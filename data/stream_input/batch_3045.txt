B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just finished the book, was shocked like everyone else, and immediately got on to see what people were saying and to be electronically with people who are grieving the end like me. I'm sad to see, though, people's automatic rejection of the ending. Yes, I'm devastated. Yes, I was definitely bawling in the coffee shop I was reading this in. But when I think about Tris Prior, the girl who will always go the full measure for others, the girl who is wise enough to see what needs to be done, strong enough to do something about it, and maybe just young enough to give her whole self for it; when you think of all that, are you really surprised by what she did and the way this series ended? I don't think I am. I think Tobias summed it up well: &#34;I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.&#34;<br /><br />Many will disagree with the thoughts I'm about to share and that's fine, but I think they still hold some credence when thinking about this book. One of the things I think I like most about YA literature is that they are able to take extremely heavy topics and creak them down to their basic elements. To me, it's always resembled the way children comprehend matters piece by piece and, therefore, simplify them to the bones of the issue (nota hard leap to make sense the books are for people in the process of leaving childhood). The special thing about this writing process, though, is that the characters themselves are not set in their beliefs like adults usually are. As much as they have their families and loved ones to care about, they still aren't tied down like adults are, who have a responsibility to stay alive for their dependents. This puts the young adults in YA novels in a unique position. One that might make many uncomfortable. The author and the genre invent these characters to live through mature, life-threatening situations, but then many don't want to follow the events they created to the natural end. They want to soften the very truths theyare trying to teach their young readers. This does an injustice to their readers and (if you want to get dramatic about it) it does an injustice to the characters themselves.<br /><br />Only in recent years, have I seen this trend starting to change. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's books like the Hunger Games, like Divergent, like John Green's books, even like in Ender's Game (an older book, but the recent re-emergence of attention to it makes it valid), that are starting to take the bold jump towards the reality of the situations they are putting their characters in. And this makes people dislike them, or wish they hadn't read the ending to them. That's a shame because they know that they're good books, but regret following them to the end just because it doesn't have a happily ever after. I know it's not my place to critize other people on their preferences, but I hope people will think twice about the purpose these books hold in the YA genre, in the growth of their young readers, and in the contemplation of their older readers. I think you'll be more likely to find something you can reconcile your heartache with, if you look down that path.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|SPOILER!!!!!!!<br />I absolutely fell in love with Divergent, couldn't put it down!! Then read Insurgent right away and loved it too. I only had to wait a couple days till the final installment Allegiant. I grew very attached to Tris, but the ending was expected. It was needed really. Not EVERY single story has a fairy tale ending and this is a prime example. The life these people had to endure.. do you really think they will live thru every single bad thing that happened to them? HELL NO. I'm not going to say I was happy with the ending, it hurt. I actually was almost shaking because they were so close to their almost happy ending. With all these people saying that it sucked and Roth should have rethought the ending is total bull. She ended it right. Tris gave her life so EVERYONE could go on living without being an experiment... whats awful about that????? It ended with the people she loved remembering her.

B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This game will literary knock you off your feet. It has a full spectrum of game play. This verys for blast a machine gun at the enemy ship to shooting zombies inside your own. The art style for this game is also truly impeccable! Many secnes make you want to be in a starship of your own. Lastly the storyline is a like a episode of stargate(also a great show), because you never know when you will be shooting aliens to destroying a space monster. I would highly recommend this game to anyone!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I admit it, when a friend told me about this series, my first reaction was, &#34;Great...just what the world needs...ANOTHER dystopian future.&#34; But I really trust Robin O'Bryant, so I bought the omnibus. It's a bargain at twice the price. Powered through the entire thing in 24 hours. And if Howey writes any sequels, I'll be on the preorder list. Howey's world building is flawless and his characterizations spot on. The mystery of the silos and the secrets some would kill to preserve are gripping and feel so very real. Claustrophobic and exciting from start to finish. Do not hesitate to make this purchase!

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|(specific to kindle fire with headphones on) the chimes for correct answers are way too loud and there's no settings to change it; if I turn the volume down so the chime is better I cannot hear the speaker.  also, since my kindle doesn't have a speaker that makes 2 major functions useless. making this app unusable for me on my kindle. I have to use headphones.  I am glad Duolingo keeps the kindle vertical and is free ...both unlike Rosetta; Rosetta has Duolingo beat in another way tho; with Rosetta, my primary language is not on screen, forcing me to focus on what I want to learn and not letting my eyes n brain go to default.  I got further in memory recall in one lesson w Rosetta.  but I still love duolingo. I use the app on other devices.<br /><br />I also use this app on my phone and I like it just fine there. I wasn't using headphones; without them thus far the correct answer chime was ok.<br /><br />This app is great for expanding vocabulary words, but does not help in actually learning to communicate thoroughly.  For that I am liking the Priemsluer series. Hopping around and using different tools keeps it interesting and it helps to see pics with words to create associations.  I definitely recommend this app.

I enjoyed the story and most of her writing style, but disliked what I consider too much \\"filler\\"  in between the narrative.<br />The book kept me interested in what was going to happen next, but the constant unneeded detail made it difficult to continue reading<br /><br />This is one of those books I really wanted to finish, as much to conclude the story, as much as to be done with the book.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I do not like the fact that the game keeps asking you to pay for more lives to continue to.play. The game was free but if you &#34; invest&#34; in more lives it could start being expensive. So I play for a while then quit when it &#34;times out&#34;. I will enjoy it for what it is...just a way to entertain myself while watching TV.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved Angels and Demons, and The DaVinci Code, this was my 3rd book from this author. I enjoyed it, especially the insight into our National Monuments in Washington DC, the Masons, and the Institute of Noetic Science. I didn't know this was a science being studied, it was lovely to learn more about it. I've always had some thoughts that perhaps human beings had untapped potential to do greater things. Very enlightening read. Thank you. (btw unrelated to this book, there's a lovely Blue Six album called &#34;Noesis&#34; - check it out).
B001R4MEUM|4.0|After hearing about this album for years, I took the plunge.  Nice, smooth sounds.  A little weirder than I thought it would be, but interesting.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|I thought it was decent, but Russell Crowe's acting in this one, is a bit... well stoic.  I think he could have done a better job, or perhaps his role could have been cast better.  Otherwise it was a lovely movie.  I want to visit that area of France someday.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|Thanks to a HIGHLIGHTED spoiler on this site, I knew how it would end. While I appreciate the story, it could have been better. The entire series went down hill somewhere in the middle of Insurgent. Putting aside an ending I didn't necessarily love, and my undying love for the author and the first book, I give this book an HONEST 3.5 stars. It in no way deserves ONE star (because I'm pissed at the ending) and it also doesn't deserve FIVE stars (in order to offset all the one stars and because Divergent was so good). The ratings of this book are a joke. Don't let them sway your or fool you either way. Reality: You need to read it and form an opinion yourself. If you've read the first and second. Give this one a chance. Even if, thanks to unnecessary and annoying spoilers, you know how it's going to end. I really think people need to let this one sink in. The ending sucks, but it wouldn't have been right any other way.

B0071MQBX0|5.0|Ramin Karimloo, SIerra Boggess, Hadley Fraser combine for a dream production of this well-loved show.  Best possible chemistry from these friends, plus amazing voices.  Needs to be seen again and again.  Buy this!
B00BSWMITK|4.0|This is the first Joe Satriani album I have listened too and as a musician myself I really appreciate Joe composing most of his songs in a verse brige chorus verse format.  Some parts of some songs can bleed together and become uninteresting to listen to BUT those are short.  He does a great job of leaving out of extra things and keeping the album straightfoward.  I think his playing is melodic and beautiful. It sounds he's playing with a wah pedal constantly depressed through the whole album and I still haven't decided if I like that or not.  He does have shred crazy snippets and I lose him but they are short and Joe jumps right back.  My favorite song was \\"A Door Into Summer.\\" The songs I didn't like were Jumping In, Jumping Out, The Weight of the World and Lies and Truths.  The rest of the album was GREAT!
B00AEFXEN6|5.0|You get to see Thora Burch's big breasts.  I think she is so cute.<br />See Ghost World if you have seen it.  Like Roger Ebert once said,&#34; you just wanna hug that movie&#34; (Ghost World).
B003Y5H542|5.0|Excellent PQ & AQ.  This movie is a treat to watch and listen too.  I recommend it heartily to children and adults alike.
B006OB3K56|5.0|She is so cute and sexy.  If you have a small dick and are ashamed of it, skip the first 10 minutes of the movie.  I can see why Michael<br />Fassbender wasn't ashamed of walking around naked at the beginning of the movie.
1451695195|5.0|For anyone who has ever wondered what a near-death experience is like. This book is vivid and imaginative. The author does an amazing job of describing his spiritual journey and how it changed him as a person. Excellent read!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is a good yarn.<br /><br />At the outset of a 12-hour driving trip for work, I downloaded Wool as my first Audible audiobook. While I was a little interested in this dystopian work of fiction, I was more intrigued to see (or hear, as the case was) how Hugh Howey's self-published work became such a phenomenon.<br /><br />I've listened to a few audiobooks before, but never one this long. There were definite (but momentary) instances where I felt like the story dragged, or certain information was repeated unnecessarily, but I'm not sure if that was the fault of the story itself or the way in which I was consuming the story.<br /><br />Sixteen hours later and multiple commutes to and from work, I finished this behemoth of a book. I enjoyed the story, and I'll see it in the theater (reports say it's Ridley Scott's next film), but I'm not sure I was entirely captivated enough to want to read the remaining two books in the series, which definitely pits me against the millions who've read the series.<br /><br />For those that have completed the series, maybe you can sway my opinion.
B000LE1GVW|3.0|I didn't mind this cd. Its got some mellow music and its not offensive...least I didn't hear anything offensive to me. His voice is different. I don't think I can think of anyone to compare him too. There's not anything on here that's going to get amazing air play on radio stations ...but I still think the cd has been worth a listen. I'm listening to it now and enjoying it.
1781162646|4.0|I'd put this in the southern gothic carnival ghost story mystery subgenre. You could leave out the ghost part and it's still a very good story. Above average for both Stephen King and Hard Case Crime. I, McFestus have spoken.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nice follow up to an excellent book. Really looking forward to the movie to see how true to the story they stick.
B008133MDK|5.0|Don't fall for substitutes.  This is the real thing.  A smart, funny series that will have you hooked in the first episode.<br />This was my first Sherlock Holmes show.  Through it I found Jeremy Brett's wonderful Sherlock Holmes series.  Both are so well done that if you are a Holmes fan I really think you will love both series.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Another phenomenal album from VW, showing a clear evolution and maturity that was inevitable and appreciated.  I love the first two albums, and this was a bit different, but definitely not a disappointment.  If you're a fan and/or enjoy well written/performed music, you'll appreciate the album, if you're a stubborn ass, you'll whine about how different it is... blah blah.  Write your own music if you want it to be exactly how you want it to sound.

B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|Notepad Pro ++ is a no-frills text editor. In its current iteration, the closest thing I'd compare it to is the Notepad on Windows systems. The UI is extremely clean - too clean in fact - with only one on-screen button (add new note). I am not sure what \\"amazing functionalities\\" the developer is referring to. There's no way to change font or text size, nor is there any way to customize the app. The notes do appear to auto-save when I press back. You long press on a note to delete it. I don't see a way to sort the notes, however. At first I thought it might be a feature in a hidden menu, but nothing happened when I triggered the menu function. And I tried it on a HTC One, HTC Rezound and Samsung S3 - all with no luck. The app did force close a few times when I pressed back on the home screen. This happened mostly on the HTC One, which is running Android 4.2.2. So in addition to missing features, it looks like the developer might have some bugs to kill in terms of compatibility with the newer Android OS.<br /><br />On the plus side, the app doesn't require any permission whatsoever. And the installed footprint comes in at around 488KB. So very lightweight and safe app.<br /><br />I don't think this app in its current state is worthy of being a paid app, even at $0.99. It doesn't even cut it as a free app, since it's missing some very basic functions and features. Most if not all smartphones have built-in notepad apps that would at least match and probably exceed the Notepad Pro ++. So there's really no point in downloading this app in its current version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. It keeps updating and is very fun to play with against friends. You should get this!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Mostly a lot of fun.  Some levels present more challenges than others but over all one of the most enjoyable games I've played.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|The title says it all. Yep that is it  no words someone please send hep for me and all other fangirls
B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|On the original movie, I give 5 stars.  For the extended version, I give 4 stars.  If you have the original, the extended doesn't offer much more worth seeing in my opinion.  The additional scenes don't add much at all and I can see why they cut them out.  Just fluff really.   The main thing I didn't care for in the movie is the Disney like scene with the Goblins in the cave.  Nothing like LOTR when the party escaped the Moria caves.
B00EV4EUT8|5.0|This is such a great movie!  It brought back so many memories - the good and the bad.  I would suggest this DVD to everyone
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyable game to pass the time. Engaged some good problem solving skills. Puzzles laid out well. I would recommend to friends.
B0094JX07I|5.0|So, I was recently (in the last 2 months) was introduced to Billy Talent... I know, I know... Anyway, INSTANT OBSESSION! I now own every album, and though I do have favorite songs on each album I really have true love for every album. I can't really choose favorites. They all have a flavor I can't live without. Trust me- Just buy it.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|The design is awesome and easy as sin to remove and reattach which makes it perfect for use with the HTC car mount. Trust me thus case is the bomb
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|My 6 year old grandson loves to beat me at this game.  The colors are bright and it is easy enough and old lady like me can figure it out.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|If you've seen the movie, then you should be able to complete that line.  If not, you are in for a seriously chilling moment that I won't go into great detail about here.<br /><br />Are you creeped out by creepy, murdering kids every time, no matter how often it's been done in movies?  Yeah, me too.  This one has that in spades.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke does fine work as a \\"true crime\\" author a few years away from his last successful book.  He moves himself, his wife, son and daughter into a home that happens to be the site of a gruesome murder that also left one child missing (there seems to be a pattern of families being murdered with one child then turning up missing).  Another reason for the move, it should be noted, is the downturn in the family's economic fortunes; they simply cannot afford to live where they had been living or sustain their previous lifestyle.<br /><br />There are echoes of \\"The Shining\\" as Hawke's character discovers some old Super-8 films in the attic, along with, how convenient, a projector and decides to play them for himself.  What he sees are a series of gruesome murders.  Rather than share them with authorities, he decides to do his own investigation.<br /><br />Things get more and more freaky and end badly.  VERY badly.  That's all I have to say about that.<br /><br />This is a don't miss, especially during the Halloween season.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|it's an Awesome product  but  it  turns off and restarts  about 7  times a day which gets very annoying  after a while.  love the clear image !
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has a plot twist and twisted characters . I couldn't look away as they related to each other and the people around them. I recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Won't work at hotels requiring wifi password.  Everything else about this device is awesome and will work with more apps soon.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Loads of action, amazing effects. incredible cast. hope that they continue with the Iron Man series. Looks great if you have a big TV with sound system.
0062103377|5.0|Just finished reading it. It's a quick read, but great! You can really feel as if Bobby is writing this book. I would highly recommend to any Supernatural Fans out there
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Happy that this is now available b or on my Kindle Fire HD.  Works well, but oh so addictive, have fun
B002GJT4XW|1.0|Maybe I will change my rating if I get the correct Item. I received the Standard DVD edition and not the Blu-Ray edition.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I'm 68 years old, forgetting everything, obese and out of shape.  I've lost and gained weight so many times I could have made three different people.  I didn't feel like doing anything, much less exercise.  My nails were non-existent, my hair limp and thinning.<br /><br />UNTIL I read this book!  In three weeks of following this new way of living (it is NOT just a diet!) I've lost 12 lbs, have happily started an exercise program, and have more energy than I've had in years!  I'm never hungry, I get to eat all kinds of meats and cheeses and veggies, and I don't even bother counting calories.  The supplements he recommends have made an almost instant difference - my nails are stronger and growing long, my skin is better, and my overall mood is vastly improved.  This will be my way of life from here on out, and I strongly recommend this book to everyone.  It was like taking blinders off, and being able to see again.  Thank you, Dr Perlmutter, for this wonderful book, and for the back up help from your website!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app and easy to use...I really like the big fonts.  It is a great addition to my kindle fire
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Kids enjoyed it: a decent movie to inspire adventure spirit. A good recommendation from both Amazon and some of my kids' friends.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a very inspiring book.  Malala is an amazing example of values, character and leadership.  I kept thinking, &#34;those who have so much usually have so little, and those who have so little usually have so much&#34;.  Malala is a perfect example of this, she's a true role model for all of us.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I did not think I would like this movie, but it was great.<br />My two grandsons (ages 7 and 9) were over and we all watched it together.<br />It is very entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very easy to read and not only was it packed with action, I was able to envision what was happening. I couldn't put it down!
006202406X|1.0|I am truly outraged.<br /><br />I have been a devoted divergent fan and even took the day off work to sit at home and read this.<br />Only to find myself crying in my bed over the ending.<br /><br />I cannot wrap my head around this. I do not understand why Veronica thought this was necessary.<br />How could she do this to the fans?<br /><br />There is no lesson here. I am taking away nothing from this book but pain.<br />I can't even begin to imagine watching the movie now, knowing how this story will end.<br /><br />Save yourself the heartbreak and hold on to the first to books. Don't let it be ruined by the third.
0099469502|5.0|Amazing piece of literature. Loved every page I had read. I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves SciFi. Thank you Carl Sagan
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|About time! I have been waiting forever for the kindle version! Highly recommend linking your Facebook if you have one!

B0085A9J18|5.0|This simple dvd movie is a great action movie. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Worth the pay and it was recieved in a timely fashion.....
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Finished the third region and am waiting for the fourth. This game is very addicting and very fun but it needs more frequent updates.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. works great. no crashes so far.  It's about time Kindle made this happen!  I'm a happy camper. Crushing candy all day!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read. Thought I had it all figured out...then I didn't! Fast read with lots of twists and turns. Would highly recommend.

B001UTW7QU|4.0|Love the characters for their idiosyncrasies and back stories.  Having five seasons to watch back-to-back is terrific!  Thank you Amazon!
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I was at this show but had terrible seats. It was so nice to see it again up close. Phenominal show!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. The two sequels, Shift and Dust, are even better, but you have to start with this one.  Make sure you pay attention to the details. I found myself going back and rereading parts of Wool that I didn't fully get until I read the second book.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Basically this book has solid ideas, but I believe it was published before it was really polished in any way. There are grammatical errors, it's too short for proper plot development, and the story is way too predictable. I don't feel emotionally attached to any character and I don't feel emotion when reading the book. Like Stephanie Meyer, the author is too afraid to actual harm any of the good guys. Though it's fantasy the world is childish with no sense of realism. The idea of \\"honor\\" seems messed up and distorted at best. The characters make choices that are idiotic and claim that they are being noble. Against my better judgement I have been reading through the series, but by book 8 I honestly don't know if I can finish. This book is nothing compared to any of the great fantasy authors. I wouldn't dream of comparing it to them and trying to group it as amazing works of literature.<br /><br />TO BE FAIR- I think the story would be good if Morgan Rice were to collaborate with another writer to get the story across, but worded better. Maybe if Rice works on improving the quality of their writing and edits a bit more before publishing.... maybe then I'd think better of it.
8866135887|5.0|I love Moleskin. This calendar is great because one week is on a two page spread. I also totally dig the extra stickers and the small separate notebook that they give you.<br /><br />Good product as usual.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game.  Reminds me of many fun hours spent with good friends.  It is exactly like playing the classic game.
0385523912|5.0|I just finished reading this book and have learned so much from the people who were featured in this book. I had a hard time putting the book down because I wanted to see what would happen next to the person whose story was being told. The book is well written and very engaging to those of us who are fascinated by NK.<br /><br />It is such a huge shame how one person so hungry for power can ruin an entire country and destroy the lives of millions of people. This book is a perfect example of why being an isolated communist country does not work (if you are not a part of the very few elite). NK seems to be perpetually stuck in the 1950's with no hope of moving forward.<br />If you want to read accounts by people who lived and escaped this horrific place and how &#34;great&#34; communism is, this book is for you!<br /><br />I wish there was some way that the people of NK could be helped and that they can see there is a huge world outside of their isolated country. At least the people in this book were able to see there is a whole different world outside and that they get to enjoy a freer way of living. I enjoyed reading how the people were amazed and overwhelmed by all the choices they now had in life once they got the hell out of NK.<br /><br />The only small nitpick I have is that the author is obsessed with mentioning how a female refugee has a cluster of zits on her chin and brings it up three different times throughout the book. I felt that this detail didn't need to be mentioned let alone three times.<br /><br />NK is run by a fat megalomaniac who was preceded by 2 other fat megalomaniacs. When will it end? :(
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great product, it keeps my phone running like new. I would recommed it to anyone that thinks their phone has gotten slower.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This is a very basic app for making lists.  There is nothing else to do with this app.  I do like the fact that it is so simple and intuitive and your lists are saved automatically.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Short but good game.  Hoping for a longer version.  Hate that they make you write a long review.  Oh well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Friends had been sending me invites via FB for months and I finally accepted and began playing a game I didn't quite understand 3 weeks ago. I was cautioned that it was addictive and I've found that to be true. But the game is masterly developed. Slowly, level by level, I figure it out and get better at each needed skill. I love having it linked with my FB account because hundreds of my friends are playing it and send me lives and extra moves. It's fun to see what friends have scored and to beat some of them. Most importantly, now that it is available here for my kindle, I can play here, on my phone, or on my computer (5 lives at EACH) and it is synced up with what level I'm on.  Warnings: Really is addictive (&quot;just one more game then I'll stop&quot;).There is in app purchasing which can give you better chances of moving up to the next level but it can add up fast; and as of the writing of this, there are 500 levels! Buyer beware!<br /><br />With that said, I'm off to try to beat level 106...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome! Love playing against my family and friends.Some levels are extremely hard so I have to get family members to help me.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This is a practical guid for people who desire to be rich. I have put a list of self development book to read and this book was in the list and it deserve it's place in the honor list. However, pre requisite to this book, one must read the science of greeting rich, the secret, and think and grow rich  then proceed to read this book.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This is a very simple notepad. To create a note, you press the button at the bottom of the app. You can add a title to your new note(which is optional but recommended to use). When you're done editing the note, you can use the back button to exit the note. As far as I can tell, you can create as many notes as you want. All of your notes can be viewed from the app's main screen, and they're sorted by date. The interface is very clear and user friendly. There's no permissions whatsoever, no ads, which is a very good thing.<br /><br />There are a few drawbacks, though. As other reviews have stated, this app is too simplistic for its title, as there really is nothing pro about this app. In its current state, it really should be free, but I'd pay $.99 for this app simply because of the lack of permissions. As a personal preference, I'd like to see the time of creation as well as the date. I do realize you can just make a note of the time in the title, but for me that's just too boring of a title.<br /><br />All in all, I give this app three stars. I'd recommend downloading it today while it's free, and if nothing else keep it on your cloud and wait to see how it's updated.<br /><br />- Sam
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Welcome to the kindle Candy Crush - been waiting for this for a long time!  Fun &amp; challenging way to spend some down time.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Great app! I like how it keeps track of how you do and gives a score for each game. I would recommend
B008Y212PI|5.0|If you like logic puzzles you will enjoy this addictive game. User friendly - no problems on my kindle. Most are not difficult; but then that's not hwhy one usually plays this game. Do wish there were hundreds more as one can go through these rather quickly.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A heart warming story of relevance victims falling in love... to me the best book ever, but then again was the last book I've read to.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|Kurt Vile's newest album is perfect. Better than the last Vile album, and that was excellent. I'm having a hard time listening to anything else right now.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|One of the best game on app store  but it takes a while to update you can fight kingdoms it is  is awesome
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|New favorite 3D movie. Better than our previous fave &#34;Avatar&#34;. Guillermo del Toro has a wild imagination and truly brings it to the big screen.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game reminds me of WoW. For a mmorpg on Kindle Fire HD, I really haven't any complaints. Just don't go into this game expecting anything ground breaking. All in all I'm enjoying this game for what it is and not hating for what it isn't.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is such an awesome series I keep starting over reading them and can't wait for the next book in the series.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Best game in touchscreen history it is so fun if you are reading this I am telling you you have to get this game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a fantastic story. I love the contrast between the two main characters<br /> So far apart in age but so close in experiences. I was captivated from the beginning. Excellent read.
0521173787|5.0|Really good!!! It is similar to the real exam! You can train yourself and see your grade of preparation! Completed and with solutions and reviews in the end of the book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been trying for weeks to download this on my kindle using facebook so I can play with friends, Now I can and I like playing it there instead of having to go to the computer all of the tim e
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love to play My Horse but....I´be had few problems with it. Mainly accessing friends etc. I reloaded it and it's working OK for now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy it's finally on my Kindle!!! My only negative comment is.... I am losing sleep over the addiction of this game!!!! Lol... Enjoy!!
B008XTVWHK|2.0|Co-producer Ray Harryhausen's revival of an unrealized Willis O'Brien project misses the mark. \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" (1969) resembles a \\"King Kong\\" rehash in the Wild West - little helped by clumsy scripting and dull characters. A fiery climax arrives too late to save the day. Harryhausen's impressive Dynamation wizardry survives intact.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I have Captain America, Hulk and Iron Man and enjoyed them all.  Just have to watch Thor and anticipate the sequel.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Like many others, I've been (im)patiently waiting for Allegiant's release all year.  I loved Divergent.  I liked Insurgent.  (Similar to my feelings on The Hunger Games Trilogy).  I was so hopeful Roth would succeed where Collins did not (for me) and make me fall back in love with the series during the final installment.<br /><br />Epic fail!<br /><br />I ordered the book on my Kindle and eagerly opened it up yesterday morning on the way to work.  I didn't get too far, but I was definitely anxious to dive back in as soon as possible.  However, curiosity got the best of me and I checked out the first ratings on Amazon.  Seeing all the one stars popping up was a huge red flag.  I paged through the reviews, spoilers and all, and I was SHOCKED to read about the ending.  Of course I opened my Kindle and read it for myself just to make sure.<br /><br />Honestly - I promptly returned the book.  I realize there is some disagreement over panning a book just bc you don't like the ending - but the ending of a book, especially a series/trilogy, is a huge component.  It provides closure to the reader who invested time and emotion into the characters.  While I agree that this is Roth's story and her characters - by publishing the books and selling them, I believe an author forms a relationship with the reader and owes something to her audience.  S/he needs to take their feelings into some consideration, in my opinion.  This ending felt like a complete slap in the face!<br /><br />I clearly can't comment in-depth on the plot, characters, and action as I only read the beginning.  What I read at first, I liked.  But the ending simply ruined the series for me.  I would be really hesitant to purchase another series by her which is sad because the series started out completely awesome.  I told everyone about it!
B008JFUO72|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. rocks this role.  It's going to be tough to top this.  He's come a lomg way since the 80s.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Oh yes he did...<br /><br />Pa Pa Peachy himself, Baba Booey, told me to get this on vinyl, and let me tell you...he's right!  This is a GREAT album that rocks.  There's no surf guitar, though, but I can deal with it.  Do as Baba Booey says, and get this on Vinyl!!!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I've used this app for some time, and was pleased with it. However, after the last update, I dont care for it as much. The at-a-glance screen design used previously was much better, and told pertinent information more clearly. I dont like I the graphs and such on this interface. Also, on my first generation Kindle Fire, some of the graphs are off screen and to the right. The menus are not as intuitive, etc...<br />The app is professionally done, but the update was misguided. I wonder if the app interface was made to look more like iOS7 and a &#34;flat design&#34; look. In any event, the old interface was better.
B00AYB12PC|5.0|Scream still holds up well as an awesome slasher movie, suspense thriller, whodunnit and a good time in general. This is the movie Wes Craven waited all his life to make, and all the classic elements of his best films to date are in this flick---the violence, the suspense, the great characters, cool story, and really good acting. Of course, Craven is interpreting Kevin Williamson's inspired screenplay, so can't forget his invaluable contribution. Expertly crafted, SCREAM is about as good as it gets for modern slash movies, and not only did it resurrect the slasher genre from a slump, it also helped usher in the current horror rage... going 17 years strong now! Neve Campbell is awesome and believable in the lead role, Drew Barrymore is splendid in her 'Janet Leigh' bit, and gotta say the bag guys are as crazy as Krug and Company from Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT '72 at the end. The movie holds up solid today, and I watch it over and over, many times over each year...Definitely among my favorite slasher movies of all time, and THE favorite of the newer batch made after the the 80's.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I cannot begin to express how long overdue this is. It is so killer to have an official live DVD and album that include the rare stuff that rarely if ever gets played live. 'Good Morning Freedom' is an old b-side but to many it is a new song. There are not many bands out today that could write a crafted rock song like GMF and to think these guys were in their late teens. The tracklist is fantastic. The band sounds great, just a great compilation. Hats off to Viv Campbell too. The guy was just diagnosed with cancer when rehearsal started for this residency. What a trooper and he sounds great!<br /><br />Any band that intend to release a live album in the future should contact Joe Elliott. The sound is great; I have never been a big live album fan because usually you get a bunch of tracks that may have been performed live but basically became studio tracks with crowd noise added by the time it was produced. This is the real deal. I read on a message board where someone stated this and recommended watching/listening to the new Metallica release then listen to this new Leppard release. I did and they are right. Metallica polished and fixed alot of the tracks. I like the raw sound from Def Leppard and dare I say this has a punk rock vibe to it. It really does. Stand up job from a standup bunch of guys and one of the all-time great rock bands.<br /><br />Def Leppard in the RnR Hall of Fame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is a total joke that these guys are not in there; I doubt they care but they deserve it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am so addicted to this game, I just wish that at the end  of  each level, the special candies are used up. I used moves to create those candies, with the  intent of benefiting from that investment. If my unused candies are used at the end, I may be able to pass the level If  I haven't reached the objectives..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome Amazon finally got this app. You guys are great I am enjoying my kindle more cause I can spend hours playing this game....all I can say is you guys did great getting this app
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Once I started I was mesmerized.  The book is a cruel but beautiful love story told by an unexpected stranger.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|AWESOME MEGA FUN!!! Can't stop playing! Hope the levels never end!  Sweet and tasty! Hope they make add-ons so the fun never ends.

0061726834|5.0|The dystopian novel written by Lauren Oliver, Delirium, is a book like no other. Its exhilarating combination of suspense, romance, and adventure gives the book a unique flare. The novel is geared more towards the young adult audience, as it is filled with a great amount of thrill and little certainty, but can reach almost any reader thirteen and over. Delirium is one of the many novels that try to reach their audience in various ways and actually achieves it.<br />  While some may argue that Delirium does not reveal enough details about the world Lena lives in, the development of each character is more profound than most dystopian novels. The depth found in each character is favored over the details of the world around them. Each character is written with insight. The way a character feels toward the society around him or her lets readers mentally construct the world without it directly being stated. One can also vividly see and hear the characters in Delirium. The depth each character contains brings them to life, making it impossible to differentiate between the fantasy world and what is real.<br />  The protagonist in Delirium, Lena Haloway, lives within a strict and unemotional world where love is declared a deadly disease. Once teenagers reach eighteen, they are required by law to go through an impacting procedure, which removes a specific part of the brain. The procedure was invented to cure humans from love, or as it is referred to in Lena's society, amor deliria nervosa. Not only the romantic type of love but love found in any part of life. Love felt towards friends, family, animals, music, and anything that includes passion and/ or affection. Once the procedure is over, the ability to partake in any deep feelings comes to an end. Removing love from life is difficult for the human mind to fully absorb. Existence without love is so hard to envision that readers feel the constant need to continue flipping through the pages of Delirium, just to get the notionof what life without love could be.<br />  After the procedure, people are then matched with the opposite sex only to reproduce and live an emotionless marriage. These people merely exist. Before the procedure, opposite sexes are segregated and are constantly being watched. Lena being one of them lives the first seventeen years of her life this way, obeying and believing society's viewpoints. It is not until she meets a boy named Alex and both fall deeply in love with one another, that she realizes her entire life has been nothing but a pure lie. Lena's mentality is completely altered and the easy life she once lived drastically changes.<br />  Lauren Oliver's lyrical writing style possesses a certain rhythm, as the words seem to flow throughout the novel. Each chapter contains descriptive language, which lets readers into the mind and thoughts of Lena, rather than giving her perspective as a vague overview. Lena, along with the rest of the characters is presented with such description, that readers become attached to each individual character. The readers literally feel the pain, panic and joy that the characters experience throughout countless situations that occur throughout the novel. Delirium sparks every single human emotion in distinctive ways, leaving the reader breathless and on the edge.<br />  From the first to the last words, Delirium captivates the reader's attention. Each chapter builds suspense for the chapter that follows it, leaving the mind wondering at all times. Not only does the novel contain an interesting plot but also, imprints on the reader's heart and soul. The mind is constantly provoked, leading the reader to become part of the story.<br />  Readers not only feel connected but also learn from the novel as well. Various lessons are elucidated throughout Delirium, such as learning to have passion in everything one does in life because time can never be reversed. The novel also portrays the fact that the most difficult things in life are usually the most rewarding. As pages turn, the reader advances and grows as a person. Once Delirium is completed, it is hard to view life from the same perspective as when it was first opened. Delirium is one of the few novels that expand the mind, while keeping the reader intrigued at all times.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game. It's very addictive. My complaint is that once I reach a new level I always have to get on line (King Games) &amp; request that my app be updated in order to play the next level on my phone. Then I have wait &amp; wait for that to be done. I've waited up to three weeks before. Not very efficient! That's why I only give it 4 stars...
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I know everyone is harping on the ending, but that isn't even the problem in this novel.  I don't expect much YA novels to be Hemingway, or Rowling even, but reading Roth's monotonous and continuously stilted, short sentences for the duration of this story made me long for some artistic flare.  A bit of purple prose, even.<br /><br />My main problem is that Roth, for having decided to alternate POVs to both Tris and Tobias, has created no discernible tonal differences between the two.  Neither develop a distinct personality and that leads to a boring read.  If each chapter title did not state whether it was in Tris or Tobias' view, then I would not have been able to tell who was the narrator, aside from situationally figuring it out.  Both viewpoints really do read that similarly.<br /><br />Again, the very minimal diction (not to be confused with the bare style of The Road, an artistic masterpiece in simplicity) also leads to little passion.  For all the kissing that Tobias and Tris do (a lot), there's little romance and tension.  Unfortunately, this style also renders the rest of the novel, including all those action scenes, as repetitive and somewhat boring.<br /><br />Finally, about that ending.  I give a lot of leeway to authors.  They can do whatever they want, even if it devastates me, as long as it serves a purpose.  In this case, I don't see how the ending served the story for the better except for \\"shock-value,\\" mainly because the end is filled with too many plot holes. Plus, by the time I even reached the end, I was already bored to apathy.<br /><br />And just to be clear, my low-ish rating of this novel was not affected by the ending.  I found the rest of the novel to be far more problematic.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This Swedish vampire drama (I do not consider it a horror film) is an absolute MASTERPIECE! Below more of my impressions, with very limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Oskar is a gentle (in fact maybe a little too gentle) 12-year old boy living with his divorced mother in Stockholm suburbs. Bullied at school and a loner by nature, he likes to stay late outside - alone, if he can help it. One evening he meets there Eli, who appears to be a girl roughly the same age as he. Eli is very pale, very calm and a little bit odd - but from the beginning \\"she\\" seems to like Oskar. A lot. This is the beginning of this amazing film, and of the rest I will say no more.<br /><br />This is a slow moving film, ultimately without much action - but I guarantee that you will not feel the 114 minutes of this movie! At the end, far from being bored, I really regretted that there is not more of it...<br /><br />This also is a somehow disturbing film, which was even censored by removing some scenes to be allowed for TV distribution in USA. It was adapted from a 2004 novel, which is much more disturbing - in fact it is absolutely abject - so even the Swedish producers changed the story a lot, to be even allowed to distribute this film in the theaters. But even with changes it is a film only for those 18 or above!<br /><br />This film respects most of vampiric cannon (do not expect vampires walking under the sun here, etc.) although not necessarily all of it - the question of crosses and holy water is carefully avoided...<br /><br />This film is so good, that even its American remake \\"Let me in\\" was very honest, even if of course it couldn't beat the original.<br /><br />I will stop here to avoid any temptation of giving more spoilers. I absolutely ADORED this extremely dark and ambiguous tale and I recommend it with enthusiasm! Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Time passer, just love it, only just got today and on level 13, hope I don't go to crazy playing this game, right now going crazy because I'm not playing this game, waiting for more life's, so I can continue to play this game, so tell me am I already crazy about this game, I think so. Buy this game you will love it as so many others do already. Trust me on this I'm already overboard over this game, it's kind of nice playing against my Facebook friend's scores, it's kind of cool. All my friends told me how good this game was, now that I have played, I can see for myself they are correct.

B00BKZUVGM|2.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent.  The world they contain is compelling as are the characters.  I especially enjoyed the development of the characters Tris and Four.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Therefore, to have Tris die at the end of this book was hugely disappointing.  Yes, I realize she died for a good cause and that a happy ending could be considered unrealistic, however this type of story is NOT realistic in the first place and I think the same surprise factor could have been simply achieved by the revelations about the outside world, rather than Veronica Roth trying to shock the readers by killing off her main character.  It has spoiled my enjoyment of the first two, which I reread prior to the release of Allegiant, and I don't think I'll reread the series again (which I would have done, had the ending been different).
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Baldacci created new characters that will draw you into a world of politics, protection, murder and plot twists that are guranteed to keep you guessing and reading on. Just because one murder is years old and a kidnapping is very recent doesn't mean they're not connected. These seemingly unconnected events brought the two former secret service agents together and Baldacci weaves a tale that winds through both cases and forges a cooperative effort between Sean King and Michelle Maxwell that results not only in solutioins to the two cases, but in their joining forces into a new PI partnership promising more books featuring these two characters will be forthcoming (actually at this writing, there are already several more available, and I plan on reading them all!).
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Reminded me of the demo version of a video game. A glob of disjointed scenes of recycled transformers and the standard 'I am great so I can be an ass' hero with, of course, a 'chip on his shoulder' nemesis. Have not seen that before! Also felt like the dialog was rushed to hit all the same old tired, worn out, plot points. Really, I defy finding a new one here. Certainly the petty; say you're sorry for being rude to my girl or I'll beat you up, all the while the worlds destruction is waiting for you to get around to stopping it...has been done a few times. Oh, lets also not forget all the P.C. crap we now have to endure in almost every movie these days.

0525478817|5.0|TFIOS is a must read for anyone young or old. After a few of my best friends told me about the book and author John Green, I decided to buy a book to see what the hype was all about. Not only have I read TFIOS, but I have also bought three other John Green books because I LOVE his style of writing. I cried, laughed, and had every other emotion under the sky while reading TFIOS. This is in my top three favorite books of all time and I can't wait to see the TFIOS movie! Aloha from Hawaii!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found  the theme of this book to be quite controversial.  It was interesting reading and drew my attention to the facts of life  and death.  It is a subject most people rarely think about. The characters  and relationships described were those of people we all know.  It was fascinating reading and  I couldn't put the book down. I believe the ending was a surprise to most people.  Much food for thought. A must read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game. I hVe it on my phone and just installed it on my kindle fire. I am a little disappointed because I thought my kindle fire would catch up to where I am with the game on my phone. But now I undwrstand I have to join face book before that can happen and I don't want Facebook.
B000V4NX04|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" is one of a few films I have bothered to see more than once. Yes, it's that good. The storyline itself is rather straightforward (although it is developed with a great deal of complexity and suspense). It takes place in East Germany during the latter years of the Cold War. Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is an author who lives with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), in a small apartment. Although not sympathetic to the regime, they must carefully watch the way they act and what they say so as not to arouse suspicion. Nevertheless, they are assigned a Stasi agent, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich M&uuml;he). While they are gone their apartment is bugged and Wiesler takes up residence in a vacant flat nearby. At first he is enthusiastic for his work. However, over time, as he compares his life to that of Georg and Christa-Maria, he becomes convinced of their moral superiority. Because he has access to their conversations, he knows that Georg is writing a book that exposes many of the abuses of the regime, a book that he intends to sneak out of the country. Rather than reporting these conversations, Wiesler covers for Georg in his daily reports of his activities.<br /><br />What makes this film so compelling is not just the gripping storyline (only part of which I've revealed), but the acting as well. M&uuml;he in particular does an incredible job of portraying Wiesler.<br /><br />And, of course, for anyone who lived during a significant part of the Cold War (as I did) and saw the Berlin Wall torn down (which takes place near the end of the movie, at which time Wiesler has already been demoted to working in the mailroom), this is an incredibly realistic look into the way life was behind the Iron Curtain. But this movie also has a message for those too young to remember those days: When the civil government tries to run all aspects of our lives it can succeed only through intruding into the private life of its citizens. In such a regime, the lives of others are no longer private.e lives of others are no longer private.

B0084B5TK8|3.0|I originally read Dracula in high school. And of course have seen many of the &#34;Dracula&#34; movies. So many that I had actually forgotten how it ends. I enjoyed rereading it for my book club. I studied Victorian History in university and this book is a great example of Victorian literature. Wordy, yes. Portraying women as either wantons or saints, yes. Moralistic, very. But I personally enjoyed it as a period piece and an appropriate read for Halloween.

006202406X|1.0|Veronica Roth started out with a fantastic story with her debut novel \\"Divergent.\\" Unfortunately, it didn't end very well. While the fangirl/shipper in me hated that Tris died, I can overlook that and accept it. What I can't see past is the fact that after she dies, the novel just falls flat. We see Tobias' reaction and how he is feeling, but it is so rushed. Something like that, the death of a loved one, should not be something that we see described in 25-35 pages or less. It should be something that is fleshed out entirely and deeply. And yet it wasn't.<br /><br />Even before Tris' death, the novel is muddy and unclear about things. First off, I must agree with everyone that the voices of Tris and Tobias were almost 100% the same. In \\"Divergent\\" and \\"Insurgent\\", you get the idea that the two of them are 1/2 of a whole, yes, but that they are like Yin and Yang. So different, yet they compliment each other perfectly. In \\"Allegiant,\\" something has changed with Roth's writing. She didn't seem as dedicated to telling the same story 2 different ways, as a writer should when dealing with different perspectives.<br /><br />The plot also threw me for a loop. Why the build up about factions and factionless only to end it so sloppily? And in 2 chapters, nonetheless. Not one character stayed true to who they were, or who Roth built them up to be. Tris, who in \\"Insurgent\\" came to a huge understanding in the fact that she wanted to live, gives up her life without a second thought for the brother who betrayed her several times throughout the trilogy. Tobias, who has always been seen as a hard, brave, methodical young man, turns into, for lack of a better word, pansy. It's almost as if someone were to look at him the wrong way he would break down in tears. Evelyn, who we all came to know as a hard, \\"I'm all about the cause\\" and \\"Factions are wrong!\\" woman decides in MERE PARAGRAPHS to give it all up for the son that she hardly even knows anymore. Peter, the pain-in-the-ass, \\"I'll kill anyone if they look at me sideways\\" transfer decides he doesn't want to be that way anymore and takes memory serum to forget who he is. The only one who seems to stay the same is Marcus, who, even at the very end, is fighting for power and control over people. I'm all for character development, really, I am. But there is a difference between having someone decide that \\"Oh, this person I thought was horrible two books ago really isn't that bad\\" and having the fundamental parts of a person's character change so drastically over such a short period of time.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the book. I felt almost as if Roth lost her desire for the story. It was as if she wanted it over with as fast as possible and was willing to overlook anything to make it happen. It was rushed, the plot was a mess, and she didn't connect or explain anything as well as she should have. Not to mention the complete lack of closure. And yes, while I am sad Tris died, and while I do agree with everyone saying that the ending probably should have played out differently, I can somewhat understand why Roth took that route. However, this was a novel. This was not real life. Too many people in her books died as it is. Would it really have been so bad to have given her main character a decent ending?kill anyone if they look at me sideways\\" transfer decides he doesn't want to be that way anymore and takes memory serum to forget who he is.

B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest but the app for the Kindle Fire is awful. About once a month I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. It glitches sometimes in normal use but when it starts freezing every time I open the app I know its time to reinstall. I don't have any of these problems on my droid phone and this is the only app with problems on the kindle. I like the way it works when its working but that's far too infrequent.

B004KA9UXO|5.0|I've read Dune four times now throughout my life, from a teenager, early twenties, and now (cough), pushing 40.<br /><br />Each time, the sand reveals knew insights and enjoyment.<br /><br />This is probably my favourite book of all time.  I'd say everyone should read it at least once.  The imagination, philosophy, story, characters, and world-building are simply at an astounding level.  Must be read and experienced--no description captures the wonder of this novel.<br /><br />Quibbles?  It's dense, there's very little air; it takes itself very seriously, as it should, but a little more humour could probably make it an easier read--not sure if that would ruin it though.  Honestly, the sequel is better written, but this is the book that establishes the Dune world.  Also, sometimes you just want to strangle all the characters and just say, \\"Why don't you simply stop scheming and lying and backstabbing and tricking, go have a spice cocktail and relax a little?\\"<br /><br />9.5/10.

1451626096|2.0|Of course, it's not Philippa Gregory's fault that the English royalty were without ethics or moral character, but to read about them murdering each other in gruesome ways for their brief time on the throne is the height of a downer.<br /><br />I would appreciate her efforts to toss us some historical facts and descriptive detail, but it wasn't enough nor was it presented in an interesting format.  I felt like I was reading the diary of a modern depressed wife.  Gregory writes in a carefree modern tone that takes away from the class, beauty, architecture and landscape of the era.<br /><br />Most of the characters were undeveloped.  A week effort to duplicate the Kingmaker's Daughter.

0545586178|5.0|Hunger Games is a fascinating story about a post-war society in which the known world is divided into 12 districts. Service and manufacturing labor is divided among these districts solely for the benefit of the Capitol, the governing body of the districts, who enjoy a leisure yet empty lifestyle. Control by the Capitol is based on the enforcement of harsh and arbitrary laws that engender fear and distrust among the people. Children between the ages of 12-16 are required each year to engage in a lottery drawing that requires a boy and a girl from each district to participate in a fight to the death where only one child survives. These are the hunger games. The &#34;games&#34; are televised as an annual media event that elicit a frenzy of entertainment, betting, and even sponsorship of favored participants. Starvation drives some children to enter their names multiple times in order to quality for a meager ration of food, increasing their chances of being picked for the games. The story follows two characters, Katniss, a virl who has developed skills of survival in order to feed her family, but along the way has been toughened by the rigors of staying alive, and Peeta, a baker's son whose family enjoys the privilege of having enough to eat. The two become participants in the games and form an alliance as unrequited lovers in order to stay alive. They capture the imagination of the viewers. Feigning a willingness to commit mutual suicide rather than kill each other, both survive the games. However, the ruse goes horribly wrong. The opening of Catching Fire finds Katniss being confronted by the president of the Capitol who discloses that he is not convinced by the unrequited lovers angle and he threatens her with harm to her loved ones if she fails to be more convincing. Katniss only wants to return to the life she had before the games. But slowly she realizes that the rest of her life will be in support of the fiction created by the ruse she developed and year after year she will hand over children such as herself and Peeta to the games to be chewed up in the machine created by the Capitol. She will live under constant surveillance and fear until she succumbs to bitterness and alcoholism like her mentor, Haywitch. By a turn of events, she realizes that the worst will be done to her loved ones anyway, and so she becomes at first an unwilling participant in the burgeoning rebellion of the districts. Ultimately, she becomes the very symbol of the struggle. Humans are capable of adapting to the most incredible strains of deprivation as long as their basic needs are met and they can convince themselves that continued survival under those conditions make sense. But when they realize that even continued complacency becomes just as costly as struggle and their lot will continue to deteriorate, revolution becomes their only option. Unremitting hunger and want; government-mandated sacrifice of one's children; government-sanctioned public beatings against those whose only crime is seeking food becomes the basis for the stand. This is a story of war between good and evil, but also a story of enduring love and hope, the requsites for the survival of the human race. We are not only reminded of the clear lines between good and evil, but how war, no matter how just, or what side we choose, piece-by-piece strips away at the human soul and damages the spirit. That is the true cost of war as embodied in Katniss and Gale, her lifelong friend. Peeta embodies hope and the promise of posterity. Together he and Katniss meet a future they have helped win for their children. I loved this book and the way Suzanne Collins brings her characters alive. I recommend it to anyone who is ready to be reminded of why we love, why we struggle, and on what terms we are here.ar she will hand over children such as herself and Peeta to the games to be chewed up in the machine created by the Capitol.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Ok, the game is fun but so are a lot of other games.  You almost have to spend money on this one. Buy powerups or get stuck. Pay for boosts or be unable to gain a competitive score. Then, at level 34, and the levels play fast, you get locked out until you start paying a buck a level. Yes, you can ask FB friends for more levels but when they send them, the game does not recognize them. Playing this is like going to a casino and gambling when you know that even if you win, you win absolutely nothing. Pass.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am one of those people that can sleep through ANYTHING!! If I wake up to this with the first few beeps you have no worries if you sleep like a rock like I do. It is very simple easy to use and unique to your personality. Most definitely worth the .99 cents.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|taut drama.  Similar plot and atmosphere to AMC's The Killing  But WAY better.  The detectives aren't idiots and the story arc has a beginning , middle, and end.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I absolutely love it. It's simple & easy to use. Recommend for everyone! Makes using my kindle even more awesome!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Bubble Blaze is a cute and fast pace game! You can play it at your own pace! So far the graphics are great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It's a very good time killer, the levels are just challenging enough to keep me interested in it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The book started slowly but came together soon enough.  As you read on it comes together in convoluted but<br />Bitty
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is amazing and makes it so much easier to use... I highly recommend this especially if you want to read in comfort without having to hold it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable.  Challenging, but not impossible.  The last one took me several days to solve.  I look forward to new rooms.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Angry birds is An amazing game overall  but when they added star wars I was in nerd heaven LOVE star wars and when they added it to this amazing game I was amazed and exited
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is so much fun. I love to keep up with my friends on facebook. It is very challanging to advance without buying boosters.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I thought this book was beautiful and brilliant. I know many people won't agree with me, and I don't really care. Well done, Veronica.
006202406X|5.0|I personally loved this book but that seems to be not what most people think. Yes, I get it the end frustrates you but what about the rest. The action, romance and mystery that propelled you to finish the book. The book came out yesterday, the reviewers must have liked the book enough to finish it in two days otherwise you would have not wanted to read it and finishing it would take forever. Some have explained why they don't like the book as a whole but others are saying they loved it except for the end and giving it a one star.... just stop.
1600597963|5.0|Ms. Eakin has out done herself.  Her imagination is through the roof.  It gives me lots of ideas in working with this concept.
B00009R6H2|5.0|just what I needed for two camera's, I have know regards buying this product again. I hope this helps. Thanks for  a great product.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Loved it! I'd recommend this to any fan of fantasy, though I would not have minded if it was longer.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent!<br /><br />It had been so long since I read the Shining, it all came back to me as I read this, one of his best that I have read in the past 5 years!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Blu-ray, DVD and digital download, all in one neat little package.<br /><br />My collection of Marvel comic movies is growing quickly and this has all the bases covered for awhile ...or until they find whatever the thing AFTER Blu-ray will be.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best most addicting game of all time.  Its a good pass time at the beginning. Farther into it you just check it. The only bad part (for me at least) is how it crashed 3 times.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I liked the book. It is well written and the character relationships are well developed and fun for the reader.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I'm very much a list person and this app allows me to have my listed with me at all time and not forget them at home when I need them most. Very useful!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Although I read the Shining many many years ago, I didn't feel I needed a refresher....Maybe I was afraid.  This was a perfect sequel and stands on its own as a wonderfully scary novel!  Thank you Mr. KING!
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app is very helpful for android phones. It lets you close programs, instead of restarting you phone, and withoud going through a long menu process for &#34;force stop&#34; apps. It also lets you shuts down programs to save bettery life. Very useful!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. With all the updates it makes it worth playing. Wish it were easier to get coins though.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|The movie was very interesting and action packed.  Loved the ending after the credits.  Must see if you missed it.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|I really enjoy the game, it's cute, with a fun storyline and while easy to play it can prove challenging to beat each level with 3 stars. my only complaint is that everytime I get to the last 2 levels of the 5th chapter is starts to freeze between areas or, like on the last one, completely kicks me out of the game. ive deleted and reinstalled it 3 times and have never been able to play that last level.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So happy that it's finally on Kindle Fire. I was hoping it would.  The only downside of the game is you need friends to play and then you have to wait on them until you can continue.
014241543X|5.0|I love this book and its sequel. It gives a different perspective than the usual sappy love story. This is a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game is actually candy star. Different game than candy crush saga. I'm just glad it was a free app. It's alright for a game, I was just hoping that it was the actual Facebook game.
0142420891|5.0|This was a great book along with the sequal. It made me sad and happy throughout the story, and gave a different perspective.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm glad this game is finally on kindle! My child has been asking for it for forever. I would of gave it 5 stars but I have a couple gripes about this game. First off my Facebook friends have sent me extra moves and for some reason I can't use them. The say I have to buy them but I should be able to collect the ones my friends sent me instead of buying them. Second I'm not sure how Facebook has it but on here you need 3 friends to send you tickets to get to the next episode or you end up having to pay $1 to get to play more games. I started playing on Facebook and I didn't have to pay anything to get to level 38 but then I down load it on here and end up having to pay to get to the next episode that is in the 40`s level which I did and then I got to play 10 or so more games, not many, and now you want me to pay another $1 to get to more or sit and wait and hope 3 friends will send me tickets. I don't care for having to pay money for more levels every 10-20 games. It's going to get expensive. I get paying for special things or more lives if you can't wait the 30 minutes but to have to keep paying a $1 over and over to play is a bit much. If that was different this game would have 5 stars but I'm sure there are plenty of people like me that don't want to pay constantly to play a game. Hope they might do something about this with a game update and then I'll change my review but I'm not sure if they will. So just a warning this game might get expensive in the long run and if your kids are playing it make sure they know not to buy anything with out your permission or set parent controls.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love this show, and this season was one of the best so far. I was extremely satisfied and can't wait for the next season.
B001DZLAWI|4.0|Good return to form for the metal gods. It seems to have been their last decent gasp, though, judging by Lulu. Maybe they have another good one left in them, check back in another decade.<br /><br />Also, get the vinyl or \\"acquire\\" the Guitar Hero III version if you want a good listening experience. The CD mastering is as bad as everyone says it is.
0061174793|4.0|We are fans of the mouse books and these board book versions are perfect for our little one! Sturdy and they'll las him quite some time.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|I have been a sci fi fan for a lot longer than I'd like to admit. Imaginative, highly speculative fiction is the thing I love more than anything except my kids and grandson (yep, THAT long!). I was soooo excited to see this, since it's in the sci fi fan by-laws that you must love Blade Runner and by extension, Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Sorry, y'all....... this movie is not worth making popcorn to go with it, even if you got the film for free. Maybe not even if someone paid YOU to watch it. I'm usually so thrilled to see even a decent SF movie that I will happily give a couple of mulligans, especially if the acting is great or the concept is unusual. All I can say is that the wonderful actors gave it their best, but nothing could save this sham of a script. Arthur J. Bullock, Jr. wrote a comprehensive and cogent review, hitting all the worst points in the film in an extremely entertaining multiple choice format (heehee)  Look for it, it's great! Wish he could have consulted on the script, because it's basically one large plot hole. Some reviewers have said that the prequel's sequels (?) should fill those in, but they can't undo the absolute zero-IQ of the characters. These people are scientists, making decisions that would have a flatworm scratching its 'head'. Unbelievable!<br /><br />I rarely write negative reviews, but for this one... well, the talented and mostly wonderful Mr. Scott has done so many amazing pieces of television and film that I just had to voice my deep disappointment, and hope that I can save some of our more intelligent and discerning viewers the waste of a perfectly good two hours. Unless you just want to watch an exceptional cast.  And some very cool effects.<br /><br />Also, my deep condolences to Mr. Scott for his terrible loss.
B0064MT1FI|5.0|Very unique movie.  It is dark yet sexy.  Holly Hunter is a great actress, I highly reccomennd to anyone that likes a dark movvie that is different from most.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think it ended perfectly, save for one death that I think was unnecessary to the story and just seemed cruel to all parties involved.
B004GYY714|4.0|so for, so good. The songs are to my like-ing. I look forward to listening to more songs and talk programs. The x-mas song will be right on time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders game is a wonderful book of wit intrigue and heart. Card has done a great job of making you love ender and how he is feeling every moment. This book was actually written second to Cards Speaker for the Dead so that you love Ender even more. And he does a magnificent job of it. It's a must read.
B009FB3XTA|3.0|Most of the songs on the CD are just okay. One is really good -- &#34;A Thousand Years.&#34; I probably should have just bought the song instead of the entire CD.
006202406X|1.0|Veronica Roth's Allegiant the final book in this award winning series is quite frankly the biggest let down that I have ever read and I can't even fathom going to see the movie based on it's series. I think that if I did I would burst into tears!! We have so much darkness around us in our everyday lives so much that it eclipses the sun and that is why we lose ourselves in the characters of our favorite books...I shudder to think what the aftermath will be when the final installment of the Mortal Instruments Series is released next spring...
B00003CX5P|5.0|We like this movie as a prequel of the Star Wars saga my husband and I grew up with .
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I have to say, this was not my favorite of the series, and not just because of the ending! It took me longer to get into the book than with the others, and it just didn't grab me quite the same way. I don't know if it was the switching of povs (although I did like hearing Tobias's thoughts throughout) or if it was just that this one seemed more confusing to me. Either way, by about halfway through I was sucked in and I couldn't put it down. Except for the last few chapters. They were so intense I did have to put it down a few times. Roth did a great job of making it believable and I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried and cried through the last few chapters. I'm not going to spoil it, but the ending was very different than I had imagined, but probably the most &#34;true-to-life&#34; the ending could have been and I'm not yet sure how I feel about that. It was one of those books that I think I'll need to process for a while before I can fully form an opinion on my feelings. I will also admit that this was a book that definitely gave me &#34;book hangover.&#34; I've been waiting for it for so long, and I finished it in a day, and now I don't know what to do with myself.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This is such an amazing album!! Ariana Grande is definitely one of the best recording artists around right now. She is definitely a rising star and I can't wait to see how far she goes. I definitely recommend buying this album!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its about time! I love this game. I am super addicted and glad I can finally play on my kindle. Now they just need to add other King games like Pet rescue saga. its too bad this review requires a 20 word minimum. Still love the game. Must download now!!!!!
B00AJCTY8S|5.0|Kodaline is amazing.  I first experience their music (along with several million others) watching their very cool artistic music videos on YouTube for \\"All I Want\\" and \\"High Hopes\\"  I expected that these songs would have been the best of what Kodaline had to offer, and like many bands would release an album full of lack luster songs to follow their huge singles.  Instead Kodaline released In A Perfect World which has nothing but track after track of amazing songs.  I have listened to the CD about 20 times start to finish and it has yet to get old.  More importantly, the CD really can be listened to continuously because there is no inconsistency with quality in the songs.  The mood changes are subtle between each songs so you feel no sudden burst of a loud obnoxious song or bored to tears by another.  The CD as a whole is a next level sensory experience like I have never had with another album or band.  I might dare to say, Death Cab For Cutie's \\"Plans\\" is about as close of a comparison as I can put to it as far as the fluid experience you have listing to the album in it's entirety.<br /><br />Some highlight tracks are as follows: Track 1 - Track 11.  All awesome.  I hate none of them!  I skip none of them when I listen to the album.  Each track is as good as the last one.  Kodaline has really done something unique here, and I have yet to hear anything they have played that wasn't truly well done.  Even their other EP's are solid.<br /><br />And my two cents on band comparisons for those wondering what type of amazing music they produce.  I sense a lot of Coldplay (which is who I hear most people say they sound like) but I would add in the mix some Civil Twilight, a dash of Death Cab For Cutie and the parts of Mumford and Son that we don't hate.  If any of these bands tickle your fancy, then get some Kodaline in your collection and enjoy the ear candy.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I was led to Rodriguez when I rented the movie Searching for Sugar Man. He has such a fine voice and can not belive that his albums did not catch on when he started.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book depicts some serious love. It also makes the reader think about some dark issues such as the right to life and death. I loved this book. Highly recommended.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I was led to Rodriguez when I rented the movie Searching for Sugar Man. He has such a fine voice and can not belive that his albums did not catch on when he started.  I went to see him in concert at Radio City Music Hall and his voice is as soothing as it is on the albums.  I hope someone gives him a chance at recording another album.
1595826971|5.0|Book is a great buy for any game art fans. Pages are beautifully presented in full color and add on to the story by showing art for never before seen characters and levels while also showing the creative process for creating the insanity that is Alice and her mad mad world.
B000005AYL|1.0|When I received it it was unplayable because of all the skips. Also, the cover did NOT look like the picture. It was just a regular black album sleeve with a horizontal stickers that had a picture of Erykah and said Baduizm. Not sure if this is a bootleg or what. With all the skips it sounded like crap though.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Fun challenging game. Good game to help the time go by. Which I didn't have to buy hints. Still a fun game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Disappointed very much. Poorly written and storyline was obvious. She seemed like she was writing just to end the series which is a shame.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked it because it was funny,interesting,and easy to read.this book is great for me to read.I just love these books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|one of the more challenging racing games I've played. the only wish I have is that the stages be separated so you don't. have to start from the beginning each time you crash.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable allowed me to charge my phone which was the problem. The original charger no longer worked. I was unable to leave the phone on since it would not recharge.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game gets your brain thinking. and your frustrations. growing but is addicting st the same time.... its good to pass the time. if you take the train or. bus to work
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A very good fascinating novel. Great characters and very well written.<br />The fact that it was based on a true story really makes one wonder.<br />Made we want to visit India again.
B001TXQN44|5.0|The harmonies, the instrumentals, the political mood at the time and the lyrics were historical, moving emotionally. Somehow at 16 I felt positive about this album. Buffalo Springfield was a fresh voice, American, not really anti-anti. Part Height-Ashbury San Francisco, part country, part hippy. One of my all time favourite albums.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Freaking awesome game, I love it! I play it all the time and I can't get enough of it. Although, it is kind of slow at different times when using power-ups and as it transitions between power ups, other than that, it's AWESOME! Highly recommend getting it!
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie and ended up fast-forwarding through most of it. At the end I saw who directed it and understood why it dragged with a whole 'lotta nothing happening for long periods of time. I thought I was going to watch a sci-fi thriller with great graphics but it just ended up being a grand waste of time, like most of his movies. Good suspense but with very little fulfillment.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|A funny and cute movie, not my all time favorite but my son will love it, and it was a fantastic price too!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I thought the Perks of Being a Wallflower was fantastic! This is a very touching film about love and friendship in high school. The characters are fantastic and very easy to relate to. It's sweep without being sappy, and tense without being too intense. I'd highly recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Everyone who is writing scathing reviews is upset because they didn't get the nice, neat little ending they have come to expect from YA novels. Life is full of tragedy. Life is messy. No one is indestructible.<br /><br />I applaud the climax of the novel, everything fit exactly how the main characters would have acted based on what you know about them from the previous novels. The only quirks I found annoying were the constant changes in perspective and Evelyn acting out of character (at least from what we know about her).<br /><br />Give it a read, finish it, and step away for a few hours or a few days then reflect on if it was a truely good ending to a the series. I think it was, even though I'm grieving for fictional characters and sad that the series has ended. At least I have closure.
039916409X|5.0|I live in South Africa so had to wait 6 weeks before the book arrived but it was worth<br />every day. This is the the most exciting thing I have done in a long time. I am already<br />so confident that this book is life changing. Thank you Margaret for giving us a book like this.<br />Best regards,<br />Fred.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book concludes the Wheel of Time series, and does it quite effectively.  It is fast paced and has lots of action.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I must admit that I was awed and terrified at the same time.  I loved the beautiful complex love story, of first love and love for family members.  The fantastic people are surreal, but with real depth of characters.  It's painful story to read, but too beautiful to not finish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so entertaining! Only bad thing is when you wait to get your life, other then that, awesome! Lol!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|fun game but it feels like a money pit. you have to buy extra lives, pay for power ups, pay to unlock stages, etc. they really should tell you in the description about this. if you can get past this its very enjoyable.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|With all the extras and the beautiful book, this is a must-have.<br />All the censored scenes are here, lovingly restored to match the image quality of the standard film around them. Good audio, too.
B0058VW36U|3.0|i beat this on my phone now i have to do it again not much of a complaint but its still fun
B005K17RU0|4.0|Never used this app  before but i like this one. Worked as said right out of the box.  Looking at upgrading already. Hope it does well.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|tewrrible just terrible, i thought the iOS onewas bad this one is ten times worse than that and there is no recovery
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's season three of the walking dead. What is not to like. Great quality and awesome sound quality as well. Nothing better than amazon video
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Amazing time killer makes my bus ride to school that much shorter and now i dont have to talk to those weirdos
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved Divergent, didn't love Insurgent but still thought it was well written, and absolutely hated Allegiant. The storyline was flat and monotonous and I found myself skimming most of the book.  I understand why a lot of people are upset with the ending from the romance aspect, but I am just as upset about it and I was reading it for the dystopian factor. I often times forgot whose point of view the chapters were from and as a result I didn't think Tris and Tobias' characters developed at all in the third book since they almost became the same.  I felt it was just a continuation of the frustrating parts of the second book. I found the whole plot of the third book to be boring and the writiing just not as good as the first two books. The different story lines also felt all over the place and didn't get the endings I thought they deserved. I just didn't think that the book provided the closure I was looking for. I am not saying that Tris had to have survived for the author to have provided that closure, but having her die didn't do anything for it either.  I have never wished this, but I hope that for this one that the movie takes a different adaptation from the book.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Dont download terrible app and dosent work just need chrome on my kindle and it would be perfect oh well though, stupid amazon
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for it to come out on the kindle. It's a great game. Addictive. But I like the limited lives. Keeps me from playing all day long. LOL
B008EL25LE|1.0|not the game i thought it was good time killer though, would never spend the money to buy this glad i got it for free
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I bought this for use scuba diving in Cozumel in 10/2013.  It comes with a soft case to protect it and a string so you can attach to the gopro so it dangles down when not in use or needed.  You  need to be careful with the filter as it is fragile.  One guy drop it gopro with this filter on it and the filter it broke into pieces.  May want to have a back up filter if you know you will need one to get good pics.  In Cozumel the water is so clear even at 100 ft that the filter was not needed.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|a strange set up not very user friendly but its ok enough for me to use for now but the browser is better
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always loved Stephen King & the Shining has been one of the scariest books I've read. I was always curious how a child would turn out after the trauma Danny and Wendy suffered and I found this book fascinating.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|havent used it that much but its fine, wish it ran a little faster though but hey its a kindle
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I literally didn't want to start this series until this book came out because i HATE waiting lol. i read the first 2 books in 2 days, got this one immediately afterwards and well lets just say I'm happy i didn't have to wait because i would have been seriously sad. i am sad. i don't like how it ended. ppl might say the ending made better story, more emotional, more powerful more blah, blah. blah. I DONT CARE. I WANTED SOMEWHAT OF A HAPPY ENDING. what i got was tears and emotional turmoil.<br /><br />i felt like after all went through reading this book, what Tris had to go through she deserved SOOO much better. i finished the book and all i could think was \\"WHY! WHY WHY!!\\"<br /><br />i finished the book more depressed and sad than i was before reading it. i don't read books to make me feel sad and hopeless, i read them to escape from my reality, to lose myself in a story, while i did completely lose myself in Tris' story this book did not make me feel better. i know not everything in life ends in happy endings, and not every book can have a HEA. but i feel like Tris should have gotten that happy ending.<br /><br />3 stars because while its not the ending we all wanted or think we deserved, it was still a good book, we saw so much growth, i loved reading from both Tris and Tobias' POV. its just that ending was so sad, idk if i will get over it, i need to read a happy book now....
B005LAIIN0|4.0|perfect movie but it didnt seem like it had a deleted scene, or that it was un rated but oh well
B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you are a die hard, stick in the mud, classic fan of the era and Jane Austen you may not like this. If you, however, like a modern take with a twist on an old classic, a bit of fun, lots of emotion and frippery you will love this movie. The door between past and present is open and you can go in. Get the popcorn.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. It gave  me, a person who has never had a prolonged  experience with someone who wasn't necessarily handicapped and only looked different, an incredible insight into not only what Auggie experience  but also those close to him. I am grateful to have  this  knowledge.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|WARNING : This game is highly addictive. If you are an Ironman fan then you will love this game.EXTRA WARNING :This game is very awesome please play.
B00A32H1B6|5.0|Excellent!  This is wonderful interpretation of Mozart  and Daponte's great work. The DVD arrived in great condition. I would greatly recommend it.
B004X80QNG|2.0|I want a more planner type . . something more like what I would use for work . . I want the ease of being able to add stuff to the calendar  . . it takes too much and I want to Sync with my outlook on my computer . . just not what I wanted . .

B00881VLCE|3.0|This was an awesome app.  Recently it crashes every time it's open about 5 min into working on a puzzle, any puzzle not limited to one of them.  Please fix!! Used to be the best puzzle app.
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|This would have been a fantastically terrifying movie.  If it weren't so gosh-darned funny.<br /><br />Oh...and riddled with cliches.<br /><br />The best part?  The credits.
1580086810|5.0|having purchased all of the menzel-d'aluisio books, i can honestly say the world is a better place because of them.<br /><br />every single book is a conversation starter, beautiful, knowledgeable, and eye-opening.<br /><br />this seller is trustworthy and professional.<br /><br />i'm very pleased.
B004J4WNL2|1.0|I just started reading the book. While I would encourage educational text describing common qualities of one-half  of our population (not one third claimed by the author) , the introverts, especially in this country, I believe the process in achieving the goal must begin with an accurate and complete definition of terms. For instance Introversion and ExtrAversion (note the correct spelling of the term by the man that coined it) are not psychological types at all but indicate the attitude of the psyche. Those who are normally extraverted, are objective or goal oriented (extra) and see themselves in the world while introverts are subjective or experience oriented and see the world in themselves. The two attitudes are NOT static, every introvert has times when they are extraverted or goal oriented, likewise with extraverts who occasoinally enjoy the experience rather than achieving an objective.<br /><br />The writer's attitude description is two dimensional and static. This contrasts with the reality of the individual human psyche. Considering the attiitudes introversion and extraversion.without mentioning the functional type makes for a psychological model that is blurred, and in-fact with conclusions that are outright undefendable as there would be too many exceptions.  The book lacks a clear structure or foundation.<br /><br />I'd like to continue reading but I am afraid that I am going to find too many errors and disagreement. If  you want to learn about psychological types, do yourself a favor an read the oridinal Jung text, &#34;Psychological Types&#34; published by Princeton University Press and save your money by not purchasing this book.

B000PAAH3K|3.0|Many interesting points.  Gladwell is always interesting, but he is so deliberate here.  Keeps returning to his case studies and repeating his points.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This has to be one of the worst games on the Android platform out there.<br />The few times it works, it's a great version of MTG....  But force closes all the time.<br /><br />Win at Sealed deck, force close without saving (even though it say it has).<br />Finish the first campaign game, force close. And because you've finished the first round, but the game not saved your progress when you try to play again... force close. The only way to play the first game again is to remove the app and reinstall, but as falls over EVERY time there's no point.<br /><br />There are many, many comments on the Play store and even WotC own forums about these issues on some Android tabs, but the dev and Wizards just ignore them!!<br />This game has the worst support of any app I've ever used. Its like they've put out a beta and just can't be bothered to fix any of the bugs.<br /><br />I'd have thought better of Wizards than put their name on something this bad.<br />I've given it one star as I can't give it zero.
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Great read and highly recommend it. Some great pointers to think about and the fact that I read it one sitting goes to show me that it is an interest I have a passion for.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|This is a great album! It's got all the elements of the classic heavy metal genre! I hope this is the first of many!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I've seen other people's reviews and I understand where they are coming from. But I will not punish this extremely talented author with a bad review just because it wasn't what I'd expected or wanted to happen(believe me I'm still a bit shaken). She has done a fine job of ending the series and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|if you want to accomplish alot in your free time-- don't get this game. it is too much fun!!!  anyone will love it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have wanted to learn Spanish from home for a long time. I have dabbled in other computer programs, but the work I put in didn't seem to get me closer to speaking Spanish.  I seem to be making progress with this program.  It is a simple teaching/learning program that gets you to practice all aspects of a language from reading and writing and to speaking in the comfort of your own home!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I bought this to go along with the Powerfast charger, but it doesn't fit it properly, too loose. So the kindle still gives me that annoying sound every other minute while charging because it keep slipping out of place. Tried plugging it up to my computer, but wouldn't charge it, again the connection to the kindle itself is too loose.
0399165274|4.0|This book is about a terrorist called the Preacher who instructs the Troll who fronts the internet to preach his terroristic views causing suicide bombers to act.<br />The tracker is to hunt him down and to kill him. He gets the assistance of Ariel a young boy who hacks into the terrorists codes.<br />At the same time there is the hijacking of a vessel in Somalia whereby the stories link when the Preacher buys one of the hostages to cut his throat on the internet.<br />It is fast moving and easy to follow the plot. I lost the flow as I got busy so kept having to put it down otherwise I could have read it from start to finish.The book is perfect for a movie. I recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A GREAT EDITION TO THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY. IT IS A THRILLING FAST PACED READ. YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN ONCE YOU BEGIN.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Fast and furious. This game will keep you moving. If your not, you need to move up. It's good for the kid and the kid in me. Thumbs up.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is sort of like subway surfers if u ever heard of that game. This game is fun and funny. My friend loves bananas and in this game u collect bananas so I should totally TELL him about this
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I have it on my Kindle and my phone. I have the daily verse widget on my phone, which is always encouraging and often very fitting for whatever is going on in my life/day. There are tons of devotionals to use, simple ones and more complex ones. There are reading plans as well if you want to read the entire Bible, which I highly recommend doing if you are a Christian. It will change your life and the lives of people who are in your life!
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I don't know what to say about this that you cannot see from pictures. So many options...vanity mirrors, tablets, phablets, phones, gps units and likely many things you could think up yourself. It is truly universal and versatile!<br /><br />I used the little rubber insert to hold this steady on my bars, tightened it up and slapped a holder on top. Solid...just solid! It's one of those products you wish you had thought of yourself.<br /><br />But, you didn't, so it's your turn to help someone else get rich. Buy it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app a lot. It's not so great on my phone, but it's great on my Kindle. Love Pinterest.
0345530578|5.0|I can always depend on Grisham to give me a great story. I love his style and subtle humor. His characters are alive and vivid. Thank you, John! I recommend all his books, haven't been disappointed yet.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I use this app every day. I have it on my phone and my Kindle. I keep my grocery list icon on my homepage of my phone. The only thing I would change is the ability to insert a work anywhere on a list, not having to drag it up or down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that they have this application for my kindle fire. Awesome game that I have been playing for a while now. Was great that you could link to your already in progress game.
013168728X|5.0|this is really a very good book for DIP. I like it. and i got this book very soon after i ordered it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Unlike what I thought I'd be. It was funny and touching I feel like i know the characters. It was sad but not slit your wrist sad it was just perfect.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|*SPOILERS* I was just heartbroken when I read the ending. I understand that some books really cannot end in a fairy tale way, but this was too much. Killing of the main character is just not fair to loyal readers and fans of the series who have been looking forwards to the release of this book for months now. I was expecting some important character to die, like Christina, or even Tobias which would have been almost as bad, but to kill Tris, the main character since the very beginning was just too much. I do not recommend this book to anyone...just imagine your own happy ending-trust me, it's better. This book is not worth the time or the money and it will only leave you sad and upset. I will not be re-reading this series ever again and instead I will erase this third book from my memory and create an ideal ending in my head.
0446568813|1.0|the book itself is great. i oredered hardcover and they sent me paperback.if you're looking for hardcover go to a book store.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game.  I can't wait to get my free credits everyday.  This is my favorite online game.  LOVE IT!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This is the spoiler free review.<br /><br />I loved Divergent and Insurgent I've read both of them a few times.  I know that it isn't the strongest world building and some of the stuff is so far from real, but I like the spirit of the story so much I really let that go.  I enjoyed the idea factions and simulations and breaking out of your norms to be something more.<br /><br />Allegiant wasn't the book I hoped it would be.  Part of that is my fault of course for being so excited about it the other part is the direction the author took in the story.  It is a departure from some of the things I really loved in the first two books.  There is definitely not as much action in this one and some of the things that happened I thought were mistakes characters had already made in Insurgent and I thought they had already learned those lessons in a hard enough way they would not repeat them.<br /><br />That said the overall story is enjoyable I got to have some FourTris cuddle time and relationship development that I really liked.<br /><br />--  I fell in love with him.  But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me.  I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.  I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.<br /><br />Seeing the world from both Tris's and Tobias's POV went well for me.  I knew Tobias was a flawed character so I wasn't surprised to see some of his struggles while others seemed a little off the mark.  There is a resolution of sorts with Caleb.  We get to see what is outside of the fence, it isn't at all what I thought it was.  Christina became a character I loved even more along with Cara.  There are new bad guys and new problems to deal with.  But the overall storyline just missed the mark with me a little.  It seemed a little like filler to get to the Big Event.<br /><br />I will say that the writing right before and after the Big Event is some of the best I've read from Roth and while I didn't like the direction the story took I respect that as the author that is where she chose to go and she at least wrote those parts beautifully.  The last 15% of the book is absolutely beautiful even if I didn't like where the story went.  But congrats to VR for doing something different with her story.<br /><br />My entire problem I think is that VR didn't make me believe in her ending.  I forgave some plot holes but the resolution between Evelyn and Tobias almost seemed like a cop out.  I did however like the arrangements between the Allegiant and Factionless at the ending.<br /><br />I will probably never read this one again even though Divergent is still one of my favorite books.  There is a definite ending and epilogue so we are not left hanging like in a few other dystopia trilogies I've read.<br /><br />Here is my silly math on how I came to my rating.  4 Stars for the commitment of the author to the ending she wanted, 1 Star for how I felt after finishing the book, 2.5 Stars for the overall outside the fence story line, and 5 stars for beautiful writing of the last 15% of the book.  (4+1+2.5+5)/4 = 3.125 so I'll just round down to 3 Stars total.<br /><br />If you would like to see my full review with spoilers please go to [...]ig Event is some of the best I've read from Roth and while I didn't like the direction the story took I respect that as the author that is where she chose to go and she at least wrote those parts beautifully.

B009WUBERW|5.0|from the &#34;old&#34; gang!  I love to see when seasoned actors come together and make a move. Similar to &#34;Original Gangsters&#34; when those stars basically 'came out of the wood works'.
006202406X|2.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent. Loved them. I get Allegiant and it's nothing but disappointing. I was with the book until the end. The ending was such a let down...<br />I expected more and better.<br />Veronica Roth is an amazing author, she should have just thought this ending out better
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book is not a literary masterpiece by any means, but I enjoyed the beginning of it, just like I have enjoyed the rest of the series, until the end.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />I feel that the ending that Roth wrote was an easy way out and that she was trying to get that emotional ending, but failed.  Honestly, killing Tris off was stupid. She's the main character.  This whole series is basically through her point of view.  It was stupid and and a cheap trick.  I also think that she could have handled the ending differently, it was poorly written and really doesn't address how Tobias goes on.  It just says that he does.  He doesn't get his happy ending.  This was a stupid ending and because of it, it kind of has made me hate the book and the series.  At this point I doubt I'm going to see the movie.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|It works really (the more u use it the more u enjoy) it forced me to use the gray stuff

B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Imaginative, another realm leaking sea monsters in our ocean? Awesome.  The effects, robots and monster verse steel fighting was great. 5 out of 5 stars.
078518533X|2.0|Graphic novel adaptations are very hard to do well. A tremendous amount of work goes into making one, so publishers can only afford to do so for really popular novels. One of the things that is often lost in the process is the pacing. What may take up 2-3 pages in the novel, takes 3-5 pages in the graphic novel (especially if you want to pause for dramatic effect). In order to fit the most important elements in an adaptation half the size of the original work, a lot of key scenes and transitions are cut or rushed. As a result, graphic novel adaptations are never nearly as good as their original novels. This brings me to my review of this Ender's Game graphic novel adaptation.<br /><br />-For people attempting to read the graphic novel first<br /><br />Don't. You will struggle just to follow along and not be able to appreciate the story at all. People who ignore this suggestion will be constantly trying to figure out who the different characters are, get confused in game scenes and not understand the rules, get lost (since the first half of the story jumps around between settings without transitions), and not be able to comprehend the significance of many scenes and therefore be unimpressed with the overall story. This is because the author needed to cut several things to fit everything in and therefore had no choice but to cut crucial transitions and explanations.<br /><br />One of my biggest quirks about this graphic novel is that all the characters look alike since they all share the same stoic expressions, hair color/styles, and skin color in dim lighting--which is extremely confusing, considering most of the story is cast in a dim light. This will only cause further confusion to an already baffled reader.<br /><br />Honestly, I highly recommend you read the original [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (The Ender Quintet)]] novel first, since you were motivated enough to look up the graphic novel and read this review. It's a page turner and you will not regret it.<br /><br />-For people who have already read Ender's Game and wish to read the graphic novel<br /><br />This book is good for a quick review; to relive the experience in a new medium. Nothing more. This book will not win any awards, and it will not be something you would recommend to a friend who has not read the original book. This book has many flaws, but not any more than what you would expect. Below I will explain some of the flaws and inconsistencies of the adaptation.<br /><br />The adaptation is split uniformly in half to represent two parts: Battle School and Command School. Since Battle School took up most of the original book, and Command School took a small fraction... it's easy to assume that the Battle School half of the book would not do the the original novel justice due to the extensive amount of cuts, and that the Command School half would be better since they could focus more on transitions and details (something the previous half could only dream of doing).<br /><br />Because of all the necessary cuts in the Battle School half, many of the scenes were very jumpy and hard to follow, many of the characters we're not given proper introductions (if any), and all of the Peter and Valentine scenes were cut. I understand that scenes needed to be cut to be able to fit the story in 120 pages, but I could not believe that they didn't explain the rules to the battle room. Arguably, the most important game in the book where about half of the book's settings takes place in-- they do not bother to elaborate on what it is or how to play it. They only illustrated that you wear suits in an anti-gravity chamber and shoot people (not taking the time to explain what shooting people actually does or how if affects the game). This book would otherwise be incomprehensible if you had not actually read the original novel.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Command School half a lot more since they were able to take their time and focus more on transitions. The only complaint I have isthat there really wasn't any falling action. Ender kills the Formacs, feels bad, and his friends come and they all jokingly plan on going to school on Earth. What about his guilt? What about the egg? The promise to help it hatch? I felt that this was a significant part of the book, and could hardly believe that they cut it.<br /><br />-The Art<br /><br />There is no denying that Pasqual Ferry and Frank D'armata are talented artists. Flipping through the book, you will see amazing color tones, effects and details that went into the making of this graphic novel. There is no doubt in my mind that the artwork is a treasure to look upon...and yet I can not give it full marks. I can't tell you if it was the colorist's fault or the artist's...but the characters are hard to differentiate. Everyone looks the same! Due to the dim lighting, everyone's hair and skin color look the same, their faces look the same, and you can barely differentiate one another by haircut. I even had a hard time differentiating Petra, and she's the only female student in the book! To add further confusion, there was a scene where Dink introduces himself in the cafeteria. Then Bernard (who has the same haircut as Dink) comes in unannounced and starts bullying Ender, and Dink suddenly disappears! If I hadn't known the story, I would have thought Dink was a two-faced bully! The next time you see Dink, you think you're meeting him for the first time, since he looks completely different with a different hair color and haircut!<br /><br />In addition, it's hard to blame them for this, but when everyone is in their suits they are impossible to differentiate between. They tried to color code it a bit, but it was still difficult.<br /><br />I also felt that the characters themselves, especially in the beginning, were very stiff. They all had emotionless expressions, and were all very shiny. The artist likes working in dim lighting with the light shining upon the characters' faces to make it look 3Dish, but it simply was not my cup of tea.<br /><br />The final inconsistency were the sizes. Ender is known for being the youngest and shortest launchie in the book, but he is drawn taller than Alai and Shen, and is barely any shorter than his Salamander teammates. Bean is known for being abnormally small, but there are scenes where he is just as tall as his teammates. Minor, but important details.<br /><br />Overall, this book is just as good as what you can expect from a graphic novel adaptation of a popular book. For me who has read the original Ender's Game, it was a satisfactory way to recall the events that happened in the book-- but not something I would recommend.friends come and they all jokingly plan on going to school on Earth.

B006M4F67A|4.0|The game is relatively easy but does have a challenge here or there. Like the layouts! Would recommend to get it.\\"
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|I couldnt wait for this to come out after hearing Love To Love You Baby And Love Is In Control remixes i thought well this should be good. But nope, all garbage! Do yourself a favor and only download those two songs.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What can I say- it's Khaled Hosseini. His stories can rarely be matched in their simultaneous sadness and beauty. His writing is just so... there are no words. Modern literature...
B00006674X|5.0|Different type of Elvis movie, but a good story.  Fun movie, with some heavier storylines too.  Love Mary Tyler Moore in it.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is extremely interesting, and very well written. Like Robert Sapolsky, Siddhartha Mukherjee has a knack for telling science stories without putting the reader to sleep, and instead weaves coherent and suspenseful stories of the science of cancer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging and addictive. Some levels will frustrate you if you haven't progressed in more than a week but all in all it's fun to play.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is absolutely the most fun bingo game for the kindle fire. It has multiple rooms and challenges. It also has specialized rooms and seasonal rooms. The payout for win could be better but this one is b better than most.  The slots games are exciting also. I've won a lot of coins by playing slots
B001EN71CW|5.0|What can I say?  Its Firefly.  It's amazing.  You should watch it, whoever you are.  Seriously.  It's great.  The End.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept me engaged and constantly had me thinking how I, as a parent, would respond. I loved how the author intertwined the current with the previous history.
034580404X|1.0|I'll be honest, I didn't read it.  I bought this as a gift, but did flip through some pages and all I found was crap.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was extremely excited for this book and was so giddy about it the day before I got my copy. I was a huge hunger games fan and people were raving about this so I decided to read it and after a full day of reading DIvergent I know this isn't the next hunger games, its completely different and it's amazing. I finished Insurgent the next day. Honestly that was just a month ago and when I found out Allegiant was coming out soon I was waiting. Instantly once I received it I started reading it but out of curiosity I went to the Divergent Wikia and somebody said Tris dies. Me, being the hopeful person I am, made excuses saying it was just a selfish person trying to make the rest of us who didn't finish the book off edge. As I kept reading  I was weary with the constant bickering between Tobias and Tris and I was losing hope for her living.  Allegiant reminded of what happened just last book. It was repetitive and I was getting bored and many times I wanted to stop reading. Finally Tris's death came and I cried, I couldn't believe how cruel Veronica Roth had been! I knew that there will be ups and downs in this book but I was always sure Tobias and Tris would end up together, maybe even start a family together. I had a completely different ending played out in my mind and this was far from it. I was also angry that the author would kill of the character that started all of this in the first place and when she died it almost seemed hopeless to be reading the series. Another thing was she also killed off Uriah. I always liked him, he always seem fun to be around and never did anything wrong. One thing I had always looked forward to the ending is that finally all the pain and suffering you went through with the characters, they end up happy and get the ending it deserved making you go phew this was everything i ever hoped for this series.. These series includes The Hunger Games, The Infernal Devices, Percy Jackson and so on. They made me think all that reading was worth whilebut this didn't. Tris's death was unnecessary and cold, such a brave character died just because of a bullet?<br /><br />Whats satisfying was Tobias's ending. He was finally free of Marcus and one of his parents loved him again. Even though he will eternally miss Tris, he's still better, he have friends and he is moving on. He also seem less intense and he let go of his past, letting go of the Dauntless part of his life behind him. Life seemed better for him and the rest of the people and somehow that made it less infuriating. I don't hate the series and I will definitely be one of those people who will watch Divergent in the cinemas  but I will always remember the awful ending. I was shock that this teen romance novel ended with no romance whatsoever and I will not be re-reading this series but I won't be those angry people making a huge deal but this definitely came from my #1 favorite series to my #10 and below. I am truly disappointed but at least on person got a half happy ending. That ending that will never be whole.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I wondered why so many people rated this game, 5-Stars?  Then, I played it and was entertained and delighted.  You can play it for fun, to fill some wait time or to wind down before sleep.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I love this sitcom and the discs quality was really good so it's like buying new products for a used low price!!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I own them all.  Great to watch on a snowy weekend when television is a dud!  If.  You love the series it's a must!
B000OSDSKM|5.0|Another not so easy movie to locate. But Amazon has it in its excellent inventory. Great and smooth transaction.- thank you so much.
B00422LESO|4.0|It is a romantic comedy.  It is funny and a quick read.  I enjoy reading this book over and over.  Although I haven't been able to find a place like Austenland, I am interested if a place like this would go over well in the real world.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is an awesome app hasbro has really outdone itself this time. I can't wait for the equestria girls update to come out
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I like this book a good bit.  Books are always more entertaining to me when I know people I could easily fit into these rolls and imagine it played out in my mind.
B008EL25LE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  The music is haunting, and it's nice to have a storyline to go along with the match 3.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Asus TF700 tablet with keyboard:<br /><br />This app with my equipment listed above lays out in portrait mode with the keyboard attached.  I removed the keyboard and it  would not rotate to landscape mode in that configuration either.  I believe the statistics show that this type of device is very popular and the author should address this issue.  Otherwise the app seems to be very engaging and has many different sections to choose.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome,amazing,you s hould get this,it is amazing who made this is a genius,buy this be smart and try this product.
B00DZJ82VC|3.0|This review is for the standard 1-disc version. The album itself, of course, easily rates five stars. In my opinion, the remastered sound here is very good - the guitars and piano are much clearer than the original release. However, the packaging is exactly the same as the original - same covers, same insert. Warner Brothers should have at least upgraded the whole package, but it has the same tired old look to it. Guess that's what happens when you don't pay extra for the \\"deluxe\\" versions...
B00486070K|5.0|Internet connection on some of the newer Macs is done through the Thunderbolt slot, so you MUST have this adapter unless you commit to 100% wireless. I don't think I read any reviews beforehand that plainly said this was the case. No complaints about the hardware, though, works as advertised.
0307352153|5.0|I found this book extremely helpful in understanding my self.  I now know there is nothing wrong with me. I am an introvert.  So?  I only wish it had been available years ago because I am 75.  Better late than never, I guess.
B009K916ZK|5.0|No more VGA ports on some newer Macs, so this adapter is a requirement for older TV/monitor use. Adapter works well, though, and new Macs are easier to set to external display than older models.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so so excited to finally play this game on my Kindle. It was long over due Amazon. I was getting tired of playing on my iphone.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I was really scared to read this book because of all the horrible pre-publication reviews.<br /><br />Do I agree with the author's decision to kill off Mark Darcy?  No, but I can understand why she did it.  Bridget Jones' story has always been about her relationship with herself more so than her in relationship with another.  I do feel like we missed out on an important chapter of her life though.<br /><br />My biggest criticism though is that Bridget at 51 seems to old for where she is in life.  I think this would have been much more successful had she been in her 40s rather than her 50s.<br /><br />It surprised me how much I enjoyed seeing Bridget as a mother.  Children in chick flick books are often irritating.  Her two certainly had their moments too but what came through overall was Bridget's love for them in characteristic fashion.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of the book dealt with one relationship and the last 1/4 with another...without giving anything away, I think it would have been better to have this proportion flipped.  The ending felt rushed to me, though I was satisfied that Bridget would carry on just as she always has.<br /><br />This wasn't the book I would have written, for sure, but I don't think the author has lost it totally a la Revenge Wears Prada.  It was a fast read and I enjoyed it overall.  I won't go back to it like the first ones but it was nice to catch up with an old friend.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The IM2 BD/DVD/DC product is worthy of your expectations.  SO there's nothing wrong there.<br />My only snit was what they did with the Mandarin.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />What they did to the Mandarin is akin to making Lex Luthor a homeless man, or the Joker some out of work actor.  That was a total and disappointing crock and distracted me from the movie.<br /><br />BUT... it is a good story.  Regardless of that little trifle.<br /><br />Now if you've seen all the trailers that are had to be seen, well, almost all the good surprises have been spoiled for you already.  Thanks Dis.  But it's still a good movie.<br /><br />Bruce (Brusimm) Simmons.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|To be honest, Christmas albums are not usually my favorite thing. They almost always have some of the popular songs that grate on my nerves, songs like Rockin' around the Christmas Tree.&#34;  Buon Natale has a couple of those songs too.  But it also has some of the classic Christmas songs like O Holy Night, Panis Angelicus and Ave Maria that are sung so beautifully with all the emotion this group of young men can summon.  Their version of O Holy Night gave me goose bumps.  As with most of their music, the arrangements feature the unique vocal qualities of each of them and also their exquisite harmonies.  The album also features classic popular songs like White Christmas and two duets with Belinda and Pia Toscano that leave you wanting more.  Although I don't usually listen to Christmas music until later in the year I made an exception for this album and am glad I did.
B008JFUR10|5.0|if you ever loved Johnny Sokko (sp?) and his giant robot, or Godzilla, THIS movie is for you.  And for the amount of attention or detail that del Toro puts into the production, it's pretty worthy and does not get old no matter how often you watch it.<br /><br />And the extras on this disc are HOW A BLU-RAY should be done.  Not like how Paramount delivers movie-only blu-rays or different extras on different distribution channels.  Paramount has driven me away from buying anything else of theirs because of that....Oops, sorry, off tangent.<br /><br />Any how, great movie, great product, just great.<br /><br />Bruce (Brusimm) Simmons.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game just wish after a million tries I could pass a level. I can't seem to get past level 23 so far but I will keep trying.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I realize the differences between the comic book character and the one played by Robert Downey, Jr. However, considering his over-the-top acting talent and depth of role coupled with outstanding scripting, directing and special effects, this is another Iron Man that just blows my mind. Well worth the few dollars to catch up before watching Part 3...
0307476073|4.0|I really enjoyed Cheryl's story of her Pacific Crest Trail hike. Once I got started, I had a hard time putting it down. She experienced a lot of interesting things on her long hike. She even admitted that she made mistakes, but don't we all? I felt really bad for her with her physical problems like her feet and with her backpack. Her encounter with the one man near the end was portrayed in such a way that I was really scared right with her! It took a lot of guts to do what she did and she certainly matured as she pursued her dream of hiking the PCT. Kudos to her for her bravery and perseverance. I was really sorry though, that she turned to heroin when her mother passed away. I had a hard time understanding that, but at least she got through it unscathed. She was really lucky to find a mate like Paul - I had hoped she could have worked out their marriage as he seemed to be a real gem. I look forward to reading more of her writing - I would recommend this book to anyone, as it holds your interest all the way thru.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith's masterpiece. He was extremely succesful in his mission to prove that anyone can make a great movie without spend some millions, using only his imagination and intelligence. KS is underrated, he deserves a lot more of recognition. I surely recommend this DVD! ;)
B00000I8DY|4.0|amazon lists this acclaimed Cosi from 1999 in tow places, and at the other place a negative review - one of the few Jacobs' set has received - points out a few inconvenient truths.  This is a conductor-driven performance that draws attention to the orchestra much of the time while the singers, including some well-known Baroque specialists (at the time - several have since expanded their reach) are more conventional, even bland. Without drawing a negative conclusion, I agree with these points while admiring the overall zip and alertness that Jacobs brings to the score.<br /><br />It's now generally accepted that period style is the best for Mozart, and in the operas one can see why. With smaller orchestras the singers don't have to strain so hard to fill a large modern opera house, and on disk they don't have to strain at all but can deliver intimate, personal characterizations with an accent on the music's fine points. But there's a flyspeck in the nectar. Singing small is easy compared with singing big. It's also less exciting, powerful, and dramatic.  So unless a singer has charisma (as Cecilia Bartoli does, compensating for her small voice), the result is a move backwards to the days when Mozart singing was dainty.<br /><br />Compared with the big voices who have sung the major roles in Cosi, Jacobs' cast is fairly miniaturized.  The negative reviewer points out that Gens isn't better able to negotiate the perils of \\"Come scoglio\\" than old-fashioned predecessors like Caballe, Price, and Schwarzkopf, while at the same time those great singers possessed glorious voices that Gens can only dream of.  In addition, none of Jacobs' singers have \\"face,\\" or individuality.  From the first notes of \\"Ah, guarda, sorella\\" in Colin Davis's version on Philips, you immediately recognize Caballe and Janet Baker. Here, Fink and Gens sound generic and much alike, as do the tow baritones who sing Guglielmo and Don Alfonso.<br /><br />For these reasons, I pondered giving this set three stars,  but that would be unfair to the general ebullience of the performance, however generic the specifics may be. Now that it's almost fifteen years old,  this Cosi doesn't seem as novel or surprising as the first reviews suggested.  I think they were exaggerating to begin with. We've had chamber versions of Mozart operas going back at least to Fritz Busch at Glyndebourne  (his recording should be acknowledged for keeping Cosi alive at a time when it was rarely performed); my college did a good job with Cosi in a dorm dining hall decades ago.  For me, the real pleasure in this set comes from the excellent playing by period musicians who sound much more accomplished than the ones heard on, say, the earlier Mozart opera cycle under Arnold Ostman and the Drottningholm Court Theatre  (on Oiseau-Lyre).<br /><br />Because I value great singing over period authenticity, I am not likely to return to this Cosi, even though its other virtues still shine.<br /><br />Note: If other reviewers haven't noted it, this recording was done at an unusually low level, requiring at least a 10db boost over normal listening volume.ee stars,  but that would be unfair to the general ebullience of the performance, however generic the specifics may be.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the story of what happened to little Danny from the Shining. Awesome story, will never pass RV's on the highway and not cringe again.
B00005N5RM|4.0|I like the original Blob and this is good as well! I like that the Sheriff is played by the actor who portrayed Dale in The Walking Dead! Had to have this and good horror movie now a classic!
B001BANK32|5.0|OMG! Saw this movie as a kid and the book was so much better! I have never experienced my heart thumping fast from reading a book before, felt like I was living the story with them. Stephen King is a master story teller!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Love this movie! Rare to see Polanski acting and not only that but with his future wife! Heartbreaking as it is I love to see these two together and wonder what it would have been if she had not been murdered! This movie has humor and horror and has always been fun to watch!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Book that just makes you want to give somebody a huge hug. it was also very inspirational in many ways.

006202406X|5.0|I understand the need for fiction, and books in general, to be a place of happy endings. \\"God is in His Heaven, and all is well with the world\\" (Anne of Green Gables). When you look to books to be an escape, you want the good guys to win, get the girl (or guy), and be sung about for generations. But real life isn't like that. Our society places so much emphasis on things coming out 'perfectly' that people don't know how to handle grief or disappointment. Teens, especially, aren't exposed to the rawness and darker side of fiction as they would have been generations ago. All war is hell, and even heroes die. So many of the current teen novels are about heroes and heroines coming out the other side of a war hailed as the victors, and covered in glory. Yes, those books include loss and grief, but they are done in such a way that the reader isn't as affected by the death. It's a relief to see books like Harry Potter, Mockingjay and Allegiant. Yes, I know, Mockingjay had a 'happy' ending compared to Allegiant - but the tone of the epilogue was bittersweet, not the unadulterated triumph that other YA books have had. The last three Harry Potter novels all included losses that caused the readers to grieve with Harry, but even then the main characters' futures were as expected. The sense of grief in Allegiant is real, and the question of how to reground after the future planned for doesn't exist anymore. It shows life going on, whether or not it was the life originally pictured.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Roth for taking the hard road for this book.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I've always enjoyed BBC news, both online and on internet radio, for getting a different slant on news events. The BBC news website is quite good, but the tablet app is designed specifically for tablets, and it looks great on my 7\\" Kindle Fire. If you're a fan of BBC news, the app is definitely worth a look.

B0001NBNAM|5.0|No one, but no one, sings Italian better than Connie.  She has a natural talent to handle these songs and once these ar eheard from Connie, no other rendition suffices.  Senza mamma is a masterpiece.
006202406X|5.0|Stayed up waiting for the release to read. Finally got it at 4am, finished it last night and felt Ms Roth did a great job with the explanation of the Divergent and the quest bestowed upon Tris, Tobias and there group to find an acceptable living state for the factions and factionless. Thank you for the courage to give us a female hero, that was capable of being strong,vunerable and moral. I loved the trilogy and I hope there will be more from Veronica Roth.

B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|I checked out the album today when it dropped. I have just purchased the vinyl album. This is a really great remix album. I come here as an avid EDM enthusiast; I am also a pretty big Donna Summer fan, though I'm a relative youngster. I can understand why some of the remixes may be off-putting to a Donna fan who isn't a big consumer of current (electronic) dance music. It's a little trancey with MacAurthur Park, a little housey with Dim All the Lights, and you get your quaint pop electronic with Holy Ghost! and Chromeo. I just can't find much wrong with this collection. If you are expecting a Donna Summer greatest hits album, DON'T BUY THIS. Get a Donna Summer greatest hits album instead.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I've lived with the album for about six weeks. I finally got it on vinyl and I must say that I like it more now than when I first heard it. Can I be honest? I actually like the remix of 'Working the Midnight Shift' better than the original. Donna's vocals are flawless, of course. But I find the structure/production of the remix far preferable to the original. The hook is just phenomenal and leaves me listening to the song on repeat.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|This is so good the best Alan has done it so good I love it its so easy to listen too
0394818237|5.0|I love this book!  It brings back memories of when my 24 year-old son was a toddler.  It really helped him with word recognition and was a great dad bonding tool.

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|It's so beautiful every track is lovely Angetha voice is better the its ever been so re-frashing and easy to listen too
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This is my favorite hits CD of Dylan's, bar none.  The songs are sung with great annunciation from yesteryear.  These I remember.<br />Recommended to everyone...
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I liked the World War I history in the book, as I had not known too about much that.  What I did't  like....was all the sexual encounters -  way too much information.  I loved following the different people and families throughout the war.  I'm debating about the next book....as I have read many of the reviews and there have been not many good ones.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish I would have just stopped after the first 2 books!!! I have never been so disappointed with an ending. First I have no problem with death if it is necessary and done correctly. Trish's death was unnecessary and anticlimactic. There was no purpose for it in the series. In fact the entire ending was rushed and seemed inconsistent with the rest of the series. Why spend so much time and energy in a series only to choose not to stay true to your characters! Its as if Roth felt like she had to have a sad ending so she did but with no real purpose or benefit to the story. The hunger games was bittersweet but the death had a purpose and the ending still left readers satisfied. I am embarrassed to have recommended this series to so many of my friends and family!
B00DW1WR14|4.0|It's a decent mix of styles. Some good hard rock mixed with somewhat, but not very, thoughtful lyrics. I don't mind it, it's pretty good overall...but unlike the people that dislike this album, I like No Code more than Ten.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|omg finally got on kindle fire!!!!!!  fun and  challenging!!!! so glad I can finally play this game. I love love love it. get this game if you can
B002RSQGQK|5.0|I have viewed this before, but my 13 year old son and his friend had not. They were on the edge of their seat and remarked afterwards, &#34; Hey that was scary without blood and guts!&#34;
B003VANOFY|1.0|Updated:  The software for these is completely atrocious.   While the hardware functions normally; attempting to also use the Lgs software resulsts in the driver repeatedly reinstalling themselves.   You can technically use the headphones without the software, but this results in the sidetone being set to 0.   Making them incredibly disorienting and uncomfortable to speak in.   So, listening only.  Skip these.   I've destroyed mine with righteous fire.   the TLDR is; If the cord on your gaming headset is annoying you; buy this.  I've used these headphones daily and they have been(nearly) trouble free. They function like standard, good quality around ear headphones so my list of pros will be short. Pros - Battery life is more than sufficient for 5-10 hours of continuous use. Sound Quality is great Logitech G keys & Software give you the ability to voice activate when away. Lighter than I expected. The range is sufficient to go up a floor and over several rooms. ~20 feet straight line through obstructions (that are not a microwave.)  Cons - There software needed a bit of tweaking to sound ideal - the Dolby options adjust to 11 - which results in some unwanted distortion. Changing these values to 10 made them quite clear. There are better (and less expensive) wire headphones for listening to music, skip these if your an audiophile. Avoid fully discharging them - they are annoyingly unresponsive until a certain level of charge is achieved. There is no bluetooth. I own the Logitech H800 series as well; Being able to double dip and connect to PC or Phone is super convenient - I'd prefer to use these with my phone as well... but alas. Battery Life - I think I'd sacrifice some weight to have a battery last 3-4 days. A heavy user (&#62;5hrs a day) is basically required to charge these nightly.  Other thoughts I'd love to see a wireless charger included, bluetooth added, the software improved and a larger capacity battery (optional?) We might be talking a $200 headset, but Idprobably pay that too.
B002BE7JE8|5.0|I'm happy to say that after 25 years Child's Play still holds up as a great horror/thriller.  Even more exciting is the Blu-ray release, which is simply great.  The video transfer looks quite nice.  Overall resolution and edge-detail look pretty strong, with only a few indoor scenes looking a bit soft.  There is a nice, natural layer of grain showing through, keeping the original film presentation true to form.  Contrast and color saturation are pretty punchy and solid, and the color timing looks pretty accurate with skins tones looking natural.  The audio track has a DTS HD master which is very strong, and really puts presence into sound effects and all of Chucky's scurrying around in the shadows (think of the little footsteps darting around in the sound field).  The special features are pretty in-depth, and we get a real feel for how the film both came to be and how it was made.  Two commentary tracks round out the extras.  Overall, a really nice Blu-ray that fans of the film will really enjoy.  Hidee-Ho!
B009CG29RK|2.0|The video was great. Unfortunately the video service was terrible. This was the first time I have used amazon instant video. I assumed it wouldn't be all that difficult as I have used netflix for years. Boy was I wrong. Every 10 minutes, the movie froze due to buffering issues. I know it's not an issue on my end as I am running FIOS quantum (nominally ~50 Mbps) and I double checked it with speed test. Another thing to consider is that you can't stream videos onto a device without wifi (have been doing this on Netlfix for some time)...
0307277453|4.0|This is an  excellent introduction to the complexity, yet basic &#34;simplicity&#34; of development of life and its changes through the eons.<br />It is interesting to general public as well as the scientific specialists.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has not disappointed me. This is a simplified version of the escape-from-the-locked-room concept. each level requires multiple step solutions invovling memorizing Colorado patterns, number sequences, and common sense.

006202406X|1.0|Veronica Roth is an exceptional writer. I just wish she would use her powers for good instead of evil. She was taking a risk and attempting to be edgy with the ending, but it felt forced and unnecessary. This book will shatter your heart (and love for the series), and not in a poetic way. I feel that a much better story could have been written. This one just leaves me feeling bitter and resentful. If you love this series as much as I did, I strongly advise you to pass this book up. I can not emphasize how awful this book makes you feel. Just read the fanfiction.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|[[ASIN:B00EENEGAY Native Sons]]This would have been the perfect almost modern piece of gothic fiction had there been a budding romance of some sort to sweeten the pot. How about one between the protagonist and the mud man? But since a ghost is of no use in a romantic situation why not the maintenance man? Just kidding. The book is perfectly nuanced bringing forward the right amount of a ghostly past to be intriguing. If I recall the mood and temperament of a novel two months after reading it then in my opinion it is very good.  Marshall L Dell
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am thrilled that this is FINALLY here for my Kindle!! I love this game! It's addictive because it's a challenge!! Some levels are easy, but others can be hard and frustrating, which is why I love to play! :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love an emotional ending.  I know people think they want a perfect happy ending, but going through all kinds of emotions with characters is so rewarding. An author that gets people to feel so strongly and connected to the characters has done their job. So although you may not like how it ends, that doesn't make it bad. I personally think the series ended the way it needed to. I also think when people give it sometime, they will see the beauty in the ending.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think everyone should read it for themselves and come to their own conclusion on how they feel.<br /><br />As for the rest of the book, Allegiant has less action then the first 2 books. Roth had to cover a lot of information in 1 book, but I think the 2 POV's  helped move the story along. All YA novels get compared to each other and in a lot of ways Divergent and Insurgent are similar to The Hunger Games and Harry Potter, however Allegiant brings a unique conclusion unlike other YA series.

B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|This is among my favorite Shakespeare productions EVER! It was light, fun and everyone playing on screen looked like ....well, it looked like what it was. A bunch of friends, having fun playing Shakespeare at Whedon's house. I recommend this for anyone who likes Shakespeare, Whedon and especially for those who like both :D!!
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|The only reason I checked out this album was because of the controversy surrounding her, so if you think bashing her will take away her success, just know bashing her will only make her more popular.<br /><br />All that aside, I liked the album and I own thousands of CDs: everything from classical, jazz, classic rock, metal, hip hop, alternative, techno,pop, film score and more. I really liked the darker moodier sounding songs on this album, I really like them. But the tracks that try to be fun bubble gum pop seem a bit off putting to me. The album feels inconsistent, you have the serious moodier trip hop sounding stuff, then you have some silly weird country hip hop sounding stuff, then some ironic purposefully cheesy early 90s sounding pop that doesn't seem to fit. The fun sounding experimental songs aren't catchy enough to really like. If the album focused more on the serious and moody trip hop sound this would be more of a 4 or 5 star album. But this is a really solid album for a young artist! I look forward for her future releases!<br /><br />Review update: after giving this album a better listen after a few months, I feel comfortable enough to give it 5 stars for everything it is: ambition, experimentation, fearlessness. I originally gave it a 3 but now I feel it's one of the best hip pop experimental albums of 2013. Job well done! I love the attitude, variety, everything about this album, I'm glad I bought it! People are bashing her for very little reason, this album is not that dirty! It has a very human down to earth side to it few people are seeing. Oh well, the controversy will only up the sales!

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This book was classic King.  Suspense, a likeable heroine and a few surprises along the way.  I  really enjoyed it.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|Firstly, this game is done to profecion, prior to the last update. With only one frame left I updated and somehow all gold frames turned silver (and moves went to 0). So very frustrated, but I decided to try and get all gold frames again. After 12 frames I took a break, only to come back and find them silver again. I'm giving three stars due to the glitch and the fact that it is still a great game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I could not put this down.  The characters were alive in thes pages. Finally, after a few ho hum books! Thank you Mr. King!
0307200477|2.0|My son has loved this book since he was a year old.  He knows how to interact with all the different activities, and even tries to hug the bunny in addition to patting it.  The Deluxe version is nice because it includes all the pages from the original version of the book, so there are even more activities to choose from.  It's a fun, interactive reading experience that we engage in on a daily basis.<br /><br />The construction of this book is horrendous.  I intentionally bought the hardcover version to avoid the plastic comb binding that many of the other reviewers hated.  I still ended up with a plastic comb book.  The cover of the book is hollow cardboard covered with glossy finish paper.  The interior pages are the thickness of about two sheets of posterboard.  Many of the pages involve embedded objects, so the posterboard is used to sandwich those objects inside the page.  This is not what I would consider a board book.  The pages are flexible, bendable, and highly susceptible to drool.<br /><br />The plastic comb binding is worthless.  I hold the book and read it to the baby, and the pages still fall out.  Once I put it back together for the 43rd time, I'm thinking of super-gluing the comb together.  It's obvious that whoever prints this book did not put it in the hands of a child before deciding on this binding format.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm completely addicted! I have all my friends and family addicted as well! It's a game a can constantly play and never get sick of.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun, but its main focus is making money for the game manufacturer.  Once they hook you, the incessant pitch to buy lives, boosters, etc. begins.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Now that it is on the kindle, I can play it wherever I go. Love that you dont need any internet eithet.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|The ad-free version is almost the same as the other. I wouldn't waste money on it if you ask me. I think you basically get the same deal with the free one. I've got this version on my Kindle Fire and the other on my phone. I didn't see the need in buying 2 of them. To be honest I got some free coins from Amazon and I needed to use them before they expired and since I didn't really know what to get I figured why not this? It seemed like the right choice and I could try it out without having spent the money for something I normally wouldn't have to begin with. Win win.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|\\"The Intouchables\\" (as titled in the U.S.) is a French movie about the magic that ensues when two individuals open up to each other--especially diametrically opposite individuals. Neither one leads his dream life and initially focuses on present unhappiness. However, Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic, hires a black ex-criminal, Driss, to serve as his hands after a spate of highly-educated Frenchmen fail to meet Philippe's true need: humanity. Driss, uneducated yet fun-loving, pulls Philippe into a \\"baser\\" but more thrilling mentality of adventure and excitement; in essence, Driss leads Philippe back to living, rather than waiting out, life. Despite some vulgar language (it's an adolescent to adult movie after all!), the movie pulls off an emotive, artistic and personal effect to leave my wife and me rejoicing in the healing capabilities of the human spirit.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Beautiful Disaster is the first book in the Beautiful series by Jamie McGuire. It's about a college freshman named Abby, who moves away for college with her best friend to start a new life. Here, she meets Travis - who she thinks is all wrong for her. She is attracted to him, but he is covered in tattoos, he makes his money by fighting, and he is the campus man-slut.<br /><br />It's hard to completely stay away from him though, because he is the roommate of her best friends boyfriend. He makes a bet with her that she loses, and she is forced to stay in his apartment for one month. He tries his best to charm her, and she tries her best to ignore his efforts. She refuses to be his next one night stand. She doesn't realize though, that Travis sees her differently. He quickly finds out that she's not like the other bimbos.<br /><br />Their relationship is slow moving, so by the time they have their first kiss the sexual tension is burning up the pages. This book has some pretty intense moments. Travis has some major anger management issues, but at the same time he had such a soft side for Abby. I actually really liked his character, despite the fact that so many reviewers are bashing him. Both characters had some frustrating actions, but Abby actually drove me nuts so much during this book. Travis was trying so hard to turn his life around, and she just kind of strung him along. She basically just couldn't make up her mind about him. There was one scene where she really angered me, but I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />I would probably give the first half of this book 5 stars. I just couldn't put it down. I stayed up until 4 in the morning reading one night. The second half just didn't hold my attention as much. I was a bit disappointed by Abby's deep dark secret past that wasn't revealed until the 2nd half. I was expecting it to be something huge, but really it was pretty minor (to me anyway).<br /><br />If you love New Adult books, or edgy contemporary romances, then I really recommend this book. It's not a fairy tale romance or anything - there are ups and downs all over the place. It's like a roller coaster. The title of this book fits Travis and Abby's relationship perfectly. With the violence and the sex (even if it wasn't detailed), I would suggest this to readers 18 and over.

B00886XQO0|5.0|I bought this set because I kept hearing footsteps on my surround sound but couldn't tell where they were coming from. I really like how comfortable the headset is to where when playing for more than just a couple hours. I know, I know, that is too long right? Well, not for me. So I get the set, download the software onto my computer, plug in the headset and to my dissapointment the window opens up but not all the way to view all of the different settings. I was able to get what I needed out of the setting, but it took a while. Support and myself are still trying to work out the details.<br /><br />Pros, Great for movies, games. I can supprise people trying to run up on me. I know where every shot is made even at a distance. Can tell when someone is reloading that allows me to take advantage of that and take the kill. Can hear through walls. Makes you feel like a Ninja on the Battlefield.<br />Movies are great with this headset. Can turn it up pretty loud and get a full dynamic 7.1 surround sound feel better than the movies. Also my neighbors don't hear the constant gun shots and tank cannons blasting through the walls. However they probably think I have turrets from all the random cussing.<br /><br />Cons: Only one. The bluetooth adapter for live chat drains the battery from my controller too fast. only get about 4 hrs of game play before having to change controllers. Or batteries.<br /><br />I would by another if it were practicle.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|DON'T READ THE ALLEGIANT ENDING. MAKE UP YOUR OWN.<br />The book was okay up until the end. Then it ruined the whole series.<br /><br />I can't believe we waited so long for this book just to be disappointed.<br />The first book in the series was the best, the second book was upsetting but necessary and very accurate, but this third book was terrible.<br />I am on the older end of the 'young adult' category, but I have been invested in this series and other series' like it. I don't think the way the author ended it was remotely okay to her younger fans or myself.<br />I don't know why she felt death as an ending to a series we loved would be the 'right' ending.<br />I will not read another book by Ross, nor can I go back a re-read the series like I usually do because the ending is so upsetting and finale.<br />Wrong choice, Roth. While you gloat and tell everyone you made the only fitting choice, you lost half of your fan base.<br />Reality is hard enough, so that's why we need happy endings.<br />Thanks, but no thanks.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Brad Pitt plays a great father in this movie. The ability he has to portray as a loving father who gave up his career to be with his family is amazing. I started to believe this was just another Zombie movie, but I was wrong. Great twist to the story and an unpredictable ending not seen before. GREAT movie.<br /><br />I think they could have chose a hotter wife, but the cast for the family shows a bit of reality which makes it all that much better.
B00BKZUVGM|4.0|First of all I'd like to congratulate Veronica Roth on ripping my heart out...Way to go!!! The ending is a shocker and I refused to believe it until I had reread it for the tenth time, it was that big. I still hate the ending, probably always will, considering how hopeless it made me feel. I think she could've toned down on the whole realistic thing but that's partly why it was so good, because life isn't fair. I hoped that this book would have a bit more of an insight into Tris and Four's relationship, for example them sorting stuff out especially after Insurgent...but that didn't happen which I'm disappointed about. For some I would recommend making up your own ending whereas for others I'd... recommend actually reading the book
B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!! Too many holes in the story on top of a terrible ending!!! The movie the \\"The Truman Show\\" kept popping in my head with all the cameras and big brother going on.<br /><br />There are a lot of questions unanswered.  Edith and the Priors could have been discussed more in depth. Natalie's double agent storyline wasn't believable. When did Caleb truly betray his family? Before the attack? Was he recruited later just to get to Tris? How did Cara help Peter save Tris in #2 since she was at the Amity headquarters? Hey Bureau, simulations to kill tons of people ok? Death Serum not ok? What's the difference? Everyone in the faction war just kisses and makes up because Tobias pops up and says so? Just like that? That easy?  What happened to Four? He lost his edge in this one. So David can barely wheel himself to a council meeting but he has the strength to rush and hideout in the Weapons Room and wait for Tris? Did the planes ever take off? Or did the Bureau lie to Tris about that too? Another reason why her sacrifice wasn't necessary.  I'm so disappointed. Roth should have just thrown Tris in the chasm in Divergent and spared me heartbreak. Pass the vials of memory serum Peter. I'd rather pretend that the series ended with book 2.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|\\"The Circle\\" by Dave Eggers is as important a work for the 21st century as \\"1984\\" was for the 20th.  Add a pinch of \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" as well.  \\"The Circle\\" is written for today's audience and takes the reader on a nightmare journey into technology's potential heart of darkness. As we shoot video and photos of everything, and I do mean everything, and post those images online for public consumption, we are meandering down that road to the \\"transparency\\" sought in \\"The Circle\\".  Transparency is a world where there is no privacy. Everyone's every action is available for view at all except for 3-minute breaks that preserve the sanctity of the restroom.  This is the mission of the Circle, a fictional high-gloss social media network corporation. A talented young woman is hired to a dream job at the Circle and is gradually drawn into its worldview. She is so taken with it that she becomes its face to the world as she allows the masses to live her life vicariously as she shares every moment of her life with everyone.<br /><br />Here is where I had trouble with the book. Eggers is a wonderful writer, but he didn't convince me that he knows females well enough to try to convey their thoughts and feelings credibly.  The behaviors of his protagonist, Mae Holland, are portrayed as pretty one-dimensional. She is fiercely ambitious, heartless, and often quite stupid. She is easily manipulated, and that of course leads to her ultimate ruin. She is perhaps portrayed this way to speak to the shallow and acquisitive nature so often found in online postings. I always choose to believe such people just do not do well in expressing the complexity of their thinking. In this book, however, there isn't a great deal of complexity to the thinking of ordinary mortals, just to the geniuses who created the Circle.<br /><br />In spite of that, however, The Circle is an important book and should be read, seriously considered and discussed. In a world where even street people have a smart phone, I find it a little alarming to think where all this personal interaction with technology may ultimately lead. Clearly Dave Eggers is concerned as well and has started the conversation in a very readable way.e even street people have a smart phone, I find it a little alarming to think where all this personal interaction with technology may ultimately lead.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|SPOILER:<br />I am quite saddened by the fact Tris is dead. She needed to be alive and this is just depressing and cruel. Veronica Roth created a fantastic series but the main character had to live along with Tobias. She could've killed everyone else and it would be okay but killing the main character...then everything that happened in the last 2 books was a waste. I am just ignoring her death because i was really unhappy with this ending decision. As much as reality isn't always happy endings, the main characters living makes it all okay. Seriously, realism could've been shown by killing everyone else but at least Tobias and Tris were together. I still adore the trilogy and a this novel was great despite Veronica's bad decision.

B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I've enjoyed Gladwell's work over the years, even though it's clear he cuts corners, smooths down facts, cherry-picks evidence, and so on. I enjoy a good storyteller who connects his tales to ideas. So I'm not anti-Malcolm.<br /><br />That said, this book is a terrible disappointment. Gladwell makes all kinds of wild leaps, without logic or evidence. He seems to have a strange hatred for Hotchkiss School, belittles lawyers and Ivy League schools, and too often just does not do his homework.<br /><br />The biggest failure here is the publishing industry. Lusting after yet another Gladwell bestseller, his editors did not challenge him to deliver his best product.<br /><br />Imagine if Gladwell had heeded advice like this (which originally appeared in www.writing-hacks.com) . . .<br /><br />Dear Mr. Gladwell,<br /><br />We were pleased to get the manuscript of David and Goliath for consideration at [name of publisher redacted]. We know of your success with previous pop-scholarship books. The title suggests a powerful \\"high concept\\" book. And we love--lovelovelove--high-concept books like Salt and Cod and A History of the World in Five Glasses and, yes, The Tipping Point and Blink and Outliers. When you see the title, you instantly get the premise--a promise of a unique and satisfying angle. So we loved your title and what it promised.<br /><br />We're going to have to pass on the manuscript, though. I'd like you to rethink the concept and do more research. Right now, the book is a loose collection of anecdotes, which take huge leaps of logic, offer scanty evidence, and contains contradictions that undermine your case.<br /><br />The biggest problem, though, is that the book doesn't really take on the David and Goliath phenomenon. Sure, some sections talk about the ability of the little guy to defeat the big guy (my favorite story is about the girls basketball team that triumphs with aggressive full-court play). But more often, your discussion ranges far from that theme. Your themes include, in no particular order: the importance of \\"multiple intelligences,\\" the power of grit and willpower, the effect of peers on behavior, the dynamics of civil disobedience, the power of buzz, the strength of love, the potential of detailed research to yield new insight, and the psychological need for belonging. I'll get to all that in a minute.<br /><br />I want to publish your book--what editor doesn't want to acquire a best-selling author?--but I simply cannot find a theme in this pudding.<br /><br />THEME<br /><br />Rather than just saying \\"there's no there there,\\" let me explain what I mean. If you were to conduct more rigorous research and recast the work, you might consider a number of frameworks. Consider, for example:<br /><br />Possible theme No. 1: The Master-Slave Dialectic: This is a key insight in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, probably due for a popularization. (If you don't do it, Alain de Botton will!) The idea is simple: Even powerful people need recognition from the peons below them. When peons refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of their superiors, those peons gain surprising leverage. This is close to the David-and-Goliath theme, but still different. Hegel's dialectic shows the complexity of the psychological give-and-take in human affairs, rather than a simple confrontation of powerful and weak. A couple of your stories fit this theme:<br /><br />* Andre Trocme is a minister in a Vichy-occupied village in France. When the Nazis demand recognition of their rule, should he accede or fight? Or is there a third way--strategic defiance and withdrawal?<br /><br />* Wyatt Walker, Martin Luther King's assistant, is eager to find a way to break the back of segregation in Birmingham. How do you change the dynamic of the civil rights movements when King has suffered defeats and most of white America is indifferent? Do you create a spectacle--or is it more complicated than that?<br /><br />Possible theme No. 2: Achieving Mastery in aMessy and Indifferent World: Sounds like a how-to book, I know, but you could get away with it. This might be your best bet, if you want to keep most of your anecdotes. Everyone in your manuscript has to confront more difficult situations than they might choose. The world is messy, complex, and quite frankly indifferent to any person's fate. (There's an idea for a title: Man's Fate. Andre Malraux might not approve, but he's dead.) Think of the subjects of your work:<br /><br />* Vivek Ranadive wants to coach his daughter's basketball team to play well. But his players are small, weak, and inexperienced. Stronger teams won't give his girls a break. Or will they, unwittingly? How can he exploit opponents' lack of imagination?<br /><br />* Caroline Sacks discovers that science courses at Brown are hard--and her classmates are competitive and not eager to share. Should she give up? Buckle down? Get out of Dodge?<br /><br />* Teresa DeBrito is a principal of a middle school where enrollment has declined drastically, taking away some of the buzz of the class routines. What can she do to engage distracted teenagers in the classroom?<br /><br />Possible theme No. 3: Finding Voice in a Noisy World: To deal with huge challenges, people need to ignore the babel of voices around them. They need to hear their inner voice and find their truest values. When you know what really matters, everything else is easier to bear.<br /><br />* Wilma Derkson loses her daughter to an awful murder. Should she lash out with anger--or find a way to deepen her considerable love and humanity and to build a better world?<br /><br />* Rosemary Lawlor is a Catholic mother and housewife in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The British police run roughshod over Catholics. What can change the dynamics of this war-torn isle?<br /><br />* David Boies is dyslexic and struggles to read. Should he work construction or find a job that challenges him more intellectually? Since he's a lousy reader, how can learn and communicate?<br /><br />Possible theme No. 4: Beating the Odds: What happens when you live in a world of rigid standards and practices? How can you persevere in the face of widespread disapproval--and make gambles that might pay off for years, if ever?<br /><br />* Jay Freireich wants to find new ways to treat children with leukemia. But other doctors and researchers are dubious--and even say Freireich's aggressive treatment is inhumane. How can he find a way to give his \\"cocktail\\" of medications--and relentless chemotherapy--a chance?<br /><br />Maybe these themes lack the same sex appeal of David and Goliath, which is, after all, one of the great parables of western civilization. But they deal, more coherently, with the stories you tell.<br /><br />Maybe you can't use all the stories you offer in this manuscript. That's OK. The best works of literature come not just what's in them but also what's not in them. Anyway, you simply need to work hard--adding and subtracting and shaping--till you get the theme that truly unifies your work without simplifying too much.<br /><br />If you want to keep all your pieces, don't present them as a unified argument. Just say: Musings of a Pop Journalist, or some such.<br /><br />RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE<br /><br />\\"When you can't create,\\" Henry Miller once said, \\"you can work.\\"<br /><br />David and Goliath feels like a mish-mash. Maybe you focus so much on creating a neat theory that you didn't do the necessary work to test and prove that theory.<br /><br />Sometimes, the separate pieces read like first drafts of magazine or newspaper articles. You often rely on one or two books or articles, it seems, when you could do a lot more research--doing library research, digging into archives, and interviewing participants. I noticed that your weakest passages--like your strange attack on the Hotchkiss School--did not appear in The New Yorker. I'm not surprised. No way David [Remnick, the editor] would allow that in his magazine.<br /><br />Which reminds me. You once said something at a conference that concerns me.<br /><br />I attended a Nieman conference on narrative journalism back in 2003, when you were the keynote speaker. You said you need to spend only a day or two with a subject to understand what makes him or her tick. Your point, I think, was that your profiles focus more on ideas than personalities. You care about Lois Weisberg because of the idea she represents--that \\"weak ties\\" bind communities better than strong ties--and not because of her life story.  Fair enough.<br /><br />Now, I know you conduct more than one interview with some of your subjects. But David and Goliath takes a one-and-done approach too often. In fact, your section on Wyatt Walker shows no real first-hand understanding of the subject. You could have interviewed dozens of the Birmingham movement's activists, including Walker himself, but instead you relied mostly on Diane McWhorter's book Carry Me Home. As a result, your account is thin and misleading. I wish you had read The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement, by Aldon Morris. You get a getter idea of how the Birmingham campaign succeeded.<br /><br />Let's get specific. True, as you say, Americans were shocked by the photograph of dogs attacking a slight black boy near a demonstration. True, most people don't realize that the dog's victim was not a protester but a bystander. True, Walker was pleased by the ugly display of police brutality, since it revealed the fundamental violence of segregation.<br /><br />But the Birmingham campaign was much more than a photo op. Fundamentally, Project C was a \\"withdrawal of consent\\" from the segregationist regime. No regime, King understood, lasts long when people reject its legitimacy. In the campaign's many phases--the sit-ins, boycotts, marches, jailings, and eventually the occupation of downtown--activists refused to play by segregationist rules. Yes, the photo was dramatic. But without everything else, it would have revealed little more than one nasty man's meanness and temper. Oh, yes: Why no word about King's iconic \\"Letter From Birmingham Jail\\"?<br /><br />I also wonder about your account of the Impressionists. You depict them as renegades who snubbed the Salon in order to display their work in their own shows. But that's not quite right. They pursued the Salon, again and again. And when Manet got in, his work created a buzz. Granted it was a negative buzz--but people were talking. Later, when the Impressionists held their own show, they benefitted from the advance PR.<br /><br />And why the sneering attack on the Hotchkiss School? You argue--with no evidence whatsoever--that its small classes \\"so plainly make its students worse off.\\" Huh? Parents send kids there, you say, because they \\"fell into the trap\\" of assuming that \\"the kinds of things that wealth can buy translate into real-world advantages.\\" Seduced by Hotchkiss' gorgeous campus and amenities, you say, parents spend big bucks and get those awful small classes. Malcolm, get a grip. Have you ever taught a class? I don't mean standing in the front of a vast auditorium, but working closely with people, on their terms? Do you know what happens when students gather around a Harkness Table? Think back to your days at the University of Toronto. Do you remember seminar classes, with a dozen students? Those seminars can be amazing. Where is your evidence that small classroom conversations fail? You don't have any because it doesn't exist.<br /><br />You say bigger classes have greater diversity. But large numbers don't always produce diverse, open-minded discussion. A class of 20 or 30 often explores fewer ideas than a class of 12. It depends on how engaged the students are, how challenging the culture. If you think diverse expression comes from students with different life experiences, consider that Hotchkiss students come from 28 countries and most of the states of the U.S. Yes, it's elite--and rich. But Hotchkiss alsooffers generous scholarships. Some 37 percent of all students are on financial aid, with an average grant of $32,500.<br /><br />One more thing. Why sneer at the Steinway pianos at Hotchkiss? If you had written about Hotchkiss in Outliers, you would have extolled the virtues of making instruments available to young musicians. You celebrated Bill Gates's unusual access to computers in high school; why not celebrate the future maestro's access to great instruments? After all, don't musicians need 10,000 hours of practice too?<br /><br />THE LOGIC<br /><br />Your logic regularly misses the mark. You often state (or imply) that X causes Y when you see X and Y together. But of course, the world is never so simple. Lots of variables swirl around all the X's and Y's of all stories. You need to define the variables--and then use consistent definitions. Then you need to \\"isolate the variables\\" to show which ones exert more force than others.<br /><br />Take the story of Caroline Sachs. You argue that she made a mistake in choosing Brown over Maryland because she struggled with core science courses at Brown. Why not star at a lesser school, you say, instead of struggling at a great school? Why not, in your terms, be a big fish in a small pond rather than a small fish in a big pond? Your charts show that students in the top decile of a number of schools - public and private - publish more papers and win more honors than students lower in the class rankings. Let's put aside your own incredulity at the fact that non-Ivies do good work. Your point is that middling achievement at Brown \\"made her feel stupid,\\" damaged her self-esteem, killed her love of science.<br /><br />Maybe, but I'm not persuaded. Let's start with definitions. True, Brown is a more elite school, but that hardly makes it a bigger pond.  Strictly by the numbers, Maryland is more than four times bigger than Brown (26,000 to 6,000 students). I know you mean Brown has a \\"bigger\\" status, but this can be confusing.<br /><br />I asked an official at Maryland for his perspective. He started with the numbers:<br /><br />\\"Maryland is a much bigger pond than Brown. We have more than 5,000 natural sciences/computer science/math majors and 3,800 engineering majors. Brown University's total enrollment in all disciplines is 6,100.  [Note: Brown graduates about 600 science students a year.] Therefore we have many more STEM fish than Brown has undergraduates.<br /><br />\\"We also have many big fish, earning distinctions like Goldwater Scholarships, other national fellowships, etc.  Such outcomes are not the province of the Ivies alone. In fact, publicly available data on Goldwater Scholarship Winners over the last 5 years - University of Maryland 14, Brown University 3. Even if you compensate for total undergraduate enrollment (our undergrad student body is four times that of Brown), we are still ahead.  And both schools only get 4 nominations each year.\\"<br /><br />OK, maybe you didn't mean big and small pond in such a literal way. You were referring to Brown's \\"big pond\\" status and Maryland's \\"small pond\\" status, right? But that's not quite fair either. Sure, Ivy admissions are absurdly competitive, state universities less so. But does that mean their STEM classes require less work? Not necessarily.<br /><br />\\"A student who struggles with early science classes at Brown will also struggle with early science classes at Maryland. In fact, it may initially be even more difficult for such a student at a flagship university, as introductory classes tend to be larger, and students who are struggling may not stand out as much. However, I suspect Brown's introductory courses are fairly large as well.<br /><br />\\"However, she may find herself among more female science and engineering majors than she would see at Brown, and this might encourage her persistence and success!\\"<br /><br />By your own account, Caroline took too many classes and extracurriculars in her freshman year. And she did get a B-minus in the critical chemistry class. Who says struggling with a difficult subject should drive her away? If she were a true David, why shouldn't she face those tough challenges? Won't that sharpen her resolve?<br /><br />Since you like anecdotes, let me tell you one. When I was a student at Vanderbilt I had a friend named Tom who desperately wanted to be a doctor. But he struggled, semester after semester. So he started taking liberal arts courses and enjoyed himself for the first time. But he still had the science bug. So after Vanderbilt, he took pre-med classes at Millsaps College. He excelled, went to med school, and eventually did a residency at Vanderbilt. You might say he made it by going to a small pond. But he excelled in both the big and small ponds. Years later, he looked back with happiness that he had learned how to struggle. He felt \\"stupid\\" sometimes, sure. But he persevered, looked for different routes to his goal. He didn't succeed right away. But he found his own path. Maybe that approach would work for Caroline too.<br /><br />If Caroline really loves science--really loves science--don't you think she'll find her place? Maybe Maryland would have been a better choice, maybe not. But she doesn't need to take a straight line to her goal. In fact, a meandering route, with some wrecks along the way, might make her a more complete human being.<br /><br />Doesn't a college education mean more than grades and job prospects? In one of your most moving sections, you describe the courage of Andre Trocme against the Nazis. Why did he settle in this remote village in the first place? Not because of his job prospects, but because his pacifism isolated him from the French Protestant Church. If he had cared about conventional success, he wouldn't have taken this route. But he wanted to live a decent life.<br /><br />Won't Caroline live a good life if she pursues what she loves, regardless of where she finishes in her class and what accolades she receives? If she's smart, hard-working, and open-minded, she'll find her sweet spot. It's when we try to game the system that we lose out on what matters.<br /><br />For such a contrarian, you seem to accept some tired old ideas about how education works. In a Gladwell school, teachers stand in the front of the room and tell their kids what they need to learn, then solicit responses from the kids. You quote, approvingly, a teacher fretting about students \\"talking about something that has nothing to do with what they're supposed to be working on.\\" Ah, so everyone in your big classes should all focus on the teacher in the front of the room. In a Gladwell school, success is measured by tests and awards, rather than the joint exploration of ideas. This is a sad, impoverished ideal of education, Malcolm. I suggest you put Ken Robinson's The Element on your reading list.<br /><br />You take logical leaps all over the book. Consider the story of Jay Freireich, the doctor who fought to provide more aggressive treatment for leukemia. But your explanation--that his unhappy childhood gave him the determination to fight the good fight-- is facile at best. All our joys and sorrows make us who we are. But without some kind of inspiration--which he got from his family physician and high school physics teacher--his rough childhood might have broken him. So maybe it was the nurturers who gave Freireich his fire, not the tragedies of his childhood. It's hard to say. Lots of people with rough childhoods fail to persevere; lots of people with happy childhoods do persevere.<br /><br />So here's another logical problem. You depict Freireich as an SOB, a tyrant with \\"no patience, no gentleness.\\" In fact, one colleague remembers him as \\"a giant, in the back of the room, yelling and screaming.\\" You call him a David. But is he? Freireich started out a David, for sure. But after he was inspired by others and enrolled at a great state university, he turned into a Goliath. Thank goodness. It took a Goliath to fight the hospital's approach to leukemia treatment. But that doesn't fit your neat interpretation.<br /><br />Let's look at one more definitional problem. In your account of the Nazi's bombings of London, you note that Winston Churchill and others feared mass panic. But instead, London responded with bravado. Why? The psychologist J.T. MacCurdy argues that those who survive such attacks fall into two groups: the \\"near misses\\" and the \\"remote misses.\\" The near misses, MacCurdy says, \\"feel the blast, they see the destruction,\\" and experience trauma. The remote misses don't experience the horror first hand, avoid the trauma, and respond with a strange sense of invincibility. Fair enough. Experiencing something awful affects people more than hearing about it.<br /><br />Then you apply this typology to the experience of Fred Shuttlesworth, Martin Luther King's associate who fought for civil rights in Birmingham. You describe the awful day when Klansmen bombed his home. The force of the blast blew windows a mile away. Shuttlesworth was calm. \\"The Lord has protected me,\\" he said. \\"I am not injured.\\" Malcolm, you call this \\"a classic remote miss\\" because he wasn't maimed or badly injured. But he was there, Malcolm--right in the middle of the bombed-out house.<br /><br />Maybe Shuttlesworth maintained his equanimity because he had already endured so much violence and hatred and survived it? Shuttlesworth and other civil rights heroes knew they faced mortal danger every day. They faced that danger squarely because the cause was too great not to do so.<br /><br />Maybe something else was involved. Maybe Shuttlesworth found comfort in his faith and in the love of his family and friends? Maybe that faith--a belief in God's undying love and mercy--sustained him. Consider also Dr. King How did he maintain his serenity and humor when a woman stabbed and nearly killed him at a book signing? How did Pope John Paul maintain his spirit when he was shot at St. Peter's Square? I would submit that their faith gave them a heart that helped them overcome the tragedies of life.<br /><br />STYLE<br /><br />Now for a few quibbles about style ...<br /><br />I love simple writing. When exploring complex ideas, breaking points down into small pieces makes sense. When a complex term comes along--an idea from scholarly research, for example--it makes sense to define it slowly. Let the reader absorb each piece fully. Let the reader build knowledge, block by block.<br /><br />This, I must say, you do well. You never--ever--get stuck in the quicksand of arcane, abstract, complex verbiage. I remember when I read your explanation of the \\"strength of weak ties,\\" an idea that a sociologist named Mark Granovetter developed. I was thrilled because you took this obscure but important concept and you made it simple and compelling for a broad audience. You deserve credit for encouraging journalists of all kinds to explain complex ideas well.<br /><br />Now, though, you sometimes write like a kindergarten teacher. Your leading questions are cloying. Your use of italics to emphasize points already made well is insulting. Your use of \\"we\\"--as in, \\"Giants are not what we think they are,\\" \\"We think of underdog victories as improbable events,\\" \\"We think of things as helpful that actually aren't\\"--not only grates but sets up straw men. Language matters.<br /><br />With these approaches, I think you mean well. So I was even more annoyed with your snide comments. In describing a Harvard student's move away from the sciences, you say: \\"Harvard cost the world a physicist and gave the world another lawyer.\\" I have no love of lawyers, but it's a cheap shot--and, in your own reckoning, some lawyers are decent people, like David Boies. And maybe--just maybe--the Harvard student wasn't cut out for science. And are all lawyers really so bad? What about your hero David Boies?<br /><br />It's also hard to stomach the easy omniscience of your style. You say Jay Freirich--couldn't remember the name of the woman who raised him \\"because everything from those years was so painful.\\" Maybe, but it sounds facile. And it's unnecessary.<br /><br />MOVING FORWARD<br /><br />So far I have outlined problems with framing your argument, making theory simplistic, using terminology imprecisely, failing to offer evidence (or ignoring contrary evidence), and creating a simplistic world with your kindergarten style.<br /><br />But the problem is deeper--and I can explain it best with reference to your book Blink.<br /><br />Recall your enthralling account of fake kouros, a marble Greek statue said to date back to the sixth century before Christ. The Getty Museum paid millions to acquire the piece after using the latest scientific analyses to vet its authenticity. But then art historians had a visceral reaction--what one called \\"intuitive repulsion\\"--to the statue. For reasons they could not articulate right away, the statue didn't look right. It looked too \\"fresh.\\" In concluding your discussion, you celebrate the power of the \\"blink\\" judgment. \\"Just as we can teach ourselves to think logically and deliberately,\\" you say, \\"we can also teach ourselves to make better snap judgments.\\"<br /><br />In that rendering, it sounds like magic. But in Outliers, you get closer to the point: it's all about experience. Those artists could tell the statue was fake because they were immersed, deeply, in art and archaeology. They lived and breathed the world of antiquity. They understood not just surface appearances, but the deeper essence of the thing. That--not just facile understanding of definitions and rules and patterns--is where real understanding comes from.<br /><br />And that's what you're missing. Over the years, you have become entranced with quirky \\"rules,\\" \\"theories,\\" and \\"patterns\\" that explain complex realities of life. But you never go deep. You don't spend significant time with your subjects. You find a great parable and match it with a fun theory. When the theory doesn't fit the parable, you ignore the misfit. Lacking deep knowledge of any subject, you cannot respond critically. And lacking the scientist's respect for difficult problems and disdain of simple answers, you skate forward to new parables and fun theories.<br /><br />So, Malcolm, I'm afraid that we cannot accept this manuscript, as is, for publication. I realize that it would sell millions of copies. But in this age of ebooks, we publishers have a challenge. When we take on a major new work, we need to make sure it meets our highest standards. Anyone can patch together a collection of anecdotes and research notes. We need to expect more.<br /><br />Please consider our ideas for sharpening the book's focus and strengthening its research and argumentation. If you are committed to producing the best book possible, we will be too.<br /><br />If you want to pass on our offer, you might consider taking the manuscript to Little, Brown. They might publish it...r /><br />I asked an official at Maryland for his perspective. He started with the numbers:<br /><br />\\"Maryland is a much bigger pond than Brown.

B00BEIYMIS|4.0|Modern horror films just aren't that scary anymore.  They rely on jump scares, gore, and horny teenagers.  Sure, this started quite a while back; but the films coming out today take themselves way too seriously to even have that \\"camp\\" factor that makes them so enjoyable.  Make no mistake: there is no camp about THE CONJURING.  There is also almost no gore, surprisingly few jump scares, and nary a bikini-clad coed to be seen.  Instead, we have those bits 'n pieces that make a truly great horror film: tension, suspense, and something actually at stake.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the Parron family, who move into a secluded country house that, unbeknownst to them, has a sordid, violent history.  Things start happening that very first night, and slowly escalate so badly that wife Carolyn invites the Warrens to investigate.  Ed and Lorraine Warren are the seventies' version of ghost hunters, who've seen and documented demonic possession.  They immediately recognize the evil in the Parron household...and are also forced to admit that their presence may be too little, too late.<br /><br />Ultimately, THE CONJURING boils down to a possession film, and as such does fall short of the \\"greatness\\" mark; the only truly great possession film I can think of is THE EXORCIST (although I'll admit, I tend to dislike most possession premises).  CONJURING's conclusion, too, embodies the low-blow theatrics that the rest of the film shirks.  So that's a bit of a shame, that it doesn't end on a strong note.  But getting there...oh boy.  The film truly revolves around atmosphere, using shadows, sound effects, and solid acting to slowly ramp up the tension.  The four adult leads (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, and especially Lili Taylor) are fantastic, though it's the child actors who truly shine (perhaps because it's so hard to find good child acting in horror films; that's one improvement modern horror films have, but it's a very small edge).  The script is solid for the most part, and the direction/camerawork are effective.  James Wan has delivered a solid, truly unsettling horror film.  He may have started the SAW franchise (though the first one, the only one which Wan directed, is actually a darn good movie), but he's been spending his time making up for all the lackluster sequels that film has inspired.  THE CONJURING is a film that can please on almost all levels: people who simply like to get a good scare in with their friends will be satisfied, as will those who prefer a horror film with some depth and lasting effect.  It's not a classic-in-the-making, perhaps, and it's not great, but it's pretty darn good, and pretty darn scary, and those are rare in horror cinema these days.r the most part, and the direction/camerawork are effective.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|OK, so it was a small tree..well, actually a shrub but let me tell you, this little sharpener works. A few swipes on the carbide, a few swipes on the ceramic and viola, you're good to go. I had some knives so dull they wouldn't cut bread. I worked on 'em a bit and now they cut paper..but keep it quiet 'cause the gummint finds out that sharp knives can be injurious to your health and they'll leave you nothing but a butter knife.<br /><br />PS: The pointy thing is for serrated blades..havn't tried that yet.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I waited for months for this book.  I completely adored the first two.  Introduced many friends to the Divergent/Insurgent books I loved so much.  I was so excited for this book that I started reading directly after it was delivered to my kindle app.  For one thing, the tone of the third installment is different than its predecessors,to me it doesn't flow as well.  The storyline from the beginning was not as interesting; quick changes in the story line that didn't make sense and a lot of waffling.  Truly, the only thing that kept me reading to the end was closure.  I had originally thought the Divergent trilogy would trump the hunger games trilogy and join the ranks of Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Legend/prodigy etc. in my favorite fiction books.  Needless to say this didn't happen.  As previously stated by another reviewer, if you liked the first two books leave it to your imagination to complete the third installment.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The story was different but basically predictable. I liked the epilogue though where you found out the if but when's.
B008MM9630|5.0|i love this game:) but i will give you a hint:) dont use your crystals to much because its hard to get more:) but other than that its a realy good game:)
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|This movie didn't make it in the theaters, maybe because of people like me who waits for it to come out in video so we can relax and watch it on our 60 inch high def flat screens. There is a lot of action in the movie to keep you on the edge of your seat. The Gould were great and Jeff Bridges character was outrageous. I also loved the idea of the avatars which made it kind of believable. You have to see this movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried three or four other apps but this one gives me all the info I need in the easiest way to use it. Simple, accurate and clear.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Wow! I loved it! If you're a fan of Transformers then you should invest in this movie. The critics may have bombed it, but what do they know. This movie has constant action it doesn't slow down and the special effects are great! I highly recommend Pacific Rim.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is good for homework I don't have to carry a lot of books adorned school all day and to home every night
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|My husband and I couldn't get passed the first 20 minutes of this movie.<br />Terrible graphics, acting, and dialogue.<br />Amazed that this has 4 stars.... Very disappointed and would like my money back.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It does what I want it to - protects Kindle from every day use.  From previous reviews, I knew it was nothing fancy, but it works for me.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|This book grabbed me halfway through the first chapter when he described his descend to succumbing to the 'flu'.<br /><br />Now I've worked with a lot of guys over the years, been in the military and was a bartender for a long time. You hear things, see things and believe me, this is the closest book I've read from a male POV that actually sounded like a male wrote the damn thing! I am so tired of reading the male POV and the male still thinks like a chic, talks like a chic but just curses more. Not with this one, no way--Emma Chase does 'man thinking' justice!<br /><br />What I loved the most was the candid talk about sex, getting a 'job' and describe in detail what he liked, and for once a girls' butt was not violated! I am also tired of reading about that too, go figure a book from the male POV and it had nothing to do with anal sex, ANOTHER thank you to Emma Chase!<br /><br />The scene set up may take a bit to get used to, and my best advice for those having a hard time reading it, is think, \\"Ferris Bueller\\". You know, how he is in the movie but talks to you at the same time...well this is the same thing. Could be confusing at first, but I loved it.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is a good, easy and fun read. In my opinion its the best in its genre for light reads. It's not life changing but definitely uplifting. It is completely worth it if you can catch it on sale. But you must try a sample at the very least!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book, a lot of twists in the story line so it kept you guessing the whole time.<br />I can't wait for the movie.  I would recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was introduced to the first book in this series by the LA girly book club on meet up so I came in without expectations. After I flew through that book, I needed more! And there it was - 4 more books! Hugh is gifted! The characters are fully developed, the new world believable, and the writing superb! Don't waste your time buying one book after another, support each series from the beginning and you will be glad you did. I'm on to the next one. Keep creating Hugh!
B005KDWUG4|4.0|I very much liked the songs and location, however I thought the audio was not up to the Blu-Ray production I was expecting.
B005LAII80|2.0|I did enjoy the movie, but my review here is not meant to judge the movie as good or bad or worth watching. You can read all of that on other movie review sites.  I just wanna judge it on its 3D quality because I think most people that already bought this movie or are considering buying it are doing so because they want the 3D feature.<br /><br />I love 3D movies and own quite a few of them. I don't think this one is worth the extra $. I don't understand how some other reviewers think that it's on par with Avatar. If you use Avatar and other IMAX 3D movies as a benchmark, this movie is nowhere near it. The 3D effects just don't pop out of your TV screen. So, save your hard-earned $ and go for the 2D version if you really like this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app isn't just up to date with the font but it is extraordinary convenient if you want to learn how to process a problem. In conclusion GET THIS APP! (Written by a 10 year old)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game for hours and never get bored or tired.  Best solitary app I found for the kindle fire.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I liked this movie. I thought it had an interesting point of view and I even liked how it ended.
B008602KQI|5.0|One might think this movie does not capture the emotion of reality that the books express. Well, I do not have time to read the books so I will appreciate the theme of survival of the fittest presented in science fiction and be done with that. Good movie that kept me gripping my seat with anticipation. To be quite frank critics are like whiners they never seem to want to give credit to originality and the Hunger Games brought an original idea to create a dialogue that most WROL and apocalyptic preppers are constantly thinking about. This knowledge of survival is bread in our own DNA and the sweetness of this movie is the message that resistance is beautiful. The alliances and mercy that formulated the factions<br /> in this game explain how good is always trying to overcome evil. the evil that comes from selfishness, pride and greed.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|Not true to the book but still very enjoyable. The characters were well portrayed and the acting was quite good. I would definitely watch it again.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I LOVED the first two books in this series!  I have read and reread them and simply couldn't get enough. I actually preordered this book  which is something I rarely ever do. I was expecting it to be mind-blowing...  and it was, just in the worst possible way.<br /><br />I wish I would have listened to all the other reviewers, but I just had to find out for myself...<br /><br />I was expecting to devour this book, but even from the beginning something was off.  The storyline took a weird, almost maize runner meets the Truman show turn, and I just couldn't get into it.  I also didn't like how the POV kept changing... (I get it now)  but the end is what really ruined it for me. I know I'm not alone with this feeling.<br /><br />I didn't expect rainbows and butterflies or a fairytail ending.. I would have been surprised if it had ended without some type of tragedy.  But what the hell??  Was that really it?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't, by any means, think that the author is a bad writer.  But how can I (why would I) ever read anything of hers in the future?<br /><br />I know this book is only $6.99, but don't do it, it's just not worth your time. A better idea would be to write your own book 3!  And when you're done, send it to me so hopefully I can erase the memory of this one!!
0312430000|5.0|Loved the book. Very useful, practical knowledge and amazing how insightful Gawande is. Although the author is a surgeon, this is definitely a book for those outside the medical profession as well.
B004RFYEEC|3.0|The music is generally 4-5 stars. Let's get that out of the way. Anyone familiar with these recordings knows that most of the discs are snippets of takes and tests of Brain's ever-changing ideas. Disc 1 is an assembly of these snippets into what SMiLE might sound like if it were completed. My issue with the product is that three of the five discs arrived with digital clicks thanks to thoughtless packaging. The discs rub/scrape against the backing of the case. The result is a travesty! Hey Capitol/EMI: send out a survey and ask people if they want damaged goods. I would bet that no one would respond that it is ok to receive damaged discs. I forked out $130 for my set and was assuming that I would receive a pristine product. I was mistaken.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Life is messy.  Things rarely turn out the way you planned.  Veronica Roth stays true to this reality in the final installment of the Divergent series.  I love her (and sort of hate her) for that. ;o)
0744014956|3.0|The guide is just OK, nothing special at all.  I've purchased other collector's edition guides in the past that at least gave you something, either pics or lithographs, in game items, etc...  This is just a guide, nothing more and nothing less.  The guide itself also has quite a few errors (car descriptions, misspellings).  I don't regret my purchase as I like the look but this is one definite case where you get more and better info from the web than from the guide.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, thank you Amazon for getting  this game.  I play it on Facebook and wanted to play it on my Kindle fire HD.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|All I can say is that this game would not run on my first generation Kindle Fire. I deleted it. Since it was free it was not a big problem. Perhaps it would run better on a newer version with a faster processor.
006202406X|1.0|This was a horrible way to end a book.  I hate it when writers change the writing style of a book at the end of the series.  To write from both Tris and Tobias POV was a DEAD giveaway and stupid thing to do.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book or anything by this author again!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the final book in this series, it was worth the wait. It did not disappoint at all
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game glad it finally came to Kindle. Bigger screen and easy-to-use. Amazing how many people play that you would never known
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing!!! While of course I wish it ended differently, still mind blowing! Read the final book to an awesome series!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I chose it by recomendation, but I think by myself thats is a very funny way to learn how to be careful and the most important: the accidents ALWAYS can be prevent  !!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of those games my kid was playing I picked it up & it has become very addicting & fun to play.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Fun, but not as good as some of the other match three games.  No explanation about  how to use the stuff that you can get with points. Played for a long time before i figured out that i could use points to advance levels.
B00A287PG2|2.0|This book makes clear that there is no such thing as McKinsey.  It changes so quickly that to work there is to touch a moving train.  First it's all strategy and no numbers from Harvard Business School, then computers and engineers from all Ivy schools, then scientists and experts of any sex, color or nationality are fine.  This is what is known in the trade as dancing between the raindrops.  And the storm is getting stronger.  It's important to note that as the focus shifts, the people change as well.<br /><br />In this respect the book was an eye opener and expanded impressions I gathered from my employment there.  There wasn't much in the book about how consultants actually work or what the day to day work is like.  The perspective of the writer seems to be to blend hero worship with hero dislike.  The result is a mishmash of mischaracterizations, probably of little interest to outsiders.<br /><br />Here is a little peek from my years.  You can compare this with what you find in the book to see if it expands your understanding.<br /><br />I entered the \\"Firm\\" as an associate in the early to mid 1970's, a time of turmoil outside and weakness within.  As the director of the Washington D.C. office of a minor competitor, I had recently beat McKinsey out of two prestigious assignments in real estate, a field where McKinsey had no credible capability but wanted to establish a foothold.  I was also a consultant to the National Academy of Sciences in new town development feasibility.  But my employer was sinking fast.<br /><br />In an initial interview, John Garrity, managing director in Washington predicted that I would be attacked by others in the \\"Firm\\" since I insisted on working at least ½ time in real estate and since I was being brought in by an unpopular partner who was essentially banished to the London England office.  Nobody made employment contract demands with McKinsey.  You were supposed to be glad for any offer of employment.  This was, after all, the leading fad employer of choice.  We agreed that I would work out of New York.  I was not loved there either.<br /><br />Young college graduates often mistake placement for achievement.  You're supposed to be special if you work in New York.  Or employment at McKinsey is a putative sign of achievement.  These assume that placement in a picture actually signifies something, that without this you have nothing.<br /><br />Depak Chopra gives a lesson about the nature of a lump of gold.  If it is turned into a ring, is used for a tooth or becomes part of a party mask it is always just gold.  Employment in a place might eventually assist you in growth, but you're still you.  You will become actually aware of this when you leave these places.  The real you needs to have the right brand of horse power to succeed.<br /><br />Soon after being hired I met Marvin Bower when he held a greeting session for new associates.  I can still remember his large red nose, slicked back hair and pin striped Capone era suit draped over his huge frame (look for it on Wikipedia), very old fashioned.  When he assured us that this employment would not lead to wealth, we all looked at the wall in despair.<br /><br />The idea of a hair shirt job of service to large corporations wasn't what we had in mind while grinding through our Ivy League MBA's.  Ron Daniel, the then New York managing director thought that associates ran to work each morning.  It was more like looking around for a while and then running for the door.  A component of employment therefore involved pretending that you believed the company orthodoxy.<br /><br />Bower also emphasized that this was essentially a word and logic shop that had little use for computers. When he said \\"There are no formulae at the top,\\" I wondered where I would fit in.  I was an engineering and MBA finance grad with a heavy career background in computer modeling.<br /><br />The engagements to which I was assigned mostly had similar characteristics.  A conclusion was formed almost immediately followed by months of shaping arguments and data for selling the conclusion to the client, followed by an illusion of verbalization session presented with an overhead projector.  The client had no opportunity to preview the analysis.  The actual analysis was the sort of weak stuff you would expect from liberal arts graduates with business school degrees, the McKinsey specialty of that era.<br /><br />In one assignment with the British House of Commons, for instance, we were to determine the feasibility of building a new city near Gatwick Airport.  The main analytical team didn't know how to construct a spreadsheet with discounted cash flow, an essential feature of this type of assignment.  In another, Certainteed Products wanted to know if they should continue with the development of a resort community that involved high pressure phone sales.  When I suggested to the partner that the McKinsey cash flow analysis was flawed by failing to distinguish between cash and installment sales, the response was \\"Shut up, this division is immoral and should be closed anyway!\\"<br /><br />The worst study I witnessed was for the State of New York.  Many students were defaulting on student loans.  What could they do?  The answer was obvious; be stricter with the loans, monitor grades, etc.  But this would violate the liberal nature of this team.  The result was to tell them after $50 thousand or so that we determined they had a loan default problem and we needed another hundred grand to figure it out.  They were not impressed.<br /><br />The big one for me was Sea Pines, a developer of high end southern U.S. resort properties.  We were to determine the financial feasibility of Brandermill, their first primary home community located in suburban Richmond Virginia.  A retired Supreme Court justice owned the land.<br /><br />The rest of the team quickly but informally conceded primarily control of the analysis to me since this was my specialty.  After the first week I determined that for Brandermill to break even, everybody who would buy a house in the Richmond Virginia metropolitan area for the foreseeable future would have to buy it here.  This development was headed down fast and hard.  For a new community to have a 10 percent market capture would be a fabulous success.  110% was ridiculous.<br /><br />For the next three months, the report was shaped and rewritten many times.  Sea Pines had recently been one of the leading employers of graduating students at Harvard Business School.  The people running the place were classmates of others on our McKinsey team.  This was supposed to be a white shoe rubber stamp of a Sea Pines expansion into the primary home arena.  Instead they were headed for insolvency.<br /><br />Everybody associated with real estate from the senior director down to the lowest research person was released from he \\"Firm,\\" although not necessarily at the same time.  \\"McKinsey's clients don't go out of business, we make them better, stronger.\\"  The underwriters sniffed this all out, analyzed all of the Sea Pines developments and liquidated the company.  It's all on line for you to see.<br /><br />I was informally advised that I might possibly be able to become part of an analytical team in Tanzania.  I declined and took a job with a company that previously built the Pan Am building over Grand Central Station.  One of their clients was Aristotle Onassis.  This was REAL real estate.  Snakes in the parking lot in Africa had no appeal for me.<br /><br />The net from all of this is that the idea of having generalists floating around in multiple fields is ridiculous, as I saw in real estate.  All of the other consulting companies I worked in did a better job with real estate than McKinsey.  The people might not have been as smart, but they had more depth from specialization.  The idea that time at McKinsey leads to executive success is at odds with the facts.  A quick scan of the McKinsey alumni directory will reveal that while there are notably successful alums, most are mediocre and many never had another job.  The idea that there is a tremendous supporting network of alums is another myth.  In the 40 or so years since I left, not a single person from McKinsey or its alums has ever contacted me for anything.<br /><br />At this point, a career in Silicon Valley holds much more promise.  At least if you're going to bust your hump for an employer, it should also hold the prospect of a path to riches.  Recent graduates from prestige schools are preferred simply because they are young, dumb and full of............. well, you know.  The kind of bookworm students who typically excel in these colleges have mainly spent their early lives perfecting their appeal to little old ladies, feminized males and eccentric loner professors.  The resulting social retardation persists about two years into an early career, which is about as much time as a good percentage of associates spends at \\"The Firm.\\"e first week I determined that for Brandermill to break even, everybody who would buy a house in the Richmond Virginia metropolitan area for the foreseeable future would have to buy it here.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that I can play Candy Crush on my Kindle Fire now!  Now I can take it with me where ever I go.
006202406X|1.0|Now that I have given this book such a bad rating, I feel that I need to explain myself.<br /><br />So Allegiant recounts Tris, Four/Tobias and company's struggle to reconcile what lies beyond the gates of their city with the mayhem that the downfall of the factions has reeked on post apocalyptic Chicago.<br /><br />I have never said this before, but I absolutely would unread this book if I could.<br /><br />I was a fan of Divergent, a little less impressed with Insurgent, but still definitely looking forward to reading Allegiant. However, from the predictability to the ad nauseum usage of the words \\"serum,\\" \\"hem,\\" \\"belt loop,\\" and \\"gene\\" to name a few--I couldn't stand this book. Roth's incessant switching from Tobias' to Tris' POV was jarring, confusing and essentially served only to slow down Allegiant's pacing. The flimsy, ill-explained plot twists inspired far more questions than answers. Also, after getting to know the characters so well in the first two books, I felt like both of our protagonists Tris and Four temporarily (conveniently?) lost their minds at certain points of the book only to make us read about another failed mini-revolution or botched recon mission. Overall, this book felt underdeveloped, weak, and was driven by half-thought out, contrived plot elements that could be anticipated hundreds of pages before they actually occurred. Also, why is water on the cover? Did I miss the faction insignia tie in?<br /><br />Lastly, is the ending a surprise? Why is one character robbed of the chance for redemption? When what could be entirely expected happens, it isn't surprising, tragically beautiful or poignant. Also, was the whole mission that the gang was going for even worthwhile? It made no sense to dispense the memory serum on ANYONE. Also, Evelyn's shift was so contrived and unbelievable.<br /><br />All in all, Allegiant features an alarming amount of lazy and haphazard storytelling, and essentially--for me--ruined what was at least a compelling YA series.eries.
B00A44HRG2|2.0|This app is pretty cool. The first star that I took away was for the SLOWNESS!!! Very slow and needs to gain some speed. The second star that I took away was the camera. The cameras are kinda slow. It takes a while to catch up with a person taking a few steps. And the last star taken away was for all the time that you wait to see the views, the cameras turn black and won't let you see anything.<br /><br />  But this app is also cool to see some sweet views.  :)
1603429999|4.0|I found the book on the recommended list and I liked how it was set up and how when you learn a new pattern, its made into a small and cute project.  Meaning best of both worlds! Learning something and having it be cute all at the same time! :)
B003M70O5O|5.0|From the moment I watched the first episode of Sons of Anarchy I was hooked!  The actors fit their roles perfectly. The writers really do an amazing job at keeping you interested. I truly hope that this show will stay on the air for years to come!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is my first review and I am moved to write this because of how disappointing this book was. I don't read to be depressed or sad and that is exactly the emotion this book leaves me with. I have never been so disappointed in an ending as I am with this series. I was so excited for this book and then to see it on screen but now I have zero desire to see the movie. I suggest if the movie producers want a success they demand a less depressing ending to the story! I will forget I read this and have my own ending.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|All I can really say is, wow. What you have given us is such an amazing experience. I found myself rooting for favorites in the story crippled and littered with tragedy, desperation, and triumph on every page. The first book in a long while to make me feel for the characters. Truly an amazing read.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|I loved this movie.  One of my top ten of all time.  First I rented this movie and loved it so much that I bought it.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are outstanding.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Gets me up in the morning!<br />I like that it starts out soft and gradually gets louder. Doesn't take much to wake me up.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is beyond addictive. Generally, gameloft annoys me. But this was quite good.  Very simple, yet challenging. Playing a funny minion has been...fun. I just wish there were an easier way to get coins.
006202406X|4.0|I know people have been reacting negatively to this book and its ending. Overall though I felt like this book was well written and yes the ending could have been written better or even justified but it's not our ending to write it was Veronica Roths.Not every book can have a happy ending and Veronica Roth wrote the book the way she wanted to. If you don't like the ending then make your own ending don't read Allegiant. Even if Veronica had written a happy ending people would have still complained that she was not edgy enough no one person can make everyone happy. Everyone has their own vision of how this story should have ended but not everyone can get their way. The decision of the ending is up to the author they are the ones who spent the time to make the characters and develop them if you don't like the book make your own ending don't hate the author they just did what they thought they should.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|For anyone expecting the same old melodic sound from Alter Bridge on this album, skip to track 11 - All Ends Well.  This is the only song that could be a B-side for ABIII or Blackbird.  The rest are fresh, and mostly heavier.  Lover is the exception.  This song is a throwback to The Mayfield Four type of song (that's a good thing).  I have listened through about 15-20 times and my favorites keep changing.  I got chills the first time hearing Cry of Achilles, Calm the Fire, and Fortress.  The only song that had to grow on me was Peace is Broken.  Now that riff is stuck in my head.<br /><br />Hand's down my favorite on this album is Waters Rising. I am a big fan of Tremonti, so this comes as little surprise.  The song itself is a mix of Creed, Tremonti, and AB all rolled into one.  My other favorites on this album are: Cry a River, Calm the Fire, The Uninvited, Bleed It Dry, Farther Than The Sun, Cry of Achilles, Fortress, Lover, Addicted To Pain, All Ends Well, Peace is Broken... wait that's all of them... EXACTLY!<br /><br />This album will not disappoint.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you have some time that needs to be burned, this is the app for you!  Fun, addicting, and really makes the time go by fast.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|You can't go wrong with Black Sabbath, so what's not to love? Ozzy and company have done it again.  Thank you.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Excellent writing, excellent acting of all players (specially Carrie and the daughter of Broody) . I hope this series go forever.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hard to put down. A heart wrenching wonderful story about how peoples lives crossed paths. This should be on everyones reading list.
0545265355|5.0|read the 3 books one after the other -- had a hard time putting them down, but had to sleep sometimes ....
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Such a helpful book! Every couple should read it--good if you're not in a relationship too. CHANGED the way I look at things
B00000I14Z|5.0|I'm not going to repeat all the other accolades for this recording.  It is essential for any jazz library.  It's full of swing, gospel, blues, soul,shuckin' and jiven', testifyin' type music.  This music is the black Amercian experience of 1959... I'm not black but it sure seems to carry all that stuff on its shoulders.  It's got the deep blues of John Lee Hooker, the spirituality of The Staple Singers, and the elegance of Duke Ellington - how's that for a comparison? It also contains the quintessential version of Goodbye Porkpie Hat.  Booker Ervin's solo on that piece with a very expressive &#34;breathy&#34; tenor is unbearably wonderful, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand on end every time I hear it.  Folks, this is one of the most expressive, mood-filled recordings in American music.  It is right up there with Davis' Kind of Blue and Coltrane's A Love Supreme as seminal, must own works of recorded art.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Great show. I'm impressed at their ability to keep the storyline new and interesting after eight years. The ending was great, too. Once again, I eagerly await the next season.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|As the sequel in the first of several books to follow the elegant Beautiful Creatures, this book doesn't propel me on to the next ones. A quality sequel novel ought to have its own distinct presence. Here book two seemed not so meticulously planned out as was book one.
B0007OY2MG|4.0|The delivery was prompt, but the only issue I had was that the case was a little banged up around the edges. The discs themselves are fine though
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|They've done it again! These games just keep getting better.  I've played all of them and this one is my rave.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it is great cause I love to feel like I'm just like everyone one the movie meaning that I'm able to control the robot
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|I always worry that if I get a full album I'll get a few good songs with a lot of filler.  This is not the case with Chvrches.  The Bones of What You Believe is every bit as good as the band's previous material, which is to say awesome.  The album is fantastic from start to finish.  Just get it, you will be glad you did
B005LAII44|5.0|This movie is GREAT! I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more people from the first movie in this (because unlike some others, I really enjoyed the first movie) but this movie surprised me.  I LOVE &#34;THE ROCK&#34; he is awesome and definitely helps to make this movie great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You finally put on it just a nice game to keep your mind working. I love trying to get all the levels
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Now instead of interrupting my shows I can just grab my Kindle Fire HD And find out the Weather, and it was FREE And if it's FREE then it's for me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game, always playing it, on my breaks and lunch hours. I was glad to see that I got to downloaded on my kindle fire
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing this version of solitaire, however, there are too many ad popups. Sometimes, it is difficult to close the ads which is very annoying.
B000002LAC|5.0|Great music, I enjoy this CD thoroughly.  The harmonizing of such musc legends is truly superb.  Play it all the time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a fantastic app! I love it. It helps me a lot since I suck at math. But sometimes it dosnt really work the way I want it to. But overall it is AWESOME!:) :)
B0001CCY7E|5.0|John Barry was a musical genius, the way he can make his music easily transport you to a whole new level of being.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Wonderful story line, love the cast. Worth the money, I watch it pretty much every day! Few scratches on the case, but they work just fine!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|By the middle of the 2nd book I lost some interest. This book jams so much into its pages I feel like it missed its chance to really mean something .... Until the very end where it kind of redeems itself by having a character look inward.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|We couldn't get the movie to work. It would not stream on our Roku device. Did not get to see the movie. The one star is for Amazon.
0545615402|5.0|A friend of mine ordered these books and, as soon as I saw hers, I got on Amazon to order mine. I was NOT disappointed.<br />The cover the three books come in is study, which was nice because that means it won't get damaged easily, unlike some other collectors cases. Each of the three books is delightfully bound in similar material, which is the same as many classic books.<br />J. K. Rowling does a masterful job with the content, as well. The stories and facts in each are extremely entertaining, for both adults and children (I have toddler to teens, and both love them). In addition, in each book there are \\"notes\\" from Harry Potter characters. Those are ADORABLE. From Professor Dumbledore, Harry Potter, Ron Wesley, Hermione Granger...It's a great way to reminisce about the first time you connected with the characters.<br />My one regret is that the Hogwarts Library \\"stamp\\" that is on each book is not of a more realistic, raised material. It looks like it should be.<br />However, if you're a Harry Potter nerd, like me, I know you'll love these books, too.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Rented it for a 30 days. Two days prior to it's expiration date, we try to play it again and it doesn't play. The one star is Amazon. The movie gets four stars.
B00E6887H0|2.0|A little disappointed in the song selection, & lack of slide guitar. I expected a little more energetic performance from a live performance. Oh well.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Casual Vacancy has left me speechless and wrung out. It was challenging to keep all characters straight and to find any to like yet the story was compelling and now that I've finished I keep going over the relationships and actions were never quite what they seemed. Rawlings has achieved something thought provoking.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is a great cd. I've been a fan of korn since I first heard them back in 96. I love this band and they've always had great music. Sure they've had different sounds on some albums, but I enjoyed them all. This one is no different. It has a different feel, but you can tell that it's korn when you listen to it. If you're a fan of korn then this is a must have cd. Get the deluxe version since it is a great price -have seen it for more in stores- and you can get the free shirt (just pay shipping).
B001J710Y8|5.0|The atmosphere created in this film is absolutely stunning.  For my money, a well thought out, creepy, scarey movie.  The acting by Christopher Lee is brilliant.  Well worth seeking out and adding to your collection.
0446556726|5.0|The Black Box by Michael Connelly is another stellar Harry Bosch yarn that puts the indomitable LAPD homicide detective in a race to follow the evidence and solve a twenty-year-old murder before the bureaucracy of his own police department puts a stop to his investigation--and possibly takes his badge. Connelly is a master of pacing and the exciting plot twist; as a reader and fan, I loved being along for the ride. Delving into Bosch's mindset and motivations is something I've always found to be particularly fascinating, and this time around was no disappointment as he reaches back into his past to right a wrong he'd been party to. A thoroughly satisfying read.
006202406X|1.0|This is first book review I have ever written so you can understand how truly unhappy I am with this book.... I eagerly looked forward to its release and read the whole thing in one sitting.... I agree there aren't always perfect endings nor was I really looking for one but this was truly heartbreaking as another review said.  And her death was written almost as a sidebar event.. the whole book really fell apart about half way through.  I am not sure the author knew how to actually do a good job finishing it so she used this as the dramatic out.  I am disappointed that she did this to a character that had gone through so much, suffered so much and then just sacrifices her.... of course perhaps this parallels our society... the bad seems to be outweighing the good more and more each day.... and we all seem to accept it... we could use a Tris!!!!  I don't think I will be reading anything more from this author.... I think she let us all down on this one!!!
B00DQQSD2W|5.0|Just when you think we know everything about a thirty-five year old film, J.W. Rinzler pulls more insights from deep in the archives and delivers them by this enhanced eBook:  Perhaps a perfect delivery method for the expanded content.<br /><br />I purchased the print volume of The Making of Star Wars in 2007 and was very happy with the depth offered. This eBook contains all of that content, both text and photos, that made the original worth owning. If there is one fault with the print volumes, it is the size of the book: Great for photos, but not something you can curl up and read. The Enhanced Edition eBook is much more approachable to read.<br /><br />Having owned the original hard cover edition, I questioned whether the enhanced edition content would be worth the additional buy. After browsing and comparing both versions, I can confirm that the Enhanced Edition is worth the purchase. The video and audio clips are perhaps more interesting than many of the deleted scenes from the recent Blu-Ray releases. All images, including the added ones exclusive to the eBook, can be zoomed in on-often giving a clearer view than was available in the print version.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|***********SPOILER**************<br /><br />You have to be kidding. Seriously. This pathetic ending (killing the character everyone is invested in and reading about to have some kind of happy ending with Four) was a sad attempt by the author to have herself 'set apart from the rest'. A total fail. You didn't have to have the ending be unicorns and rainbows; however, you didn't need to completely ruin the series. Negative stars if I could! Will not waste my time with the movie nor will I read anything else by Ms. Roth.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Good direction, actors were great, awesome story. I was taken in by this movie and it left me with things to think about.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I tried it on my summer gloves first. Got very good results. Next heavier gloves. Initially I didn't think it worked, but on leaf looking ride it worked perfectly. I would recommend this product!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I cant get enough of the cat frying and the Sh**ter's fulll.  We watch this all year long. Grand kids love it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent, but not this book.  This review contains slight spoilers, so if you don't want to know, stop reading now.  Anyway, the dual point of view just didn't work for me, because I didn't find them to be different enough.  I was constantly having to stop and remind myself who was narrating in the current chapter.  When I read a book, I want to lose myself in the book world.  Here, I had to keep thinking and reminding myself, and so was never able to reach that state.  Also, the revelations given in this book also fell flat for me.  With Divergent and Insurgent, I was typically surprised by the revelations given, and there was tension building up to many of those revelations.  Here, information seemed to come out of nowhere without the same climax.  For me, that made the revelations boring.  Finally, there was a little too much death.  So many of the likable characters died over the series.  I think the ending would have been easier to swallow had there been others that survived.  But the combination of all who died was a little too much for me to enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|pros: the game is fun. the characters are cute. the levels are detailed really good.  cons: lags. wont load on tip screen second time. it freezes up when advertisment shows up. advertisments pop up that will not load sometimes. overall, its a good game but needs to be worked on a little bit more on freezing up.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|This is a great book for anyone new to the Tudor period or a seasoned reader such as myself.  I enjoyed having all of his queens in one book, and seeing the progress of this &#34;married&#34; life.  An easy read and an awesome reference.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's both addicting and mesmerizing I will never be able to stop playing it. It makes me feel like a little kid again.
B001V7P2MM|5.0|Woodstock really doesn't need a review,  If your into the 60's rock and roll music of all the great legends and would like to see the most notorious and awesome concert of all time and on blueray this is a must have in your video collection.

140006922X|1.0|If others bought this book as I did partially to spite Fox News for that horrible interview Lauren Green gave the author, then Green should get a percentage of Reza Aslan's profits. In the interview, Reza Aslan claimed he was a \\"scholar of religions with four degrees, including one in the New Testament, and a PhD in the History of Religions.\\" However, his PhD is NOT in History, but in Sociology, which he got at UC Santa Barbara; his dissertation was a 140 page sociological study of \\"Global Jihadism as a Transnational Movement.\\" His two other degrees (not three) are a masters in Divinity and a masters in Fiction. At UC Riverside, he is an associate professor of Creative Writing of which Zealot must be an example.  I really wanted to like this book, but the more I read, the more I doubted the author's honesty. Major claims are supported by little proof. Aslan claims the Romans only crucified seditionists. Since both Suetonius and Plutarch record Julius Caesar crucifying pirates, I wanted see what Roman law Aslan was quoting. But he pointed out no law or ancient source. In his odd endnotes, he refers the reader to check out \\"Brill's New Pauly Encyclopedia of the Ancient World: Antiquity.\\" (I tried to do this on-line but there was a $548 registration fee.) This point of crucifixion is important, because, according to Aslan, since only seditionists were crucified, Jesus was a seditionist. Since he was a seditionist, he really wanted to be King of the Jews. Aslan goes on to portray Jesus as an ambitious, uneducated, illiterate, back-country rebel similar to, but not as successful as, other contemporary messianic characters. And yet, this very unattractive, repellant Jesus that Aslan has created is, to Aslan \\"every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy\\" as the Jesus most Christians believe in. That's hard to understand. Why would just another failed rebel against Rome be more \\"praiseworthy\\" than the Jesus most Christians know?  Aslan claims all of what subsequently would be called \\"Christian\\" was actually the creation of later writers (especially Paul), who wanted to placate Rome and distance themselves from the failed Jewish uprising of 66 A.D. (or C.E., as Aslan uses). But even that claim is not supported in the narrative Aslan creates. He points out that Jesus' younger brother, James the Just, was Jesus' truest follower, uncontaminated by Paul's \\"false\\" teachings. Yet James was known as \\"the Just\\" because he devoted his life to caring for the poor. If Jesus was merely a freedom-fighter and James his truest follower, shouldn't James have waged war against Rome? Why would the \\"purest\\" Jesus follower, unpolluted by history's \\"false\\" Jesus be living a life most people of any age would recognize as Christian?  My views are simply a layman's perspective. For a more academic review of Zealot, please read: [...]

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Incredibly addictive!!  Love it.<br />Not sure how to get Facebook involved....will get coaching from a friend and really get involved!
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|This game is very addictive , every time I play this game I end up playing for hours it is very hard to stop playing. If you like puzzle games and solving them this is one to get you won't be disappointed.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I chose this rating because while it did work, the instructions were quite vague.  Along with the USD cable provided, I needed to purchase separately an audio patch cord.  The first recording session was a total waste of time as after it was finished I found I had recorded ambient sound, not what was coming from the device.....
0425263924|2.0|I was really bored with the first two books but thought I would like to see what happened at the conclusion.  I thought this would be the end - however - beware - there's ANOTHER one coming which I will absolutely not waste my time on.  Too predictable!  The characters are as flat as paper dolls.  The writing is boring and sooooooo repetitive.....  Nothing new at all - same old over and over and over again.  He &#34;fisted&#34; his hand in her hair, in the blankets, into the pillow, into her shirt, etc., etc.  Every scene was just like the one before and you really can't see them as real people doing real things.  I no longer care what happens to any of them - they are just not fleshed out.  The sex scenes are same old, same old and just like the one before and the one before that...  Even though she thought she tried - she failed - 50 Shades this is NOT!

6305090564|1.0|I would have loved to review this movie but Moviemars screwed up my order and sent me a movie only veiwable in another region(outside of US) How can they screw up when my address is USA? Don't believe the feedback info quoted and they lied about the return policy when it said it was prepaid.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is the best way to play YouTube videos on your TV, which I think is a huge advantage. It has Netflix too, which is great, though I have a Roku so that is of less interest. What is missing is Amazon Instant Video, which is the sole reason I keep my Roku around. Amazon is of course coming out with its own set top box, and I assume Chromecast will get Amazon Instant Video soon enough. THe $35 price point is unbeatable.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|seems like a really good series,..i am just beginning the first of the first season, ..<br /><br />but, the lack of subtitles, in English, .... really makes watching this, for me, somewhat difficult<br /><br />the characters are often not that easy to understand<br /><br />fast-paced, great scenery, great acting, very believable, lost in their 'reality',<br /><br />good buy, gave it a four, 'cause of the lack of english subtitles,..spanish, french & portuguese, -- how difficult would it have been to add the english?,.. and in this day and age, .. almost ALL dvds have english subtitles!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I am so happy I didn't have to wait in between these two books!  Though The Elite let me down a tiny bit.<br /><br />The love triangle between Prince Maxon, American and former boyfriend turned palace guard Aspen was the meat of this tale.  I read this book in two days instead of one.  The reason being is I got a bit turned off by the love triangle.  The Elite's story had America indecisive on where her affections lye.  Though I did not enjoy the back and forth of her emotions, they had me on pins and needles the entire time!<br /><br />In the end, The Elite has set up the final book in the trilogy perfectly and I cannot wait to see the out come!<br /><br />*4/5 stars*<br /><br />[...]
B001TH16DI|5.0|i am not a trekie, .. never been to any of those conventions, just a few comic book conventions,<br /><br />these are worth watching, .. bluray, is amazing on a 65 inch samsung smart tv!, wow!<br /><br />my only complaint, .. & maybe it is merely the 'learning curve', ..the bluray discs,... when they 'go to sleep', .. or if it was late, and i wanted to watch the rest, the next,...the bluray does NOT return to the last moment, .. one need to start at the beginning, ..with the ads, .. skipping, skipping, skipping!,.. irritating!<br /><br />other than that, .. a big wow!

B009LDD1X0|5.0|I ordered this for my husband's birthday. It arrived in perfect condition and in time. Well written and funny. He loves it!
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I've never felt compelled to write a review of an album before, but after listening to this album twice from start to finish on the first day of owning it, I definitely do now. Lyrically, it's brilliant. I don't know how else to describe it. Some bands are at their best writing dark, depressed music (see Alice in Chains). While I wouldn't say every AFI song has to be depressing to be good, it definitely seems to help. It also happens to make this album what it is. I love Jade's guitar work, as always, and the sprinkling of electronic elements throughout. It's subtle enough to assist and fill in perfectly without sounding industrial or EDM-like. Right now, this is my second favorite AFI album and may soon move into first place. GO BUY IT!
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|A very novel and challenging set of games! I highly recommend this download!!! This game is a real memory challenge and really a great mind developer for older folks like me.
0071422943|5.0|A classic source of reference for PE exam and day-to-day work for chemical engineers.  Although not useable for the EIT, it's a nice perk while preparing for the PE.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie was way better than I expected. It was so funny. The family loves it! Happy to add to my collection....
0812979656|5.0|This was so beautifully written and a riveting story about the tragedy of the human condition in which circumstances, that are chosen and unchosen, unfold the fate of individuals.  Roy's diction will grapple your heart and emotions as the journey of star-crossed lovers is revealed to the reader and boundaries of love become unbound and bound again.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Not worth the wait. I wish I stuck to the first two books. Why bother making your readers wait such a long time and decide to end it that way. It ruined the whole series for me. It is not only the ending that I am annoyed about, I feel like the plot was similar to the first two books. Multiple people dying for no real reason just for Tris to \\"sacrifice\\" herself at the end. It is always the same build up for the same ending.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great collection of movies, with original cast. The High definition and 7.1 Dolby are fantastic. Price was so little I was really surprised with the quality. One of my best buys on Amazon. Would definitely recommend to any Star Trek fan.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My wife and I chose to play this for date-night and we had so much fun! Such a great app!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a nice easy play. There is enough of a challenge to keep you playing. Hope there are lots of levels.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Love the effects in this movie (only reason I got it in 3D) the plot is a little shallow but the action is awesome.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Starts at the beginning and is very basic. And that's good. There is good reinforcement and sensible progression. I hope that continues through the levels.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle provides a real insight on what it takes to be and live as a Seal.  Tanya's comments give a true inside as to what a wife has to put up with her husband being deployed months at a time in harms way. Never being able to talk about what he's doing, where he is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game for kids. my kids love it and love to play it. would love to see a second version.
B00ATSS73U|5.0|This CD is great! Heard Darlene perform at the Joyce Meyer women's conference and she was great live.  The CD has many good songs and uplifting commentary. I would recommend this CD if you like to have uplifting songs you can still listen to loud and jam to!
006202406X|1.0|****************SPOILERS*****************What a disappointment. Tris' character didn't learn anything or grow from her experiences from the previous books. Also, her taking the place of Caleb was too contrived and predictable. It was just poor writing, and obvious that the author took the bold move not because it fit with the story but because she wanted to be different.<br />Due to the fact that Caleb was a coward, he should've been the one to die, but not so willingly. I think Tris taking over, as predictable as it was, would have been okay if Caleb had turned back and sacrificed himself for Tris. The entire theme of sacrrifice and bravery would've come more together had he actually sacrificed himself for his sister after all he'd done. He should've been the hero in the end, the one who saved everyone. That would've been fitting.<br />So in the end, we get Tris, who doesn't change, Caleb who doesn't change, but Evelyn who must be bipolar because her change was too out-of-character.<br /><br />It was sloppy writing. It seemed like the auther just wanted to get it finished with her big, planned, \\"shocking\\" death of Tris, but didn't care about how anything else played out in the story. I wouldn't doubt if the epilogue was written before the end of the book, without care to how those \\"loose\\" ends worked themselves out. She was after a shocking moment, but instead lost the trust of many readers.<br /><br />I will never read another book of hers again.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great read!  A very well written sequel, that will become an instant classic. If you have not read the Shining, read it first, and then dive right in. You will not be disappointed.
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|Chock-full of sexual innuendos, suggestive language and actions, and just plain crude manners.  \\"Family movie?\\"  I don't think so.  The song choices made me cringe, as did the seedy, deep voice in which some of them were sung.  The fact that the movie has cute, animated characters to lure parents and kids in makes it even more despicable.  Disappointed.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Seems very interesting so far. Even though you look for the same object s in the rooms it helps to keep your time down.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent book for those like me on a spiritual path and just like a little nudge from time to time, a little clarity on how things work.  For those who are not on a path or just beginning one, this book is an easy to read, excellent Segway into Law of Attraction.  Highly recommend
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Veronica Roth is a very young 25 year old author just starting out -- and it shows. The Divergent trilogy was a flawed but promising beginning.  If the critical reception of this third rather dull and sloppy book does not completely blow her confidence, I expect she will grow as a writer and will hopefully learn that structure, planning and careful editing can make all the difference. But getting older and more experienced helps as well!<br /><br />JK Rowling was 32 when she started the Harry Potter series and 42 when she finished Deathly Hallows; she had already married, divorced, was raising her child, and dealing with the death of her mother as she started her seven book saga. Tolkien was 33 when he wrote The Hobbit and started on the Lord of the Rings trilogy; married and well on in his academic career, he, too, had had an eventful life, surviving the trenches of World War 1 but losing all but one of his close friends to conflict.<br /><br />Truth be told very few authors produce much more than half-baked drivel in their 20's.  This series is a step or two above that level.  I certainly will give her next book a chance.<br /><br />I also have secret hopes that the movie will iron out some of the flaws in Divergent (not perfect, even though it was the best of the three).  And as for the dreadful ending to Allegiant, and the confusing, implausible plot...directors and screenwriters can and often do make major changes as they translate books to film.  I can't think of a better project for a major Hollywood re-write than this trilogy!

B001I0T92Q|5.0|I had purchased about 6 of these units already to share with family members and friends because of how amazingly well and unique they are!<br /><br />A simple device like such is able to combine two micro SD cards into one larger virtual memory card and this is what fascinates and magnifies the value of buying this adapter for your PlayStation Portable device.<br /><br />As high as the market goes, you can get a PSP memory card Licensed from Sony at 32GB = $67<br />Now if you buy this adapter and a single 32GB micro memory card to insert into it you can get 32GB = $24<br />Let alone you are saving NEARLY 36% off because you’re using a different brand selection and memory storage method.<br /><br />To top things off, you can confidently as I write this review; achieve 128GB of PSP memory storage which is not even on the market from Sony products by joining two 64 GB micro SD cards. The cost for this would nearly $88-$95 but even so, the potential of having so much storage on a PSP is available for the public!<br /><br />While I haven't been able to experiment it yet, I have discovered that PSP can max out memory at 256GB. Mentioning that the public can achieve 128 GB on Psps as of now, I can only predict that once 128GB micro SD cards are released (Possible around 2014), will this adapter be able to provide two 128GB micro SD cards and give your PSP the limits it can achieve!<br /><br />Last note about this device. Be sure to handle with care like all small objects. One of my friends accidentally cracked the plastic frame on one of these by simply being too rough with the handling process for his camera.
B008EKON56|1.0|i'm on my second Fiio L11.  one would assume it's a plug and play type device.  no go.  don't bother.  this is garbage.  i bought this as a workaround to the problems i'm having with my Ipod headphone jack.  i assumed that this would work with either an aux cable or by plugging in my ear phones.  both are a negative.  don't bother with this even for the low price.
006202406X|4.0|I have a feeling I'm one of the few people that actually adored this book. I thought it rang very true to the characters. I laughed. I cried. It was better than cats. I think one of the reasons I love the Hunger Games and the Divergent series is that the authors do some things that aren't on the beaten path. There are costs to the choices we make, and sometimes they come in lives. Sometimes they come from complicated feelings that allow us to shine brightly before our light goes out. To try harder, to be better, to make that awful choice to do the right thing... and Tris is a character that reminds us to live as brightly as we can, and to be brave. I'm glad I had three books getting to know her and Tobias. Not all things come with happy endings, regardless of the genre. Veronica Roth made a bold choice that i know many will disagree with... but I thought it was the right one.<br /><br />I think I'll digest this one for a while, and then return to it on a rainy day.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book kept me glued for the first two-thirds, then it's as if the author didn't know how to end it. I was very disappointed .
B00BD99JMW|3.0|After Insurgent, the story picks up with Tris in trouble and Evelyn in control of the city.  Soon, Tris, Four and some others choose to leave Chicago and pursue the meaning of the Edith Prior video.  Most of the remaining story takes place inside a special facility a short drive from Chicago, where we find out what the story is about Chicago and the factions, as well as what it really means to be divergent.  Three-quarters of the way into this story, I was very disappointed.  It felt like the author was just going through the motions, and frankly, the story was boring and dull--lots of talking and philosophical introspection, but not much plot movement.  The last quarter of the book salvaged things for me and raised the story from one star to 3.5.  No, like a thousand others, I didn't like the ending, and I didn't think the ending was necessitated in any way by the story arc.  It seemed almost as if the author realized the story about to crash and burn, so she tossed in this ending to slap us in the face.  HOWEVER, the ending was well done and beautifully written, and it was quite evocative.  I thought the writing went from passable and average to excellent and gripping.  BUT, I'm only at 3.5 stars because the ending doesn't really fit the overall trilogy IMO.  So, for those that want a 'they all lived happily ever after' ending, don't read this book.  Stop with Insurgent and think up your own ending.  For those of you, who--like Tris--aren't afraid to jump off the roof into the net below, you should read it and experience the pain.  I just wish the first part of the book was written nearly as well as the ending.  Yo, Tris, you...well, you know what i mean.
1452126607|5.0|Being a cat lover, I fell in love with Grumpy. I recieved a Grumpy birthday card & coffee Mug in September so, I decided to return the favor to my friend and got her a Grumpy calendar for Christmas, as well as my son & myself, so yes, I love the calendar.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|This was not the best season. This show has always been about how Dexter maintains that balance between good guy and bad guy WITHOUT getting caught, and this season continued along those veins. I liked the addition of \\"Hannah McKay\\" to the storyline. She gave an additional edge to the season, which I liked. Somehow, she made Dexter vulnerable in a different way, and I liked that. There is something appealing about that love/hate passion...
1452126607|5.0|Loved it, very nice calendar. How can anyone NOT love  this cat? Cute sayings on each picture for each month, grumpy but nothing too offensive for a dorm.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't think I have to tell anyone how fun &amp; exciting this game is.  The beautifully vivid graphics!  The deliciously challenging levels that will keep you entertained for hours on end!  I am so glad that Amazon finally acquired Candy Crack!.....I mean, Candy Crush!  Oh yeah....it's addictive!  :-D
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Love this game, I am not very good, but I Won't give up I see all my friends play and wish I could catch up... They better watch out!
B00FPH6A70|3.0|Great movie, if you like scary ones! We thought it was perfect for Holloween! We had a frightening good time! A lot of fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad Amazon FINALLY got Candy Crush Saga! I really love this game!!!  The game is working great. No glitches or bugs that I've found. Enjoy!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Awesome game!!!!!! Very entertaining. I had to load it a couple times but when it was done I was very pleased.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I cannot rave about this book enough! I love it so much I own it in hardback, paperback, and digital. Through the years I have loaned out my paperback copy and have always replaced it when it didn't get returned.<br />I have to say - I am not a Sci-Fi fan and have never been able to get into any other of these authors' books. And believe me, i have tried and tried because I love this book so much and I wanted more like it! It is hilarious and clever and witty and ... well, I did say I \\"couldn't\\" rave about it enough, so I guess I won't go on (but I could). Just read it.<br />******WARNING****** DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR OR DO NOT ENJOY LAUGHTER AS IT MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR DIGNITY!

B006WMILQU|2.0|I kept getting lost and confused.  A very slow moving, sometimes boring, movie.  I just didn't like the plot for the most part.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know many people will not be happy with the ending of this series, but as I sit and reflect I can't imagine it ending any other way that stayed true to the themes and characters.  I will read this series again and again (with many tissues by my side).
B005P1YCNK|3.0|While the information in this book is not at all new it is presented in a way that gives the reader a clear idea as to the benefits of approaching life this way.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|What's not to like?  Her voice and styling is a throwback, but her lyrics definitely make her a modern day gem.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have to admit that I never read the Shining, but loved the movie. I have read almost every other Stephen King book written. I decided to give this a try because I really wanted to know what happened to the kid from the Shining. I was not disappointed!
B000H305U0|5.0|I still love this album.  JT is at his best and the whole album is very listenable.  Yes, it's 2013 and I still jam to this.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Thought it was a good book. It keeps you attention and it has great Characters. I would recommend it for any Fantasy readers.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Great Album.  It reminded me a bit of the Gorillas, but with a cleaner and more orchestrated sound.  I love the riffs. It took me a few times to get into the album, but now it is one of my favorites.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Very Fun And Challenging. There Are Many Different Games And Difficulties To Choose From. A Must For Passing Time And Keeping The Mind Sharp.
B00908DDZM|4.0|The highlight to me is that my nephew thought I was the coolest aunt ever for having this album bumping in my jeep.  The Heist helped me reach him and that is the best thing I could ask for.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like this game. The  game doesn't respond as well on gru's lab. I've only unlocked residential and el macho's lair, but it isn't an issue on either of those locations. In gru's lab you have to swipe twice often especially when you first start the location.<br /><br />I'd also like to see costumes not quite as expensive;especially seasonal stuff
B008220BLG|5.0|I thought this was a fascinating perspective of the undead.  I never stopped laughing or smiling throughout.  A funny and romantic zomedy.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Divergent and insurgent were amazing books that made me want to finish the series. I am sad to say that veronica Roth definitely made me cry and be angry at her in this last book. It was good but not as good as the others.
B00EO10M54|4.0|With the distractions of her behavior, it could be easy to overlook her music.  A lot of the songs are good and she has an interesting country, pop, and hip hop sound unlike anything I have ever heard.  There is no doubt that Miley can really sing and I find this album would appeal to people who appreciate crossover music.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES by Gary Chapman<br />I have this book on my original iPod as an audiobook. I have on my Kindle, and now I’ve purchased TWO paperback copies to present to my children … someday … if they ever decide to marry. It will be required reading before I agree to host a reception or rehearsal dinner. The author shares his advice, which is based on more than 30 years of counseling. He has determined that people give and receive love in FIVE basic ways: Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Physical Touch, and Giving Gifts. So exactly HOW do you determine your love language – your partner’s love language? Chapman’s short questionnaires are one way to learn. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively. This book resonated with me so deeply – it was like someone FINALLY explained my husband of ALMOST 30 years to me. He loves me through Acts of Service, which is why I always get the full laundry list of EVERYTHING he’s accomplished when he’s off work. A question to ask frequently is “HOW FULL IS YOUR LOVE TANK?”  If it’s empty, read this book and you’ll find a way to communicate your needs to your significant other. This book is a game changer – life changer – marriage changer. If you’re relationship needs a boost, this book may help give you a new perspective on how to love your partner!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Thanks for the 1.5 good songs.  This album was a HUGE disappointment.  I never thought I'd say this, but stick to acting JT. And yes, I know there is a follow up edition to this album, but no. I can't do it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Reviewed by C. Perrot<br /><br />Ever heard the expression …”Oh, what a tangled tale we weave?”  I have, and it’s the first expression that comes to mind when reading the novel “Gone Girl” by Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />First, it is important for you to know that I am an avid reader. While most people read, I devour. Some people, maybe even people like you, may take a week or longer to read a book. Know that in that time, I may have read three. Having said that, I am usually pretty quick in seeing how the story will end. I can read the first three chapters of a book and figure out how the book is going to go. And, I will admit, I am usually spot on. That changed with “Gone Girl.” Boy did that ever change. While reading this enthralling book, I never know what was around the corner. Not to sound clich&eacute;, but this book had more twists and turns than the scariest roller coaster at Busch Gardens. As I read, I was amazed at all the nuances. Amy, the antagonist, is so clever. I can’t believe how she schemed! Who thinks like that? It is indescribable and unbelievable!! And poor Nick. He is such a perfect victim. I can’t recall ever reading a book where I am rooting so hard for the protagonist!!!<br /><br />Now… to delve or not to delve into the details of this story, that is the question? Let me just say this - If you want to find out for yourself, I guess this is a good time for you to stop reading. Nick and Amy are husband and wife. What seemed like the most unlikely of couples...She the debutante; he the quiet, nerdy type. Yet, they were both writers. They connected. They tried to make it work. Really, they did - from New York City all the way to Missouri.  In spite of all this, neither was happy. The marriage was coming to the end. They both knew it. Before it could end, though, Amy disappears. Oh yes, it seems mysterious.  And yes, it unfolds before our eyes.  As far as the world knows, Amy has been killed. And it seems, undoubtedly, that Nick had killed her. Every piece of evidence points to him.  It’s indisputable!  What appears to be an undeniable, inescapable, ready to be convicted murder, everything points to Nick.<br /><br />But we know better.<br /><br />One of the things that great about this book is the point of view from which this story is told. We live this story from both perspectives; alternating chapters from Nick to Amy. (I really like books written in this format.) Another great thing about this book is the sequence of events.  The book has three “parts.”  Part one is “Boy Loses Girl.” Part two is “Boy Meets Girl, and part three is “Boy Gets Girl Back (Or Vice Versa).  As the novel progresses, we see not only both sides of the story, but also the time frame in which the events occur. In all, “Gone Girl” by Gillian Flynn, is a roller-coaster of a book. If you are ready to read a gripping book with unexpected twists and turns, then this book is for you.<br /><br />Just one warning: When you are done with this book, you are not done with Gillian Flynn! You will be on your device and ready to download another of her books.killed her. Every piece of evidence points to him.  It’s indisputable!

B00E3I3KDE|3.0|A few hits, but again, hit or miss songs. I'm glad I got the double album. I at least feel I got my $$s worth.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love the show it was a great buy looking forward to getting the next season very soon and more.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I enjoyed listening to all of the songs on this album. This is to say I didn't skip songs. I recommend highly.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This  device works sporadically at best.  About 80% of the time I have to disable something or reinstall something, or it just never works at all.<br /><br />I often sit there and stare at my TV with the lovely Chomecast wallpapers up, and my laptop screams 'Device not found? '<br /><br />This product should still be in Beta.  It is not ready for mass consumption.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This thrilling final chapter of the Divergent series has a lot of moving pieces and parts. It's told from both Tris' and Tobias' perspectives which gives a well rounded description of what is going on at all times. It's a time race from start to finish filled with rebellions and tyranny. You must read this book to see how it all ends, everyone has their part to play.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I ordered this movie as a gift for one of my daughters.  I  have my own copy and have watched it many times and love it.  Whenever I go to an airport now and see people greeting or saying goodbye to friends and family I immediately think of this movie since it begins and ends at an airport.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it is finally on kindle now if they would only get pet rescue saga. Now I can get my extra lives unlike on Facebook.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My girlfriend recommended this book right after we first started dating (we are in our 60s) The topic was written very well and really helped us understand each other, knowing how to make each other feel loved.  Highly recoomend!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I just played for about 3 hours straight. I love it!! It's just like the older mmorpgs for pc! The controls work nice and the game does not have a learning curve  if you've ever played an mmorpg before! Worth the money.
034580709X|2.0|I am a big Harry Hole fan, having read all of the books in the series.  I always wondered why the English translations began with Nesbo's third book.  Now I know.  this book is mediocre at best, boring at worst.<br /><br />The basic plots wander about slowly.  There is page after page about Aboriginal heritage.  The identity of the serial killer is obvious about midway through the book and then after the identity is established we are led in a silly confrontation.  Most ridiculous is the way a civillian is used as bait without reasonable security measures - just to make a bigger personal impact on Hole.<br /><br /> If I had read this book first, there wouldn't have been a second one that I would have read. Looking at the Amazon reviews, I think many share this conclusion.
B00BB8UJKG|4.0|It wasn't life changing, but it was relatable and worth the effort. I especially liked Natalie Portman and Rosie. Give it a shot if you have a lil time to kill.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wonderful fun!  would play for hours if I don't run out of lives :)  cant get enough of it! play this game!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Either did my family. My husband, 11 year old, and myself still really enjoyed this film. I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Wonderful lovely story, that touts the virtues of love, being need, and work.  The two lonely spilled children both find happiness.
1554072840|5.0|I had this book for my Day are and I would take it with me when I would go to my daughter's to read to my granddaughter and she loved it.  So I bought one for each of my youngest  granddaughters.<br /><br />The book is well written and the illustrations are great!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game keeps me entertained for hours. I love running my own little village and leveling up to get new things and expanding the land.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|The movie will be around forever.  It's funny and just a great movie to watch during the holidays or any time during the year for a good laugh.
B004UHF51S|5.0|I haven't heard in any new Michael Franks in years, or probably decades. This CD was beyond my expectations. Michael has only gotten better.
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|I'm a recording engineer and listened to the album in my mixing room before I purchased it - I was completely blown away.  The production is quite well done.  I listened to Tomorrow's Harvest in my car and I was disappointed and disinterested (which is no fault of the mixing quality).  What I am trying to say is that this album deserves a critical listening environment to be fully enjoyed.  It also should be listened through beginning to end.  There are songs that easily stand on their own, but I've enjoyed the whole experience.  So don't just purchase the \\"singles,\\" do yourself the favor and get the whole thing.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I enjoy using this app.  It is a good way to relearn the Spanish I've learned and forgotten since high school.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing running game I can't keep this to myself people out there that like running games YOU will like this game alot
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love that I can play it on my kindle :) facebook is not on the go kindle is :) amazon needs more Google apps they need to team up so we kindle folks don't have to wait so long.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't already been written.  I came to it late....had been hearing and reading about it for over a year and it lived up to the hype.  I have now read all of Gillian Flynn's books and hoping her next is out soon.  Love her style and how she formats her stories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, finally, finally!  I have been waiting for this. I am so excited that it's now available on Kindle Fire! I never get tired of playing this game. Thank you for finally making it available.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Up until owning this product, I have always had to deal with clunky slow interfaces from boxes that cost much more than this device when I wanted to stream Netflix or Youtube on a TV.  I didn't know quite what to expect when Google first announced the Chromecast.  But I have to say that I love how seamless the installation is on any wifi network coupled with any android device or laptop / desktop computer.  Video playback is always responsive and it is quite easy to jump forward and back in videos without any hiccups or long pauses.  For anyone who is looking for a convenient, portable solution to stream Netflix and Youtube, I couldn't recommend a better product.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best novel of his in a long time.  Loved every page.  Very hard to put it down.  Great character's.<br />Story moves right along, with great background information.  The characters relate to one another very smoothly and the story is easy to understand because of the way King tells it.  When I finished, I was satisfied with Danny's story after The Shining.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Additive and very clever.  Glad I stuck with it to figure out last level.  Wish I could keep going with more games!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome. game. very addictive once you start playing you walnut to keep going and going all the level. Clues are well hiden sometime take a lot of thinking to solve it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game have it on my phone,computer now on my kindle. But on my kindle it will not let me connect with my Facebook account. Pretty disappointed about that
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app does what I wanted. I just click on the little birdy and I am signed in reading tweets and easily can post and re-post etc.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I think every single song on this album is amazing, so much better than One Of The Boys and Teenage Dream. She has grown up and her voice is perfect. My favorite songs are Legendary Lovers, Birthday, Love me, Spiritual and Dark Horse. Buy this!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Fast and user friendly. Gives you lots of info on the fly. Current conditions and essential forecast information. Nice looking to.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The best yet! Loved Robert Downey, Jr, again. This one had just the right amount of story, action and humor.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is still cheap though if you missed the free app of the day. This calculator does everything.Plus it is simple to use.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Aslan has presented a Jesus whose spirituality he skews through carefully selected references to scripture.  He uses some verses or stories to support his views and then denies the validity of others when it suits him.  I am not a fundamentalist, but I am a critical thinker, and I find Zealot to be a work that beats a biased drum with zeal, despite Aslan's protestations
B000VZUT64|5.0|I had almost forgotten this album from my youth! Every song a classic. Trower was grunge before there was grunge. Another example of the great music from the age of classic rock.
B00CE5C8RW|4.0|No idea how long it will last after reading some other reviews, but so far so good. Really surprised how detailed the dial and movement is and overall the watch has a decent roughly 44mm wide case and about 12mm thick with a decent enough leather strap. It actually looks very expensive to me regardless of price. So far I love it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|App gives you a one click interface to all your Google services. Mail checker, Google Plus+, the works. I noticed the mail shows up in only the basics with no HTML.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed it and have been recommending it to everyone. Season 1 was the best, as 1st seasons usually are, and then 2nd season was a little tiring with the war and all. And then 3rd season was very good, sad in places but very good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally I can take candy crush with me.  Until now I could only play on my PC.  I'm hooked on this game and this will more than double the time I was able to play.  Thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it can be very addictive. I could play this game for hours or at least have the urge to keep coming back.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a very good book it was also very intense. I liked the book. I also liked the series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's easy to see why this book captivated so many people. It was difficult to put it down.<br /><br />Awesome READ.
B0074V3712|3.0|A fun read for a budding evolutionary psychologist. The upshot is that Wilson supports group selection. His other commentary is predictable for those familiar. Man is he a great writer though. So much depth in so few words.
B00136JQMI|5.0|My third Miles Davis album. I also have Someday my Prince will Come and Green Dolphin Street. I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its fun and u challenge your self to get a higher score each time u play and also u get to compete with friends and its FREE who doesn't love minions?!
B004LWZW24|3.0|A young family begin to experience supernatural occurrences and their young son, Dalton, who never recovered from a minor accident and is in a mysterious coma, appears to be the centre of this strange phenomenon. A medium is called in and it is discovered that Dalton, has the ability to astral project and travel to another realm, which is referred to as \\"The Further\\" and is somehow lost and may be in the company of a monstrous entity. His empty, soul-less body, has become an open vessel for other worldly creatures who are wanting to live again, and will possess his body if the sleeping boy's soul is not returned soon.<br /><br />It has been stated that this film bears a resemblance to the classic Tobe Hooper film, \\"Poltergeist\\" (1982). Let's see.  Both films deal with supernatural activity tormenting a young family with the phenomenon concentrating on one of the children. Both films have a child lost in another dimension,  \\"The Further\\" (Insidious) or \\"The Other Side\\" (Poltergeist, although this term wasn't used until the sequel). Both children are in the company of a monstrous evil. Both films have a team of parapsychologists called in to try and establish contact and return the child to this world. Both films have a parent travel to another dimension to reclaim their child. The similarities appear endless. However, visually, the 2 movies look nothing alike. \\"Poltergeist\\", in my opinion, is superior. Hooper's classic is very Special Effect's heavy and has a lot more on screen action, with floating phantasms, supernatural whirlwinds, exploding coffins and many corpses on display, not to mention, it also had heart and a funny bone. \\"Insidious\\" really has none of the above, and this films tone is much more darker. Comparisons aside, \\"Insidious\\" has a lot of atmosphere and there are some real sinister scenes. You do see some surreal characters and images during the last quarter of the film and the performances are good. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who play the tormented couple, John and Renai Lambert, are good, although Josh, at times, was kind of loopy (more on this a bit later). I also loved seeing the beautiful Barbara Hershey again as Lorraine, Josh's tormented mother who also has a secret of her own to tell. The film is more psychological, relying more on atmosphere and tense situations for its chills, and some of the make-up effects are frightening (the main demon resembles Darth Maul a bit too much). The score is a bit creepy, although it could get a bit grating if you sit through the end credits, almost like nails on a chalk-board.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are a bit of a let-down. **Possible Spoilers** When Josh is shown ghostly pictures from his childhood, the apparition in the photos are just too in-your-face to the point that they look photo-shopped. Images that were less obvious would have been far more successful. Also when \\"The Further\\" is finally visualized, it is much too dark to see anything clearly and the ghosts/souls inhabiting this realm are quirky and rather pathetic, aside from the main demon, they do not appear at all that frightening, and I have to admit, the main demon lost it's frightening edge once I realized it likes to listen to Tiny Tim. Josh also appears to be a bit mindless in the latter parts of the film and is not able to follow important instructions all too well. A medium explicitly tells him that he is travelling to another realm and to NOT DRAW ATTENTION to himself because if they (meaning the evil creatures that reside there) realize he is not one of them, they will come for his \\"physical body in this world\\" yet once there, he starts screaming at the top of his lungs \\"Dalton!!!, Dalton!!!..Followed by \\"Where is my son? .. Tell me where my son is, please! .. Have you seen my son!??\\" and then initiates a fight with, none other than a parasitic and powerful entity and screams at it - `What do you want from me?..I am not scared of you ... Get away from me.. Leave me alone!!\\" . Really? Dude, really? You fail.<br /><br />\\"Insidious\\" moves along surely but slowly and there really is minimal action here and when the action does start during the all too important climax, it is much too dark to see any of it. With that said, I do appreciate this film and would love to see more of this type of horror releases since for the past decade, we have been given far too many slasher movies and torture porn. \\"Insidious\\" is more in the lines of \\"The Changeling\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", and of course, \\"Poltergeist\\", the film it most resembles, at least in spirit. It's a good little horror tale but despite its chilling atmosphere and good performances, I still have to admit that this has been done before and done much better. It's still makes a great movie to watch on \\"Halloween\\" with the lights turned off and the volume set to MAX.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5de, really?

B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good mystery and enjoyed the information on diamond mining.  Would have liked a more romantic relationship/ reconciliation between her and Ryan.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Writing is not the least bit engaging.  Characters are given no depth, and the author seems driven mainly by her need to tell what an adaptable survivor and best friend to all she was.  Even in minimum security, it is not believable that all of the women were so kind and wonderful to her.  She came from, and returned to, a completely different world than the majority of the inmates.  The only saving grace is the glimpse into some of the details of prison life.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is one of my favorite series. I had taped the first four season but missed the fifth season.  Now i'm  caught up and getting all the new season  Thanks

B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|When you name something &quot;Pro&quot; you'd be wise to at least give a few features.  This app is as basic as basic gets.  Also the menu button on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 doesn't seem to work with this app for some reason.  Even as a free app I'm not sure its worth getting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun! Really makes you think. I could not stop playing until I made it to the end.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Sent back. Worst quality Blu-ray Disc I have ever seen. More like an old VHS tape.....lol  Hopefully when they reissue this the quality will be perfect. Like her Sticky & Sweet tour Blu.....
006202406X|5.0|It was an amazing ending. I thought it was very surprising and just fantastic! So far my second favorite of the series.
0470932139|5.0|This is a vr simple to read book. I could say  have very poor knowlege about photography, and I could understand it all.<br />The ork she akes is amazing, and all the tips she gave you are very well recive fir someone who doesn´t undestand so much about it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I have to admit that I am chuckling at some of the reviews that are upset at the ending. This seemed like a perfect ending to me. I won't go into spoilers or anything but I felt I needed to give it a little boost in ratings since so many people are upset with the ending. I'm actually glad she didn't cop out and make it different.<br /><br />If you felt sad and depressed...if you feel the author ripped your heart out...then she did her job as a writer.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|THE GAME IS GOOD BUT WAITING FOR NEXT SET OF LIFE SUCKS. THAT IS WHY I GAVE FOUR STARS. NOT A BAD GAME THOUGH.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read The Shining probably 10 times since I was first introduced to it, it is one of the novels that can still scare the bejeezus out of me. I was so excited when Doctor Sleep came out and I wanted so much to know what happened to Danny, Wendy, Dick Holloran and where they all landed in life. It was sad to see heredity grab hold of Danny and hurt him so badly and that his shining became so hard for him to handle as a young man.<br />I love Stephen King's books and I probably always will. I go back to them like that old pair of jeans that might be worn and just a bit crusty to everyone else, but to me they're home. In his latest writings to date with the end of the Dark Tower Series, The Dome, and a few others - I feel like the end of the stories are rushed and meant to be hurried up and finished. Doctor Sleep was no different. I am glad things got tied up neatly for Danny, but it's all just too pretty and shiny and happily ever after.<br />And heredity plays a big role in this book and in one way it is sad, and in another... it annoyed me and was just too convenient.<br />I love and dislike this novel at the same time. King is my man with the writing master plan, but dammit... what happened to dead and spooky ever after?
B00846REIS|3.0|I liked the book...not the abrupt ending...so much.  I cared about the characters....and was left wanting more.  What became of Cary.

B00D7NWTSI|3.0|Although a well reviewed movie, I feel that we have reached the tipping point where Stark as the dead horse has come back to life, but as a zombie that you don't want around.  It's repetition in the finest form.  Protect the one he loves and fight __________(Don't want t spoil it). that are ridiculously offensive to the average intellectual human being.  These movies have become cash cows and that usually leads to neglect of some sort.  Similar to Iron Man 3/Avengers/Iron Man 2 etc.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|Very basic app. Nothing exciting. May not buy this unless it is free.<br />The interface is simple which is good. Got it free from amazon. So, no complaint.
B00AZM7IQC|3.0|I have seen several Cirque Du Soleil shows live in Vegas and locally, so I had a hard time being unbiased when watching this film.  For those who have not or will not see a show live, this would be a good alternative and is an accurate representation of what you will see in a live show.  I would recommend you wait until the price drops before making the purchase.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson the lightning thief was a great peace of writing I loved the book I can't wait to get the next book.
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|I originally purchased this movie because of the 3D capabilities and I am glad that I did it for only that reason, because other than Idris Elba, this movie is not good.  The 3D is great, and if you're into the godzilla/robotech/comic scene, you will like this, but as a far as character development and plot and clarification into the story, it fails.  The visuals are amazing and sometimes at a fault, because with all the lights flashing, it is hard to decipher some critical scenes.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Have watched twice...so far!<br />&#34;It will work out in the End, and if it has NOT worked out, then it is NOT the End&#34;

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Like always with any of the Wheel of Time series, this has more twists and turns than a roller coaster. I would have given it 5 stars since it was a good book, but not to give away too much, but it left plot lines open and unfinished. Almost as if there were going to be sequels to the series but sadly never got to happen because of Mr. Jordan's untimely passing.

B0051OZ564|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, it was a little hard to follow. Once it got to the end, It was like my mind was blown. So of course I'm going to watch it a second time!! Great Movie!
B00E9ZFIMM|2.0|As basic as it gets, except it looks similar to a paper notepad; if it didn't, I'd mistake it for Windows' Notepad (which has more functionality).<br /><br />Every smart device I've owned has come stock with a notepad of some sort, and all having features I've come to expect such as exporting and sharing capabilities.<br /><br />The good news is that there are no unnecessary permissions.  That earns the app a second star.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the app, per se, but I see no use for it, especially as a paid app.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|great clock app! I love the weather option and it isn't to bright to leave open. I like that it doesn't drain my battery either
0062255657|5.0|Prepare to read this book in one setting. It won't let you go. It was beautifully written and woven with magic and mystery and the kind of fear that only a child can experience and never forget. I want to read it again and again--this is a book to curl up with when you want to disappear to somewhere else.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Fun game but so annoying to have to stop often and being asked for more money. Do not like the selling tactics of this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was playing this game on my phone before it became so popular, but it's not easy because my phone is small. Then I got my kindle fire and found it was not available.

006202406X|5.0|I absolutely loved it - the ending included. The book was true to the story line, setting, and characters, throughout Divergent and Insurgent, so it's only fair that Roth honor that in Allegiant. Yes, the ending is super emotional but it's better than a happy, cliche ending! Well written and a wonderful conclusion.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Changing and motivating!<br />A must read for anyone seeking to change their lives and embrace freedom.<br />I'm so happy I read this book. I wish this was apart of my high school curricula.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am so incredibly frustrated. Divergent and insurgent were both INCREDIBLE novels and I couldn't wait for Allegiant..  but now that I have read it, I wish I had never even read Divergent. It is one of the most depressing books I have ever read, and the worst part is there was no hope at the end to lift your spirits. The conclusion didn't give closure. The whole ending seemed like a joke; I kept waiting for it to be a hallucination or something but no. Seriously don't read this.. imagine your own ending because this one will leave you unsatisfied, wallowing in a pit of sadness.
B00DD49R0E|2.0|I recently bought this Vhs for my 42 yr.old  grandson.<br />I didnt like the movie, they made fun of these cute little, ugly loving yellow people named minions.<br />(they sold minions at Mcdonalds!)<br /><br />I hated everyone else in the movie, besides the minions.<br />The minions should take over our planet, and eat our cookies.<br />Also did you hear that minions are gonna be in COD:Ghosts!?<br />i dont know if its true, but i hope so.<br /><br />Overall, this was not really an exciting movie,since they kept killing the minions.<br /><br />2 stars. :(

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little device has finally managed to give me Netflix on my TV, which for some reason Samsung was unable to provide on a high-end TV.<br /><br />I had a few nits with the product, but I still consider it good enough for 5 stars.<br /><br />1) Couldn't connect out of the box to my WPA2-PSK network (served by an Asus RT66U). I set up an open network, connected, downloaded updates, then reconnected to the protected network without a problem.<br /><br />2) Doesn't work on networks with address isolation or networks that require webpage login (hotel or public wifi networks). I consider this a problem with the networks, not the unit, though.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is an easy to read flowing book.The action sequences, splashed with a little comedy, keep you wanting to read more. Great story for anyone to read.
B00CTMPJ7Q|3.0|Q-W-E-R-T-Y<br />Fingers to home positions and go...<br />Quirky small town characters and obsessed competitors, \\"Mad Men\\"-era design and the universally loved story of an underdog defying the odds are all combined to make \\"Populaire\\", the new French comedy from writer/director Regis Roinsard, a fun little romp.<br /><br />When Rose Pamphyle (Deborah Francoise, \\"L'Enfant\\") comes of age, her first act is to leave the sleepy French village and the family grocery behind. She wants the big city, she wants excitement, she wants more. But the only thing she is really good at is pounding away on the tiny typewriter her father keeps in the window of the family general store. She is incredibly fast, but has no training or skill. She talks her way into a job as a secretary at a small insurance firm owned by Louis (Romain Duris) who quickly becomes frustrated by her lack of secretarial skills. But he is amazed by her typing speed and thinks she could win the national Speed Typing Championship, she just needs training. The road to victory is bumpy at first, but Louis decides to quietly move her in to his house so the training can continue beyond work hours. Louis enlists the aid of his friends, Marie (Berenice Bejo, \\"The Artist\\"), an ex-girlfriend now married to Bob (Shaun Benson, lots of TV credits), an American who stayed behind after the war, to help Rose become the champion Louis sees in her. Marie is a piano teacher, so Rose begins to learn to play. Bob becomes a one-man cheering squad and provides encouragement to his good friend, Louis.<br /><br />Every French film these days seems to have Romain Duris in it. He is our generation's Gerard Depardieu and it is easy to see why he is so popular. While he is good looking, he isn't matinee idol handsome and this allows him to step into a lot of \\"everyman\\"-type roles. But he is also instantly recognizable; as soon as he flashes his crooked grin, I can imagine all of the French girls swooning. As Louis, he fits into the era and its conventions well. He isn't beyond flirting and carrying on, but he also recognizes he has an image to protect and a business to run. As soon as he decides to help Rose become a Speed Typing Champion, he concentrates all of his energy on reaching this goal. And, per romantic comedy conventions, he fails to notice when he is being too hard on Rose and is oblivious to her growing attraction to him. Will he realize she is in love with him, and he with her, before it is too late?<br /><br />Rose is so desperate to get out of the sleepy French village where she grew up, she would probably take any job, but she is a fast typist, so... Francois is very good, almost darling, as Rose channeling a little bit of Debbie Reynolds in her heyday. She follows the conventions established by Reynolds or Doris Day and quickly becomes interested in her boss, the attraction growing unnoticed as they work very closely together. As the story is set in the late 50s, she is also very worried about her image and social standing; when Louis suggests she move into a vacant room at his house, she is taken aback and wonders what others will think. In fact, the woman who runs the boarding house where she lives is suspicious and starts to spreads rumors. The fact Francois is able to evoke the spirit of Reynolds or Day is a compliment, not a criticism. If you are going to do a homage, do it well, and Francois does it well.<br /><br />Throughout, Roinsard seems influenced by a variety of different things - \\"Mad Men\\", underdog films like \\"The Full Monty\\", the romantic comedies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson and more. As Rose competes, the field is narrowed until she is finally up against the National Champion. Getting to this point involves a lot of montage and it moves the narrative at a fast clip. Later, more montage to evoke the period and how Rose's life is changed by her new circumstances. My one complaint would be that this film is too American. I go to foreign films to experience and witnessa different way of life, a different kind of story. \\"Populaire\\" is fun, but it isn't very challenging. In fact, most foreign films we see in American cinemas are more \\"American\\" in style. The companies releasing them want to tap into the American audience and their moviegoing dollars. Challenging films, more \\"French\\" films, may have a more difficult time finding a limited audience. Of course, there are many factors involved, but the more \\"American\\" a film is, the more chance we have to get a chance to see it.<br /><br />You will have a fun time watching \\"Populaire\\".

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|i really like clash o clans but you cant get it on the kindle so i got this and it's just as good
B005LAIIGW|5.0|\\"Gravity\\" is the very rare case of a film deserving of all the hype it is receiving. And I am about to heap some more on top.<br /><br />Specialist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Commander Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are trying to run the very test Ryan is on this mission for, the test she trained for six months before traveling to space to complete, the very last thing they have to do before returning to the shuttle, and then to Earth, when they receive an urgent message from Houston. Russia destroyed one of their satellites with missiles, creating a debris field, and a chain reaction, destroying more vessels in the wake. The growing mass of debris is headed their way and they need to get to safety immediately. Before they can, the debris hits their shuttle, rendering it useless, and Ryan and Matt have to come up with an alternative plan. They also lose communication with Mission Control leaving experienced veteran Matt with rookie Ryan on her first space mission. They are going to try to get to the International Space Station, a distance away, and use one of the escape pods to reach a Chinese shuttle, which is even further away. And Matt estimates they have about 90 minutes before the debris returns.<br /><br />Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (\\"Children of Men\\", \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"), and written by Alfonso and his son Jonas, \\"Gravity\\" is an almost perfect film. One of the reasons for this near perfection is it seems so simple - yet a lot of work went into making this film seem so simple.<br /><br />The camera moves around a lot - the characters are floating in space, it would seem odd if they remained stationary - but I was very concerned this would cause some motion sickness. Cuaron does a very interesting thing. For instance, he shows us Ryan and Matt spinning, unable to control their movements, establishing their sense in space. Once he does this, Cuaron moves the camera towards Ryan until we are looking out of her helmet sharing her point of view. This is a remarkably good way of establishing both Ryan's place and situation before making us a part of her universe. It is also a great way to create some suspense; we can see Ryan has very little control as she spins around and around until we take her point of view and become a part of her journey and struggle. Strangely, because the camera's movements are controlled by computer, the nausea which can be caused by handheld camera isn't really a factor. Films like \\"Captain Phillips\\" and \\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\\" are much more likely to cause problems if you suffer from motion sickness.<br /><br />Cuaron and his team developed new technology to help make this film seem more real. It is always thrilling to see something new in film, to participate in something like this, to see the beginning of an exciting technological advance. While watching James Cameron's \\"The Abyss\\", I remember being awed by the Water Sprite creature. The technology used to create this character was further developed for the T-1000 in \\"Terminator 2\\". Now, it seems almost commonplace. In fact, the trailer for the new Keanu Reeves film \\"47 Ronin\\" played before \\"Gravity\\" and this same technology was used at least twice in that two-minute commercial. Now, when you watch \\"The Abyss\\", the Water Sprite seems almost quaint, almost prehistoric. The technology used to make Bullock and Clooney seem like they are actually in space, is already good, but I can't wait to see how it develops and how it is used in future films. Someday, I suspect we will watch \\"Gravity\\" again and consider how quaint that technology is.<br /><br />As Ryan and Matt float through space you get a real sense of how helpless their situation is, even before the debris hits their shuttle - tools float away, they are tethered to the space shuttle by a small cable, communication is tenuous at best - and this sets you on edge almost immediately. Then, when all hell breaks loose, you have to wonder how they might ever make it out of this situation.<br /><br />As impressive as the technology to create these images is, the cinematography is every bit the equal. Earth, and little else, frequently pops up, trying to dominate the blackness of space, showing us the void they are drifting through. The shuttle they use and the two other ships are represented, but they barely make an impression. And that is sort of the point - space is supposed to feel overwhelming.<br /><br />There has been a lot of press recently about 3-D movie ticket sales. Quite honestly, there are too many films coming out that don't need to be in 3-D - the studios are releasing anything they can in this format to squeeze an extra $3 or $4 per ticket out of our wallet. And the public is catching on as they avoid paying this extra fee for many of these films. So when a film like \\"Gravity\\" is released and uses the 3-D technology in, perhaps, the best way since \\"Avatar\\", you should run, jump and go to the first screening you possibly can. The very composition of this film lends itself to the process - very often, one or two characters are the only figures on screen, against the black of space, allowing the figures to pop out and float in front of us, the vastness of outer space beyond them. I would really recommend the splurge of an IMAX 3-D ticket. It would be worth it.<br /><br />Cuaron spent a lot of time working out all of the technical issues of this landscape and the sound design is also pretty extraordinary. Another director, say, Michael Bay on \\"Armageddon\\", fills the soundscape with explosions and music. In space, sound can't travel, so this is unrealistic. And annoying. In \\"Gravity\\", when the debris hits the shuttle, we see the destruction and hear some of it, but it sounds like an echo. Cuaron is letting the silence of space envelope us as it would the astronauts.<br /><br />All this technology and production design would be a waste if we didn't have believable characters to root for, to take the journey with. Bullock and Clooney's characters are basically it and they quickly give us insight into each of their characters, allowing us to get to know them a little bit. We don't have a lot of time before the problems begin, but as the narrative moves forward, we learn little bits here and there. Surprisingly, these small moments do make us care about each of these characters and we find ourselves rooting for them to make it through this ordeal. My technical eye realizes the character development is very minimal. But the movie-lover in me embraces these moments and I begin to get lost in the story.<br /><br />Bullock's performance is very good and different from most of the other films she has done. The only other instance I can recall of an actress taking on such a different role is when Meryl Streep starred in \\"The River Wild\\", an action film. Bullock's portrayal of Ryan Stone is very physical and very challenging. As she is swinging and rotating through space, she manages to make us believe in her character's dire situation. Again, it is remarkable how moving her character is when she has so little time to create one.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron is a gifted filmmaker. He isn't the most prolific director working today, but he spends a lot of time crafting, shaping and making films that are interesting and unique. \\"Gravity\\" is his best film yet and one of the best films of the year.ey might ever make it out of this situation.<br /><br />As impressive as the technology to create these images is, the cinematography is every bit the equal. Earth, and little else, frequently pops up, trying to dominate the blackness of space, showing us the void they are drifting through. The shuttle they use and the two other ships are represented, but they barely make an impression. And that is sort of the point - space is supposed to feel overwhelming.<br /><br />There has been a lot of press recently about 3-D movie ticket sales. Quite honestly, there are too many films coming out that don't need to be in 3-D - the studios are releasing anything they can in this format to squeeze an extra $3 or $4 per ticket out of our wallet. And the public is catching on as they avoid paying this extra fee for many of these films. So when a film like \\"Gravity\\" is released and uses the 3-D technology in, perhaps, the best way since \\"Avatar\\", you should run, jump and go to the first screening you possibly can. The very composition of this film lends itself to the process - very often, one or two characters are the only figures on screen, against the black of space, allowing the figures to pop out and float in front of us, the vastness of outer space beyond them. I would really recommend the splurge of an IMAX 3-D ticket. It would be worth it.<br /><br />Cuaron spent a lot of time working out all of the technical issues of this landscape and the sound design is also pretty extraordinary. Another director, say, Michael Bay on \\"Armageddon\\", fills the soundscape with explosions and music. In space, sound can't travel, so this is unrealistic. And annoying. In \\"Gravity\\", when the debris hits the shuttle, we see the destruction and hear some of it, but it sounds like an echo. Cuaron is letting the silence of space envelope us as it would the astronauts.<br /><br />All this technology and production design would be a waste if we didn't have believable characters to root for, to take the journey with. Bullock and Clooney's characters are basically it and they quickly give us insight into each of their characters, allowing us to get to know them a little bit. We don't have a lot of time before the problems begin, but as the narrative moves forward, we learn little bits here and there. Surprisingly, these small moments do make us care about each of these characters and we find ourselves rooting for them to make it through this ordeal. My technical eye realizes the character development is very minimal. But the movie-lover in me embraces these moments and I begin to get lost in the story.<br /><br />Bullock's performance is very good and different from most of the other films she has done. The only other instance I can recall of an actress taking on such a different role is when Meryl Streep starred in \\"The River Wild\\", an action film. Bullock's portrayal of Ryan Stone is very physical and very challenging. As she is swinging and rotating through space, she manages to make us believe in her character's dire situation.

030758836X|4.0|Gone girl is one of the best books I have read in a while. I always thought I hated reading but it turns out I was just reading the wrong types of books. I get completely wrapped up in mysteries, thrillers, and romances. Well boy let me tell you, this book is a combination of all of those. This is one of those books where you feel like your watching a movie and you don't want to look away because it's so good. I read this book in two days! And I'm a busy girl. Gillian Flynn is such an amazing author. Her wiring style draws you in so deep that you literally won't want to take your nose of this book. Not only is gone girl scandalous but it is also sad and romantic and dramatic and just about every other thing in between. Gone girl was the number one New York Times beat seller and you can clearly tell why when you read it. I can't stress this enough, you have to read this book! The writing is jarringly good and the story is just brilliant . The plot has it all I mean this book is almost so good it's bad. I mean the main characters Nick and Amy manipulate each other in such a way that it's actually quite twisted. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who likes to get completely engaged in a reading. I also recommend Gillian Flynn's other two books. She is very talented author with clever word use and plots a story perfectly. You can get this book at just about every book store and it's not very expensive. It is definitely worth the wait if you decide to get it online also. Well I hope this helped, go buy now!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is the best way to organize all the news sites you read in to one location. I have categories set up all for all my topics like news, sports, entertainment, autos, etc.  It's a real easy way to browse though everything you are interested in reading about.  You can either check out a few main articles of the day, or go deeper and read through everything you want.
1594489505|5.0|If you have been keeping up with my blog, you would know how much I love Khaled Hosseini. I’ve already eaten my way through Hosseini’s The Kite Runner and And The Mountains Echoed, so I found myself staring A Thousand Splendid Suns at in the way of me being able to say I read every Khaled Hosseini book to date. The Kite Runner focuses on a single person and watches as they grow up and And The Mountains Echoed focuses on a family, while A Thousands Splendid Suns focuses on two women as they are forced to leave their past lives and marry Rasheed, a hateful man who beats them.<br /><br />Laila and Mariam are two strong characters, who have their own past and their future woven together with their hatred for Rasheed. By the end of the 372 pages you feel attached to the characters as if they were your own friends. Laila and Mariam are both some of the realistic characters I’ve read this year. Both of whom have their own habits and mannerisms and are easily lovable, something you just can’t find in average books nowadays.<br /><br />Hosseini’s ability to describe makes his world of Kabul and Afghanistan come to life, giving a clear illusion of what times might’ve been like back in Afghanistan during the Taliban reign, while also exploring into women's roles. Khaled explains what the difficulties of what it was like to be a woman in this time of history, while also telling a wonderful story.<br /><br />Holy plot twist! There are a lot of twist and turns through the entire novel that make it even more memorable. Everything that happens is unexpected, but natural. The plot twist are throughout the entire novel till a few pages from the end. And being a Khaled Hosseini book there will be some tears shed.<br /><br />I recommended this book to anybody who’s even slightly interested in reading this novel. You won’t be disappointed and most likely you will learn something from this novel.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I began watching the first season of &#34;Homeland&#34;  when Season 2 was already over. A friend recommended it to me and my wife and, one Saturday afternoon, we decided to try it. WE COULD NOT STOP WATCHING IT, and we ended up watching the entire first season over a weekend! The show is absolutely addictive, cleverly written, and well directed. Claire Danes is simply fantastic. The show is saturated with tension---I never felt such a suspense while watching a TV show, I felt literally nailed to the chair and could not move my eyes away from the screen! Highly, highly, recommended---best show in ages!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|What does it mean to be selfless? That was one of the main themes of the entire 'Divergent' trilogy. But in the shocking ending to the series, Veronica Roth personally shows what it is to be Dauntless, as well, choosing an ending that some less mature readers may not enjoy. She didn't choose the agreeable 'Amity' ending of hearts and flowers and a future of baking cookies that some readers may have wanted for their favorite characters.<br /><br />Roth was brave. She chose a thought-provoking ending. She loved her characters enough to be true to what drives them.<br /><br />I've had a small problem with the earlier books, even though I loved them. People, in general, are not one-dimensional. In 'Divergent' and 'Insurgent,' other than divergent people, you didn't see many people showing traits outside of their chosen faction. What on Earth is wrong with these people?<br /><br />In 'Allegiant,' I appreciated the reasons for what led these people to become so one-dimensional in the first place. Things finally made sense. I often wondered where Ms. Roth was going with all of this. This book is tightly written and better edited than the previous works. And don't get me wrong, those books were great. This was just better, and more purposeful. There didn't seem to be a wasted word in the entire book.<br /><br />I think those who were shocked today to read the ending will later find themselves thinking and re-thinking this series. It may not have had the perfect happy ending. To my knowledge, Roth wasn't writing a Harlequin romance. What she delivered was a well-crafted and thoughtful series on what it means to be human, selfless, brave, kind, intellectually curious and truth-seeking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got addicted to this game on Facebook...and finally... I can get it o my kindle! It's so much fun, and challenging. I think it's brain food, and a fun way to take a &quot;time out&quot; and enjoy :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you loved the Shining, you will really love this one. This is the best one that he has written in a while. I found myself compelled to read it non stop!
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|I love this movies. It is great when you can share it with the young kids in your family and they wonder how the director and the agents found the actors to look so much like former Presidents such as Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. Then you tell them the magic of movies... and watch how their eyes light up in amazement! If you have not seen this film, run and buy it now because it is that good you will want to own it!

B0029XFN9O|4.0|Remember this movie from when I was a kid watched it all the time growing up such a hilarious movie I actually like it better than the 1st one, I do however I do have one BIG problem with this blu-ray movie you know when the song \\"all alone on christmas\\" starts to play while kevin is walking around new york city. Well when the lady starts to sing the song I can hardly hear her singing it cause the tune of the song is really loud and the lady's singing voice seems like it's just background noise which you can barley hear. I don't know if it's a sound issue or maybe I just got a bad copy of the blu-ray movie but if anyone else has this issue let me know
B007SGM084|5.0|Very entertaining from her version of their meeting, to his version of their meeting. It was a fun book and very enjoyable!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I can't say that I liked this book as well as I did his first two books:  The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, but I greatly admire the manner in which Hosseini brings his characters together and solidifies his story line.  It all comes together in the end and we are all richer because of it.  I highly recommend this book!<br />Avid Reader
B00F9040HU|2.0|I thought great a fun free game with different games. Then early on you are asked to pay 5$ for the rest. NO WAY. It was not worth it. Not in any way.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Great intro on how Charles Xavier became confined to a wheelchair and how the &#34;School For Gifted Children&#34; came about.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I loved the album. The first song that got me was Follow Me. But then most of the songs grew better with each listening.<br />The are 2 songs sang by the bass player which are quite different but great. A very modern rock band that still write songs that move you. Very rare this days.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a great book and will keep you guessing throughout. I couldn't put it down. I always wanted to see where the story would go next.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good read.  Maybe a little slow in parts but well written.  I wasn't sure about it when I found out it was in interviews thoughout the book but it worked.
B00EUUIWZ6|3.0|This is an LGA 1150 socket, not an LGA 1155 as advertised here. I'm sure the product is fine, but beware when purchasing, I had to return it as my motherboard is LGA 1155.
B005OK725M|4.0|Probably Zoe Saldana's best movie.  It offers a lot of action and has a fairly good story.  I would recommend it for anyone that like action movies.
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|The Cd did not work. froze on screen. We ended up signing up for HBO so we could see the movie..which is outstanding
B0085KGHI6|5.0|wow this is the concert i ever seen.its just like being there.the sonds are super.i dont think they could have caught the feeling of a small club like this anymore.you even have muddy directing the players.it blew me away,video was great dint miss anything.its a trip back to yhe 80s.if you want a great concert at a good price,take your seat up frount and watch muddy waters and the rolling stones do there thing.and if thats not enough you have the cd to listen to.great buy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's addicting, especially when I'm trying to get rid of the jellies.  But it's a lot of fun and the kids love it.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|&#34;The Secret&#34; isn't really a secret at all.  It is the same information that has been passed down through the years.  The law of attraction.  The golden rule.  Fake it till you make it.  Still I rate it highly because the nature of self-help is that self-help usually requires a &#34;nudge&#34; from outside of ourselves.  It is motivational reading.  Nothing in your life will change unless you are open to change.  Things in your life will change more if you set a path, a direction, and actually take steps to help your life move in that direction.  If you need a little help, a little motivation, that first step and a few more to help you feel like you can accomplish something with your life, read the book.  It's got that.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I read book one after having watched season one on television, however decided to read book two before I watch the show.  I wondered if I would struggle with it, as I found the television show helped with book one due to so many characters, locations etc.  However, I feel I am now into the flow of the story and how Martin writes, so did not find it difficult at all.  It's not to say I didn't have to stop and think about certain parts as it again is rather full on, however in an extremely enjoyable way.<br /><br />The story continues on and again had me captured for all 900 pages and have now dived straight into book 3.  There's so much action, drama, humour and unexpected twists and again characters who I continue to love and some that I dislike which makes it all the more enjoyable to read.  I feel like the characters are part of my life and I'm not sure what I'll do when I finish the series as I can't imagine anything else living up to the quality of this series.  I sure am glad however that I've only just discovered it so I can read them all consecutively.  Hopefully the author is making good progress with book 6.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Seemingly slow because of all the characters involved, the web gets spun and the story takes off and into each home's secrets.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|this game gives you what you need in a war game the rooms are great the world is very colorful
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I amnnot at all happy with a pay sit. Freeze ups and morenare awlfil. I wish the many glitches would be corrected very very very soon.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Trent is back and brilliant. I had never been a big NIN fan but after listening to all tracks on \\"Hesitation Marks\\", not only did I buy this one but 4 of their previous albums and went to their concert, (which was one of the best all around performances I have ever seen in my life). He never stays stuck in a pattern, and has evolved with the times without loosing the amazing NIN depth, passion and truly sophisticated creativity in their music. Trent is simply an absolutely gifted innovative genius.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I originally got this game for my four year old son but i can not put it down!! Very fun
B000KG499M|5.0|This action base is a must have for all 1/100 gundams. If you're going to buy a kit, get this as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thus s game is awsome. There is so many levels. This game is so addicting. Im sure everyone will enjoy it
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|How could so many varied characters come together so naturally, easily. There is a surprise on every page as one life flits with another. Best yet. A must read.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This is a must watch. Bryan Cranston has done amazing acting. All the sessions are thrilling. Jesse and Skyler have done good supporting roles
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game keeps you busy. Challenging but very do able, my four year old can even match some of the tiles and has learned there is a hint button! Thanks for free app!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Tasty! Divine!  Delicious! And so addictive just like real candy! I am so glad to finally have this game for my Kindle too. There are way less glitches than on the computer.
B0012GMUI6|5.0|If you have any doubts about this wonderful piece of music, just take it on your next road trip and listen from beginning to end - LOUD - and non-stop.<br /><br />One of my Top Ten of all-time.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|For one thing, it's not that scary.  For another thing, I don't have kids and would probably be a sucky dad if I did, so I don't care if it's \\"too scary\\" for kids.  But that's totally beside the point.  The main thing is it's not that scary.  It's probably just as scary as the recent-ish remakes of 13 GHOSTS and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.  Not that scary, IMO, although I did enjoy the action and macabre of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL back when I was 16 (haven't re-watched it recently, I don't remember it well enough to know what I'd think of it if I saw it again).  They try to incorporate drama-esque elements in the storytelling, bits of character development and the actors do give it their all, which gives the film a more down to earth and believable feel, but the story was too thin and what little story there was didn't get the attention it deserves.  The focus of the film was the supernatural build-up that made it obvious to the household that the place was haunted.  The paranormal investigating itself takes less than half the film, and prior to then it just seems like 1979's THE AMITYVILLE HORROR in HD.<br /><br />IT's not a bad film, I just was very underwhelmed after the anticipation surrounding the film's release date.  Paid 4x more for this movie than I could have had I just waited.  It wasn't worth it.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I recommend this book for the casual reader that is interested in cyber security topics. It is not a must-read if you are already a cyber security professional. You probably already know about most of the topics covered. However, if you have friends and family that wonder what you do every day, you might hand this to them as a primer. And, if you are looking for some pretty good reading material for your next beach vacation, you could do a lot worse. “Zero Day” is a fun political thriller that shows computer security geeks saving the day. In it, Russinovich describes the nature of cyber crime and how a cyber terrorism campaign might be launched against the US.<br /><br />Read my full review on my blog site: Terebrate.
006202406X|5.0|The trilogy is complete. I'm sad that its over. I love this series. So bittersweet and heartbreaking. I'm very excited for the movie.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|I recommend this book for the casual reader that is interested in cyber security topics. It is not a must read for the cyber security professional, but it is a fun one. You will not learn anything new here, but you will enjoy wallowing around in a Clancy-esque story with cyber security tech as the main focus. In it, Russinovich describes the nature of the Chinese Cyber Espionage program, general hacking techniques, and the significance of STUXNET. If you are looking for some easy entertainment during a rainy weekend, this is your book.<br /><br />See my full review at my blog site: Terebrate.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|There are multiple issues with this book in addition to the most obvious one -the ending. Pass on this one.
B000LRVLPK|5.0|Wow..!<br /><br />This watch is an absolute beauty!<br /><br />I actually received an Armani ($400) watch for my birthday, but I liked this one better. This Swatch is less than half the cost of the Armani I returned, but much more beautiful and practical than the Armani.<br /><br />I've had it now for 4 months, and everyone has given a compliment. Even strangers at stores, movies, etc.<br /><br />It has a nice thick leather strap, a very well laid out dial, clear numbers, a magnified section over the date, nice big buttons and overall a very classic yet modern look and feel.<br /><br />You can never go wrong with this one.
B008BR3QOQ|5.0|If you are a fan of old time rock and roll/ psychedelic music, then you will love this album!  It's a combination of blues/ rock and funk.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the vivid colors and cute little sounds.  Very addictive  game.  I loved Candy Land as a kid and playing this lets me relive those childhood memories.
B00009R86L|3.0|There is nothing really wrong with this - but for me, it just added bulk and weight without really helping much.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book! Loved it! The characters pull you right in. Nicholas Sparks did not disappoint with this book. I knew they were making a movie about this book so I got to look forward to that as I read.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoy this game<br />I can really relax while playing. The best decision I have made as far as games go.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Product arrived a couple of days before the delivery date. Great product. It was very simple to install and make it work. Good for non-smart TVs
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|If you listen to Piano Guys, you can easily tell their music. The songs on this CD range from very slow and relaxing to up beat and fun!  I hate listening to Christmas music this early but there is just something about this CD that makes me want to listen to it from its release date until Christmas day.<br /><br />If you enjoy the Piano Guys music, buy this CD, you will not regret it!<br /><br />*update*<br /><br />After listening to it several times I have decided why this is so easy to listen to even though the holiday itself is so far away.  Most Christmas music focuses on the Christmas aspect. These guys though focus on the MUSIC aspect which makes this CD an excellent choice to listen to any time of year.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|The lead actors were magnificent and their singing was exquisite!  Bravo & Brava!  The stage setting and costumes made me feel like I was watching it live.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's a game you can't play for hours until you get really good at it and a high level but it is fun it doesn't demand a lot of attrition
B0001I561E|5.0|I bought this for my girls (ages 4 and 3) and they love the movie!  Sometimes they will watch 3 times in a row!  This is also one of my favorite Disney movies!  I'm glad I found this on Amazon since it is not available in stores!  I'm glad my girls have another Disney Princess movie to add to their collection!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really  enjoyed  this book. It's the first Balducci book I've read.  It was interesting to see the softer side of a hired gun.
0857208748|5.0|Great book!! Couldn't put it down! In Flynn's usual style, tremendous plot, characters were believable and exciting, kept me guessing until the end. Really enjoyed this book!!
B003VIW8DK|5.0|Love this cd.<br />I am a Bryan Ferry fan from way back and I thought this was one of his best!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game forever to come on amazon and i was looking for an app to get and i saw this app and its the best i have ever had on amazon and its just amazing. I say that this is an app from app heaven and theres no better app than this app. this app is going to be more popular than MCPE it has 20000 or more comments or reviews this app is going past that in just a month. the only thing i dont like about the app on amazon is that it cost money to use iteams so im reciving these extra moves for nothing but this is the best app out there
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm daily on my Kindle and absolutely love it!!!  Great and AFFORDABLE!!!  ;)  Easy to Figure out and set times and days and sounds.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Hilarious.  Well written and superbly acted.  Entire cast was great.  Would watch it again anytime.  Brad Pitt is extremely funny in this movie.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love playing this app to work the mind. It makes u think on some of them and some are really easy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|No glitches. Works perfectly. Super fun game I play it constantly and I can't get enough of it.. I highly recommend candy crush saga
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|August Burns Red's Rescue & Restore met every expectation I had for them, and then some. They got very creative with this album, using instruments foreign to this genre. I was very pleased with the speed and manner that it was shipped, as well.
B0064O927I|4.0|people from work asked about my watch because it looks cool.. cheaper than the swatch website itself but all the same. great bargain
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My daughter and son loved it. The best interactive story made. Worked great on the kindle. Hopefully the makers do another storybook.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it is awesome. I don't know about you,  but i like hands on activities. It think it is cool that we have to raise horses too.
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|Full disclosure: I did NOT buy this microphone! I did check it out at our local audio shop and frankly I was stunned with the very poor build quality of this mic! I've used othe Rode mics (NTG2, etc) that are top quality, but this videomic pro is ridiculously flimsy!<br /><br />The battery compartment door is an abomination--very difficult to access/open, very flimsy, and there's one little plastic tab at the top that makes the whole thing work and if that breaks off (which seems HIGHLY likely given how thin and small the tab is) that's it, you're done! I do documentary work usually in remote locations, and there is NO WAY I would trust this mic to get there in one piece and make it all the way through a project.<br /><br />Also, when you take the foam wind diffuser off, it's really shocking to see how cheaply made this mic is---it's little more than a thin plastic tube with white cloth filter material glued on with the itty-bitty mic all the way down towards the end. By comparison, the standard Rode VideoMic (at half the price) seems to have a much better build quality, though the shock mount is ridiculously large and the gain switches inside the battery compartment are poorly placed and very difficult to use. I know they say they use plastic to keep the weight down, but truthfully there's no way this mic would survive any kind of drop or bump while attached to your rig. I know it has a ten year warranty, but I really doubt that Rode would fix or replace units with broken mounts, broken battery door tabs, etc.<br /><br />Lastly, the 3.5mm plug wire is super thin and cheap feeling, and I really doubt that this would hold up to serious use and I'm sure the audio quality must suffer because of the super thin, flimsy wires that they used.<br /><br />I'm used to much better quality from Rode, and I'm still stunned with how poorly made this $200+ mic really is! For the money, you're much better off getting a Rode NTG2 or an Audio-technica AT875R and a $25 shock mount togive you much better performance and a build quality that will last for years--all for about the same price as this cheaply-made Rode videomic pro.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Amazon finally added Candy Crush Saga. Really fun and addictive  game. Probably the best game I have played in a long time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I found it fun top play when I'm bored or late at night before bed cause in a night owl so I stay up late all the time
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I've never been a big fan of the Kindle Fire. There's a few things that turn me off from the start, but that's for a different review.<br /><br />I'll start this by saying that Magic 2014 is an awesome game. I've played it on the PC, and it was easily the best thing that Wizards could have ever done. The tablet version is more or less a port of the console app version, hence the 3 stars. On that note, this game does not work on the Kindle Fire, despite it being available for download. This is not the app maker's fault, it is Amazon's fault due to the many problems that surround the Kindle.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|One of &#34;those&#34; serials!  I love it and although I missed a nite or two I always have the Revenge 1 and 2 seasons to go back to.  Looking forward to Victoria's demiss but that would probably mean the end of the series and that would not do!  Thank you for the great deals and I look forward to adding series 3 of Revenge to my collection.  Thanx.  E

A book that can convey emotions intensely that I fiercely feel I'm actually going through what the book characters are enduring. Profound and personal thoughts told by a book character can sweep you away in love, can break your heart in pain, can make you ecstatic in laughter.<br /><br />This is not an easy subject to write or read, but the author has written a lovely, touching and highly unique story with remarkable characters. Told in a comical yet heartbreaking story, this author makes me think about real-life people who go through this. It made me admire them even more, it made me think about how momentary life can be, how everything can change quickly, and how adaptable we are. In the midst of unfortunate circumstances a one of a kind love story is told, and most of all a story about how we should cherish life always. Okay?<br /><br />\\"We made the story funny. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.\\"
B008PUEZ6C|5.0|A  wonderful story of two boys growing up during the period of Hitler's rise to power.  The outcome is startling.
B0084AZXKK|2.0|This book was very boring and I barely understood it. If you are younger than 12 you will not understand it otherwise, from the parts I did not understand I was a good book
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I was looking for some escapist FUN and Marvel Comic's &#34;Thor&#34; fit the bill. My husband and I both enjoyed the fantastic, silly nonsense and I think its safe to say this is a movie an entire family could enjoy.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I returned it. Yes, it works, but the interface, at least from the Nexus 7 tablet, is clumsy, complicated and tedious.<br /><br />I bought it thinking it would be an alternative to my Roku box, so I could stream Youtube, If that describes you, just wait for Roku to get a clue and make a deal with Youtube,
B00006I53S|4.0|For the cost of this lens, its very good. I've taken some really great shots with it over the years. The only thing holding it back is, it wasn't fast enough as far aperture. It wasn't the best lens in poor light. I will keep this lens as a back up though because its not a bad lens and takes very crisp images in good light. I used it for portraits, landscapes and nature shots. I replaced this with the Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens. There really is no comparison between the two. They are both good but the latter is great.<br /><br />I would give this lens 3.5 stars if I could. I guess 4 is apt.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I literally JUST finished Allegiant and had to head out to see what others were saying about it. I was completely shocked to see all the negative reviews. Most of them I have to believe are provoked by the way it all ends, and I have to completely disagree with them. Tris' final decision makes perfect sense to me, given who she was written to be at her very core.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />From the way Insurgent ended, I knew we were in for a wild ride once Allegiant was in our hands, but I certainly didn't see the true nature of the dystopian world coming the way it did. Genetic manipulation and the chaos it caused leading the US Government to make some radical choices, allowing the pursuit of science and perfection to turn them into god. When that failed, their answer was to start all over by resetting the entire city's memories. Someone has to stop them. And of course Tris, our ever selfless heroine, does just that.<br /><br />Tobias, Christina, Marcus, Uriah, and the rest of the Allegiant cast journey though the discovery of the true reality of who they are and why the Factions and their city of Chicago are so important to those outside the fence. But it's the bitter reality of finding out his, and others, genetic makeup isn't perfect enough for the government that brings division and confusion to Tobias, even among his friends. Thankfully, this group is strong enough to believe in themselves, in who they are as people, without allowing those who think otherwise to divide them completely. At least not for long.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias continue to struggle through their relationship and they both make painful decisions but they are finally able to come to the understanding that life does that to couples. Just like in reality, they realize that holding a grudge against someone you love isn't the right answer. Life is painful, and the only way to survive the pain is to agree to give forgiveness before it's even required. And there is a lot to forgive in Allegiant.<br /><br />Tobias' poor choice leads to the eventual death of a friend, and Tris' wise decision leads to the ultimate sacrifice. Something all us readers should have seen coming. Painful and heart wrenching as it was to read, every character held true to who they were written to be. Having the book written between Tobias and Tris' point of views truly only made sense in the end, but that's where the real power in this book comes through. Dealing with the loss of war, rebellion, and the death of those who believe in the cause enough to give their lives for it takes the last chapters of this whole trilogy to a new level. Tobias' character is pushed to the limit, and we get front row seats as he shows us the real strength it takes to move past the loss of someone you love, and the courage it takes to allow those who've hurt you the most the opportunity to make things right.<br /><br />I do agree with those who are comparing this final book in the Divergent Series to Mockingjay of the Hunger Games Trilogy, in that, despite the tragic ending and saying good-bye to several beloved and vital characters, Allegiant, though horribly painful to finish, left me feeling much more satisfied and convinced that those who were left will indeed succeed. It was a brilliant end to the story of Beatrice Prior, and a fresh beginning for everyone who survived.<br /><br />It will be a long time before I can emotionally handle re-reading this series, but it will forever be one of my favorite book series to date.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Roth. You've not only written an amazing trilogy, but you've given us a lot to ponder. And THAT is the mark of a brilliant dystopian series.n Allegiant.<br /><br />Tobias' poor choice leads to the eventual death of a friend, and Tris' wise decision leads to the ultimate sacrifice.

B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I am a huge del Toro fan, but this is utterly unwatchable. I had to stop watching after 30 minutes, and the only reason I lasted that long was that I watched Screen Junkies' Honest Trailer for the film.<br /><br />I honestly didn't think anyone could make a Michael Bay film any worse than Michael Bay himself, but del Toro has hit the mark. This film is dumb, dumb, dumb. I feel stupider for having sat through those 30 minutes than if I'd spent the same amount of time swilling gin.<br /><br />What a complete disappointment.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I read Divergent this summer and then finished Insurgent last week. Thought both were good, possibly great, depending on this vital, third book.<br />Oh boy.<br />I'm not going to go into spoilers, but I will say that the only reason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one is because I'll give the author some props for having the guts to do the ending she wanted to do.<br />The only problem is that the ending didn't really fit with the characters she had portrayed the rest of the series. Tris and Four had been set up to be unique characters, but then when Roth uses both as first-person POV in this book instead of just Tris, it weakens the characters instead of strengthening them. In a way, she painted herself into a corner by going first-person in Divergent instead of third person, but it didn't work in this book.<br />There were plot holes. It seems as though ANY authority figure is automatically corrupt, but most can change their ways with a simple speech. Every guard is pathetic and can't watch the person they are supposed to guard. Tris becomes an infallible source of information (far different than in Insurgent) and Four becomes weak and fragile.<br />By the time I was halfway through, I was trudging through, just plodding along to finish and the ending just confirmed the rating for me.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I do not ever remember hearing of orphan trains so this information came as a surprise to me.. a sad surprise .  The author has a wonderful way of  linking the past  with the present.  A sad, honest, story showing once again that a person can survive and prosper despite his/her past  circumstances.

B004QKNXIQ|3.0|I had heard a lot of hype leading up to watching this movie with my wife. After wards we were kind of let down. I think it was mostly because we didn't really like the male lead. You take the girl who has only known one person her entire life and introduce the first person of the opposite sex to her so they can fall in love? We left the end of the movie feeling like she could have really done better for herself.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|First of all, I commend the author for sticking to the story that she intended to tell from the beginning. I do not believe for one second that the \\"thing\\" that happens, that has so many people upset, was for the sake of adding drama. And I'm saddened for the author to be getting so much heat for writing HER story the way she wanted to tell it.<br />As for my review, well I do not want to give anything away at all so I'll be brief.<br />I loved the twists and turns. I loved the dual POV's - which I believe were very necessary in this one and really helped in knowing who Tobias really is. I was enthralled from the very first page until the very end.<br />In my opinion, which is just that, an opinion, so I hope I do not offend anyone which is not my intention, this book lived up to the hype and was a great ending to a great series.<br />I'm very much looking forward to whatever else Ms. Roth will be releasing in the future.
B00DGXGUSY|4.0|Amon Amarth is one of the few bands that haven’t needed to drastically evolve their sound. Their patented sound of melodic death metal and Viking themed lyrics have yet to grow tired. It still gets the blood pumping. Boring drive to work? Slogging your way through chores? Falling asleep during your workout? Well toss &#34;Deceiver of the Gods&#34; into your eardrums, and you’ll want to slap some face paint on, charge into battle and crush some skulls!<br /><br />&#34;Deceiver&#34; has the lovable Amon Amarth sound, however, this album sees them sprinkling some classic heavy metal sound on their melo-death style, and it works. The title track is one of the most epic openers they have done. If you don’t get “Father of the Wolf” stuck in your head you have very strong willpower, and when you eventually arrive your fiery afterlife (you know what you did) you’ll hope “Hel” is the soundtrack. “Hel” is the most experimental track the band as done, getting ex-Candlemass vocalist Messiah Marcolin to bring something different.<br /><br />My favorite track on the album is the closer “Warriors of the North.” It is pure epicness clocking just over eight minutes. It is a headbanger about banished warriors the whole way through and is worth the price of the entire album.<br /><br />It is very apparent listening to this album (and the &#34;Under the Influence&#34; EP) that the band was having fun recording it, and that fun is infectious. “Blood Eagle” proves they can even make a delightfully catchy song about brutally torturing a person to death. &#34;Deceiver&#34; has a similar feel to &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God,&#34; in that it is a collection of very good songs, but doesn’t have quite the cohesion as an overall album to stand with the bands stronger work such as &#34;Surtur Rising&#34; or &#34;With Odin on Our Side,&#34; which is still my favorite Amon album.<br /><br />That being said, there isn’t an Amon Amarth album I’ve ever disliked or would give less than four stars, this album included. &#34;Deceiver&#34; will serve a similar purpose to &#34;Twilight&#34; in creating a fun, addictive, accessible album that will help recruit new fans to their ever-growing army. So grab this album, sharpen your weapons, and charge into Valhalla!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Wow! What else can I say that can express my appreciation for this app.<br />I thank God that He endows people with imagination and the knowledge to create and bring into reality what is in the spiritual realm convenience and order, God is a God of order and this app helps put my thoughts in order, organze my written work both personal and spiritual. But I do wish I can delete a notebook. All in all it is a great app to have, work with, and use. I also have it on my iphone where I can dictate notes because I can easily forget what's on my mind. TGBTG.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|These amazon reviews for Allegiant are much more entertaining than the book itself!<br /><br />There are plenty of things that I resign myself to doing when reading a book meant for young adults. (I'm no spring chicken.)<br /><br />Suspend disbelief and ignore glaring plot holes for the sake of a good adventure? No problem.<br />Chalk up a pattern of poor decision making to the naivete of youth? Sure.<br />Roll my eyes and skim through angst-filled dialogue that is expected of teenage romances? If I really, really must.<br /><br />Veronica Roth, however, is not a teenager. And while I can give her credit for expertly depicting the dysfunction of a 16 year old's brain, she does not have the license to write like one of my 10th grade students. Chapter after chapter, we are forced to suffer through repetitive plot lines (Is this rebellion number 3? 4? 15?), snore inducing prose, disjointed (and unnecessary) narratives, and an incredibly poor use of the thesaurus function in Word. (Does someone have a count on how many times Tris' \\"blond head\\" appears in a crowd and her \\"petite frame\\" jumps into Tobias' tattooed arms? The editors need to return their bonus checks.)<br /><br />I liked Divergent. No really, I did. Insurgent was a slight letdown but at least I cared enough to be disappointed with Tris and her inability to use summon rational thought. I was also willing to give Roth the benefit of the second book curse that plagues many a trilogy. I knew it was a lost cause by the time I hit Chapter 15. Instead of skipping straight to the Epilogue, I rode this train until it crashed and burned on the Weapons Room floor. (If you caught that reference, you have my empathy).<br /><br />Save your money and go re-read Harry Potter. Or buy a book that is actually written for adults.

B000V6AD46|5.0|Always enjoyed their music, which my mom had introduced me to as a boy, so now when I listen it also takes me back.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I'm not into musicals at all but the tied in Beatles music to tell the story, the acting, the special effects are all top notch. There will always be critics and it's easier to point out the negatives sometime but just grab some popcorn, a soda, maybe someone special and give it a try. My wife and I love it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|If this is the future of gaming, we're in trouble.  I was thrilled to finally see this for kindle, but got a rude awakening.  Are you kidding!  Never saw a game where you had to beg for lives from friends, or worse yet, have to pay for lives!  While this game is fun, I will not play it to make the developers rich.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It's a good logic game on par with &quot;Cross Me&quot;  and &quot;Cross Me Color&quot;. There are a couple of 10x10 puzzles which are unsolvable without hints. Other than that, it would be great it the developer gave the option to get more puzzles or create your own.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|Good price, great show, and the DVD's worked well (no scratches or anything). What more is there to say? I am pleased that I purchased it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Kept my attention throughout,  didn't like the way it ended though.  Kind of petered out instead of ending strong.  Otherwise, loved it.

B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Good:<br />1) Special Effects were awesome (even considering #2 of the Bad list.)<br />2) Monsters and mechs were cool.<br />3) Fun to watch.<br />4) No Jar-Jar<br /><br />Bad<br />1) Predictable story with stock characters. (How with Del Toro?)<br />2) Action sequences were dark and hard to follow, a lot of blur ala Transformers. This was a promised improvement that fell short.<br />3) Too much of an over-simplified story. I don't think this told the story people wanted to see.<br />4) A lot of bad logic, bad science and bad psychology.<br /><br />Ugly<br />1) A big disappointment: the lackluster response this movie saw in the market may cripple other attempts to break this genre into the mainstream.<br />2) Ron Perlman abuse
B0091REZMW|2.0|I don't like the design of this game. It's seems way too geared at spending money to get anywhere. It's graphics are very small for a tablet. Cannot recommend.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Love love this movie. So clever, so engaging, unlike any other animated movie. My boys ages 2 & 4 adore this movie & so do Mommy & Daddy
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addictive. It is truly a very fun game. Can not put this very happy game down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! Crushing candy on Kindle! Great graphics. Great challenges. Best matching game ever. Time to get my sweet tooth on !
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|SPOILER ALERT: I'm with all the other passionate readers who hate this book and are devastated by the ending. What a lame way for our brave Tris to die! She survived the oh-so-terrifying death serum only to succumb to gunshot wounds from David the pansycake whose a** she could've whipped, even while she was fighting through the serum effects. Gimme a break!<br /><br />I refuse to watch the movie now and I'd be surprised if it does well enough to fund the sequels since so many of us fans are angry about how it all ends and none of us want to get re-attached and pulled back into this journey of endless violence and pointless loss.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Super fun movie for all ages.<br />Great story, great animation.<br />We quote from it all of the time.<br />Fun to watch for EVERY holiday.
B007CLSE8K|4.0|This was a nice entertaining mindless move, perfect for some chill time.  Watched with my husband and 13 yr old who enjoyed it too.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|great app. There are alot of different brain training games. the only problem I have with it is that the Sudoku. First it quits working as soon as you finish the game; and second the back round needs changed it's hard to see the numbers in the middle.  As soon as those problems are fixed I will give it 5 stars.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus, and directed by Richard Donner who is widely known for the Lethal Weapon series, The Goonies was released June 7, 1985. The story follows a group of kids who call themselves \\"The Goonies\\" through an adventure to try and save their neighborhood that is being foreclosed and turned into a golf course. Mikey, played by Sean Astin known for his star roles in Rudy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, is the unofficial leader of the group that starts him and his friends on a quest to obtain the riches of an infamous pirate known as One-eyed Willie. With only one day left for Mikey's father to come up with the money to save the neighborhood, the Goonies are losing hope and decide to scavenge what they can from the attic and discover the treasure map of One-eyed Willie and decide to go on one last adventure and search for the rich stuff. Mikey's older brother Brand, played by Josh Brolin known for his part in No Country for Old Men and the 2010 version of Wall Street, tries to stop Mikey from continuing this endeavor but is tied in when the group crosses paths with a family of outlaws known as the Fratellis, Anne Ramsey as the mom and her two sons played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano. When the Fratellis learn of the treasure, it turns into a foot race for the treasure with deadly consequences if the Goonies can't find a way to come out on top. This is an adventure comedy that is a must see. The story addresses the difficulties of being a teenager and shows how a group of kids with different background and personalities can work together to overcome the obstacles placed before and beat the odds. The Goonies is a good family film to watch that will keep you entertained with the variety of themes and characters displayed.
0812550706|5.0|One of my favorites at a good price, and with a quick ship. This is a great book for a budding mind and imagination. My next favorite is The Speaker For The Dead.
0061124958|5.0|Great book and always a classic. Bought this got my 8 year old summer reading and at first she didn't want it. After she started the book she cried for this story. Recommend for all kids.

B001MSMUH0|4.0|I liked The Element because it was encouraging and inspirational.  I've felt stuck for a long time about my career.  The book didn't get me unstuck, but it got me thinking about what I'm good at and what I really love to do.  I would have liked more advice for career changers, but that didn't seem to be the overall emphasis.  I think this book would be best for someone who didn't do well in school to show them that they can be successful; or a young person in high school or recently graduated to help them really reflect on what they want to do with their lives and find some genuine direction.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Amazing because it's incredibly fun &amp; entertaining, yet it's challenging enough to keep it interesting... Terrible because it's soooooooo addicting &amp; there are not enough hours in the day to play as long as you'd want to.<br />I'm relatively new on the &quot;Candy Crack&quot; bandwagon &amp; for months I told myself that I wouldn't give in to the peer pressure, but clearly I did &amp; there's been no turning back since. But, it's great, I love it more than I should, &amp; I can't get enough of it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I like the cast, care to detail of the era and especially the authentic costume. I look forward to each and every installment.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|What can you say about this movie....except that it totally rocks!  It's a John Carpenter movie w/Kurt Russell.  What else do you want?  It has action, some comedic moments, and a cool soundtrack.  This movie is always enjoyed in my house!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on my pc for awhile now. I was very excited to see it FINALLY available for Kindle Fire. So far it is working great on my Kindle Fire.
006202406X|1.0|So disappointed with this book. Veronica Roth's  attempt of a bold ending by killing the main character was cruel and unnecessary, evil even. Good luck to Summit trying to sell tickets for the movie adaption of this series whats the point now? Veronica made it very hard for loyal fans to want to see this movie. I was a fan but am no longer and will never buy another Veronica Roth book again and I will not be seeing now either. Shame on you Veronica Roth! Enjoy your millions but you had ruined this series for scores of former fan including myself. Was it worth it?
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After waiting almost breathless for several months for this to release, I devoured Allegiant in a few hours...and it left me hollow.<br /><br />No, I wasn't expecting a Happy Ever After. But, after spending two book building up great characters and developing interesting plot lines this book just watered them down, tied them up in a neat bow, and offered up an easy ending. I cried, yes. Not because of the what happened at the end, but because the story didn't deliver on its promises and I'm left unfulfilled.<br /><br />Where is the kick-ass, confident, risk taking from solid gut instinct, Tris that I grew to love?<br />Another reviewer nailed it: this is just another version of Divergent--only not as interesting. Do yourself a favour and don't read this book. Make up your own ending, it's bound to be better. :/
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a while. Make sure you check this book out...and give it a chance. The beginning was a little slow - but I promise once you get into it, you won't be able to put it down!
B00B4804KS|2.0|Always liked this movie.  Haven't tried the 3D yet but watched the Blu-ray.  It was horrible, very grainy.  I had to take the disc out to verify I inserted the Blu-ray disc and not the DVD.  Very disappointed with the transfer.  Worse than DVD.  More like watching a VHS copy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kept me guessing in the beginning...good read but didn't really like the twist toward the middle of the book. Overall, good book but in my opinion not worth the hype I had heard...
B000065V42|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie? Awesome for the kids, just a good old movie for any anyone, any age. Enjoy!
006202406X|2.0|Allegiant by Veronica Roth<br />Third book in the Divergent Series<br />Pages: 544<br />Rating: 2 of 5<br /><br />I had such high hopes for this book! First, it gets dropped from a 3 to a 2 because I found myself skipping through some parts that felt unnecessarily drawn out. The book was good as I was reading it and it has a lot of romantic and exciting moments between Four and Tris that I loved but the whole series was ruined by the ending. Honestly, I had such high hopes for this finale and it could have ended so many different ways but this ending left me wanting so much more. Disappointment is the main reaction I am having and that sucks more than the feeling you get when you want to keep reading despite the novel ending but by the last couple chapters I was left... empty. It felt like all my hopes were built up for this amazing unknown exciting conclusion and then they just left me wishing and hoping that the ending wouldn't be left that way. I don't (won't) give spoilers but I just wish it had ended differently. I'm known for giving most books 5 stars and great reviews but with a pit in my stomach I just... can't. I wish I could take some Abnegation serum and forget the ending of this book. When I finished I kept thinking I should've stopped after Insurgent. I won't be re-reading this series.<br /><br />For more reviews visit my blog at www(dot)yailovebooks(dot)blogspot(dot)com
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My family absolutely loves having Chromecast installed into our lcd tv.  We can take it anywhere we go that has an HDMI or USB or port.  It would make sense though to have more than just one.  Since we all have different taste in programs.<br /><br />I defiantly recommend this to all my friends and family.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Ireally like it.  I have tried, will be trying more weather and surroundings info, for this part of the country.  Anyways, I loved the APP!!!!<br /><br />Sure, tweak it all U want.<br /><br />Hwilliams1970@gmail.com
B0034G4P9E|4.0|I really, really love this movie. I'm not much of a UFC fan; I've only watched this and \\"Here Comes the Boom,\\" but this movie is simply amazing. There is some great backstory concerning Tommy and Brendan, and NIck Nolte's character is phenomenal; he really did an outstanding job. The end kind of annoys me when Brendan won't commit and finish the job; you're fighting for your family, man! But I do understand its necessity for the story and can see where he's coming from, and it is essential for the ending of the film.<br /><br />I give the movie itself a five stars, and I'd give it more if I could. I give the product four stars because the digital copy included is only available in Canada. I'm not Canadian.
B00E9O6C96|3.0|Sounds great but way to clunky slow old school controls ..advancing through songs was painfull ..After having Apple devices ..this thing could be a challenge

B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This is definitely my favorite collection of short stories. I finished them in just 2 days. Mr Rossi did an amazing job on his first book. He had me since the beginning. The plots are engaging. Great writing. If you are a sci-fi and erotica lover this book is a must! Highly recommended.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I absolutely love the first two books of the Divergent series and I read them both multiple times. I wish I never even picked up Allegiant. I cried because it was not at all what I wanted the series to end or more importantly how I needed it to end. I'm absolutely terrified to even watch the series in movie form because I already know that Allegiant will disappoint me. If anything, give us a beautiful ending in a movie or something. They change those things all the time.<br /><br />I regret reading this book. The idea was okay, but the conclusion was terribly unnecessary. I'd be shocked to talk to a true fan that liked this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when I found this game for the kindle. Now I don't need to go on the computer to play. Now the game goes with me wherever I go. Love the graphics the are sharper on the kindle. Thank you for make this game against the kindle.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a fun game to pass time, however I wish you didn't have to purchase crystals to make any progress.
0385486804|4.0|good book to enjoy at your leisure . Did not expect it to be this good in any way.Im glad i read it.
B005BY3XHC|4.0|A book about growing spiritually and being one with the universe to let greatness flow through us to fulfill our desires. Definitely reminded me of &#34;The Secret&#34; and Napoleon Hill's &#34;Think and Grow Rich&#34; at times but truly drives beneath the monetary attainment to self fulfillment through spiritual growth.  Also talks about finding you dharma or purpose in life that will give you meaning and keep you energized.  A very inspiring quick read. The key idea that resonated with me is you should be happy when you are filling a little over whelmed with you re devours because that implies you are stretching your boundaries.  Favorite quotes: &#34;Good luck is nothing more than preparedness and opportunity coming together&#34; and &#34;The past is history, the future is a mystery and this moment is a gift. That is why this moment is called the present&#34;.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|what a  great funny comidy, Barbara Strisand was simply great in this movie. I would recomment anyone that likes a good comidy to watch this
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This is a  good movie, you have to take the time to watch it all. I recommend this to anyone that likes this kind of movies
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the series.  Adding the 3rd season to keep my library up to date.  One of those shows I can just keep watching.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I felt compelled to write because I almost didn't buy this book based on all the negative reviews.  And it's a great book, one that you really shouldn't miss as long as you can bring yourself to accept that Mark isn't in it.  If you can look at this book without worrying about what preceded it, it's really fantastic -- easily as lovable as the first two.  I, fortunately, haven't read the Bridget Jones books since they were released, so it was easy for me to leap into her life as it is now.  And to be honest, I think I'd infinitely prefer this to a story about hapless Bridget getting into more scrapes that Mark has to save her from...I'll probably read this again (and I never read the first two more than once).
B0086449YA|4.0|This album is fantastic.  It is shame that Knopfler's solo work does not get more attention.  The title track is one of the best historical ballads released in years.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2 are combined in a double DVD package. Seeing as you can get it cheap at most places, it's definitely worth getting especially if you're a fan of Ghostbusters.<br /><br />Ghostbusters is a comedy classic. No question. It ranks at the pinnacle of 80s SNL related comedies with The Blues Brothers, Fletch and several others. Sure the special effects may sem dated (although they have aged better than many others ones from the same era). But the fantastic performances and often hilarious lines still hold up.<br /><br />Ghostbusters 2 is not quite a disasyer as some people claim. It's a lesser sequel and it's not anywhere near as funny as the original Ghostbusters. But it also doesn't fall into the category of awful sequels that tarnish the memory of the original (too many to mention). It has some amusing moments even if the movie is more or less a zerox of its predecessor.<br /><br />In addition to the DVDs there are also special features. Ghostbusters contains a making of feature and commentary from Ramis and director Ivan Reitman. Ghostbusters II features two The Real Ghostbusters Cartoons. I wasn't a fan of the cartoon Ghostbusters when it was on in the 80s and I'm not a fan of it now. There's alos an entertaining if kitschy scrapbook.<br /><br />So if you're a fan of Ghostbusters, this set is definitely recommended. Sure most viewers are likely to wear out Ghostbusters while hardly reaching for Ghostbusters II. But that's a minor complaint.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|If all you want is an annoying program that is worth less then free then this is for you.  All it does is input list.  Do not expect to export, make new entries (at least on Kindle Fire), change font or any basic functions at all.  There isn't a menu or other things that you would expect to see.  My suggestion would be is to bypass this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush! I'm very pleased to have found it for my kindle. Now on to beat more sugar loaded levels.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|Not as much fun and the first Star Wars, but don't let that stop you from trying it.  I do hope Rovio plans to continue the series.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|one of johnny depp's more tongue 'n cheek performances. has some good frights, but also some laughs sprinkled around. still makes a good october/halloween entry to watch.
0930289234|4.0|good for teens that don't enjoy reading. story requires interpretation, something kids resist if they think it's work. check it out.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never been more disappointed in the last book of a series than I was reading this book. Normally I reread a series at least 3-4 times. Because of this book I will never read this series again, no matter how much I loved the first two books. They are ruined. Forever.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />I found this book far too different from the other two books. I did not like seeing into Tobias' head at all. Part of what I enjoyed with the first two books was the general mystery surrounding Tobias and how he affected Tris. This book was just, oh hey here is how Tobias is feeling and here is how Tris is feeling. It took all the fun out of trying to understand their relationship and we focused strictly on their actions. I was not invested in the story because of this and I even had to flip back to the first page in some of the chapters because their thoughts had the exact same style and I wasn't sure whose head I was in.<br /><br />Then the ending. That choice flushed away this entire series. We don't read these types of books for realism. I personally read these books to escape from reality not have it slap me in the face. The death wasn't in any way worthy for the character that was built up through these books. It was a death that left you questioning if she even had the right to do that to everyone at the compound. It threw away this moral and selfless person and had her do the very thing that she hated. In my mind it was just as bad as resetting the city. Only David and the council were responsible for those big decisions that affected Tris so much yet she reset everyone in the compound, guilty and innocent. It didn't fit her. The rest of the book after her death was one of the most painful and pointless things I have ever read. There was nothing to take away from it but heartache, and I have enough of that without this book thank you very much.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|My boyfriend and I were a little late catching on to the Walking Dead stuff but fell in love with it instantly. As soon as I caught wind that this season was out on DVD, I pre-ordered it. I was stoked when it arrived the day it released but even more happy that I got a credit for the original price I paid. Needless to say it's has already been watched in full and we're on to season four... on TV :/
006202406X|2.0|Well folks, this is a tough one. I, like so many others, have been greatly anticipating the release of this book. First of all, I really struggled with the changing POV. I never could remember who was narrating but more importantly I lost that connection with Tris that was so wonderful about the first two books. I had been able to relate to her and empathise with her. The inclusion of the additional POV turned her from my best friend into a stranger. And that ending... Throughout the series Tris had represented hope to me. Hope that she could make her world a better place. And hope that she could finally live the life she struggled so hard and sacrificed so much for. It was not to be I guess. I applaud the author for creating such dynamic and imaginative series. But she broke my heart a little tonight and, as much as I don't want to hold it against her, it may be a long time before I'm able to read another book of hers again.
B004A2V3K0|4.0|Great CD with all the hits...good memories and still love every song.  If you get a chance, go see them in their Because We Can tour...they play them all!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|For years I have heard and read many things about thinking and the more I read the more I am convinced that we need to be careful about what we think. We watch the TV, ready the news papers, listen to other people telling us what they think and we really get messed up, it has shown me to be more careful about what I listen to in every direction, our minds can get to be a garbage dump if we aren't careful, it started before we were born and I am finding out it takes time and al ot of effort to clean things up.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great actors, great acting, great story-line. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie. I would highly recommend this movie to men and women of all ages and races.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very cool and addictive game. Each level makes you wonder what the next is like while maintaining incremental difficultly throughout the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much! My friend intoduced me to it on her ipad and I fell in love with it! My sister and I like to make cool things in creative and i like to kill creepers in survival! You need to get this app!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books, loved them and I retread both of them. I hated this book, hated it. I know the author created the character's but to kill one. Of the main character's is heart breaking. We as the readers invest so much time to love them them and we want the happily ever after. I for one do to want reality that is why I love to read. I wish I would have stopped the series at Insurgent and made up my own HEA. I will go see the movie and even the second one if they make one, but I will not see the third one.. This book was just much of the same, Tris and Four deserved a happy ever after. I hope Mrs. Roth is happy because many of her fans are disappointed and heart broken.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I didn't like flixter and the UV.  It messed up my computer.  Shut down my anti virus......Totally not good.  Why doesn't Amazon let me have the digital version, without all the software and hardware conflicts?  I felt like I had a digital war on my personal computer.<br />The movie was best horror movie in a long time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was a surprise discovery for me, and post-apocalyptic story lines have always been a bit of overkilll for me. But in this case, the author's approach was less heavy-handed, and the premise for this society -- and the individual characters and their stories -- proved immediately interesting. I was through with the series before I knew it, and craving more.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Like the app. Good for looking at weather for travel locations. No problems with my battery. Easy to use. Nice for a quick look at the day .
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I agree with everyone else about the grammar.  I'm ashamed to say I made it to the 4th book and will not even try to read any more in this series by this author.  There is one sentence from that book that just sticks in my head \\"They both laughed, amused at their own jokes, and Luanda tried to think fast, faster than she ever had in her life.\\" There's so many instances where someone is in a fight and they need to save their friend but can't get there fast enough yet the hero is able to swing his sword and cut through the enemies sword, or they cut peoples heads off, or cut them in half.  That's just not believable. Buyer beware - maybe you like that, if you do this is a pretty good series otherwise stay away.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|I uninstalled this game after about a half hour of having it.  You play the same 6-8 games over and over and over.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|There is really not very much challenge in playing this game.  It is fun for a while but gets to be very repetitive.
B00867HDTA|3.0|This is a fun game for soccer fans but it does get repetitive after a while and you tend to forget the game exists.
B00ESF285S|5.0|This book has been my favorite Dr. Seuss book since I first heard it as a child, and even now as an adult it makes me cry every time I read it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Will to be honest this game wasn't that bad. It was a awsome game.You should downloaded it you might think or say oh it's going to suck but to tell the truth it won't suck.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriends mom because I borrowed hers and spilled my drink on it on accident (turning it into fifty shades of pink). It got here fast (2 days!) and the condition was like NEW! :)
B001O1O71C|5.0|This short book is a fable of Nazi Germany, providing a child's view of events. Told from the point of view of the 9-year old son of the Out-With commandant who befriends Shmuel, a child on the other side of the fence who wears striped pajamas, this is one of the more thought-provoking I've read in a long time.<br /><br />It's amazing how powerful a simply-written book such as this can be. Highly recommended!!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Gladwell is well-read and tells an excellent story. His writing style mimics his speechifying ... or maybe I've now read enough of his books and seen him speak enough that they match up well to me. The critics say he oversimplifies or bends facts to match his theses; perhaps, but he's not writing history. He helps us see his point of view, and that's good for me.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|As so often happens when I read his books, I had trouble putting this one down. It amazes me the scenarios he imagines and the writing he does to make it all come alive!
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|I made it through this year's Booker Prize winner but it was exhausting. The book's a brick, packed with characters, the plot twisting and turning on itself so many times I didn't even try to keep count. I didn't keep all the plot lines straight, a fact that may make other readers feel a little better. The reviews I read revealed the major relationships to watch and I heeded their advice. Aside from that, I managed to follow a couple others and that's as well as I could do without keeping a score card. If you can honestly say you made it through this book without nearly losing your mind, I salute you. In my case, I highlighted passages madly, thinking I could always come back to them, trying to make sense of things. Trouble was, things weren't conveniently truthful nor linear.<br /><br />In short, my method didn't work so well.<br /><br />The Luminaries is set in New Zealand, during the late 1860s gold rush, similar in many ways to the California rush of the 1840s which I suppose makes sense. One gold rush in a largely unpopulated and wild area is equivalent to another, I imagine. I find the gold rush era compelling and it's certainly a fantastic setting for all manner of depraved and troubled characters. Catton took full advantage of that, creating such a cast of characters I've personally never encountered outside the novels of Charles Dickens.<br /><br />What a wild, wild ride...<br /><br />The setting of the book is unrefined, populated with prostitutes and prospectors, bankers and opportunists. Chinese workers perform the hard work for a tiny percentage of the profits. Murders aren't uncommon and jailers are so busy prisons are in desperate need of expansion. Back-stabbing, suspicion and any vice you can name run rampant, including very high-profile drug addiction.<br /><br />As the tale opens, a new arrival named Walter Moody enters the scene, finding a group of twelve men gathered in a hotel for the purpose of trying to get to the bottom of a murder, as well as a disappearance, of two local men. As for the rest, I can honestly say it's far too complicated for me to dissect, as stories are told and disproved, alibis declared and found to be lies. In the end there is a trial. Witnesses testify to things the reader could never have guessed, while in the midst of it all everything is confused, turned on its head. I couldn't explain it all if you paid me.<br /><br />The very heart of the book actually contains a romance, if you can digest that. The young whore, Anna Wetherell, is in love with... No, I won't tell, not that it really gives much away, in the grand scheme of things. I could reveal a few dozen plot points that would still have no chance at all of spoiling the plot of this book. It's just... Oh good God. It is what it is.<br /><br />The question remains: was it a worthwhile read? Tough to say. Had it not won the Booker, and had NetGalley not provided me with a copy, I wouldn't have finished reading it. As it is, I picked it up and put it down innumerable times, when it's a book best read in long sessions. Note taking is highly encouraged. I don't know how one can keep track of anything, otherwise. I don't have time for such extensive scholarship, not when it's a modern novel. A classic, okay. But The Luminaries isn't time-tested. It just exhausted me.<br /><br />If you enjoy 800+ pages worth of convoluted puzzles - and unreliable characters - you may find this the god of all such books. It isn't without merit, by any means. It contains lots of fun passages, many tongue-in-cheek humorous moments, as well as some which are poignant. You'll laugh, you'll cry, etc. The characterization is staggering, the handling of so many plot lines impressive to the extent I can't even think of a word to describe it. Masterful, that does the trick.<br /><br />The fact the author was 22 when she wrote this book will make your head explode. If you're a writer, it will send you away sobbing. It's just unnatural what Eleanor Catton managed to pull off. No one should be able to create such a symphony from this wild cacophony. But she did. I bow to her, while at the same time I admit it was all far too much for me or my enjoyment.<br /><br />As author Jay Parini puts it:<br /><br />  \\"All really good books shatter their generic origins, becoming a thing unto themselves. But rarely has this axiom held more firmly than in Eleanor Catton's thrilling - in every sense - second novel. The sheer weight of the narrative might seem daunting; but dismiss that. She is among the finest of storytellers, drawing us forward through a labyrinth of lives, all of them converging in ways you could never easily imagine.

My mantra: please let it end, please let it end... It's a singular experience you can only understand if you attempt it.

I guess it was the mammoth accomplishment of the book, which I still maintain was far, far too much. Earlier I compared the work to Dickens but I love Dickens and find his complicated plots satisfying. The Luminaries? Not quite so much.<br /><br />But congratulations, Eleanor Catton.
