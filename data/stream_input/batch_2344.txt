B007ZGO7EM|2.0|never can use it.<br />did not  load.<br />tryed and tryed again.<br />just another junk app.<br />try again amybe get it  right next time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I simply love Katniss,  she is a survivor, what every female aspires to be. Peers, makes you love him. Must read...
B0065GC0BA|5.0|The theme was introduced well.  I was not expecting such a storey line.  It is a topic which needs thought and consideration as more and more people are considering the choice and time of death.  The injured was portrayed in a very realistic way, I did not think the same of his family.  I felt that the family situation was merely added to prolong the story, particularly in relation to his sister.  The ending of  his life was a little protracted.  In my opinion the less written the more room for the reader's imagination and challenging thoughts.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book and considered it a good read.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|The final season of 24 was excellent. I enjoyed having the convience of watching the show on my l Pad Kindle. I would definitely recommend.
B005K17RU0|2.0|My wife has the old AccuWeather on her kindle and I have the new upgraded version on mine. The temp reading on hers reads 52 degrees and mine reads 75 degrees even after refreshing and after 15 minutes.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love this app!  I appreciate it mostly because I can find and sort my personal videos (it shows their full name, so I can see Which episodes of each t.v. show I have).  I'm very happy to have found this app and would highly recommend.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|The book includes only the very basic aspects of publishing a book. I wish it included more information than what it does.
B006LRUVUA|4.0|This is a great app!  I use it occasionally on my Kindle Fire HD to remotely copy things from my home computer that I may have forgotten to transfer to my Kindle (an ebook, song, etc.)  The mouse isn't easy for me to use, and it took me awhile to figure out how to transfer files, but it was worth the learning curve to be able to collect the things I wanted and have them on my Kindle without having to drive home to get them.<br /><br />I also like the idea that I can set this up on my mother's laptop, and will be able to help her much more effectively with programs she doesn't understand, because I will be able to see her screen in real time as I talk to her on the phone and explain what to do.
0307895475|5.0|This thing is heavy and thick and contains every map, hint, walk-through, screenshot, and advice you could ever want for this expansive game world.  Worth every penny.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first chapter had me scared and I had to put this series down for a few weeks.  I finally got back to it and I am so glad I did.  I did not put it down until the end and still want more.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I liked it as expected. As with all of my movie reviews I am not a guru. I try to compare this movie to the book, but I haven't read the book in so long I forget most of it. It seems to me there is some stuff missing but I understand they have to pick and choose and make things a little different to hold a movie goers attention etc...<br />I think this movie is a good addition to the series and I am looking forward to the 2nd part of this.
B00117P0HE|4.0|resident evil freak over here.never a dull moment from stsrt to end. hope to see more. LOL may be soon
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|Plain and simply a movie masterpiece. I was like 11 when this movie came out and I remember being floored by how awesome it was. I am no movie junkie but if you ask me, for 1993 this movie was phenomenal. Even now as an adult I am still impressed by this movie.
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|Fantastic Album - absolutely dig this album.<br /><br />Can't wait for the Delta tour dates, I have my tickets!<br /><br />I recommend buying the album immediately :D!!
B00C1BU8G2|3.0|I didn't like it as much as the 1st but it was good. It probably isn't any fault of the movie. I was a kid when the 1st one came out and it was like &#34;wow!!!&#34; so maybe this is a biased review but the 1st was something special. The 3rd was still a good movie though. Just as well acted and just as action packed and the dinosaurs were really cool.
B004U52VPS|3.0|This is a fun idea and a fun set.  The problem is that it can get very tedious to set up.  Getting everything to balance can be difficult and everything falls quickly.  Basically you spend a lot more time setting up than knocking down.  Aiming the catapult is also very difficult, especially for little kids.  It is fun for a while, but when your child misses 10 times in a row because the birds can basically go anywhere, they start losing interest.  Honestly, it takes a pretty fine touch even for an adult to aim the thing.<br /><br />The low price of $10 that we paid for it was worth it, but it gets old quickly.  We got it at Christmas and have only played with it a few times.  Nice concept, difficult execution.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved watching season 1! I am a lover of shows and movies based out of older times. I love the clothing and the hats!!!!
B005KITK6C|5.0|We purchased this set for our nephew for a Christmas gift and he just about jumped out of his seat with excitement when he saw it.  It was a big hit.  He is a big fan of Ninjago Legos and he has always wanted this set.  Make sure to check the Lego web site to make sure you are getting a deal.  You should never pay more than the MSRP.  Many Secondary Amazon Merchants sell it for much higher.  We paid $15 with Amazon as the seller around Christmas time.  Make sure to shop around.
B001M2CBRK|2.0|I suspect everyone hired in this production was shown a dozen other military movies, which is the worst thing they could have possibly done.  If the theme is boredom, why punch it up with relentless music?  If the theme is discomfort or loneliness, why move the camera so often?  There is no inventive cinematography besides the oil wells and little character development.  I would have given 3 stars if not for the embarrassingly redundant voice over narration.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|The story was not very compatible with real life.  Children should never be subjected to such lack of morality at any time..
B007HACDLK|5.0|Read every books by the author ... they are all interesting, quick and substantially sizzling.  I just don't know why I have to pay so much for my Kindle versions and I need my books on kindle as I read when am working out and the kindle is so much easier to handle than paper books.
B002OG5GT8|3.0|It does not amplify sufficiently for me.  I do not hear very well even with my hearing aids.  This item does not help.
B009A9EYUO|1.0|The vinyl re-issue of this simply sounds bad. I expected more from these guys. This is a great album on CD and I'm not quite sure how they managed to bungle the vinyl reissue so badly. I really wish I didn't have to write a 1-star review for this. It's easy to find plenty reviews speaking to what a great album this is, and it is, just not the vinyl reissue.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I do not like to listen to profanity.  I do not use it and I do feel I should have to listen to it.
B000000992|5.0|This album really sounds crystal-clear and was very well mastered for vinyl. I bought this at the same time as another high-profile vinyl reissue from another very popular band and was disappointed in the other one, but this reissue of Undertow very much makes up for it. This, simply put, is vinyl done right.
B00BQ1DAHC|3.0|I have literally worn out all of my Volbeat CDs and honestly I don't see that happening with the new one. Have they sold out or going in another direction? Whatever it is this album is far from being as heavy as their previous releases and personally I'm left wanting more.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|A lot of hype, but very generic. It was just like every other Disney movie, but cool accent... ta da
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I bought this book thinking it would be a spooky thriller. It is not that at all. What it is, is the kind of mid-life memoir fictionalized by movie directors and good authors.  There's a terrific mystery which is enhanced by flashbacks to the protagonist's childhood on a bleak island. It is also my favorite kind of book, whether fiction or non-fiction, a true page-turner. I have the second book in the series and can't wait to start that one.
B005HSL626|4.0|I would rate this app 5 stars but it freezes and I have had to close it a couple of times. Other than that I love it. Please fix that problem half brick.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I think this show is pretty cool.  I love music and I love to sing so I get the best of both worlds.
B00A0A6F7C|4.0|I have bought all of Susan Boyle's albums because her voice is exceptional - I think it sound like Barbara and I love her personal story.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|Watched this long ago.  My memory was consistent with the uniformly rave reviews.  It was still good, but Cary Grant's character was not as believable as I remember, the romance not as compelling, and the bad guys were real idiots.  On this much delayed second viewing, I would say the best part of the movie is the portrayal of late 50's society and culture.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|We had to catch up to this year's episodes !  It is easy to see why this series gets nominated year after year. Same great actors, interesting plots and good twists.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I finally caught up with Downton and I cannot wait for the new season to begin! Hurry, hurry, up please!
B007N85POS|5.0|Fun to. play.  Also found out if u delete and reinstall. it updates  your game with more levels.  This is  Fun game.  Not<br />Tired of it at all.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm not sure if I enjoyed the story more or John Corey's wit.  He is one of my all time favorite characters - a good guy who behaves badly!  The story is mostly centered in Yemen and involves terrorism, betrayal, corruption, and cultural diversity.  It was also great to have Corey work with Paul Brenner.  If you are a fan of either of DeMille's characters, it's a must read.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Each room requires you to solve a puzzle through multiple steps. Be sure to look under, on top of and even behind objects in the room to find the tools and hints you`ll need to solve the puzzle.
B00AQSN7HE|4.0|I am collecting all the Bond films and this is a great addition. Daniel Craig is a great successor to Pierce Brosnan.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|Helen Hunt getting naked is pretty much the highlight of the movie, even though it's something your probably don't want to see (her getting naked). It was sad though, because you see a guy like that. But if you have the time, watch? It was average. Don't pay money for it though.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game. Its pretty fun but can make ya mad when ya doing soooo good then get hit by a train or run into something. :)
B00821OX98|5.0|I like the show. It's a family friendly show with some action. I hope they keep up the good work!
B0092MKTL2|1.0|Very poor quality audio ... Lots of distortion. Distortion was noticeable on in digital format as well as CD. Very poor quality on car stereo.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I've been selling off some items, so it's really convenient to see what's happening on the go on the Kindle.  However, you cannot invoice or see the postage options from the app, so I still have to go to the computer for those functions.
1577314808|5.0|This book has had perfect timing in my life.  It has given me the tools to let go of identifying myself with the past, which has given me a sense of freedom that I have never known!!  This is just the first of many tools that are shown in this book to free your soul from the chains of the past and the future and your thoughts and emotions. A dear friend gave the recommendation to me, and I have seen him change dramatically from worried and sad, to joyful and peaceful and spiritual.  I bought one for my sister and it has changed her life too!  I sent copies to my three daughters and my friend!  Highly recommended for anyone who is seeking peace and joy in their lives.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A good way to live your life. Four simple but difficult agreements to finding heaven on earth. I loved it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I am using this application nearly everyday. I can see how much my battery is full, how long can use for different application and how long I have to charge my battery. Thank you x x
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|What a great collection! It's complete and it's beautifully rendered and packaged. If you love the series Columbo as much as I do, or if you simply enjoy watching entertaining, well-written and well-acted televsion drama, this is the collection for you. A real treat!
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Leslie mann is sexy and paul Rudd hilarious. Good humor good storyline Just a great movie definitely a must watch.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I hear what great books these are....... It has and still is taking me so long to read this book.  I keep reading waiting on the WOW part and I am 85% through the book and still waiting.... very disappointed. Not sure I will buy the others.
034553154X|5.0|It is a wonderful calendar. Some pictures are not appropriate for children. The style of the art is just incredible.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Very well done, compelling, methodical in the way it tells the story.  Takes the time to tell it right.  In short...great movie!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Game is fast paced and addicting. Upgrading your shark and also unlocking bigger sharks keeps me coming back for more. Favorite part of the game is eating the people. Oh the carnage!
0061733199|5.0|There is a lot of great information packed into this book.  There are many variables to survival that are covered thoroughly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are extremely addictive! I love to get points just for logging on everyday. There is multiple games for different age groups. I can play this all day.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just loved Downton Abbey very calming but addicting. Well written and excellent performance along with the clothing for that period of time.
B008OURHPY|5.0|This effort is a grand slam. The lyrics are clearly conveyed with heart.  If you're taking the time to listen to the samples and read this review I can almost guarantee will transport you to memories of loves past and present, mistakes made, and life lived fully. Evocative, lovely music. Enjoy!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This books feels like an autobiography but presents and addresses key IT and business challenges in an informative and educational manner - worth a read if you are development or operations or management in general over such teams.
B00BI745AA|5.0|After waiting so long for Les Mis I expected to feel somewhat disappointed in the film or performances, but that did not happen. The singing performances were hauntingly beautiful and and in some cases were emotionally draining even. This mostly was because I was reduced to tears, especially during the female characters' performances. Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were convincing in their respective roles and their singing was wonderful as well. This was the most beautiful and heartfelt musical I've ever seen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY????? LOVED IT. MY SON AND I BOTH FIGHT OVER THE TABLET BECAUSE WE BOTH WANTS TO PLAY THIS GAME.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This author always write a nice book. He hasn't disappointed me yet. He writes stories that the average person can relate to.<br />Look forward to the next one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great series and I really enjoyed watching each episode. It was definitely worth every penny. I also enjoyed watching on the privacy of my tablet, whenever and wherever.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|this book is imaginative and witty. A light-hearted and easy read when you have read too many serious books. The book changes perspectives and time keeping you entertained the whole way through.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, let you select any bible version, hear your bible which is wonderful for me when I go to sleep, gives you reminders of dates verses and you can save your favorites verses to go to them lather just with 1 click.<br /><br />Lo recomiendo para todo aquel que desee tener la biblia a su alcance en cualquier momento. Tiene una funcion que te lee los versiculos que para mi es exelente para cuando voy a dormir, o simplemente estoy ocupado haciendo algo y deseo escuchar la palabra en vez de musica o algo asi. Te permite guardar tus versiculos favoritos para luego poder verlos con solo un click. Es una exelente herramienta y te ofrece soporte en varios idiomas.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|While long this edition was more informative and seemed to flesh out the characters better than the last 2. Quite a few eye-openers! Can't wait for the next.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I use an iPad for teaching, so the stylus comes in handy, especially when students come up to use it. It's great for their smaller hands, and definitely more sturdy so it won't break as easily as the traditional stylus!
B004EPZ084|5.0|This movie is a riot.  Hearing and seeing sweet little Jennifer Aniston bust out the NASTY talk was hysterical - new respect for her mad acting skills.
B002S45V32|5.0|The story of a girl from the wrong side of the tracks that falls in love with a popular guy while being chased by her best friend, Ducky.  How can you not love this movie?  I've seen this movie at least 50 times in my life and I still get sentimental over it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love heartbreak rich poor. Amazing characters. What more could anyone ask for. Why did I wait so long. Loved it
B00355L2TU|5.0|I've been going to the gym for a month and figured this would be good for the days I didn't have time to make it to the gym.  It is great!  My heart rate is accelerated, I feel the burn in my muscles, I sweat and I feel great for the rest of the day.  I love the fact that I only had to buy the first level.  I've already recommended it to several friends.  I can't wait to see the results!
B0055OK2T0|2.0|I'm writing this review a couple of weeks or months since seeing the movie, and honestly, it's hard to remember much to say about it.  What's that tell you?
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app is very easy to use.  I generally use it to double check my spelling, but also have looked up meanings as well.
B001JDGK2E|4.0|classic p!nk, I. never thought she would make it through the 90's  but ity looks like she is here to stay.
B005HSL626|4.0|Slice, dice and smash virtual fruit as quickly as possible for the highest score. What else can I say, that's what it is! I downloaded this simply so I can overcome the shame of my 5 year old kicking my butt at it. I am trying to resist playing it when she's not around but it's awfully tempting.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I love the Jesse Stone movie series, and I wanted to have all the entire set.  This is a good movie and Jesse Stone is a great series of movies.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|A couple of funny parts, but overall not a funny movie.  Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I had noticed on a lot of church signs that his movie was being shown in churches.  This is a good movie with a great moral.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It has had a great a story line since the start and season 3 is no exception. I really can't wait for season 4. My favorite episode has got to be &#34;Clear&#34; and the saddest has got to be &#34;Killer Within&#34; when two of Rick's group members are lost.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I already had the first Sex and the City movie and wanted the sequel. Enjoyed this movie a lot and glad I bought it.
B000FA675C|5.0|I Don't think Dan Brown could write a book I didn't like, And his is upcoming new release is much anticipated.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I wanted to have the whole Harry Potter movie collection, so it only made sense to add this one to help finish off my collection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing this is elementary school and middle school. I was ecstatic when I saw that I could get it on my Kindle!<br />It's true the graphics are a lot different then back then, but from what I can remember the game itself is dam near the same. I love it, it goes quick so you don't always run out of energy like in other games.<br />These is one downside though, if you get a new device out have to re install the game you have to start over. Aside from that, it's one of the 3 games I play the most on my Kindle.<br />PS, you don't have to have Internet to play! (Only to download the game, duh).
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I never got to see this movie in the theater, so I bought the movie. I enjoyed this movie a lot.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Movie was good, Daniel Day Lewis was awesome. The movie was just a little too long. All the actors were good and very authentic.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I had the whole Harry Potter movie series, so it only made since to buy the last in the series. Good movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my kindle. Easy to download and use.  Has many of the attributes expected ,, settings and visuals are adjustable to personal preference.  Will be watching for more from this company.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|I saw part of this movie on TV. I could not find when it would be on TV again, so I bought the movie.  Great Movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game requires u to be a productive thinker and it helps learn the skills to  are and make animals happy
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I wanted to have the whole Harry Potter movie collection, so it only made sense to add this one to help finish off my collection.
0446343129|5.0|Sugar is sort of like organized religion - you either love it or hate it. Sugar lovers like the taste, the buzz, the profits, or all of the above. The book is just one man's opinion, however. Your best path here is to get off of sugar just for the heck of it. See what your life is like without for 60 days. You can always add it back if you want to. There is also such a thing as moderation, which is a challenge with sugar because it is quite addictive.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I love all the Jason Bourne movies, so it only made sense to add this one to my collection. Good movie
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great series and great DVD set. This one takes my husband and me through Season 3, and now we must wait with bated breath for Season 4.
B00BF11STU|4.0|It was a good gradual build of plot.  After 1/2 way thru  you were glued to the seat.  Totally held your interest!
B00B2QA9TI|5.0|One of those rare films that we can watch over and over. The film's visual beauty is gut-felt. Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay. Really good choices selecting the actors in their parts. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky (unknown to me until know) blew me away by his confidence. He had my attention from the first pass on the train and holds it through out the film. Keira Knightly delivers our best Anna and Kitty and Levin's love story is touching with their quiet conversation moving the blocks and Kitty caring for Levin's dying brother. I have seen many different versions of Anna Karenina...not only is this my favorite, it will rank in my top five films ever. Joe Wright...another great work. To me, it's poetry.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Where do I begin? A while back I heard one of Lana's songs on MTV and wasn't into it. It seemed maybe too weird... even for me. About two months ago I read an article about my favorite rock frontman, and he was highly recommending Lana Del Rey. I thought it exceptionally weird, but I was intrigued. I thought it was worth a listen, and boy was I glad I did. I was INSTANTLY taken by her incredible melodies. It's like new hip hop meets the old and great voices of yesterday. The beats are killer and really highlight her unique sound. Her dark way and crass speech are reminiscent of Johnny Cash, and I honestly love this entire album from start to finish. One listen was all it took.
B0083V2W6I|5.0|This DVD has some background on the making of the movie as well. I would recommend to anyone who is interested and the mods and rockers.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Ivan was always a charecter I desired to see evolved, and now it is done!  So different than a Miles adventure but equally well-crafted.  I cannot wait to read more about Ivan....and family.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana has a way of letting you think you know the next element of the story and then she adds something new to make you think about. All of the James and Claire Fraser &#34;Outlander&#34; Books are great!
B001O37WTY|5.0|I absolutely LOVED  LOVED LOVED this movie! I LOVE JOHN MALKOVICH and I think he is an AMAZING actor!! I thought the storyline was hilarious and John Cusack and Cameron Diaz were great!!!!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Daina is such an awsome writer. Her characters are so real and jump off the page you want to touch them and walk in that time in history!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Overall it was a great film. The cast did an amazing job. It is very emotional and I would recommend to anyone
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Difficult topic-well written-for a common man-For a non psychologist the approach is practical-Use it in my practice of obesity control
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quick does a fantastic job of putting us inside the mind of people who don't think like we do and allows us to see their world without judgment or condescension.  Heart-wrenchingly sad and brilliantly funny all at once--this book was a very nice surprise.  I saw the movie before I read the book, but that didn't spoil it at all.  Now I want to see the movie again!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 13 year old Grandson taught me how to use my Kindle and I hated having to learn something new at this stage of my life (74) so I let him install his favorite game and now I&#34;m trying to keep up with it and it not easy but watch a child do it and it's amazing and fun to watch. GAB
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Frankly, the title almost put me off from trying the film.  It sounded pretentious.  But when the action started, and the plot progressed, I was immersed in the film as I would be by a good novel.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones fills the part well with his stoic simplicity hiding his emotion and anger.  John Goodman is the believable Louisiana crook played broad.  The other actors--including James Gammon in one of his last roles--do a good job of making us believe they are at home in the bayou.<br /><br />Louisiana is truly a star of this piece, and the scenery alone makes you homesick for a place you may never have been.<br /><br />The script, dealing with the murders of young women, is not so much driven by a frantic effort to save as the need to overcome evil and provide justice.<br /><br />Yes, few car chases here and the violence is largely viewed as aftermath.  But I found that I cared about all the characters, and wanted to know what would happen next.<br /><br />Don't try to \\"half-way\\" watch this film.  Give it your full attention, or don't bother.  It is as much a moral and human drama as a crime story.<br /><br />They say this is not the director's cut.  It was still fine for me.  However, I would like to know what else was there.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|At 74 years old I am having more fun with this.  I received a Kindle Fire and have learned to use and now I have gotten use to and play games on it and read many of books too.  Love playing with Akinator with my friends and trying to stump him and I have to pat myself on the back as I did stump him with Lion Tamer...so Fun.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Even though it's similar to the Nintendo DS version of the game it's still so much fun. I think the one drawback is that they had to make it to work without video game controller buttons but they pulled through. A plus to this compared to the Nintendo version is the downloadable content. With the new 3DS programmers can make DLC but on a mobile app it is so much easier. I look forward to the seasonal things I heard about happening on the iPad version!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is  a really fun game and you can buy all the horses you want. i reccomend it to everybody.  this game is fit for all ages
B0064QNS62|1.0|I complete all am suppose to yet the game doesn't go to the next level.like really?<br /> Free but wack.!  Sigh
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is looking like it will be as good as the Lord of The Rings. It is following the book nicely.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I had heard a coworker and dear friend of mine say how much she loved the movie Benny and Joon. She is a busy mom and wife and trying to \\"claim\\" TV rights when this movie was showing was sometimes difficult. I knew the best and only place that I should look to try and track this little gem down....Amazon! I ordered it and gave it to her as a: Just because you are special gift...she was so surprised! Could not have done it without Amazon!
B000FA675C|5.0|However much fiction or fact this novel is or could be, it's a mind opening text that gives alternate explanations, maybe possibilities or facts about many riddles in history entangled withing it's own story line. Who is telling the truth, who is not etc... I strongly recommend this book to anyone.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is a very challenging game but no so hard as to be frustrating. I have hardly been able to put it down. Well worth the $.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Love this app, it has many different games to play and you don't need to purchase credits as they give you plenty of chances to get them for free. Many hours of entertainment.
0062082353|5.0|Before ordering this book i had not an entire book in several years, at least 5, but I finished this book in less than a week and it was sort of addictive. Chris Kyle was a hero, but he denys that many times in his book. The stories he gives of war just grab your attention.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this series. Some may think its too much but in todays world it could be a reality. The book does have some so so parts but it was a &#34;don't want to put down&#34; type of book.
B001EBROWQ|5.0|This movie is a classic... and of course it's about Our Lord Jesus Christ...I really liked it a lot. Thank You
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched all 3 seasons.  Now I am waiting for the new season on TV.  It is a great series about the early 1900's.
B005K17RU0|2.0|It happened three times.  Everything else is ok, but I don't like the app constantly running. I'm out of here.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|wow this CD rocks, and blues, and souls. He has such diverse styles and does them all with a great vocie and pwerful guitar.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago and recently ordered it as a gift for a friend who had never seen it. It gives the viewer an intense feeling of how terrible life was for people during that time in the concentration camps. It should make each of us stop to think about the atrocities of war and how horribly people suffer at the hands of bigoted people. Hopefully civilized people (and uncivilized ones) can learn an important lesson about discrimination against anyone just because their beliefs are different and also to show love and respect to others. Let us pray for peace and set a good example that we can be proud of and raise our children to be compassionate humanitarians. Please watch this movie and share it with older and newer friends, We can make a difference.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Full of fluff to make the story last.  Very let down.  Also, the quality of the &#34;HD&#34; version played on a ROKU was terrible.  I will wait for all the movies to be available on BluRay in the extended versions.  I should have learned my lession from &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Few times one's able to find a good adaptation from a novel, this movie is a perfect one, dialog by dialog, scene by scene you can revive the pages of the sourcec and the source is so good.
B0087EACJK|3.0|I like the concept.  I played the original on my computer and enjoyed it.  Something about playing this on my phone I find more frustrating than fun.  I think it has to do with how clunky it feels zooming in and out on the action.  And I have a big problem with the fact that the \\"tiles\\" don't snap into place, which prevents me from zooming in because they aren't perfectly aligned.
0670026603|4.0|This book is beautifully written and very emotional. I really cared about the main characters and didn't want to put the book down until I knew what was going to happen.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't know what I did before Evernote (well I do but don't know how I did it). I love evernote and I love that I can access all my evernote content on the go and create new notes on the go. Sometimes I use the app to create quick notes or blogs and then I edit on my desktop to make it more polished but with swype its as good as paper and pen.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Very interesting book. I do recommend to read it during quiet times because, even if the explanations are well written, it get technical sometime.
B005HSL626|4.0|I play is game when I am bored and don't really need or want a brain challenge. Its fun to play for all ages. My 8 year old son loves it.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|Byrne is a genius.  Can't wait to see Byrne & St. Vincent in concert.  This style of music is a whole new direction for Byrne, which is typical of his pioneering career.
B004T32SOK|4.0|This app lets me easily upload and download my box content. I didn't give this app 5 stars because whenever my Kindle Fire HD screen sleeps while I'm downloading something, the download fails. In order to download larger files I need to change the screen sleep settings.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|It's okay. I would not watch it again but I'm not sad that I watched it once. There were funny parts. It's okay.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|I had wanted an app that could allow me to write in my notes however this app is too frustrating for me  to use. I prefer to just use my swype feature and my existing evernote app.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Can't get it to work! Or even come up!  Wanted to try it but just couldn't get it to work.  May try again sometime.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|This app allows me to easily cancel or close apps when they go haywire or when they  are hogging up my Kindle Fire's resources. It has many great tools to help get the best performance from your tablet.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry Birds!  So addictive though watch out!  Just constantly trying to beat my scores!  Try to play everyday even if<br />only for a few minutes!
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I got this app because I use the PC version on my laptop, I trusted it and of course it was free. I think the functionally and the look can be improved. The PC version is great.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Despite the similar plot line to the 80's movie Total Recall, I found the movie to be well done and entertaining.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is good to access facebook on the go but its hard to use when you want to use the messenger feature if you have to send multiple people messages.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I always wanted a kindle so i was excited to see the app on my android. my husband hates it now lol
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love this app because it not only gives me access to find my files on Kindle Fire HD but I can also access my files on Box or Dropbox and files on my laptop or husband computer which have been shared with the workgroup.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse lovers. My kids finally got the hang of it and they love to play.
B00A3OTNTC|5.0|Great beat, easy to dance to.  Fantastic for working out.  Very motivating, beat keeps you going  I love this album.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Proof of Heaven was interesting but written by someone who never saw Jesus Christ in Heaven.  He sets on a throne at the right hand of Our Heavenly father and guess what? Jesus was not in the book...... So I counted the book as a fairy tale.<br />Read: A Christian Rebuttal to Dr Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven. If you want the truth...<br />So if you are looking for a good happy &#34;story&#34; read Proof of Heaven but not if you are looking for the truth.<br />A somewhat biased saint.....
B003UYUP58|5.0|Supremely worthwhile for cancer patients, family members and friends of cancer patients and those who may someday be attacked by the emperor of all maladies.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I will truely love this if I can ever figure out how to work this ICON....I have yet to figure out how to get it to work the way I want it to work and why I bought it...Anything I need help with is too complicated for this old woman!
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|Uchida, Jeffrey Tate and ECO are indeed the most incredibly  artistic match. The music created by Mitsuko is like beautiful magic, is deeply mooving and delightfull.  The only minor problem, as mentioned by some reviewers would be putting the same concertos divided into two CD's, The solution proposed by one of these reviewers - make your own record uniting the separate movements -is quite simple and I  dit it myself. Strongly recomended this set of concertos. Excuses for my poor english..
0984725113|4.0|Modern capitalist economies are facing a seemingly insurmountable paradox. By using information and automation technologies, we have increased the efficiencies and scales of our businesses and industries tremendously, but at the same time our income levels and unemployment rates are diminishing while negative externalities are eroding our environment and our social structures. What gives? If nothing is done to change things, we can extrapolate these trends towards a future where income inequality, unemployment, environmental degradation, and social strife are exacerbated to unsustainable levels. In essence, we find ourselves in an unwinnable race against the machines. What is the solution? Well, to reiterate a popular phrase, \\"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!\\" The authors explain how the only way to move forward successfully is to change our organizational structures in such a way that enables productivity to be amplified by technology, not replaced by it. They note that Moore's law is an exponential curve that seems unstoppable, but there is another growth curve that increases even more quickly, the curve of combinatorial explosion. By continually retraining and increasing our skilled work force through just in time education and opening up our organizations so that we mix and match knowledge, humans can exploit this combinatorial explosion to outpace the exponential trends of accelerating technologies. This is inline with the economic theory of endogenous growth, where the bulk of our wealth increases through innovation and invention as opposed to simply trading and globalization.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, they offer 19 specific suggestions that I mostly agree with:<br /><br />1.) Pay teachers more.<br />2.) Eliminate tenure and hold teachers accountable for student performance.<br />3.) Separate instruction from testing/certification.<br />4.) Keep K-12 students in classrooms longer.<br />5.) Expand H-1B Visa program and offer green cards to graduates of advanced degrees.<br />6.) Teach entrepreneurship as a skill.<br />7.) Offer founders Visas for entrepreneurs.<br />8.) Create databases and templates of 'best practices' for systematic 'turn-key' startups.<br />9.) Reduce government regulations that hinder business creation.<br />10.) Invest and upgrade our country's communication and transportation infrastructure.<br />11.) Increase funding for basic science research and R&D.<br />12.) Reduce regulations on labor laws.<br />13.) Decrease payroll taxes and provide subsidies for hiring long-term unemployed workers.<br />14.) Decouple health care and other benefits from employment status.<br />15.) Don't regulate new innovative industries too soon.<br />16.) Reduce or eliminate home mortgage subsidies.<br />17.) Reduce the implicit and explicit subsidies to the financial sector.<br />18.) Reform the patent system.<br />19.) Shorten copyright terms and increase the flexibility of fair use.<br /><br />These changes are just the beginnings of a shift we need to make, but they will get us moving in the right direction.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, because I love chess and I thought that it had some great embedded themes during the action.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The movie was a little slow in places but the book is also! So all in all  it was an ok flick  Im glad i didnt have to pay movie theater prices for the show!
B0064QNS62|2.0|Garbage. Took half a minute to even register that I completed one of the levels. Gravity suddenly takes full effect when you let up on the jump button. Extra buttons for jump left and right.<br /><br />Not worth it, even as the free app of the day.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show.  My wife and I watch it on the computer at night after the youngins are in bed.  Works great.
6304698542|5.0|I enjoyed the movie more than I did when I was younger. As a mature adult, versus a college student when I first saw the movie,I paid more attention to the historical parts i.e.the rise of Naziism. I am lending the movie to a good friend who has never seen it.
B0030B621W|5.0|Loved this movie.  Really nothing negative to say at all.  Great acting, excellent story, good characters, just the right amount of creepiness and mystery.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|I just couldn't stick with it because it made me feel ill and have bowel problems. It might have worked long term, but I wasn't willing to keep trying.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Even though the plot can be a little convoluted (dream within a dream within a dream, etc), it was never difficult to follow.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B006PAZMMK|4.0|I recently found this artist.  He is great.  Dubstep / electronic music has a been a favorite of mine for a while.  Skrillex bring down some great beats with that special Dubstep sound.
B000002LND|5.0|Always a fan of Madonna, never have this album in CD format, but have it for the first time and it brings back a lot of good memory!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I really love supernatural it has a good story and great characters,set in a believable  area.It has a never ending story line that keeps me watching week after week.
B00004WPFX|3.0|I love this album, but at some points on this BRAND NEW album it skips so bad that the songs become unlistenable. Maybe I just got a bad copy, but that's not ok.
034580404X|4.0|It's very entertaining. I usullay read mysteries, but became curious after my friend talked about it. Easy to read. Thanks a lot
B001P1MZNI|5.0|It's Frank Sinatra...do I need to say more?  Apparently I do since I can't submit this until more words are added....lol.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I really liked this movie, the actors and characters worked well together. It was fast moving and enjoyable. I will recommend it to my friends.
B00005V9IL|5.0|If you have never seen The Abyss, you are in for a treat.  If like me, you could watch this movie over and over, you are still in for a treat.  This movie is timeless and true entertainment.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Heard all about it from friends and everything was true. I usually am not a fan of horror but the storyline is so good you forget how extreme the graphics are. I am completely hooked
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Another great album by Blake Shelton!  Love it!!!  It is fun to have a song with the Pistol Annie's included on this album.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book saved my son from surgery.  My 6 year old son was underwieght and was having trouble breathing at night.  Doctors had recommended we have his tonsils removed.  After reading this book we decided as a family to give up wheat for 30 days.  2 weeks in our son was sleeping silently, no snoring or gasping for air at night.  It was such a blessing and it saved him from an unneccesary surgery.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie i watched it many times in the first month of having it and i still enjoy watching it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The second book lags a little but really picks up in the third.  amazing, tugs at every emotion.  Love it.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love this show deffinately recomend the next seasons if you buy this one we have them all and are great love watching them over and over
0316067598|5.0|Great book.  It's nice to read about things that our heros of the armed forces face, especially special forces.  The training required to become one of the elite is almost unbelievable.  To bad our media doesn't consider the sacrifices they make for their families and our own well being worthy of print.  Marcus Luttrell is a true hero to the United States of America.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Great start to kicking of the show. Have all of the seasons out so far and love watching them all
0062082353|5.0|What an eye opening story.  This book does an excellent job of portraying what it takes not only to become a SEAL, but what it takes to become a sniper in the best of the best.  You never hear about the people behing the scenes, and that is exactly what they are.  This man has saved so many American lives, and so will the people that follow in his footprints.  God bless the special forces!
B0053O89WY|5.0|My boyfriend and I are big fans of the show, they just seem to get better and better, i cant wait for the 6th season to come out i have been watching it on tv and love it. We also have the first 4 seasons they are great.  love sheldon Bazinga !
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written book but depressing.  No redeeming value or lesson to learn.  I finish the book and felt terrible.  Not how I want to feel after reading a book for leisure.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|I really liked this movie but the TV series was better.  I think the characters were smarter on the series.  The movie had better special effects but not realistic.  Good entertainment, for sure.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Was a great movie. The whole family from 7 to 35 enjoyed it. I would recommend this to any anime fan.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|You could think that this is a girl's book, but it isn't. This book make me think about all the times I judge someone without knowing he/she and then I'm proved wrong. I love the idea of second chances.
B00555X8OA|5.0|The author revealed many faulty thought processes I am guilty of. Expecially appreciated his comments on research and sample size.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I purchased this for my 15 year old son.  He is an avid fan of Doctor Who and said this is a must have.  He loved it!  It is an endless source of entertainment for him.  Now my 7 year old son wants one.  Highly recommend!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|This diet works. I lost 12 pounds in 6 weeks. Easy to follow and to live with. Highly recommend it.
B003K16P3M|3.0|Title: Graceling<br />Author: Kristin Cashore<br />Rating: 3.5 Stars<br /><br />My Review<br /><br />I enjoyed Graceling. I know the series has been successful and does not need my endorsement.<br /><br />What I Liked<br /><br />Katsa – I always enjoy a kick butt heroine MC, therefore, a girl whose Grace is killing had to be intriguing. My favorite moment about Katsa? The flashback to her first kill. It’s an excellent insight, making you simultaneously respect and fear her. Definitely “bingo” for this story. But I have to say that some of the opening scene left me flat. I love detail in action scenes and it was very much, “she kicked and ten men were dead….” I craved more.<br /><br />Later we learn (along with Katsa) that she doesn’t feel pain like normal people so you could see this “summary” approach, but I wish I knew more of her emotional feelings then. Was she exhilarated? Disgusted with herself? Bored? The author refers to Katsa being afraid of what she will do if she’s angry. What does that feel like?  Do her palms itch?  Does her scalp tingle?  Does her throat burn?  Could this opening scene plant that seed?  Just musing. I DO like that it started mid-stride, in Katsa’s personal crisis: reluctant strong-woman.<br /><br />I also liked her whole sequence with Bitterblue and the mountain pass crossing.  That two women against the world thing worked for me.  And the woman killed a mountain lion by hand!  That’s one crazy Grace.<br /><br />Po - Po was utterly likable.  I know the author made him out initially as a possible threat, but you don’t really feel that for long.  His Grace did not come as a surprise to me as I could see no reason for the “mind-reader” child cameo earlier in the story unless it was to serve as “Po” foreshadowing.  Which it did.<br /><br />Katsa + Po - What I love about this particular romantic combo is their unity and their playfulness.  You really get the friendship that is the underpinning to this love and that makes it believable.  I even liked the way that Katsa resisted it at first.<br /><br />Lovers – It was refreshing to have a story that felt comfortable portraying lovers who did not marry (especially given that was the woman’s wish).  Though, I will say I’d heard that the sex in Graceling was a little more than most YA and I read it and thought, “Really?”  These folks must have meant FIRE or something because the sex in Graceling was nice but it was hardly edgy…or even particularly detailed.<br /><br />Women’s Rights – It’s mostly subtle and well-done, but there is a STRONG women’s rights message in this story, with Katsa’s Grace originating when a man tried to molest her.  She is a defender of women and girls throughout and feels a deep need to teach them to protect themselves (hence her planned school).  It’s part of why she rejects marriage, not as a concept overall but in her time and place, where it is about women becoming chattel.  I liked that aspect and felt it was consistent with Katsa’s character.<br /><br />What I wasn’t as into<br /><br />What the heck is a Grace and how does it originate?  There is no info on this.  I guess I could accept it as pure fantasy, but I still want the backstory.  In fact, the entire book felt like a bit of a “middle” book in the midst of an epic.  Then I researched the series after I finished this morning and found it basically is the middle book in this epic. I kind of wish it had gone in order so I could appreciate the layers and complexity of the world building.  In Graceling I felt like I’d arrived late to “The Hunger Games” movie and missed the critical five minutes of backstory.  Then again, I likes me detail. I say that and the book was 400+ pages, so perhaps I don’t represent the norm here.<br /><br />I also found suspension of disbelief a little difficult in places.  Whenever a story proposes a nearly invincible villain and a lot of build up and then he/she is easilybested, it’s a bit deflating.  Herein I refer to both Randa and Leck.  I couldn’t understand why Katsa felt at Randa’s mercy at all if she truly could beat 200 men easily as she claimed in her “escape” scene.  And Leck seemed unbeatable until the moment she just *killed* him.  NOW, I would like to qualify this.  The purpose here was to show her undying love for Po and how it overcomes the strength of Leck’s Grace.  THAT I loved.  I’m a sucker for that.  But the swiftness of Leck’s death left me a little hollow.  I LOVE action (detailed as I said before) and for the big, bad, wolf to go down with one dagger’s flight was kind of a let-down.  For me, anyway.<br /><br />Finally, I enjoyed the whole two-color eye thing but it made me think of Steph Bowe’s posting about how all ya must have protagonists with special eyes.  It does seem like that’s the case, though I think Graceling may have been at the leading edge of some of that emphasis.  If you go to Google Images and put in “Graceling” you get a lot of fan art of Katsa’s eyes.  Tons of it.  People just love that.  So is Kate Bosworth a Graceling?  :)<br /><br />I like this enough that I’ll likely read FIRE and BITTERBLUE.  I’m looking forward to BITTERBLUE more in many ways because I felt connected with her character in Graceling.bested, it’s a bit deflating.  Herein I refer to both Randa and Leck.

B0026UV77C|2.0|I really like placebo and &#34;ashtray heart&#34; is a great song but I was not impressed by any others on this CD
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|love this game. they did a great job with it. Easy to get into. You'll be hooked in no time.
B000FA675C|5.0|Robert Langdon's character comes to light quickly and entertainingly.  I read it when it first came out and reread it on my Kindle.  Even though I knew the story line, I picked up more information.  I liked the way Dan Brown wove historical events into life-like incidences.<br /><br />Sophie Neveu's character is definitely one that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I like the idea of a possible relationship with Jesus may exist.<br /><br />Worth rereading.
030758836X|2.0|slow to start with.. after you a good 100 pages into it - it becomes 'unputdownable'... but what a horrible ending... felt so totally cheated with the ending!!
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I had to read this in high school.  I did not care for it much because it was difficult to understand because of the differences in our culture then and now.  I reread this in college and still had no love for it but had to do a research paper over the themes existing in it.  I still had no love for the plot or the characters.<br /><br />I recently reread the book, every word, every line, every punctuation mark.  The story drags on and on.  Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship from a rocky start to a spirited one seems to drag the reader down and could leave one depressed.  Heathcliff's morose character mars all other relationships.<br /><br />I also do not like the fact that it is a story within a story.  I personally would have rather that the plot just be told instead of from the housekeeper's point of view.<br /><br />I realize that it is a classic and if that is what you are interested in then you would enjoy not only its length but the fact that the moors were depressing and that people lived extremely different lives at that time.  I wondered where the sense of religion was in this book as her sister definitely displayed it in Jane Eyre,
B0017VG69U|5.0|it is an excellant way to aquire the whole set which i now have the graphics are highly renewd and the added sceans are great
B009O2XY12|2.0|Plays the same games over and over.  It's boring unless you buy the full features.  I just play some games for release, relaxation, and entertainment.  I would not buy the extended version.  Not my interest level.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Great classic movie making fun of boring cubicle jobs, humor much like the show the office. Good acting as well.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A different take on World War II through the eyes of a child dealing with war, death, a new family and the challenges that not being able to read bring to her.<br /><br />This book is significant in keeping us thinking about the Holocaust and never letting that part of history be forgotten.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Whoa!  Didn't expect that outcome.  First half of the book was a slow build up and totally throws the reader off.  I didn't like the back and forth so much.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Loved the movie.  I read all of the books in the triology and thought that it would be hard to engage me with the movie, but I was incorrect.  The movie did the book justice and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this for viewing.  The acting is outstanding and the plot sticks close enough to the book.  I also like the actors that were chosen to play them.
B009EEMFSI|5.0|I loved this movie. I lived in Mumbai several years ago and got to experience the slums first hand. While watching this movie, I felt a connection to the actors. This movie was probably the best movie I've seen in a long time. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is extremely relevant to our society today.  It includes computer usage which many of our young people are highly advanced at and makes us aware that this was written prior to the technology age being so prevalent.  The story is well written and vocabulary is at a higher level.<br /><br />I was continually interested in the outcome of the characters and the future of their well being as well as other human beings.  It really shows us what human beings are about.  The humanity that is inherent with us all and our relationship with a higher being or a religious deity is creatively intertwined without being preachy.<br /><br />Most will love the book and its characters also for just a simple story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this app. If I could give it more then 5I would. Very fun for all ages and hours of fun. I just told someone yesterday that I needed an intervention for this game. I pray it none stop. Right now I am in 1st place out of my friends. GET THIS GAME!!! You won't be disappointed..
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is the best Dr Panda game! Definitely worth the upgrade from the free version. I love that it's interactive and teaches good lessons about health and caring for others. WIN WIN!
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|What can one say about Daniel Day-Lewis other than WOW. He was superb as the Lincoln that made sense of his time. Sally Field as the brooding Mary Todd Lincoln was amazing. There is not a lot of action, but the political wrangling is good. I highly recommend this movie especially if you are interested in the political side of things.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|These Dr Panda games are just wonderful! Very entertaining for kids and there is lots of stuff to choose from. My daughter has never gotten board with any of the Dr Panda games. She loves them!
B00BI745AA|5.0|Les Miz brings tears to my eyes. This movie version was no exception. The acting, especially by Russell Crowe was wonderful. His singing was more tenor than the baritone usually heard from Javert. I recommend this movie highly.
0547848412|5.0|This story is a sensation for any age reader.  It is great for male and female readers.  I'm 83 and I consider The Life of Pi one of the greatest stories I've read.  It is captivating, compelling and hard to put down.  Try it!  I'm sure you'll like it.
B00BF123WG|5.0|The film explores the difficulty of finding and tracking terrorists without sensationalizing the process. Although much has been written about the action sequence of entering Bin Laden's compound, the film's real contribution is the focus on the preparatory work, which is done behind the scenes by dedicated servants who can't know if their efforts will ever result in real progress. Like most intelligence analysis, nothing is certain and analysts disagree on the validity and accuracy of information. The film gives a good sense of the real war on terror, without the dryness of a documentary.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I almost visited 'ye-old-movie-house' to see this one. I resisted and waited for the DVD so with ticket savings applied to the purchase, this DVD was &#34;FREE&#34;  and I can watch it again and...
B008XG1X18|2.0|Like too many Kindle apps, this one falls far short of using Pinterest on a browser. Could be much better and if Amazon cannot be bothered to expend some effort demanding better apps for its device, I might as well switch to an iPad or Google pad.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|You notice how little it is and how well it works on all your low bitrate mp3s.<br />Enhances the audio quite well without much distortion.  For the price point, it is a very good buy.<br />The 3 inbuilt equalizers are welcome addition.<br />Build quality could be better, you can feel it especially in the on/off button.<br /><br />But overall, a very good portable amplifier for 27 bucks.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|Good movie.  Glad I was able to rent it from home and watch it before the 2nd movie came out in theaters
0913866156|5.0|This deck was MUCH better than the smaller cards. The smaller cards are more flimsy and prone to marks that you will in time remember and thus ruin the whole gig (unless you are trying to count cards, lol). I have owned these cards for a year and they are still all identical as far as the backs of the cards go. I love the Thoth deck too.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|Bought this item as a Christmas gift and it was a hit.  They loved it!  I recommend this item to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. I find it challenging at times, just what I feel I need at this time in my life. 5 Star all the way.
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|Love the LOTR series and The Hobbit story (book). But this movie was a bit of a disappointment really. It does have it's moments but lack something from being great!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A modest, unvarnished glimpse into the life and journey of one U.S. Navy SEAL. Kyle's story sheds light on the deeply fueled patriotism and unflinching resolve of the nation's elite warrior. While it may be difficult at times to cope with the author's blunt, direct opinions of war and killing, it still offers a great perspective on the life behind the veil of secrecy surrounding the Navy SEAL.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|The transfer of the audio video were both very well done.<br />Nice special features package.<br />Very happy with it indeed.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I didn't like the first episode and it took a few for me to get interested in this show. I can see why people liked it so much, I can also understand why it was cancelled after the first season.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about setting Sherlock Holmes in modern NYC with a female sobriety counselor, Dr. Watson.  The writers have quelled my fears.  Familiar names appear throughout the episodes, sometimes with a new twist.  The original is respected, but realistically updated in my opinion.  Highly recommended
B00B8PMWJI|3.0|Boring in places but my husband likes these types of movies. They are too cliche for me though. Not much else to say
0767812166|5.0|I bought this for my Mom when it was on sale and she loves it.  Hardly see it on tv anymore so now she can watch it at will.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|This is what ever movie should be: smart, witty, fun, drastic, emotional, full of action and romance. It is a perfect date movie. If your date doesn't like it, you don't like him/her. Ditch the bitch!
0938045768|5.0|Just wanted to come here and say this book is amazing. Really well written and spot on. So happy I found this book!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Fantastic story of survival told in a gripping style - I read this over a holiday and found it difficult to put down.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Good from bad with ultimate resolution.  Keeps your attention and creates both a feeling of sympathy while condemning bad behavior.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it had suspense and had me on the edge of my seat.  Matthew M was an A+
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love, love, love this game. It s addicting but I really wish that you didn't have to wait on lives to play because I would play it all the time. I also enjoy playing in the weekly tournament as well as being able to play without spending.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app is fantastic,my son loves fractions....nowadays<br />His homework is completed in record time. The application is cheap and worth the price.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it. keeps my son attendtion. even my granddaughter enjoys it. makes long cars rides easies. thank you for the app
B005COO1X6|2.0|It is too scary, I prefer less gore and blood. I should have known from the history of the author it would be the same as others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! This game has provided me with many hours of entertainment, even though I personally liked the original version than the update, other than that it is an excellent game.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Bought as gift for nephew. He loved it and it works well. Bright colors.  So came back and bought one for my toddler.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|As an old marketing guy this series really brings back the era and the culture of advertising agencies extremely well.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Works well.  Very bright and useful.  Would recommend this app to all my friends.  Comes in handy in those dark moments when I need light to see detail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|now if you like animals or your a horse lover this is a good game for you I always wanted a horse and now I got one in a game thought
B000FA675C|4.0|This book is an amazing read that keeps you at the edge of your seat. I was unable to put the book down because of all the twists in the plot. This is by far my favorite novel by Dan Brown.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|I first got the book & had started to read it & saw that it was on CD. For the very little I had aready read in the book I KNEW I wanted the CD's so I could hear this book in my car. I CAN NOT in the english language fide would to discribe how incredably up lifting & mind blowing these CD's are & to here them for the first time driving down the road, before you have read the book. The power of them was infananty incredable. I can say if you are a person that suffers from road rage. GET these CD's because they will give you so much insperation that your road rage will fade into ablivean in a heart beat. I also loved the fact that the author Rhonda Byrne read the book her self for the CD's. If accents from other places you find you enjoy, her Austrelan accent just adds to the inate power these CD's alone already have. If you suffer from depression or have a harsh out look on your self. These CD's are deffanately for you. Please do not pass them by. If you cant afford the CD's but you can the book. The book is just as incredable. Even my 18 year old son ASKS... to listen to them in the car, rather then the radio. That says it all.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I just got it but so far it seems to be a good thing as it tells me how much time I have for each thing.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat during the entire film--Loved It!  Be sure to rent this movie now.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|it wanted me to go to youtube for instructions...I don't want to do that...it needs instructions at the beginning of it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My niece loves this game.  She plays this game for hours and is constantly buying items with the coins she wins to make the game even mire entertaining.
B000FA675C|3.0|This is a good summer read.I have to say, though, that the premise is a little far fetched. Why would DaVinci's paintings be taken as gospel regarding the life of Jesus Christ? He lived 1500 years later! It is an entertaining story, but that's about as far as I would go.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had heard this season would be more action and less story building, human interaction. While that may be true, I felt they stayed true to making a stunning show about how humanity reacts and survives in a catastrophic situation. Don't get me wrong, I love zombies. But you most definitely don't have to in order to love this show.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|We purchased the first 2 seasons and enjoyed them so much we wanted to see the next 2, in sequence.  Order arrived ahead of schedule.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Joss Whedon is the man.<br /><br />Best super hero movie ever made.<br />Best super hero movie ever made.<br />Best super hero movie ever made.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I love this series, whih it have never been canceled.  Came on time and was packed well.  Exactly as advertised.
B008EKMB82|4.0|I was already familiar with Dogen's Shobogenzo and am a Zen practitioner so was excited to read a novel using some of these ideas in a &#34; real life &#34; situation. The concepts did make the story more interesting for me but someone who has never heard of these ideas will also enjoy the book.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|the game is really good. i play it all the time. my grandsons love ti also. its a cool game
B00846REIS|4.0|The story is not as good as Shades of Gray but a close second, however.<br />It's steamy and raw and good for a lonely, rainy day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome  I would recommend this book to all children it is a very exciting book I luv it
0345803507|5.0|this series was amazing. i highly recommend it ! the books were hard to put down and I would stay up all night reading.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Great animation, lots of western movie cliches (a bit fun) some sexist aspects that are annoying. I mean really? A naked Barbie doll that objectifies the female body in a kid's movie? A reference to a female character's &#34;special time&#34; as an explanation for her acts? Le'ts get rid of this nonsense instead of passing it on to the next generation.
B000068FY0|5.0|Cross the sonic pallet of Steely Dan with the English cleverness of 10cc (and a dash of Pink Floyd dread for added effect), and you have Supertramp's breakthrough formula for \\"Crime of The Century.\\" This was the album where their progressive rock instincts of their arty early albums merged with a pop sense, meaning that many of the songs had great hooks and memorable melodies. This meant two things: They scored an American Hit with \\"Bloody Well Right\\" and a near miss with \\"Dreamer,\\" and that this was one of the best sounding albums of 1974.<br /><br />That didn't mean that Supertramp had turned into The Sweet. They still had it in them to stretch out on a jam like \\"Rudy\\" for seven plus minutes, or the orchestral overload of \\"Asylum.\\" Like Pink Floyd, they took to investigating where the border between sanity and insanity balanced. \\"Asylum,\\" \\"Hide In Your Shell\\" and \\"If Everyone Was Listening\\" are cries from a haunted soul (perhaps it belongs to Rudy). \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" may have been a take on full-on madness, \\"Crime of The Century\\" wonders how you get there.<br /><br />That kind of thinking extended into other Supertramp albums (think of \\"Fool's Overture\\" on \\"Even in The Quietest Moments\\" or even the hit \\"The Logical Song\\"). However, it was the interplay of band leaders and chief songwriters  Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson that made \\"Crime of The Century\\" such a thought provoking album. And it still sounds as sonically gorgeous now as it did when it pulled Supertramp into stardom.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER! IT HELPS A BUNCH AT HOME AND WITH HOMEWORK. IM DOING GREAT IN MATH AND THIS IS THE BEST CALCULATOR APP. BUY IT! :)
B000V39KDO|5.0|My husband and I can watch this movie over and over again. I must purchase this movie to keep in my collection
B000BZISTE|5.0|My husband and I were wanting to re-visit the original cast of MASH. Now that we are more mature (older) I think it was even more fun.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed all the fun of Baggin's. I was enthralled  with Armitage's portrayal of Thorin. All the actors were good.  A little too much violence for me. Everyone should see this movie.  Peter Jackson's  vision is amazing.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I read Childhood's End first over 40 years ago and loved it.  As it remained in my mind as one of the definitive science fiction books of all times I decided to read it again recently.....and was not disappointed.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I'm fine with the film, which I saw in theatres and the same version of which is included here. I'll let others debate its merits (or lack there-of).  That is not what my rating is for, instead I'm just focusing on the extras. I knew I wasn't getting the cool stuff that the LOTR extended package included, but there really isn't much here as far as extras compared to most movies.  A short documentary on New Zealand with literally just minutes devoted to each of a few movie locations, then some video blogs that were available for free as they were regularly released during production.  My version also included a book about Middle Earth that is clearly aimed at youngsters.<br /><br />I knew I should have waited for the extended editions, but couldn't stop myself this time.  Oh well.  Hopefully some of you will.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love coming to my kindle every day and playing subway suffers.Keep playing this game;also every monthor so it has a new level.I enjoy it very much thanks for looking at this review.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Love this band and their music they put out a good cd and it arrives so fast, after it shipped.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charging cable works as expected.  The cord is long enough and fits my kindle fire and charges it quickly.
B00BSBVLF8|1.0|I have seen them live. they are extrodinary. This 'movie' version fells contrived and edited. I was bored and dissappointed.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|My great-grandaughter and I enjoyed our ride with the Hatladies, and we appreciate everything that was done. She is still talking about it.
B004L9MFM2|2.0|I read this book having watched the 1st TV season of Game of Thrones.  Such a disappointment.  Whist the characters are strongly developed, it completely lacks in the 'plot' department.  The saga rambles on, chapter after chapter, describing the minutia of circumstance befalling each character and their respective entourages but fails to excite.  Definitely no page-turner.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie. Interesting story line that had us wanting more and more. Haven't seen a movie for a long time that had a &#34; moral to the story&#34;. Enjoyed it very much and may want to watch again!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Not much action, but, a good recreation of Lincoln. I think at the end they should have put the train in there that carried his body that would have been a good addition to the film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I usually don't get into the zombie thing.  Someone said to check the series out and from the first episode I was hooked!  This season is better then the first two.  There are flawed good guys, kind bad guys, and of course the walkers.  Great series - I highly recommend it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm no engineer, but I am a mechanic, and maybe that's why I liked this book. The engineers will read this and laugh, but I thought it was well done.
B00ATPVA78|1.0|Paid 4.99 for game but have not been able to complete because it keeps shutting down. I am reloading it right now. Hope I can come back a change my review.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it better than the Temple Run it is a little more trickier than the first one and the skill level is more challenging.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|doesnt Zac Efron just blow your mind. Well he does ine thats why i decided to get this one, the dvd is in top shape as well as the package
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Great movie for kids, my husband and I enjoyed it too! My boys are 6 and 11 and they both enjoyed it!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful, exciting and perfect entertainment, This film is what all other films should be. It tales you thoughts away from your life to take you on a wonderful adventure.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love watching it on Amazon Prime with no commercials! It's so well done and the cast is fantastic!  I recommend this one!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This history made me cried and thought me a lot about cruelty. The Jews are God's people and the apple of his eyes. Someday he will gather them from around the world. God keeps his promises.
B00004D304|1.0|The movie would not play in any of my 3 DVD players. The seller in my opinion just sent mumbo jumbo wording about DVD Regions & Players. Also in my opinion most people who buy a DVD in the USA from a business in the USA expect it to work. I am sending this item back & will NEVER do business with MovieMars again. Here's the description that they have.....<br />Region 2 encoding (This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV.<br /> It says MOST NOT ALL....My question is aren't alot if not most DVD players made from Japan or other countries ????? Oh Well....LESSON LEARNED !!!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I personally like hidden object games so I really enjoy playing mystery manor. If you don't like hidden object games you probably won't like this game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So many twists and turns in this series. Not your typical sci fi/fantasy, but a more realistic story of what could happen to this world because of human nature. So hard to wait for the final book!
B001H1SVO8|4.0|I really like the quirky film. Tyler Durbin is an interesting character!  Some of this picture is very disturbing, but keeps your interest, none the less
1616550414|5.0|Every Zelda fan or collector should own this item.  It's a beautiful product. My only problem with it was the comic.  There is a short comicin the back and it should have been in full color, butit was not.  That was disappointing, though definitely not a deterrent.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|This is a fantastic game. Very old school and true to the Sega series! Now Sega, how about some of your other older games
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a terrific series!  It has a feel of Sparticus but it isn't as graphic.  The History Channel's first dramatic series is a &#34;historical&#34; success.  I love the characters and the story is great because of the factual nature.  Ragnor is a compelling character and the supporting characters are all great.  Can't wait for Season 2 already.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The drama continues!  It will be difficult to wait for the next season.  Watching season 3 definitely helped pass the time during  surgery recovery.
B009GED3HS|2.0|it didnt buffer good at all I had to reload the page like 5 times so it was a huge pain especially for a show
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Recently introduced to  Downton Abbey.  it's difficult to not watch one episode after another. A great story of a unique family and their estate.  Highly recommended.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|The Impossible is excellent, with gifted actors, and high drama. It made me weep and truly understand those who suffered. I recommend it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Although a lot of people bash the movie and the book for the ending it actually worked for me as it made almost everything make sense. I am not going to ruin this for anyone but I hgihly enjoyed reading the book and watching the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sweet, romantic, surprising. This book made me want to keep reading! Excellent story with a great ending. This book kept me guessing but really surprised me.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Loved the actor playing Michael Ohar (spelling?). Loved Sandra Bullock's performance.  She looked a little over-Botoxed though.  Great screenplay. And TRUE
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love the entire series.  Great read, read them all in about two weeks.  I would like to see more books to follow.
B0012NO4WO|4.0|Great performances by lead actors.  Seems a little dated now.  Not much to it except driving the bus fast, running the subway fast and bombs
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is a great show. It really worth your while to spend some time to see it, although I really can not stand the female lead.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Been a Star Trek fan since it started I could use colorful metaphors to describe it but ill refrain from doing so.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Two honorable men, a girl in distress, a troupe of fine actors (few better cowboys than Duvall), and a masterful story teller in McMurtry.  How can you go wrong?  Excellent.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Although this is better than the facebook for Android app, it is not perfect. I can't share something anywhere other than my page and that is a MAJOR flaw. Would love this if that was fixed.
B0086449YA|5.0|If you are a Knopfler fan, this is an excellent collection of music... &#34;Sailing to Philadelphia&#34; used to be my favorite... this has eclipsed it.  Highly recommended.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Nice price for this GREAT TV series.  Haven't watched it yet but like the price value.  Was better than buying at Costco  which is my usual purchase place of TV sets.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|GOOD PLOT, FAST ACTION, ACTING A LITTLE FLAT, BUT OVERALL A GOOD WATCH. MY SON (20) WOULD WATCH PARTS OF IT OVER & OVER.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Not for the squeamish, but a fast moving story that is a must for<br />those who want to know the whole Jack Reacher background.
B001TM14VC|4.0|Video & audio quality very good, familiar movie; but I didn't watch to the good part<br />with the dynamic music
1432794426|5.0|Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy (Paperback)<br />I am a huge fan of Michael Jackson and read all I can find about him. This book gives me alot of information that I had not read before. I am so sad that he lost so much of his short life because of liars.<br /><br />I just got my 3 day reminder that the book is due back so I have a tiny bit to read before I return it.  I love the book Karen.  I am Debbie Siener from Bobbys Michael Jackson group.
B00005RFH1|5.0|We rarely see this classic on local cable and is a real favorite.  The price was very acceptable and the quality is excellent.
B004KZDV8E|4.0|good cpu. prefer i5
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Be prepared for a journey through 20 th century history and then some.<br />A thoroughly engaging and enjoyable read<br />Highly recommended
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a good game for people that are just learning how to play Mahjong. There are more difficult games.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Hearing the CD I can picture every scene in this great movie.  I have listened to it over and over again and do not get tired of the power of this CD.
030758836X|3.0|The first half is absolutely masterful.  One would swear, however, that the second half was written by someone else.  The plot turns preposterous, and what had been a very interesting sociopath turns into a not-so-interesting psychopath.  I was extremely disappointed.  The only reason I award the book three stars is due to the quality of the first half.  (As a teacher, I'd have given this book an A/D-)
B000I9WW0E|5.0|This disappeared from Netflix recently--that's a bummer, man. So I bought this on Amazon instant to make sure Dude was available to me at a moment's notice. Even on Shabbos. It really ties my life together.
B0087EACJK|5.0|My kids and I love this game! We work on it together and see who comes up with the right configurations. I just don't stress about the time to beat, I figure my 40 plus year old brain is getting a workout.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I expected this to be bad, but in a good way, if you know what I mean. It's not. It's bad in a bad way. Don't waste your time or money.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|I've always liked this movie a lot, I wore out several vhs copies over the years. Hadn't seen it in a while, and then my daughter asked if we had a copy of it totally out of the blue. Got a good price on it from Amazon and can't wait to watch it with her, hopefully she'll enjoy it as much as I do.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I refused to watch this movie for a long time. Even though others raved about it, I didn't think much of a 'futuristic sacrificial killing'  plot line. Boy, it wasn't anything like I expected. Rich in cinematography, acting and even the plot line, it kept me riveted all the way through. Highly recommend it, even to others like me who are not in to the futuristic stuff.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|thought this would be a time passer only; thorougly enjoyed playing; addictive; wish there were more levels;<br />considering buying hidden letters
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Wife loves this fascinating time period piece with plenty of drama. Story is well done and captures your attention. Interesting show with a great second season. Looking forward to season 3.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|My husband and I just finished this second season and we cannot wait for the next one to come out. This series is for those who love to see historical fiction with the visual of the likes of &#34;300&#34;, then this is for  you. In this season, there were definately plenty of twists that were very unexpected.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. It's my new addiction, but it could use more features and more mission types! It needs more ways to get characters besides just collecting stuff. More boards and powerups would be cool, too. But other than that, this is my number favorite game!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Suspense! The Following has some of the same traits that I like in TV. I missed Battlestar Galactica, Lost and the Walking Dead. They all had suspense and I think it is rare to get such good quality suspence in TV nowadays. Oh Yeah! Kevin Bacon awesome!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Bubble Mainia is a fun and entertaining game that my kids and I love, it occupies our spare time in between appointmeints.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|One of the Best movies that I have ever viewed showing the true &#34;Brutality&#34; of these &#34;Gangs Of New York&#34;. The acting was superb also with actors Leonradi diCaprio,Daniel Day-Lewis. Well acted,realistic,great filming,directing,and all-around Great movie,that I would highly recommend to anyone,with the exception of anybody who does not enjoy violence.
B004OR199G|5.0|I loved this book. Too often I found myself unable to put it down. Kris writes in such an appealing and non-judgmental style which is really nice when dealing with such a drastic change for most people. I love the balance of information, suggestions, love, and grace. I will definitely be trying out the CSD method!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Loved this film.  Quite the contrast to today's typical turn your brain and heart off, no character development, special effects stimulation oriented offering.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great way to test your vision and great brain training game. wish the energy refilled itself faster, also wish purchases were more coin based than diamonds
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Having read other great stories from Lee Child, I did not realize that this was the book, \\"Killing Floor,\\" that started it all. It is a must read because the character Jack Reacher is introduced and his brother Joe as well. This suspenseful blockbuster of a story starts when Jack Reacher traveling to Atlanta on a Greyhound express bus suddenly ask the driver to make an unscheduled stop near a town called Margrave. The driver makes an exception and a nightmare begins for Jack.  Margrave is really a no name town but there is something going on that stinks. The only reason Jack walks  14 miles down a county road from the Interstate in the pouring rain is that his brother Joe told him that Margrave is where the famed blues guitarist Blind Blake died. But later he discovers he didn't die there he was killed there. Being hungry as he always is he stops at a diner on the edge of town for a hearty breakfast. The story then takes an explosive twist and Jack is arrested. But how can this be happening since Jack was never in Margrave and this is his first visit. Now Jack wonders why he ever decide to get off the Greyhound bus and why he asked the driver to make an unscheduled stop in a town that is nowhere. Things go downhill from there literally. You start wonder why the leaders of this down are so conflicted in their assumptions and actions concerning Jack Reacher. The reason is simple; they are hiding a terrible secret! Yes, and it takes Jack almost a week to follow the many clues and solve the mystery. Meanwhile nothing is what it seems to be. This is a very exciting story and Jack is dogged at every turn. In solving the who-done-it to whom Jack is continually realizing that it is all smoke and mirrors, lies and deceptions. Who can he believe and why does it all seem like the tip of an iceberg? What is happening in this no-name town call Margrave? Let me add a bit of caution... if you have a sensitive stomach or a weak heart I would not recommend this story. But for all who are fans of Lee Child's suspenseful stories or want to read a great story from a masterful writer of suspenseful, mysteries I highly recommend this story. It is a favorite of mind...

B00BSBU4EC|3.0|This was a cute movie. though it had too much violence it also had some good messages.  I'm not sure what kind of messages we are giving the children, with all the competition and fighting between the &#34;Good Guys&#34;.  The idea that all the holiday characters were all working to save belief in them was interesting.  I think in the end it redeemed itself .
B004X75RK4|5.0|This is a really fun movie. We enjoyed it so much we watched it a second time a month after the first. Sandra's character's chant in the woods is an absolute hoot!!! It makes me giggle. Now my girls will start singing the chant if they see I'm in a grumpy mood - turns me right around.
0800141806|5.0|A very good look at AIDS in it's earlier years, it's devastating effects on not only the person has it, but on friends, family and others as well.  Also a look at the dark side of corporations and their dealings with employees that have it.
B001DPC4SM|4.0|Got it as a Bdy gft for a true die hard fan whose a friend. He loves it. The cove is really nice and nostalgic too.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|If the strike team were allowed to exist in real life without the ACLU and the Courts interfering the country would be a much safer place for a law abiding person.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|very difficult to pick up and stay in the moment.  Confusing at times due to so many unheard of words.
0785152458|5.0|Great book showing what most won't see in movies.<br />Killer story mix with outstanding artwork and piece together with crazy<br />dialogue.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a lovely book. It is great to read a book about another country. The values and the unexpected are sweet,at the same time a little sad.  Thank You
B0092MKFIY|5.0|How is it possible that I am just now discovering this band?!<br /><br />All the songs on the album are good (can't remember the last time that's happened when I've purchased an album). But, my favorite has to be \\"Nothing Left To Say.\\" Who hasn't found themselves in that situation once or twice....when the words just don't matter anymore and there's truly nothing left to say.<br /><br />Right then, back to the point: interesting/thought provoking lyrics = 5 stars.<br /><br />Now stop reading this review and go purchase/download this album already!<br /><br />-Sue
B009AJD5E0|4.0|not gonna lie...this was the third time ive tried to watch this movie...LOVED the Alien series and was excited about a prequel directed by the same director...<br /><br />first couple times i cut it off, completely different than Aliens and i felt it was really, REALLY far reaching...but i certainly liked the sets, costumes, some of the actors, and i still wanted to finish it out and did so last night...<br /><br />if you go into this movie completely forgetting evrything about Aliens and take it for what it is...a really expensive, expansive Sci-Fy movie i think you will enjoy it as i grew to.....no, it doesnt pack the horror punch of Aliens but its not trying to....its the start of a EPIC three part series and it achieves its goals very well i think...<br /><br />it is rather confusing and i found myself more than once checking online for the plot details which, at the time, is annoying but looking back this movie doesn't pander to the audience at all....you are either in or you are out....simple as that....<br /><br />take it for what it is, forget Aliens, forget Sigorney, etc.....and enjoy a truly remarkable journey!!! (there are enough Alien references and sneaky, gross things to keep you occupied as well.....)<br /><br />recommended.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|It really is not fair for me to review this book.  I started reading it. It didn't hold my interest so I switched to another book.  I might go back to it.  this I don't know yet.  Not sure I am wanting to take the road trip with Mr. Fry
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Good movie, sat on edge of seat at times.  I think that Pi had a guarding angel at times, especially to afford a tiger.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|Easy to learn and fun to play - it's gonna take time for me to get the timing down, but that's the challenge.
0800141601|5.0|It doesn't get any better than Sean Connery, Richard Gere, and Julia Ormond! Not to mention the beautiful scenery and costumes!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have not had the opportunity to watch the entire series yet, but what I have watched is wonderful. The acting is remarkable and I love seeing the culture of the day. Costuming a fascinating.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Jeffrey Archer keeps the reader guessing all the time.  He carries you back in time and the characters are real.
B004IYISSK|5.0|I was surprised how hard it was to find this classic in local libraries. What a shame. It's a must-read for anyone who wants to understand other cultures.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|For a supposed Horror category there is not much too scary here. Too long to get moving. Bored entire time
0670026557|5.0|This book talks about `givers', `takers' and `matchers'. Givers are rare and they help others instinctively, frequently at cost to themselves. Their open-handed generosity makes the world better. Takers tilt the reciprocity balance toward themselves and put their own interest above that of everyone else. Matchers try to balance giving and taking and expect direct reciprocity when they help others.<br /><br />Now, in a competitive world takers should rise to the top, right? Givers are so busy helping others that their own work suffers. And, indeed, many surveys find that those at the bottom of the heap have higher `giving' scores than those above them who tend to be takers and matchers.<br /><br />Proof that `good guys finish last', right?<br /><br />Hold your horses. It turns out that those at the very top also have higher giving scores than the average of those below them. In other words givers dominate at both the top and bottom.<br />Why this is so and what do the givers on top do differently from those at the bottom is what the book is all about. It also reinforces a thesis I strongly hold. If you want to get ahead, then help as many others as you can without keeping score.<br /><br />Givers on the top are `otherish', meaning that they do not deplete themselves and quickly learn to give the most to other givers. It's a little bit like the admonition you hear from a flight attendant every time you board a plane - in case of a decompression, first put the mask on yourself and then try to help others. They differ from matchers because they do not try to balance their giving and taking.<br /><br />There are host of super stories throughout. The opening vignette is about a venture capitalist who agreed to fund an entrepreneur but gave him all the time in the world and placed no restrictions on his offer. The entrepreneur went elsewhere.<br /><br />But he was so impressed by the way the venture capitalist handled himself that he went back to give him a part of the deal and then became a fervent advocate and helped him get many other clients. That is the way it works.<br /><br />In a popular course I teach called Creativity and Personal Mastery there is an exercise called The Other-Centered Universe in which participants set out to help someone with no strings attached. Their reward is the privilege of being able to help. They are not even allowed to expect a `thank you'. If they get one, that is a bonus. If they regret not getting one, they violated the spirit of the exercise. Participants report that they feel extraordinarily good after doing this exercise.<br /><br />Now Grant provides `proof' that behaving in such a manner not only makes you feel good but also likely places you on a fast track to success.<br /><br />His examples touch many industries and occupations. Politics is largely absent with the exception of a shining example of a politician who achieved truly great things as a by product of his unstinting giving. Many of his former opponents became his supporters or, at least, helped him at crucial junctures.<br /><br />That politician is Abraham Lincoln - certainly a person worthy of emulation.<br /><br />Now, it is readily obvious that the world will be a vastly better place if there were many more givers than takers. Can you imagine what would happen if politicians in our troubled areas - such as the Middle East - became genuine givers sincerely interested in the well-being of their political adversaries?<br /><br />Great thought, but unlikely to happen, right?<br /><br />Is it possible to `convert' a taker to a `giver.' I know it is because, in my course, it happens repeatedly. Every participant comments on how giving everyone else is. I now know why this happens. Takers are highly sensitive to the context in which they operate. When they are in a situation where the `norm' is giving, then that part of them surfaces and they often give much more than they take and also much more than they would have normally given. They cleverly figure out that if they are perceived as givers, others will give more to them and they want that.<br /><br />So a national conversation about givers and takers could get everyone sensitized to such behavior and have persons evaluating one another in terms of their `giving' and `taking' behavior. When such a conversation is taking place, takers tend to become givers.<br /><br />Initially takers become givers because they are sensitive to reputation and do not want to be labeled as takers. But, eventually, when they have done it long enough, they become genuine givers.<br /><br />And, with the high profile Adam Grant has, this book could just start such a national conversation. And when takers become givers, all of us will benefit and the world will change for the better.<br /><br />One caveat, the indexing is terrible. When you read it, have your highlighter in hand and a pen. Mark sections you want to return to and persons who you would like to know more about. Many mentioned in the book such as Scott Gerber, Jonathan Haidt and Sameer Jain do not make it to the index.<br /><br />Finally, there are stunning insights in the book that you can use immediately for great personal benefit. For example, Grant reports on a study that showed men consistently outdoing women in a negotiating game. A simple shift had the women running rings around the men.<br /><br />This is a technique that I have used and teach and it absolutely works. It is not gender specific - a later story shows how a man used it to gain a substantial salary increase.<br /><br />So what is this method? Get the book to find out. I will tell you this much - the answer is on page 205..

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I haven't watched any of Craig as James Bond. He is just too angry and not attractive to me. I found out this one had a little history of Bond and everyone said how good it was so I watched it. Still don't like Craig and how he portrays Bond but liked the movie and the story.<br />Sex: There is a upright sex scene that showed both bodies side view. There is implied sex to others. There is a shower scene where Bond gets in with the girl but you only see them kiss.<br />Language: There is some. Does M say the F word? I think I heard it in there.<br />Violence: Tons, like all Bond movies. Death, torture details of violence death and torture to almost all in the movie.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I had expected it to be much better with all the hype it had received, but still it was an entertaining film.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I expected more of a &#34;Hollywood&#34; movie not a documentary type movie, but I was engrossed throughout the whole thing. As my companions got up and went to do more interesting things I was glued to the television. I have always loved history and the civil war is fascinating to me and I loved the raw realism of this movie. Each actor,tress in this movie did an amazing job and Daniel Day Lewis was AMAZING!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Made the whole situation more real.  It had me from the beginning, but the ending did have me glued to my seat!
030716327X|4.0|My little one loves the bunny and the story. I wish the book wasn't so flimsy and I would buy a board book version if I could go back..
B0049J2BSM|4.0|We rented it to view before going to Disney World just because we knew some of the shows there included Monsters, Inc. characters.
B00AI5AQPQ|4.0|Matilda is typical of Dahl... Funny for kids, sometimes even funnier for adults. I even laughed out loud a couple of times reading this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this trilogy twice.  Read it second time like it was the first time.  Will probably read again.  Loved it that much.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It was unfortunate that this book was written in the first person. I really wanted someone to just kill Katniss Everdeen every time I turn the page, and because it was told from her point of view, I knew it wasn't going to happen. Her very strong character turned into a whiny teenager sometime in book two and got even whinier in this book. Katniss became unlikable, and I found yself page after page rooting for Peeta to kill her mercilessly. The story line also wasted too much time on her sister's cat and what her mocking jay outfits looked like. I basically only read the whole thing just to get through it. I especially don't suggest this book to anyone who liked the other two books in the series
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I wasn't expecting much but what I got was an amazing experience. It totally validated me getting this Kindle.  This game is the bomb.

B00BHU2A7I|2.0|Hitchcock was alright, that's all, alright. It was very cookie cutter as far as true stories go, take a true event, get a small back story going, \\"of love variety\\" and the rest was just what we already know about Hitchcock.

B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Danish metal band Volbeat has parted ways with lead guitarist Thomas Bredahl and has also shared that former Anthrax and The Damned Things guitarist Rob Caggiano has officially joined the band. His addition has proved integral to the band's ever evolving sound. Caggiano also served as producer on Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies alongside long-time production partner Jacob Hansen, who produced and mixed the band's prior four albums.<br /><br />\\"Half of the album tracks will take you into the world of outlaw gunslinger stories sometime in the 1800s. Some of the characters are true legends, while others are fiction. The listener will hear inspiration from classic spaghetti western movies which gives you a clue to the album title and cover artwork.\\"<br /><br />\\"You can hear the influence of the Old West right from the start in \\"Let's Shake Some Dust,\\" an evocative intro track that features harmonica from acclaimed blues harp player Paul Lamb.\\"<br /><br />This is definitely the most ambitious set of tracks they've committed to tape, the songwriting is tightly focused, there are lots of hooks, most of them heavy -- thanks, no doubt, to Caggiano's presence. The band shifts from rockabilly to thrash, from death metal to heavy metal to country, and often within the fabric of the same song. Hard rock and vintage heavy metal dominate on cuts like \\"Pearl Heart,\\" the rifferiffic \\"The Nameless One,\\" and the ultra-aggressive attack in \\"The Hangman's Body Count.\\"<br /><br />\\"The slow, doomy chug of \\"Room 24\\" melds early Black Sabbath, Hetfieldishness, to death metal with King Diamond guesting on vocals.\\" Great pick guys!<br /><br />\\"Another surprise is in the cover of Young the Giant's \\"My Body.\\" Thanks to Poulsen's awesome singing and the blasting guitars, it could pass as a Volbeat anthem.\\"<br /><br />Former \\"Creepshow\\" and now in a Canadian band called \\"Walk Off The Earth\\" vocalist Sarah Blackwood sings with Poulsen on \\"Lonesome Rider,\\" where slap bass rockabilly and hooky '80s metal co-mingle.\\"<br /><br />\\"Our Loved Ones\\" is a really slow heavy song, with a great acoustic harmonica ridden intro with an ultra-vulnerable undertone.<br /><br />\\"Doc Holliday\\" is definitely very heavy, inspired by the famous gunslinger.  Volbeat refer to this one as \\"Our Slayer Song\\". Metallica infused from head to toe with a very uncharacteristic heavy chorus.<br /><br />This is the best band to come along in some time, with a new vibe, ultra-heavy, vintage and modern rolled into one. A muscular approach, a cool combination of when blisters meet polish.<br /><br />This album isn't just the best example of what Volbeat are capable of producing it is heavy metal at its best as well. It's like a \\"horror outlaw movie\\" unique, unpredictable and so good it's scary.<br /><br />Poulsen also offers additional detail on the recordings sharing:<br /><br />\\"We are very excited about this album. We feel that we've achieved the goals we set out.

B008S4FZHI|2.0|did not find this book as good as her very first ones e.g. the body farm those books i could not put down.  This i could put down and forget about it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Writers keep your mind struggling to keep up.  They filled in so many holes left unsaid in previous novels - I unstand that so they have something interesting to say in the next book.  I would say to myself &#34;I did not see that coming&#34;  Agent Pendergast is a superman in my eyes - hope the authors never run out of stories to tell.  My first novel was &#34;The Cabinet of Curiosities, and I was hooked - wanting to read the first and following novels, etc.  I am never disappointed in the story line - never know what to expect actually.  What a blessing to have the gift of writing, and feeling your thoughts firing off at warp speed to fill the next sentance.<br /><br />PB/Ohio
B006O2QNOU|4.0|The movie never fully explained just what toxic securities they pushing off on the unsuspecting public. Or for that matter who or what role did Simon Baker, play in the movie accept maybe pave the way for Mr Big, played by Jeremy Irons? But outside it was enjoyable to watch.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is my sister's favorite play. As soon as I saw that the DVD version of the movie was going to be available I pre-ordered it for her. I called her while she was watching it and she couldn't talk because she was crying so hard.. She LOVED it. Fast delivery, great price.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I had hoped the second book would be better but it was more of the same mish mash.  I won't read the thrid book!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I really like the James Bond trilogy, this one was the best, due to the action and the acting of James and M.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|What's better than an apocalypse?  That's right... an apocalypse with flesh eating zombies!<br />I love the show because it's much more than killing zombies and surviving... It's about people and how society acts and how we behave.  What used to be taboo or wrong is now right for survival.  It's an interesting study on just how fragile our societal rules are and how primal at the core humans really are. And... occasionally they find really cool ways to kill zombies!
B004X4R49Y|3.0|This movie was slow, but watchable.  It is an excellent historical piece, but more moving than interesting.  Overall, worth watching once.
B004SBULWE|4.0|App works great for Android Tablet and on Kindle Fire HD. Recommend it to help with battery life. Used the free version.
B003HYNB34|5.0|With a new Doctor, a new writing style, and apparently a massive budget, this season took the show in a whole new, but still spectacular direction.  I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The grand kids asked to play this game. Of course I tried it out first (I always try out their game requests) and found it to be pretty fun to play. I the same vein as Temple Run and others, the game starts out easy and gets progressively harder. There are also power ups and other characters to unlock by collecting various items as you play. Overall, quite enjoyable.
B003KLGKAA|5.0|This season was a bit of a let down, generally, though it had some of the best episodes in Dr. Who.  The season finale was without a doubt my favorite ever.
B007H1HQW0|1.0|So far my husband and I BOTH have tried several times to cut the bottom off of a wine bottle. So far, all we have managed to do is distroy the bottles! I have watched videos, on how to do it, and it looks sooooo easy! I do not know what we are doing wrong, but it is not working for us so far!
B003NRWW58|4.0|Set in the Dr. Who universe, this show has its own, somewhat more intense character.  Certainly more violent than Dr. Who, but also a solid show, featuring excellent characters and gripping plots.
B005L38QK2|5.0|the mouse itself is pretty much what you would expect from a mid to top end SteelSeries Product: Solid, Reliable and quick working.  Where this really comes into its own is in the software that comes along with it.  lots of fun and cool features including lifetime click calculators and multiple save able modes for you know when you use this for games other than Diablo 3.
B003LZ5B7S|4.0|This season wasn't as good as what followed, but it set the stage for a new generation of Whovians.  The basics were introduced, and there were some fantastic stand alone episodes.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One word - KLEENEX!!!  This is such an inspirational book - and, if you're a dog lover, it gets to your heart even more.  If only humans would live their lives like our canine friends...they're way smarter and compassionate than most...
B001L5YW9I|5.0|As a fan of the original book, I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did.  It's an older film, yet still as exciting and emotionally gripping as many modern action films.  It takes liberties with the plot, but still maintains its own storyline well, producing a very complete epic narrative.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is always a good read to me. Lee  Child's puts you right in the action.  It's s book you can't put down!
B004XS97KO|5.0|This season was more focused than those that proceeded it, driving forward with the main plot from episode to episode, and bringing us to a bold, brilliant conclusion.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I try to play some games each day to keep my mind active. Along with software and freecell these keep me and my mind active.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This is an excellent historical drama, capturing the heart of the abolition movement in England through the eyes of one of its great leaders.  This film avoids being preachy, yet captures the heart of a movement that changed the world.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I've loved Paramore since 2006, but I liked them because they were pop-punk. So consider this review maybe a little biased. I hate the current trends in music. It's this weird hybrid breed of alt-rock and dance tracks. Fun., The Naked and Famous, etc. That's exactly what this album is. Not too much pop-punk, but more so this sickly sweet feminine (Cardigans-esque) 80's pop. Just a bit more modern.I'm personally not a fan, but I don't acclimate well to musical change. All I know is that this 1980's bubblegum, dance-pop on crack isn't my thing.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br /><br />Still Into You<br />Anklebiters<br />Future<br />Proof
B008133DO8|5.0|Rarely do I find any movie or show which compared favorably to its original source material.  This show is one of the exceptions.  In its depth and richness, it even surpasses many aspects of the original books, particularly in the depth of the characters, and the dimensions of the world, which are fleshed out here in a war Sir Doyle never attempted.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I love this book. I recommend every book in the Honor Harrington universe. David Weber is one of the best authors I have ever read.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Gripping, tragic, exciting, realistic, even historical (somewhat).  This movie captures the sense of once of the early battles of the Vietnam war in a way few others have even approached.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really liked this book-<br /><br />Solid story line, keeps your interest.<br />Looking forward to seeing the movie!<br /><br />Some people have said they thought this book is funny- totally disagree unless you have no compassion for ppl with mental illness- really just found it sad. Guess there are a few &#34;humorous&#34; parts, but certainly not a comedy...
B000GX8B9I|5.0|Few movies have ever approached the success of Black Hawk Down in technical proficiency, storytelling, or accuracy.  There were liberties taken, but overall this movie is so close to the original history as to almost classify as a documentary.  A must see!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|If you've heard mention of the United Nations push for a &#34;sustainable planet&#34; this is it, folks.  This is the ultimate goal of Agenda 21, (maybe minus the child gladiators) but a totally subservient population with no rights, dignity or freedom.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I loved every minute of this show, from the characters, plots, themes, costuming, even the cinematography.  Far and away one of the best things ever made, this show brilliantly adapts the a time-honored character to a new age.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Wonderful characters. John Hawkes was superb and Helen Hunt really put herself out there for an incredibly heartfelt and vulnerable performance. Highly recommend film, but definitely not for kids.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Este juego lo compre para mi hijo, el lo disfruta no le doy cnco estrelllas porq para mi es lo mismo de siempre.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very convenient and easy to use. I was skeptical at first, but I recommend this highly. This allows me to carry books that I use for reference without having to lug them about.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I love this show!  They are all so talented and there is nothing better than singing and dancing and drama.
0061714402|5.0|Arrived in great condition, albeit the corners were a bit bent. The book itself is great. Describes Dave Mustaine's experiences from his birth (almost) to the date it was released with plenty of pictures/photos included. All that in almost 400 pages. I love the feel of the covers and the pages. It's something I don't often find. Maybe it's exclusive to America. Here in Australia, we use cheaper materials maybe.
0066620996|5.0|This book helps show that as managers what we think and do has a direct impact on our working environments. I found this book uplifting and motivating.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Awesome movie, awesome director, great cast, and plenty of tears from me. Gut wrenching that is all I can say.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|DAY-LEWIS GREAT, MOVIE SO SO<br />No effort to develop characters.  Cast of thousands osbviousy computer generated.  Good, but not great.  But, Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the Oscar..
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Had to get it for a class at school. I'm sure someone else might like it more if they're interested in this topic.
B004QMRHHW|5.0|There is nothing bad about this album. I love rocking it at work. It keeps the goobers away from my desk.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|As a fan of the tv show naturally I had to read the comic gotta say the book felt rushed the pace of the show us so much better and the changes were definitely for the better. But I will continue to support the comic and think about how it differs from the show and anticipate the next chapter for Rick and the gang.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are terrific, my grandkids love it. There was a glitch with flooding coins and level, but customer service responded quickly and politely.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|One of the best show that I didn't know it was out there. Now I'm hooked, started to watch from the first season, many more to catch up.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book, read it in two sittings.  I could not put it down.  It's a must read.  Have recommended to friends and family.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This series will have you questioning your senses after each episode. Not only does it provide a wild array of spooky stories but the cast will have you wanting more. Jessica Lange has an amazing range in this series not to mention a comic edge. If you enjoy scary tales, but not too over the top, this series will leave you wanting to watch season 2 in a hurry.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read wicked and someone told me to read books about Oz by L. Frank Baum.  I have not yet had time to sit down and read.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|I don't like the ending.  LOL  This was a great way to watch season 3.  Thanks Amazon and Downton Abbey.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This movie is extremely entertaining. It follows the book relatively well and is just a fun film to watch. The characters are complex yet understandable, the graphics are enjoyable.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|It is Dark Side remastered. What else is there to say? If you like Pink Floyd, get it. If you don't know who Pink Floyd is, get it. If you dislike Pink Floyd, there is no help for you.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Over 20 years ago, I read Goldratt's &#34;The Goal&#34; and loved it for its readability, mystery, teaching through storytelling, and reinforcing organizations as systems - production systems and human systems. Since then my work has been with software development and IT, and I've wished for a book that would tell a similar story for knowledge work.  After several different people independently recommended that I read &#34;The Phoenix Project&#34;, I picked it up. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. Finally my wish has come true - a simple straightforward story of the evolution toward high performance devops and working cross-functionally to improve a system. I also appreciated all the references to retrospectives, improvement kata, and other group learning, collaborative problem solving, and team decision making for organizational and process improvement! Thank you Steve Bell, Jez Humble and all the others who recommended this book.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I am a big fan of the director and this is by far his best work to date!  Simply amazing entertainment!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been reading all these reviews and the commonality is that alot seem to mention weight loss or lack of it and I believe that weighing yourself once a month over once a week or every other day can have a huge effect on your decision to continue or not.  I started 30 Day Shred on 25th February 2013.  Sometimes I incorporated Killer Buns and Thighs and completed 25 out of the 30 days.  There was no major change to my diet apart from not eating after 6pm.  My results after Level 1 are that I lost 10lb and 11 inches.  I am a 50 year old and have 4 stone to lose, so another 3 stone and 4lb to go.  I started Level 2 on 26th March 2013 for a few days and realised I'm not at that level of fitness yet, so I've gone back to Level 1 and this is my 13th day!!!  My weight and inch loss may be down to the fact that I have a lot still left to lose but I also see my level of fitness has increased and I have muscle tone and strength.  I paid £11 for both DVD's and if I never use them again, it was the best £11 I have ever spent.  Hail to Jillian :-) :-)
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It was a privilege to read this book.  Although I never knew these brave men personally, I feel a kinship to them.  Their bravery and self sacrifice is what protects us from the barbarians at the gate.<br /><br />The book was well written and highly recommended.
1401238580|5.0|I had never read this book, and decided to read it on the basis the I enjoyed Watchmen, along with the outstanding story it provided. And when I saw that I could get the iconic mask with it for just a few extra bucks, I jumped at it. My one criticism is that the mask is a bit flimsy, but still perfectly wearable. The book is amazing in every way. The characters are real, the plot is breathtaking, and the are is in a class all its own. For those who haven't read this, you should change that.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Edgy, suspensful and dramatic.  If you're into musicals then I suggest that you don't watch this movie. Shows the psychology and psychy at play in Marines Boot Camp as well as a great view into the Vietnam War.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Series is really nice. I highly recommend to watch it. Waiting for season 4 to come. I hope amazon would make season 3 free for prime members soon.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It has a good mix of feel good, humor and enough suspense to keep all members of my family entertained!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Interesting more for its portrayal of a somehow familiar dystopian society than for its brief and hectic action sequences.  The cinematography is nicely done.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|We live in an isolated area in the Ozarks and this app gives good, accurate coverage for our area.  It definitely meets our needs.
B005FHXB0O|1.0|This is truly a bad movie. Fortunately, after 35 minutes of viewing, Amazon's streaming video got interrupted. Fortunately I got a refund because I felt badly after paying $2.99 for this junk. I think there were about a dozen violent deaths portrayed and the coup de grace was when Slater gets to shoot his adversary in the croch and watches the guy squirm in agony before he finally puts him out of his misery. This is a very bloody violent movie so don't waste your valuable time. I would give it 1/2 a star.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wish the options kept going.  I will max out the game soon.  I wish there were more to keep going.
B00004KD1L|5.0|I am very glad I got this CD! I grew up listening to it with my dad and formed a great appreciation of music because of it. I would suggest it to anyone, as well as the dealer who sold it to me. Nice job friend!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have  read  the  whole series. I cannot  wait  until  the movie  comes out. I Loved all three books. But I think my  favorite was Freed.
B002VECMAE|5.0|I deeply enjoy this movie every time I watch it. I heard that it got a lot of bad reviews and publicity, but I still like it and find it funny.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|It was raw,honest, open...AND heartfelt. With her all her warts, regrets and memories, this is a story from a Mother who obviously LOVED her daughter with all her heart. It is told from her obvious pov which gives you new insight into the world of entertainment and celebrity.
B000002C25|5.0|If you liked Morning Glory or Definitely Maybe, you will like this. I understand that it got some bad publicity for a while, but also that it was the fastest selling album in British history! The tracks are long, too, but I like them that way. This is my favorite Oasis album, and possibly my favorite album over all!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season, easily streamed with great quality. So glad we found this show on Amazon since we don't have cable/dish.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|Yeah... it comes with a CD that contains a shareware program, it's just a tape player with a USB microphone jack, and it's overpriced. It DOES work, though, and I used it many times.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A fair amount of  other peoples observations were included. I do realize this was inevitable as he was in a coma.but was written sometimes as if his own. His  recollections  were somehow  what one would dream of as heaven.<br />His remarkable recovery  does give one food for thought.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|I had this in vinyl once upon a time. As all things fade away, I lost it. This brings back do many memories! The music is incredible. Not just good - INCREDIBLE! Everyone should have a chance to listen to it!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Magic Puzzles can be played at many different levels.  This gives you the freedom to choose your pleasure of play.  Very enjoyable game.  After a long day at work Magic Puzzles helps me unwind.  Great Game.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|If you liked the later material of Oasis, you will like this! It sounds a bit more modern, but the music is enjoyable and nostalgic. There are too many references to the word &#34;dream&#34; however.
B00459GJUM|4.0|I like it because it doesn't vocus on one specific person.  The charactors have grown during this season.  Relationships have evolved.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|I heard the music on YouTube and figured that the entire album must be good and original. Most of the songs all sound the same, even after listening through the album three times. They are good songs, don't get me wrong. This album would be food for someone who enjoys a modern folk sound.
B0063IH60K|5.0|simple set up and reasonable odds of winning. easy to view and navigate through as well.<br />I enjoy playing this game between books.
B000VEA38E|4.0|Compared to the last editions of this collection, this one is by far the best. On the copy that I bought, the first disc of Episode VI didn't work, so I downloaded it. This set includes tracks that I didn't expect it would, and the tracks are ordered in the same order as the scenes from the films. Very well built!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An easy, interesting, and informative read.  I wish it h.ad had more detail.  I read the book in about 2-3 hours and found my time well used.
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|I didn't expect that this album could be good compared to Oasis, but I have to say, I would not trade this album for anything! The music is not as nostalgic as the old Oasis albums, but it still has the artist's charm and a classic &#34;Gallagher&#34; sound that cannot be replaced. I recommend this album for anyone, not just Oasis fans. Much better than today's music.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|the app is ok nothing else I need to explain regarding why.....this is how I keep in touch with people
B00C0NFMKI|2.0|Well, upon hearing that Paramore had lost the Farro brothers from the lineup, I was interested to see what they would do next.  I thought it was interesting that they decided to go on without them, with a trimmed-down lineup, and would release new music under that lineup.  With the song \\"Monster\\", I found that Paramore still had some essence to them, but it was disappointing in comparison to their past music.  I was hoping that, on the next album, they would do better than this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that has not happened.  They have instead gone backwards, replacing the lyrics and attitude of their previous efforts with electronics and production to the point where only Hayley's voice is distinguishable.  Josh and Zac were crucial to the band, and this effort clearly demonstrates what happens when they lose such crucial members from the lineup.  Without their musicianship and lyricism, this album is greatly harmed.  The edgy, pop-punk/alternative rock style characteristic of Paramore's previous three efforts is virtually wiped out on this album, replacing it with a watered-down, simplistic powerpop sound that fails to truly do the band, and Hayley Williams' voice, justice.  In short, this album feels more like a Katy Perry or Avril Lavigne effort, rather than a true Paramore effort.<br /><br />As for the tracks, the production is shiny, but as a whole, nearly all of them feel lifeless and hollow (though the songs \\"Now\\" and \\"Still Into You\\" admittedly can be earworms).  The song \\"Part II\\" is the only song that actually FEELS like a true Paramore song on this album, and \\"Still Into You\\" and \\"Be Alone\\" show significant elements of Paramore's trademark style, but other than these tracks, the rest of the album is forgettable and shallow.  Perhaps if Paramore would have built upon \\"Part II\\", \\"Be Alone\\", and \\"Monster\\" (and to a certain degree \\"Still Into You\\"), they might have been better able to negate the lineup change.<br /><br />In closing, the loss of Zac and Josh Farro from the band has proven to be devastating to the band, and without their contributions, Paramore has taken a turn for the worse.  Here's to hoping any future albums correct the mistakes made on this effort.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had crazy twists that I did not see coming. I was so completely sucked into this book. Highly recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely loved it. It is humorus and at the same time touching on some serious subjects. I enjoyed the interaction between the staff and the family of Downton Abbey.Great show.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'm sure that I'm not the first to say it, but this is one of my favorite documentaries of all time. Simply amazing videography. And Attenborough is in a narrator like no other.
B009FZFONO|3.0|it started off great but ended up being some sappy human drama I thought the show was called The Walking Dead fight zombies try to survive that's what the show needs to bring back
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was super excited to watch this movie - Knocked Up was hilarious.  Unfortunately it was not as good.  The one-liners were dumb and it was way too long!  Too bad, so sad.
B009LDD13K|5.0|Ford Madox Ford was one of the UK's most accomplished early 20th-century authors (\\"The Good Soldier\\" and \\"Parade's End\\" among dozens of other novels), sadly overlooked among other literary giants of the time.  His tetralogy, Parade's End, has been brilliantly written for the screen by Tom Stoppard, and the story is much more multi-dimensional than \\"Downton Abbey,\\" though set in the same era.  The plot threads are richer, the characters are true-to-life, and the picture of British life prior to and during World War I is unforgettable.  The cast, headed by Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Christopher Tietjens, the protagonist, is hands-down superb; Rupert Everett plays Tietjen's older brother; and the offsetting female roles, played by Rebecca Hall and Adelaide Clemens, stick like glue in your memory.  This 5-part DVD set is not to be missed and should be in everyone's permanent collection.  Five stars doesn't begin to do it justice.<br />***
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Its a good movie, the story line is the as several movies from the past, the ending<br /><br />my first movie I watched on Amazon,
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I purchased this movie because I missed it in the theaters, and I collect practically everything Harrison Ford has ever done on DVD.  It also didn't hurt that Daniel Craig was in it.  Not a blockbuster hit by any means, but if you love one or both of these actors, you'll enjoy the movie.
B002H3T3TM|5.0|This singer is awesome! I can not wait his return for Brazil to do other show. This disc have a high quality of audio and video
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was so excited when I found out my Prime Membership would let me watch Fringe for free! Thank you Amazon Prime!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I never played online games before this one.  I cannot put it down.  I play mainly on my kindle which, BTW, has to get recharged now almost every day.  I love this game
B008602KQI|3.0|I suppose this film had its good moments but it left me in a place wondering that the message was nothing more than people suffer and face trials and sometimes they just make it through with great effort and performance to a meaningless outcome.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I thought it was great movie to have.  I like the actors in this movie and they all play a fantastic role. It's a fantasy, comedy and romance type of movie.  But over all it's a good movie.  Love It.
1451627297|5.0|Actually haven't read the book yet.....I'm sure it'll be 5 stars....the book was advertised as coming with a CD which was not included in the package.  Other than that, I am satisfied.  Guess you can't believe all is perfect.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this app every night. It has helped me fall asleep each night. I need no medicine. I like that I can listen to different sounds every night. I love it.
B006R4H5FG|4.0|I like the way the writer expresses his points...<br />I think he gives very useful  tips when you are making presentations in public
B00BVYJG18|5.0|I can't stop listening to it! It's one you have to listen to start to finish all the way through with no stops.
B000P0J09M|1.0|I was super excited when I received this movie. I have seen it in a long time so I was really into it. Then mid way into the movie the dvd stop.
B00BF11STU|3.0|If you like action, military flicks and questionable events, this is your movie. I was curious why they never explained why they didn't display/show Bin Laden's body.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I enjoy playing the mini piano and learning to play different songs and melodies on the keyboard.It's a great way to learn music.
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Black Keys and this is one of their better albums. I really like the gritty rock-blues sound they do so well.
B001993Y2C|5.0|This review is for Battlestar Gallactica, the Complete series on Blu Ray with collectible Cylon. I purchased the item as a gift. The receiver of this gift was very excited, especially for the collectible Cylon! That was a very cool extra. This series is for people who are interested in the science fiction genre. The series is funny and interesting. I reminds me of Star Trek.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I didn't care for this film. It seemed to be pandering to 13 year-old boys. Not a very good story, characters weren't that interesting either.
B0089LT8Y6|3.0|I can write a review with the best of them, but I'm very flustered with this one and its gonna leave me to leave an 8th of the review i would have liked to have given.<br /><br />Musically this was a great accomplishment for Testament. They sounded better on here than they have in years. Everyone in the band sounds like they have a passion for the music and put every bit of their heart into their playing. With that said, they woulda been better off keeping the album in its entirety AN INSTRUMENTAL!<br /><br />If i wanna be preached to i'll listen to Gospel or Christian music. Im tired of bands shoving their political beliefs down my throat. And that goes for and band whether they fall to the right, middle or left. If you're a metal band sing to me about the death, satan and dark sides of the universe. If you can sing to me in a more positive way while sounding angry, by all go ahead and do so. But bands that sing about politics are no better than the teachers and professors in schools and universities that indoctrinate the younger generation on a daily basis.<br /><br />ENTERTAIN ME, DON'T PREACH!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I know this is a 'Highlights' album, but there are a number of what I would consider 'headliner' songs missing from it.  I know this is all you can get so far, so if you absolutely have to have music from the movie, this is pretty much your only choice.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Very good reading -- a little hard to keep the characters identified,but definitely leaves you with the  idea of readindg it again to enjoy it all more clearly
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book probably when I was in third grade and just happen to read again. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book as a adult. The things I missed in the story line when I was a kid added much to the story. And the timing was perfect, spring is here and a perfect read when I am thinking about what I should plant and the joy of watching the plants start coming into bud.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I'm only a day into playing this game but so far I love it. It's challenging &  fun.I would recommend it yo anyone who likes time management games.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|A great job of letting the story tell itself.  Actors were superb and gripping even though you knew the ending.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Absolutely amazing book. When I started it, I wondered how anyone could capture readers interest given the subject, but there was so much more beneath the obvious telling of walking such a long journey. I was intrigued within the first chapter. The intertwining of the authors personal life before and after the trip makes for multi levels of feeling. I could personally relate to the death of my own mother to breast cancer within her sharing of emotions regarding the death of her mother. She comes across so human and humble, you cannot help but find yourself rooting her on. I have hiked along the Smoky Mountains, but would never be brave enough to attempt it as a single woman hiking alone. I applaud Cheryl' s tenacity and thank her for putting me, as a mere reader, smack in the middle of her grand adventure.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I bought this for my son who is a college student. He doesn't answer the phone while driving, which is a good thing . This device keeps his hands on the wheel and he is able to accept my call when he's on the road.  The sound is crystal clear. I often ask, &#34;Are you on your speakerphone?&#34; and of course the answer is yes. Great Buy.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Finiding this 3rd part of the series so easily and having it ship so quickly was wonderful.  We have enjoyed Downton Abbey ever since it was introduced into the USA.  The package arrived in superb new condition just as advertised.
B00170KA0C|4.0|It depicts the time period perfectly for what women were going through. It is not a family film, more for adults.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I love this app and all, but it keeps telling me that &quot;Talking Tom has stopped working&quot;, and closes the app. Each time. After five second of running the app, it does this. Does this happen to everyone else? (Btw I'm using a kindle fire HD)
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I thought this was going to be another boring, english family story....turns out there is alot more than meets the eye. I liked it but probably won't watch anymore seasons. It's alot like all the other shows on tv, scandal, love affairs, and deceit. If you like that sort of thing this is your kind of show.
B004H6G0TI|3.0|when i am bored i like to play it.<br />its that game that looks bad but is actually really good
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I loved this documentary. It's amazing how differently babies are raised all around the world. I would highly recommend this film to all moms, dads and, soon-to-be moms and dad's.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|sweet game love the look and how sounds are fun to pass the time with you should try it and you will like it.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|There aren't many films made like this anymore. It has that old world romance feel to it. Great film! Love Barbra Streisand~
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I really enjoy the game especially because I enjoy dinosaurs and Jurassic Park series. It keeps me entertained while I'm at college waiting for my classes.
B006SMEVL8|4.0|As a lover of Nicholas Sparks books and a fan of miley I of course had to see it!  Saw in theaters and loved it. Great cast... Of course doesn't follow the book to my liking but still was a great recreation!
B009S33I68|5.0|I was a young soldier once, myself, but not in Ia Drang, I'm happy to report. Spent most of my time in the safety of Binh Thuy. But these guys of the 7th Cav were asked to deal with an impossible situation under the most difficult of circumstances. Though it occurred before many of us, and them, realized how absurd it was to be there at all it is a story of battle well told. It's just too bad it had to be told, at all. Keep your steel pot on for this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is still awesome even now in it's 3rd season. New characters are added and some lost which keeps it interesting.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I've now had this for a year or so and used it in a variety of situations. I've had good luck doing video interviews with this on my DSLR. Very good sound on my Cannon 60D when dual channel mono is acceptable. I generally go with external audio recordings when I need stereo and then use better mics. For very many projects, this shotgun mic does an excellent job, particularly when doing interviews in areas that are relatively noisy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun ! I play it all day long. I've been waiting for it. I would recommend you to get it.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This is a great game but it crashed one time and I could never open it again<br /> Do not get it its horrible I got to level 50 it was was great
B004INNRFK|5.0|Great album with great stars.  David Foster is the best.  Enjoy the music, some of the best you will find today.
0385349947|5.0|Critics be dammed. Sheryl Sandberg finally has had the guts to say what lots of us have been thinking for years. If you want advice from people who &#34;can't,&#34; look elsewhere. If you want advice about success from someone who is successful, you've come to the right place. I'm not rich or privileged. I didn't go to an Ivy League school. I'm single and have no children. So what? It's narrow minded to think the advice of people with one set of circumstances can't apply to someone completely different. Take what you need from this book and leave the rest. There's plenty to take for all of us.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is one of those movies that is pure entertainment throughout the entire movie.  It never gets slow or boring!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Bigger Leaner Stronger provides exactly what I was looking for: straightforward advice on nutrition and exercise, based on scientific research. The recommended workouts and diet are realistic, focusing on the exercises and supplements that yield the most gain.
0738702994|4.0|The superb artwork of the Llewellyn deck makes it a near-favorite of mine. The artists has maintained a consistent style and use of color toning throughout, her skilful use of watercolors gives the entire deck a sense of mythic otherworldliness. For me, looking through these cards is like stepping back into mythic time. The Major Arcana cards depict scenes and people from Welsh mythology, so there are some name and image changes from the standard Smith-Waite depictions. The interpretations given in the accompanying book, however, give more or less the usual meanings, so this would be a suitable beginner's deck, particularly for those with an affinity for the Celtic myths. The book itself is attractively-presented and explains each story used in the deck. The Minor cards are given a more simplified rendering, but still convey the same otherworldly feeling. The card backs show a shield with a Welsh dragon motif on a brown background, and are not reversible.<br /><br />The only reason this deck does not get five stars from me is because of the actual production. I am mystified why Llewellyn publishers did not put a bit more investment into its self-named deck and make the cards more durable. They are paper-thin, and even when held together the deck buckles easily. Also, the parchment-colored border is way too large. I would have preferred less border and slightly larger pictures, so I could see more of the details.
B0047DVHV2|3.0|The style of writing was relaxed and I prefer more structure.  Too technical on guitar playing for non musicians reading this biography.
B001NLL93W|5.0|there is everything supernatural in this books, and it combines all worlds in a very natural easy way make you question if it could acctually be real, if one day you could open your eyes a view all that has been obscured.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I'm using this amp with my cowon J3. While I like this amp, the sound profile it gives isn't quite what I like. With no EQ, there seems to be a bit more bass (which some may like). It does sound clearer overall than just playing straight from my J3, but I feel like I'm loosing some of the higher frequency tones in the music I listen to.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice little amp, sound profile isn't quite what I like (others may find it more to their liking), none of the EQ options where all that impressive, and it's nice and small.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|After all the buzz about these books over the last few years and after watching the movie, I finally got the books when they were on sale. I can say I'm sorry I didn't get them much earlier!<br /><br />These books tell of a courageous young woman named Katniss Everdeen. This is actually a character I wouldn't mind my daughter looking up to some day. I haven't finished the books yet, but I'm half-way through the 3rd one and I'm anxious to see how the trilogy wraps up.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to anyone!
B004YF6MHW|2.0|Product works fine.  Problem is that you have to be logged into Amazon to use Camera ZOOM FX.  This means if you are in a place where there is no 3G connection, or if you travel overseas you cannot use this product.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|Jane Austen is a great author! Emma is well written, and hard to put down once you start reading it!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This product is superb.  It is just a good as Texas Instruments scientific calculator.  This app is a good deal and way cheaper than buying a scientific calculator.
B00B1CGDTS|1.0|Once again we are being ripped off by vendors (in this case Olive Films) who put out a low quality blu-ray.  Absolute JUNK!!!!!!!!!  I think most everyone believes that blu-ray is synonymous with a higher quality product, and this happens to be one of those that along with scores of other HORRIBLE blu-ray transfers that companies know we will purchase again as this film was sold out the day it became available. The film is in letterbox format and the colors are clearer, but that's about it.  There are a lot of flecks and white spots (flares) throughout and the DVD I purchased a couple of years back is of much better quality.  Olive Films did not use the same transfer from the DVD and used whatever they were able to acquire.  So if you don't want to be an unhappy buyer, don't get it.  I really hate it when I am ripped off and that is why I am here to let you know that this blu-ray is not worth purchasing if you have the DVD (If you don't have DVD, get Paramount's AUTHENTIC COLLECTOR'S EDITION).
B00457WZEI|5.0|My sister read this book in fifth grade, but I read it as a seventh grader, after studying World War I. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can't wait to read the next one!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The first book gave you characters to love and hate and a war for them to play in where there was no clear victor.<br /><br />Book 2 gave a war where power shifted and characters were tested.<br /><br />Book 3 tore the world upside down where characters fell while others ascended. I am so shocked at the way this book turned. Such rich and exciting characters. So many story lines that are easy and fun to follow. Can't wait for the 4th book.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|What else is there to say.  This is the matrix.  One of the greatest sci-fi moves of all time! Must watch!
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I HATE Michael Bay.  I think he's a frat boy of a movie director who would do better as a stunt coordinator.  But his first Transformers was fun and toned down compared to his other action spooges.  And the 2nd...all spooge.  This one told a fuller story that was darker and stood well on it's own.  So wish they got rid of the Sam character early on and had another one fill in.  What better way to transition to a new character than Sam dying at  what seems like the end of the world and have another fighter step up and fill his shoes.  The action sequences are some of Bay's best.  The inner child/geek in me gives this movies more stars than it probably deserves.  But having Terry Tate: Office Linebacker in an actual office trying to shoot a bazooka tickled me a lil.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I loved the lord of the rings trilogy.  I used to watch those dvd's over and over and over.  So I was excited to continue the adventure.  This one however just felt long and sort of pointless.  I was bored and not paying that close attention.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|An emotional account of an orphan survival who finally found happiness.  Not recommended for fun reading, but an enlightening account of how some religious orders treated some homeless children tv
0307341577|3.0|\\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp right on it. It's the Day blood.\\"<br /><br />So goes the opening lines of Gillian Flynn's creative novel, \\"Dark Places,\\" that is at times horridly grotesque (the cow scene), exciting, (the climax), slow (the middle third, ugh), and mysterious. As you can imagine from the opening characterization of Libby Day, these are not likeable characters. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. And you really shouldn't like any of them. This novel felt a lot like that car wreck on the highway that you can't stop gawking at and saying something like, \\"Oh, thank god that's not me.\\"<br /><br />I found the beginning intriguing, especially the first meetings with Lyle and the \\"Kill Club\\" and I found Ms. Flynn's writing to be a pleasure in its style; you'll find yourself reading to see what she comes up with next. I laughed out loud during some scenes, like in Barb's apartment (pills were definitely being popped!) and the scene outside the strip joint (\\"I'd worn a low-cut top, assuming it might make Krissi more comfortable when I found her, signal I wasn't a prude. Colleen was looking at my cleavage now with the eyes of a jeweler, trying to match my tits to the correct club\\").<br /><br />I also have to admit that this one tired me out and by the end I was ready for it to wrap up and find out how it all happened. There are some plot points I found hard to believe (like the little girls colluding against Ben) but the conclusion was satisfying enough. Perhaps it could have come fifty or more pages sooner. I don't know.<br /><br />The bottom line: an interesting read told from multiple POV, \\"Dark Places\\" pulls the curtain back and looks at the darker side of society perhaps we don't see (or don't want to see). The more I thought about the concluding premise the more I actually started to believe someone could resort to such measures. Indeed, we Americans live by the dollar (and sometimes we die by the dollar).<br /><br />-Raeden Zendollar (and sometimes we die by the dollar).    -Raeden Zen
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very good and entertaining movie. My grand daughter calls it &#34;awesome&#34;. She watched it several times while we had it rented. I think we will end up buying it.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was good, but I didn't buy into the characters as much as 50 Shades of Grey.  50 Shades was a better story.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is a fun game, I enjoy playing it before bed. Be careful you will lose track of time! enjoy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great, Love it can't wait until next season it has become an unbelievable show. I'm just surprised and disappointed that Andrea was killed off.

B0065AVS0K|5.0|Great film, super entertaining. A classic. I have watched this movie a dozen times. Jessica Alba is the sexiest woman ever.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Product itself is great...case was shattered and a new one had to be purchased - other than that, the service and timeliness of getting the product was great! Would use them again.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I would recommend this TV series to anyone who likes procedurals. It's quality entertainment with great characters. I love it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Fun and entertaining.... kept my interest the whole time I was reading. It was hard to put down my tablet.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love the continuance of the series with great mix of mystery stories and detective work. Kind of a mix of Nancy Drew and Sherlock Holmes.
B006KHQ2RW|5.0|Serious movie viewer I am. Generally I have not been in the mood for science fiction unless it's really really good. I love the classic westerns. This is a mighty fine western. It has great respect for Indian people. I swear the story is very well written. All of the acting was great. There were some attempts to satisfy audience urges for resolution that could have been skipped, but I enjoyed the heck out of it. It was great to be... in the west. Daniel Craig was quite perfect. There was a wee too much beautiful bodies on display but that got us through the authentic dirty cowboys. Loads of authenticity that we don't usually get... such as blood caked on to clothing and difficult to separate from wound. Elegant Indian language. Even though we know it's not a true story... it is quite believable if you have room in your brain for the existence of critters from beyond the sky. There are many little familiar notes from classic films. High quality fun. This was an HBO broadcast... but I may buy the blu-ray because I would like to share it with grandkids in ultimate-mode. I swear I never heard a word about the movie. I just saw three minutes in the middle of the film... and set my machine to record the whole thing. I can imagine that this would be a movie that would demand a director's cut. I also failed to engage my super-sound. I should have done that. My wife hates westerns but she likes science fiction. She just won't come to my westerns. When I told her about the Indian people dealing with demons of the Third Kind, she was ready to roll. She loved it. It gave me the opportunity to put in a pitch for some of my favorite westerns... like Heaven's Gate... my all time favorite movie, in it's new Criterion edition.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I enjoy the quality of the storylines and characters. It's entertaining with just the right amount of comedy and romance.
B008Q0AZVK|3.0|...it was interesting for a light insight into the time period and expectations of women.  I think it was more of a parody than anything but was interested to see how they had manipulated the time period.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|After purchasing two great new albums by Depeche Mode and Wired Remorse, I was very hesitant about listening to the new David Bowie.  Although, I had heard that Bowie had gone back to his old days sound wise.  I was curious as to what it would sound like.  While, there is the occasionally cheesey song in \\"Dancing Out in Space.\\"  This album for the most part reminds me of the \\"Changes\\" era.  First off, this CD is surprizingly uncommercial.  Secondly, it seems like some songs employ the strategy of the weirder, the better.  That said, I felt this album was a surprizing artistic statement and I definitely recommend it.
B001224WBS|5.0|Harken back to the good old 80's.  You won't be disappointed, these are the original songs that you will sing along to just as you remembered them.  Great price
B00B69UQEO|5.0|So, I purchased the new Depeche Mode and Wired Remorse on the same day and was a little worried.  Especially after hearing the song \\"Heaven,\\" and comparisons to \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion.\\"  I felt certain that Depeche after two straight great albums, would go commercial again.  Thankfully, I was wrong.  Instead, Depeche goes old school with songs such as \\"Broken\\" going back to their very early years.  I am very impressed.
B001223BLU|5.0|Having seen Jersey Boys, I wanted to relive those songs.  This album is a great compilation.  Be prepared to sing along.  Great price
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just a few clicks and you are watching the BEST BBC series ever!!!  Got my daughter hooked and so now we are rewatching
0525478817|5.0|I am not quite finished with the book, but so far, I think it is very well written. It covers a topic that is difficult to talk about and is often avoided. It has been challenging for me to get through; however, I feel like I should add my perspective. I was diagnosed with cancer at 10. I am now 15 years old and a teen-age cancer survivor. I am a volunteer and advocate for pediatric cancer awareness.<br /><br />This book has gotten negative reviews based on several points:<br />1) This is from another reviewer: \\"The characters are not believable. They do not speak like teenagers. They do not even handle situations like teenagers do. So many interactions between Gus and Hazel are interactions which, plain and simple, just would not happen between real, emotional, scared, awkward, virgin teenagers, let alone ones with cancer who have been socially cut off for much of their lives.\\"<br /><br />*My point-of-view: Have you spent time with any of us? They are believable as teen-age cancer patients/survivors. We may look like teen-agers, but in our heads, we are not. We have had to face our own mortality and make choices we should never have to make. It makes us grow up...quickly. Most of us do not act or speak like teen-agers because that is no longer how we think. After treatment, many of us find the things most teens (and sometimes adults) are worried about are trivial. Society cuts us off, but we are not cut off from each other. These types of interactions do happen. And, it is emotional and scary, but we learn to tell it like it is, without the normal fluff and awkwardness. We find 'normal' where we can and try to live every single day we have because we know that time is an illusion.<br /><br />2) The parents are not real, not deep characters, and they do not have their own identities.<br /><br />*My point-of-view: I have seen my own parents (and siblings) and the parents of other friends struggle with this. Many times, they do not have their own identities anymore. Every single minute is spent trying to make it to the next! They try to keep the family together and functioning, in spite of the effects of treatment, fevers and midnight trips to the emergency room, 3 weeks of the month spent in isolation, jobs in jeopardy, birthdays and holidays interrupted, not to mention talks that parents never want to have with their child. I've talked to my mom about this. This becomes their identity. My mom said their jobs become about doing whatever it takes, travelling all over the country (which is very common), researching new studies, and new medicines, all to help us survive and thrive with grace and dignity. It is also their job to prepare, if treatments don't work, to help us die with just as much grace and dignity.<br /><br />I hope everyone can read this with an open mind and an open heart. Then, reach out to the patients and survivors in your communities. They are wise beyond their years, funny, brave and inspiring.very single minute is spent trying to make it to the next!

B009GJBEF6|5.0|Great action film. Rupert M-ish character was vilified throughout the film and dealt with accordingly by James. If you have a couple of hours and would like to get immersed into a film get your goodies sit back and enjoy Tomorrow Never Dies.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved it. Not what I expected at all enjoyed it greatly. it's not extremely gruesome just a few killing scenes.
B00AA0U05A|4.0|Enjoyed the old favorites sung in the old fashion way.  Emmy has a pleasant voice and pronounces the words so they are understandable.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|You never want to put this one down!  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!  Well written and very entertaining!

B00C1BU7V8|1.0|We rented this title based on the buzz during the Oscars. Very disappointed. Very boring narrative of a very exciting time in our history. Lewis performance was sleepy at best and if that is what the director wanted out of him then shame on the director. Lewis did NOT deserve the Oscar. Glad the director of Life of Pi won for best director because this didn't deserve anything. Don't know what all the hype was about but it put both me and my husband to sleep. Very sad. A big story was turned to nothing in over two hours. Someone else might do better with the story. Hope they try.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A very well-written book about an adventuresome young woman who hikes the entire Pacific Rim Trail. Her experiences, both positive and negative are woven into her reflections of her childhood. A very interesting read.
1400069807|5.0|Very well-researched, well-written, and full of anecdotes from industry insiders. It's a contemporary horror story, and it's up to us consumers to have things come to a happy end. My grocery shopping will never be the same, even though I live in Europe, where controls are a bit tighter but, alas, globalization means that the food giants are everywhere.
B0095P33IW|4.0|What makes Captain America great is that he's humble, patriotic, and tough-as-nails. What's not to love? This movie reminded me of the classic Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. Can't wait for sequels.
B00005YU98|5.0|I've been a Waterboys fan since they first started making music and owned this album on vinyl back in the day. Since then I've replaced most albums with CDs but this was one I neglected to get as a digital reissue. Listening to it again all these years later I'm struck by how powerful the music still sounds. I remember liking this album back in the 80s, but after hearing it again repeatedly in the past few months, it sounds even better than I remembered. Maybe it's not quite the equal of \\"This is the Sea\\", and of course it doesn't have the Celtic vibe of the great \\"Fisherman's Blues\\", but this is still mighty moving stuff. When this album was recorded, Karl Wallinger (later, the genius behind World Party) was still in the band with Mike Scott and crew, and the Waterboys were an up and coming band, turning heads with their vibrant songs. And this album is indeed vibrant and thrilling; both the music and the poetic lyrics. You can't help but we swept up in that symphony of sounds; guitars and music, keyboards and horns, all raging and churning, driving forward and upward, soaring and snarling. Brilliant stuff.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think this game is great. fun, fast paced, similar to other gem games. I like that it shows friends' scores...makes it competition-like.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|Following on the heels of eat, pray, love, Gilbert traces the fascinating cultural and historical history of the marriage rite and institution along with her own journey to the altar. Making dry history incredibly interesting, she uncovers many myths that are ingrained in our very belief system as fact - this is as revolutionary a book as the work declaring the earth is not flat. Astonishing how little of the truth is known about what we live with, talk of, and participate in on a daily and even hourly basis. A must read for anyone interested in marriage on any level.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|i love this app i wake up good not tired an like i want to go back to bed. so yes i love this app

B002UM5BXW|4.0|Enjoyed reading about the restaurant business. But after reading, am not sure I want to ear out as often. well written and fun.
030746363X|5.0|I ordered both the audio and the book. After listening to the audio I could jump anywhere in the book and have the general concept as if I had started reading on page 1. If your like me you love going one step farther to achieve grater results and understanding. This book takes you down well researched tangents of how to do great things with your body. It really shows how timings and the right concoctions will help u surpass what you always thought was the limit. A must have like an encyclopedia was in the old days. Deconstructing what makes others human performance greater than yours in order to help you increase that body function. Tim's books have helped me in my life's journey in countless ways that no other has! I hope to meet Tim someday as he is a true Guru!
B005PK56TA|5.0|A friend told me about American Horror Story and I watched it with some skepticism.  I was pleasantly surprised.  From episode to episode the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The acting is suberb.  Don't know if Jessica Lange has gotten any awards for this show, but she should.  The idea that Vivien's baby is the anti-Christ is rather interesting.  Am surprised they didn't follow up on this story line in season 2, though maybe they'll come back to it.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green has a way of getting inside the head of teenaged minds and creating characters that are so incredibly believable they very well could be real. Although I am way beyond my teenaged years, I find myself back in the days when small things seemed big, and I find myself realizing that maybe they are. Margo Roth Spiegelman is a girl every teenage boy knows. Quentin Jacobsen is a boy every teenage girl wants fantasizing about them. He is sweet and sincere, and what most parents want their daughters to date.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to the high school crowd, but I must say, it was a fun read for my middle aged self as well. It also helped me remember what it is like to be a teenager which I greatly appreciate because I am now the mother of two. The characters are complex, the story is intriguing, and like always, I had a hard time putting it down. It also allowed me to have conversations with my kids about how they would handle situations that these funny interesting characters find themselves. Great, quick read.

B007QUUJMG|5.0|My daughter insisted I read this. I was worried it might be too &#34;young&#34; for me but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It took me back to those intense teenage years and reminded me what kids go through during those years.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although I loved all three hunger games book, I don't like how this one really lets you hanging.  I wish there was an appendix of all the characters a brief review of their life.  It had a surprising ending.  I would have been very frustrated if I had to wait for the third book.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book is a good read, its not as good as the first book in the series but I still couldn't put it down. This one is very in depth about religion and emotions.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A wonderful series. High flown soap opera taking place in England at the beginning of world war 1.<br />Very addictive!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had never heard of this book until recently, I'm a 24 year old male. This book is written for younger people but I still really enjoyed it.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Wonderful movie for kids and anyone who appreciates great animation. Clever plot, lots of action. The tooth fairies, the Sandman, and Easter egg land are worth the price of admission!
B006H5120E|5.0|the movie is phenomenal in 3D! only downside is you have to switch blu ray discs in between to complete full movie
0307460444|4.0|I only bought it for one recipe.  Maybe I should pick out another recipe to see if we like it better.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|My book club read this book.  People seemed to either love it or hate it.  It wasn't the easiest book to read - some of the subject matter was hard, as you would expect about WW II but it gave me a perspective on life in Germany at that time, when previously I had only known about life in England during the war.  It made me realize how difficult life was for many ordinary German people.<br />The characters were interesting, there was joy in the book, and the fact that &#34;death&#34; was the narrator was not as grim as you might think.  Sometimes the writing was a bit too poetic or odd, and the length of the descriptions got a bit tedious at times but this was a memorable book for me, and I would recommend it to somebody looking for something thought-provoking.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I already love this movie and have been wanting to purchase on dvd, but I am very impressed with the quality of this downloadable flick.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book.  It held my interest throughout the whole book.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I usually read before I go to sleep and I couldn't wait for to read each night.

B005LAII8K|3.0|An ok movie but nothing to get excited about or want to watch over<br />and over again. Just ok but I'll alway be a Bruce Willis fan.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This product works extremely well and helps me keep track of the battery and how much longer my battery would last depending on how I use my kindle fire H grade A+ app for sure!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great to have the collection but if there's a person on the planet<br />that has'nt seen Godfather 1 and 2, well, it's time. The 3rd one<br />should'nt have been made. A total waste in my opinion. Even this<br />many years after it's release, I still find it unsatisfactory to watch.<br />But 1 and 2 are masterpieces and do highly recommend to everyone.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Really enjoyed all the great information at the beginning of the book and was inspired but felt that the rest of the book fell into the rhythm of all other &#34;diet&#34; books out there.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Denzel is great as usual. The story line is exciting and along with great<br />acting the whole concept of a less than perfect pilot keeps you wondering<br />whenever you get on a plane. I recommend this movie to all.
B00B23O96A|3.0|not his best trying to be like Rod Stewart and jazz up the oldies. I would not recomend it to my friends
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has made me better at lesson planning, a better gift giver, &amp; its eliminated the clutter in my home! I used to have binders full of recipies, home decorum, fav magazine articles, etc... Now I have boards on Pinterest! NO CLUTTER! :D It has also proved an amazing platform for connecting to other teachers, milsos, &amp; friends! I love this! It has changed my life! Its amazing as an app as well! I can browse on my Mac at home or on my Kindle Fire or iPhone while on the go! :D
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I have seen him in person and this cd is just good as that except withiout the crowd and the Texas heat
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love that you can rent this movie on Amazon Prime!! Such a great service provided by Amazon that is cheap for college students
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Jamie Fox is awesome and riveting.  It's hard to believe that this was how African Americans were treated not so long ago in America.  It must makes me count my blessing that there where so many great people before me to fight for their rights so other can be treated equally today.  If you have not seen it watch it!!
B009I2UH2W|5.0|My only ask is that it also have a standard USB out plug in its body in case I want to also charge another USB device. Good quality heavy duty cord, lightning end fits iphone 5 correctly, nice all around quality feel.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I paid for this app and it wont upload on my phone ir my kindle. Garbage app. I don't recommend it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Please let Canadians purchase other Android apps from Google.com. This is about the only one of thousands on your website that I am permitted to purchase.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|A must see episode for fans. Very entertaining! Different take on witches and their familiars. I stopped watching this show a few years ago but heard about this episode and had to see it. I'm glad I did.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I'm just another among many who consider this to be among the best World War 2 movies ever made. A couple of years ago I went to Mobile, Alabama so I could go aboard the USS Drum (a United States World war 2 era submarine). The men who acted as tour guides were actual veterans who served aboard the Drum during and after WW2. I asked them what they considered to be the movie that best represents what it was like aboard such a vessel and they said, Das Boot.<br /><br />If you watch the digital version, you will most likely be watching a subtitled version with the audio in the original German, but if you get a disk version you can watch it overdubbed. If this is the case, then know that all but one cast member spoke English and it is their voice you are hearing. This made for very accurate translations which isn't always the case in overdubs.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I couldn't ever get it to work properly for me.  I am new to apps though so maybe it is just me.
0375851569|5.0|I've been a fan of Dr. Seuss books since my kids were infants.  Great favorites.  I have a collection from my kids early years and wanted to share this with a new upcoming arrival in the family.  These books came quickly and in new condition, not to mention a great price.  Individually these would have cost $8.99, which would have cost me over $30.  Can't wait to give them to my niece.
0142420891|5.0|good book loved the story read the first one it really is a tear jerker and a perspective no one know
B002RKSZS0|3.0|It was not one of the best of Jane Austen, but I had not read it before so had to give it a try.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|this is a very good movie very emotional I love it I think it portrays the realy time when people had to band together
B006LSZECO|2.0|Too much bad language for me that over shadowed the story line.  The plot was good, but spoiled by the language.
6305320802|5.0|this is a amazing old tie movie takes you back and it seemed so easy then and it is a musical which we love too
B000TO0T4O|4.0|I liked it, it was good. It wasn't the best book I've read, but it is definitely worth reading if you are into the Alex rider series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Koo game nice way to kill time I recommend this game to any body who likes to find hidden items and Mystery
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't happy to have to wait for this second Hunger Games book and so I ordered the final book before I even started to read this one. I loved the pace, the twists in the plot and the outcome.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie was surprising funny and enjoyable.  There were some laugh out loud moments.  It was light, entertaining and fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reading The Hunger Games was a fulfilling experience. My imagination ran wild and I couldn't put it down. When I was finished, I knew I had to read the other two installments.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie is truly an eye opener! Most people just go to the grocery store and shop with little thought about how the food got there and what happens to it along the way! Everyone must see this movie!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This novel was highly suspenseful and fast-moving.  It was totally worth my time to read the entire trilogy. I highly recommend it.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The firs<br />t was better, still liked this one kinda drugged on. Took to long to get to the point.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cannot wait for the movie versions of Mocking Jay and Catching Fire. They were so exciting in my mind, and now I look forward to watching them on the big screen.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|This is the first time I have ever read her work.  I couldn't put them down and hurried to read vthe next one.
0141192364|5.0|Was really happy with this purchase. It looked just like new, great quality. THe book is amazing but hard to get into after a while you pick up on the language. The sellers even managed to get this book to me even after I put down the wrong address by mistake!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|There was a lot of action as usual but the story was predictable.  I walked away and came back and didn't feel like I missed anything.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Although a novel, I am always fascinated by how people lived in the past. A young girl who leaves her home to work for a family in order to help her mother survive is a life I can't imagine having to live. I loved this book!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Not easy to use and doesn't work. Don't buy it. I ended up wasting the purchase price. Live and learn....
B00003CXWV|5.0|This movie is awesome i love johnny deep he's a real good actor and is very educative make you  think twice before you do something stupid about drugs your life and most important think your family
B004S5C91Q|4.0|It was a bit had to get into , but then it was interesting.It cetainly made you thinnk about it.
B004YKSXYW|4.0|I gave it this rating because, as a lover of history, naturally I enjoyed it, but, like the title states, it's just 'a little' history of the world
B000002KBD|5.0|I backed into this album from the famous live \\"It's too late to stop now\\" concert (1973), which is an attractively energetic affair, with Van and his band at their hottest.  This album was cut about three years earlier, and it too is full of energy and feeling, and there isn't really a dull track to be had.  I can't believe I paid under $5.00 for it.  My only complaint is that some of the songs don't go on long enough, and think that's testimony to your desire as a listener to stay with that energy in the way that one can with a live concert, where the jamming is more spontaneous and developed.  This album has a bit of that \\"live' vibe.  \\"Domino\\" and \\"I been workin'\\"  found their way into the live set three years later, and deservedly so, but there are some other beauties. \\"Call me up in Dreamland\\" has an infectious swing to it, and \\"Sweet Jannie\\"  (inspired, one assumes by Janet Planet, Morrison's wife at the time) is an uptempo blues that finds Van catching something of B. B. King's quality of utterance.  \\"Virgo Clowns\\" and \\"Gypsy Queen\\" are also arresting songs, and throughout the album the band plays up a storm, with the brass coming on like gangbusters.  I'll listen to almost anything by Van Morrison, but this early stuff is special.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I really loved reading this book, I love the way Ayn Rand writes and the way she tackles difficult subjects like one's moral fabric and the way this sometimes clashes with others'
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this program of strong characters.  Alicia while being central, but also Michael J. Fox.  Very entertaining indeed. GREAT!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the Parasol Protectorate. The mixing of steampunk and paranormal genres was very well done. I would definitely recommend the series to my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an engrossing show....I can't believe how much I love it!!  Keeps my interest at all times.  The characters are fully developed and you feel like you know them well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I could watch this show over and over- and season 2 was by far my favorite... my husband even likes it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I put off seeing Argo because I felt Affleck would have a hard time avoiding a politically skewed view.<br />Although there are a few liberties taken with facts, there was a lot of attention taken to fine details, with the actors even chosen based on resemblance to the real people in the hostage crisis.
B0091WBU8E|5.0|This movie is much better than Clash of the Titans. It has better action, and a much better plot. It is a must see!
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Crowe does a fine job, even if at times going zombie.<br />Plot twists and turns keeps it interesting.<br /><br />THE END
B0042TV4IW|4.0|this is a pretty good.  i've been trying to find something to assuage my interest in downton abbey and this, although nowhere near as good as DA is well done.
0525953728|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the Navy SEALS. You can tell Mark Owen is an absolute professional. Thank you to all of the SEAL members and everything they do.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great little spinning cube match game, it occupies plenty of my free time. It runs smoothly on my Galaxy S3.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Smart, funny, touching and well acted. It's a great show. I'm also not of the age of the characters (a bit older) and I still really enjoyed it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great series. Love the cast and interesting storyline. The legal cases are thoughtful. Never watched before but will continue to follow.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a wonderful story, about a simple country man just wanting to\\"belong\\" to somebody, particularly after his adoptive uncle dies. The regional vernacular took a little getting used to, but it serves the story well. I would definitely recommend this book. It's a great read!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Movie starts out slow, but really picks up in middle and end.  Seems true to book from as much as I remember except its expands on some of the lore.  Only down side is I wish that less CGI was used.  I loved how the Orcs looked in LOTR.  Wish they had used actors instead of CGI as sometimes it gets distracting.
B000FBFMFW|3.0|Overall, it was a good read.  However, be warned that for the first 20% of the story, Fitz is a whiny little girl, pining away for his love; and it DRAGS.  However, once you get past that, an engaging read.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Loved it. Very sad. So glad I didn't live then. The hardships, illness, death, and heartache was overwhelming, just as the perseverance.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|We're not entirely pleased with the quality of the image we're receiving on our TV. We've upgraded the speed , which seems to help to some degree, but we fill Amazon could do better.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is one of Kate Morton's best stories.  It was fast moving, good character developement, and kept your interest through the entire story.  It's not often you find a book that the last paragraph holds the answers and ties up loose ends of the story.
0670026603|5.0|I loved this book. It's a story that made me laugh out loud and brought me to tears. Louisa is a character who lights up the page and I couldn't help but cheer for her as she started to put herself before the needs of everyone else. That wasn't an easy thing for her to do because she'd put herself last most of her life. I'd love to read her story about ten years from where the book leaves off.<br /><br />As sad as this book was it was also quite uplifting. The point to live in the moment and appreciate each moment was a theme throughout the novel. There's also a highly debatable topic that I'm certain would invite lively discussion for book groups. I've only touched the surface here. It's a wonderful novel that I'm still thinking about weeks after turning the last page.
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Yes it is similar to The Grey Books !But still has some differences. I would read again.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|What can I say I'm always trying to better myself and I love all Deepak Chopra books as well as the man himself!!!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|We already owned the DVD, but it wasn't translated to Spanish. I bought the Blu-Ray version because it was dubbed in Spanish and also ha sub-titles in Spanish.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great human interest story, that actually has some twists and turns with a surprise twist towards the end. I especially loved the Painting of DG in the opening shot.<br /><br />The sound track is incredible and this ROCK-umentary brings the songs to live and not in the normal, &#34;This is what that song means&#34; way. It is more personal. DG tells us a personal humble caring and very Human story. About a very rare side to the music business, that is almost non-existent on the BUSINESS side of a cut-throat, money driven everyone and thing is disposable industry.<br /><br />CHING
B004G7UTXG|5.0|Great Cast, great scenery and photography, distressing story about European lack of ethics in 17th century South America. Two countries contesting ownership of land they don't own.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife and I watch this every week. Fun show. We dont get AMC s through DISH, so we order it on Amazon. Its worth it.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|It's a tight fit plugging it into the power source in my 2002 VW Passat, but seems to work just fine.  The &#34;head&#34; has a white ring of light that illuminates when charging.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Excellent album, it's different!  I think it's the best R&B album of the year.  Love the lyrics and the sound.  Pyramids is my favorite!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I didn't actually finish reading this book. I couldn't get into it. it was very predictable and just wasn't for me.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Fringe is like nothing else you have watched!  It is sci-fi with wonderful characters that draw you in from the first show!  If you liked Star Trek, Star Wars, etc., you will love this show too!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I bought these with high expectations. I own a g-15 which I am in love with, and always have had good luck with Logitech products but I was a little let down on this one. The bass is sub-par, the materials are a little cheap. The surround is decent, and the functions are good.. when they work. I installed the software that came with it and it was working ok, but when I updated the software, it bundles all the G series products under one software and everything goes to hell. It would conflict with my G-15, would not even show up on the software sometimes, I kept getting a very annoying message about disconnecting it, the device would turn off and back on every 5 minutes and the worse part was dealing with the customer service. They were a joke, incredibly frustrating. I had to kept looking for the legacy software in order to make it work, and even then, it would not work properly. The only reason I don't give it a one star, is because I still have a little faith in the company thanks to the G-15. For over a hundred dollars, I would expect a much better product.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Whether you are a long time Bond fan (like me) or a newcomer to the series, this movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The cinematography on this is pretty good (inline with today's standards for action movies), the action scenes are compelling and the story line will draw you in. I will stop now before I give away the movie. Best Daniel Craig movie I have seen.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was an exceptional movie. We all enjoyed it (our kid is 9 years old). It has a very powerful message. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The story and characters are excellently done. I gave it a four out of five because even though there are several lines of the story that are very mature and only appropriate for adults, it is all tastefully done.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The acting was terrific, however, there was so much talking (of course, it's not an action film) that it seemed to go on and on and on.
B00263HWM8|2.0|Loved MI3 and MI4.  Turns out there's a reason we haven't seen a John Woo movie in a while...he sucks as a director.  Slow motion and doves does not make for suspense or drama.  Give me Brad Bird any day.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|It of course has its cliche Disney moments, but it is not completely dominated by them. I really enjoy the film for its nostalgia, creativity, and albeit often recycled messages.
B005HSL626|2.0|The games great, but the biggest problem I have with it is when you are doing real well it freezes up on you. I had to delete it. Fix the problem!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|No complaints. It has got something for everybody, even the most repugnant critics of the genre. Storytelling is fantastic and I absolutely love the witty humor.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty fun and does use planning. I like it even though there is a waiting time for things.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is heartwarming to read how these men after so many years still maintain a bond that encompasses there<br />former enemies.  What is shocking is how their former enemies are decent moral humans.  What I will never understand is how people like this did defend their country and permit the aboyses that they truly knew were wrong,  I guess it is true thatfor evil to prevail a few good peopke need to do nothing!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow is all I got.  Certainly a raw book with everything you could ask for love, drama, and some really twisted father.  Cant was to read the follow up.
B009K0P10K|4.0|This is another show that has you glued trying to imagine ,what will come next. I love the plot and the fact that the plot just seem to get thicker .LOVE IT.!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Enjoyed each one of the nine shows. Worth my time. Recommend it to everyone. Can't wait to see season 3
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was a great book, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to see the movie next!
B000EWD1KK|5.0|I have always enjoyed Danny Kaye's humor and talent. His movies make you feel god and after all laughter is the best medicine.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|A love story across the years. Penelope the spinister and Colin an  lonely traveller. She has been in love with him for years. Can they finally come together.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|it broke after 10 months, the gears inside sound really rough now. It wont keep time for more than an hour. DO NOT BUY
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire HD. It's awesome to see what the world is looking at so much fun
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The third in the series of Batman movies featuring Christian Bale rounds out the story lines.  It is a must see for anyone that has seen \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" as they take the story lines a little further from cartoons and provide great story lines.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app for my kindle fire HD I love to stay connected with all my.family and friends. Love love love
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I had about given up on Angry birds, but only after playing all of the other versions.  This is good change to the product.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Best search app for my kindle fire HD got to know what's going on.I go right to google for anything I need to know
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This movie is heart breaking but the ending still grasps your heart and fixes it. I'm a sucker for love and this movie is not a love story, but it's amazing.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire HD the sounds are so crisp and relaxing it's great for mood settings
143911000X|5.0|Barney is the greatest man whore on the planet and this law code, it's just beyond hilarious. Full of wit and wisdom, I love it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was Just as good as the book, didn't let me down.  I can not wait for the sequel to come out!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Seriously. This movie was great. It was adorable, yet enjoyable. I'm 17 and I thought this movie was well done.
0385349947|5.0|I was prepared to read this book and and not agree with anything the author, Sheryl Sandburg wrote.  Why did I feel that she couldn't know anything that would help poor, African American women, or Hispanic women or poor White women become leaders because she was a rich, privileged woman who was a graduate of Harvard.  I was wrong, she did know about women and self-doubt, like I experienced when I became a leader of a University Library in 1988.  She did know how I felt in a room full of men, who acted as though I didn't exist.  She knew how it felt to have great ideals and be afraid to share them because no one would listen to you, because you were a woman, and even more important a woman of color.  What could I know about anything, particularly computers and technology in libraries.  She did know how I had to tell myself that I was not an imposter or fraud, even though I was often treated like one.  I went to school and took graduate classes continuously to ensure I was on \\"top of my game\\" the field of Library Science, at my own expense.  This is a great book for young and old women of any race.  She got it right.  She did her research and she made it easy to understand and easy to do, if you want to be a leader.<br /><br />Any young woman who reads this book can learn alot from Sheryl, regardless of how rich, privileged and blessed she is.  She had a great mentor, great opportunities, great rewards and she wrote a great book to help young and old women learn how to be a leader.  She tells us to surround ourselves with people who believe in us and this is so true.  She tells us we don't have to know everything about our position to be leader, we can learn on the job, just like the guys do.  She tells us to \\"lean in\\" and learn from each other and that is really what makes a big difference in being a leader.  I had a husband who was a \\"partner\\" and encouraged and believed in my ability from the day he married me in 1971.  This is so important to women, having a partner is crucial to a woman who wants to be a leader.  I recommend this book to all young women and women of any age who strive to be a leader in whatever field they have a passion to serve in.  You go Sheryl, you leaned in and gave us all a vision.  I shared your books with a group of young women leader this month and I believe they will benefit from it greatly in their lives.  I wish I had someone who had given me this advice 30 years ago.  My mother and husband did encourage and support me to the best of their ability, so I did become a leader.  Thanks Sheryl
B0063M22QO|5.0|So enjoying the game, love the variety of shapes &amp; levels of play. Fun new way to play an ancient game. You will love it if u try it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|it's a challenge to try to beat my own score. No time to chat. I need to get back to my game.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|What happened, twists and turns expected but not thought they would carry out. The new 'regulars' will add some personality to an already dead horse. If the story line stays within the confines of the prison for very long it will lose it's allure and fans will wain. Hopefully the next season will resurrect the series to a new level.
B00985E3UG|4.0|I will keep this short and sweet (pun intended) - this is a book that I would recommend *everyone* read.  Our foods are making us sick and this book explains why.  It clearly explains how we are manipulated by marketing and science to over eat, eat unhealthy foods, and it outlines the government programs that reinforce our unhealthy habits.<br /><br />However it's a bit of a slog through it and I think the people who should be reading this book won't because of the size of the book and the time/effort required.  I think the author did his very best to make this readable but a lot of the material just isn't going to lend itself to being a 'fun' read.  Some additional editing could have made it a bit shorter and tighter though.<br /><br />If you are at all concerned about your health please read this book!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Didn't watch it yet, But I am sure I will like it. Sounds like a great movie. Can't wait! Great!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Look, I'm a sucker for stories like this.  Best so far was &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; but this book was really a good read also.  My hat is off to all the men and women of our military and god bless them for their service and protection of our great country.  I just wish we would all appreciate what we have a little bit more.<br /><br />OK - off my soapbox - definitely a recommended book if this topic at all interests you!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I didn't get to watch the movie yet but planning on it this week-end, I really can't wait should be awesome!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So powerful.  If you're not a believer, you will be after reading this book. I will be hearing Dr. Alexander speak to our men's group at Trinity by the Cove Episcopal Church April 23 to a capacity crowd.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|SPOILER.  The worst thing an author can do is betray his or her own characters.  It happens in this book.  While the story had great possibilities, there were two glaring inconsistencies, IMO,  that almost made me give up on the book altogether.  The first was Victoria's ability to insightfully  \\"detangle\\" the relationships of others while not having a clue how to have any of her own; and the second, far more costly to the believability of the book, was Elizabeth's behavior on adoption day.  You are expected to accept that this woman, by far the strongest and most connectable person in the story, after one solid year of working with a painfully tormented little ten year old girl, gaining her trust,  and overcoming her own personal hurtful past, suddenly cannot cope with the fact that \\"they're not a family\\" and stay curled up in her bed?! It infuriated me that this was the method by which the author chose to create the adult Victoria.  There ARE strong, trustworthy people out there who do not waver in their commitments to others.  Everything about Elizabeth led to this persona.  She should have been allowed to remain that person.  Her ridiculous, hurtful, and outlandish behavior on that one day ruined the book for me.  It was so out of Elizabeth's character, that I didn't care much about the story after that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series--about the only thing my wife and I enjoy watching together.  It has drama, suspense, warmth, and subtle comedy with a very talented cast.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|This movie was good. It showed courage and the will to survive. I recommend it for anybody who is looking to see a movie about survival.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie is very well done and the cast is superb.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about a specific time in Lincoln's life.
B004D20JP2|3.0|The puppetry of this short was pretty creepy.  The music, of course, was beautiful.  Not exactly the story I remember, either.  Overall, it was okay, but I don't think I will be watching it again.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was just too disjointed for me  overall... I just never got fully engaged with most of the characters. Deals with some interesting subjects... Definitely a slice if teenage life and perhaps I'm just too far removed to feel too deeply about it??? Not a bad read just not going in my top ten
0316228532|4.0|I grew up with the Harry Potter series, and I loved each and every one of the books.  This book is completely different, but I enjoyed it almost as much.  There were some slow parts that I had trouble getting through, but the majority of the book was a fun read!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the story line. I even feel sorry for some of the demons some times. The angels can be scary too.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I would recommend this case to anyone that is looking to buy the new HD 7.  I like that is rotates to a standing position or you don't have to rotate the screen.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I have been using this cover for several months now and I love it! Not only does it do a good job of protecting my Kindle HD. It's just as comfortable to hold as an actual book. I highly recommend it.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|At times it was unbelievable and gory. It was hard to believe in places but I was unable to stop reading. I had to see what would happen next .  The tiger was the draw for this reader.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|not historically accurate and very long and boring.definitely a sleeper movie.Not at all what I pictured Lincoln to be.I dont think Lincoln would be swearing like they portrayed him in the movie
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|Shipped quickly. Great movies for the whole family. My family really enjoyed the movie. I am glad that I purchased it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a satisfying read and has surprises but it is unrealistic from beginning to end.<br /><br />The two main characters are unlikely to meet due to the &#34;filters&#34;' of their backgrounds.  Character development is not consistent in my humble opinion.  If the characters had the backgrounds the book finally fills in, they would probably not have taken the risks they took in this book.  Perhaps that is the point.  You might take the risks and win like the hero and heroine enjoyed but I really don't believe the two main characters sketched here would have taken these chances with the two small children in the family.  Perhaps that is why the author &#34;employed&#34; a spirit to bring them together.  Her actions were also a bit illusiive or inconsistent.  The protagonist, though the most disturbing, was unfortunately believable.  I always cheer when someone gets what they deserve,  I suppose all three did benefit from such worldly justice.<br /><br />When this book was done, I was done with it.  I didn't look forward to writing this review and I didn't miss the book.  In contrast, I just finished a mystery with a platonic romance that I wish was not over.  I would like a sequal.  I do not desire a sequal to Safe Haven.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Very realistic. Kind of puts a new perspective on the effects of water boarding. No water boarding.........then, No Bin Ladin.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Unlike other reviewers, I could totally see this happening in Ireland.  I could even smell it.<br /><br />Unlike others, I liked the ending.  It was realistic and satisfying.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This baby works like a charm.  I have probably cut around 30-40 bottles so far and use the boiling water/ice water method.  I would say on average, I break about one in five bottles which isn't bad.  It seems like the thicker bottles give me the most problems.  Buy one!  It's a great way to recycle those empty wine bottles!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I don't usually review games, but this one deserves a note. Fun game, great graphics, varied puzzles, fun hidden pictures, AND mystery solving! It's long enough for the price and I've played three times so far. I'm going to try without the hints ;-)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful movie. I was absolutely captivated from beginning to end. The visuals were amazing. I felt almost as if I was on the boat with him (spoiler alert).
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|In a very quiet way, without any dialog..there are scenes where one's imagination simply takes over and your heartbeat quickens and you just know things that you want to erase, but can't.  I read the book and saw the movie with Anthony Hopkins many years ago, and like the movie Psycho by Hitchcock, it has stayed with me all these many, many years.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is the best game in history. this is so awesome. I wish I can play every day .This rocks<br />this is freakin awsomest game of all time even before time began. I 'm freaking out like for real.this is awesome.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Its O.K.  Old fashioned movie!  My wife loved it!  I don't know what else to say, except it is a classic!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I truly enjoy these games. They make you think with no stress! My only wish would be for more mistakes before game is over
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Pretty good book, reminds me a lot of my army training, fully agree with Chris the politician should let the soldier fight the war and not mix the action with the politics.<br />had you let the soldiers do there job there would not be two Korea and two Vietnam, this of course is my personal opinion and does not entail other members of this crazy world we live in now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, easy to play - don't like the merchandise that show once restart another round... but still fun. kkkkk
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another in a long line of suspensfull books fron Mr. Clancy.  Look forward to the next Jack Ryan Jr. adventure.
B00007KWHG|5.0|The performance was better than the original band, but they didn't have all of the &#34;stuff&#34; we have for sound now.  I love the fact that I could download it also.  I haven't gotten the CD yet...due today, but it was great to have the download to keep the mood alive.  Thanks.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I've only had this app a few days but so far it works just as advertised.  Good for a free app.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I have never been one to read a book really fast but this one I could not wait to see what happened next.  My sister recommended this to me.  She had seen the movie but I read the book.  Didn't even know there was a movie.  It was such a bad time in our history and I feel badly for all of those people that lost their lives.  It was written very well.  Very surprising ending.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I heard Hugh Howey speaking on a podcast and was intrigued by his description of Wool.  When I read the other reviews I decided I had to try a sample. It is a great world he has built and you find yourself wanting to know more about it very early in the story.  One big con for me was - SPOILER- there was so much character development in the first half of the book for characters who died right after you got their back story.<br /><br />I liked it enough to try the next part- Shift.  I am not sure I agree that it is a science fiction masterpiece, but I would recommend it for others to read.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Another sad movie. I failed to see the humor in this storyline. I did not think it had any comedic value.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I find this site very useful and helpful in my search for not only local weather reports but for other services in which I am interested.<br />The weather Channel for Android
B008ODZUN2|1.0|Truly too sad to watch. I would not recommend this movie. I was not impressed with the story line. The acting was okay.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Easily one of the best written and acted courtroom dramas I've seen. The storyline keeps you interested and has enough suspense to keep you glued to your seat! Wonderful acting, and as another reviewer stated, it would be great to have a sequel. Thanks Amazon, for having this available for streaming!
B00999DFP0|2.0|One whole season skipped on the intro.  One disc did not work at all.  I am not pleased with the quality of what is suppose to be new DVD&#34;S.  I usually buy all of my DVD's from Wal-Mart but thought I would take a chance.  Very disappointed with quality. Will not buy again.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|The app comes up much quicker than typing in the url on my Kindle. Sometimes you just want to know a definition or spelling F-A-S-T.  ;)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo, it was a real story which make it very exciting. Ben Affleck did a very good job on this film.
B004GCQ2WS|5.0|I recieved the item on time, I will do business with them again in the future! AAA+! Highly recommended! package was the right size!
B000062X90|5.0|Wishbone Ash has existed in some form or another for over forty years, yet most rock fans have no idea who they were & are. This album, \\"Argus\\", their third album is probably the first album most of their fans were exposed to them through & it is excellent both musically & lyrically. The best descripton of Wishbone Ash's music would be a mixture of the lyrical adventurousness of early Peter Gabriel era Genesis mixed with excellent dual guitar harmonies & driving playing by Ted Turner & Andy Powell that ranks up there with Peter Green & Danny Kirwan in the early blues incarnation of Fleetwood Mac & Scott Gorham & Brian Robertson/Gary Moore in Thin Lizzy. Two more great bands ignored by American radio & rock fans. \\"Argus\\" has all of the elements of their best music & contains five of their most enduring songs throughout their history in \\"Time Was\\", \\"Blowin' Free\\", \\"The King Will Come\\", \\"Warrior\\", & \\"Throw Down The Sword\\". These five songs almost always turn up on compilations. The album kicks off with with \\"Time Was\\" which builds from a beautiful acoustic intro as a lot of Led Zeppelin's best material does which then becomes a great electric rock song. \\"Sometime World\\" & \\"Blowin' Free\\" are next & are both great uptempo songs with the former having a more moody feel, while the latter is much more upbeat lyrically & musically. \\"The King Will Come\\", \\"Warrior\\", & \\"Throw Down The Sword\\" all have medieval style lyrics along the lines of Fairport Convention, King Crimson, Blackmore's Night, & early Genesis & excellent dual harmony guitar work a la Thin Lizzy & early Peter Green era Fleetwood Mac. The song \\"Leaf And Stream\\", which falls right in the middle of the album is the \\"Battle Of Evermore\\" of the album. Gentle, acoustic music & medieval lyrics a la The Pentangle or Fairport Convention, this tune breaks up the album nicely & is one of the strongest songs on the album. Fans of hard rock bands like Thin Lizzy & English folk rock bands will really enjoy \\"Argus\\" & everything else Wishbone Ash has recorded & is still recording today. This particular release of \\"Argus\\" includes the rare \\"Live In Memphis\\" promotional EP which contains three songs from their first two albums. The quality of these live recordings is excellent & will give new listeners a taste of Wishbone Ash recorded live in their prime. Music like this isn't made too much anymore & it's a shame. What's really sad is as big as Wishbone Ash were & still are in their native England, American audiences are still ignorant of their existence and their music. There is WAY TOO MUCH great music ignored by American radio programmers today. This band is a prime example of that fact. I have long since put down the small pile of \\"classic rock\\" hits American radio programmers try to shove down everyone's throat every day. The pile of great albums they ignore, like this one dwarfs their tiny hits only \\"classic rock\\" playlists & I'd rather hear something great & also fresh. For those listeners who love great guitar driven music different from the same old worn out hits on \\"classic rock\\" radio this album is a great starting place in the vast Wishbone Ash catalog.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game isn't bad but can't find price for things the goals want me to build it is very inconvenient and annoying
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great game for challenging the senses.  Watch carefully because what you see may change right before your eyes!
B001NB1E4G|5.0|I have the LP version and played it all the time when I was in my late teens and early 20s.  Now I have the 25th anniversry version copied  to my iTunes library and listen to the live performance at least once monthly.  Great Music and great memories.
1423140605|5.0|I can tell you this book will not dissapaoint at all, the only draw back is that at the end of the book you want to keep reading but there is no other until fall!
B0060QM0AG|4.0|I enjoyed the discription of the countryside and life In the rolling dales of Yorkshire in the early years. The young veterinarian from Sunderland joins a new practice and his experiences of the small country farms and with stubborn  farmers set in their ways are engaging and sweet. This story is witty and heartwarming.
0823003590|5.0|As a budding portrait artist this was a must for me.  For structure, values and perspectives an essential guide for the novice.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I love this sudoku app! There are soooo many different puzzles at varying levels of difficulty. I also like that it keeps track of your times and gives you different options while playing, such as undo, redo, hints, erase, etc. I wish it had a &#34;start over&#34; option so that you could try again once you realize you messed up a particular puzzle. But there are so many to choose from that you can always just start a new one!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Normally I'm not a huge fan of non-fiction books however I found 'Wild' to be very well written, heart-wrenchingly honest and completely engrossing from start to finish.  I've never experienced loss like the author describes however Cheryl provides you with a vivid picture of her turmoil and subsequent search for inner peace on the Pacific Crest Trail.  It moved me to tears several times.  I highly recommend this book.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Whether or not you are interested in American History this is a compelling story about the struggle for freedom and the resolve of the man called Lincoln.

0385737955|5.0|I read the first page and I thought to myself \\"Great.  Another book I am not going to finish because it's boring.\\"  By the third page I was completely hooked.  I almost finished the book in one night - and I would have if I didn't have to go to work in the morning.<br /><br />This story is completely different from any other book I have had the pleasure of reading.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought this in Jan 2013...thinking it would be my last case cover purchase...today 4/9/13 it has fallen apart. I dropped it and the side of the case cracked about 30 days ago...I thought okay...but still usable. Today I went to charge it and the \\"door\\" hinge feel apart...IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY, TIME AND ENERGY. I will go back to my $20 case that was much more durable.<br /><br />Sad really!

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|First, there's no suggestion that it's all a dream Dorothy had when she bumped her head. (Aunt Em and Uncle Henry have already built a new farmhouse by the time she gets back to Kansas.)<br /><br />My 7-year-old son and I were surprised at some of the violence. The Wicked Witch of the West sends  hordes of beasts at Dorothy and company before finally deploying the winged monkeys, and the travelers of the boulevard of amber masonry slaughter each one in turn.<br /><br />After Dorothy melts WWotW and returns to the Wizard, she and her friends have to trek to the south to see Glinda,  and there are a few adventures along the way that we didn't see in the movie, including a visit to the land of china (ceramics, not the Asian nation), which we saw in &#34;Oz the Great and  Powerful.&#34;<br /><br />It's a delightful book that was made into  a delightful movie. I'm interested in reading some of the subsequent Oz books with my son.
030746363X|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed Tim's book and found most of the info very helpful. My body has changed like never before during the last year of applying the system he recommends, I also taught my mom a part about a slow-carb diet and she lost the weight and feels much better. Especially when being able to wear some pieces she couldn't have for the last couple of years.<br /><br />There are parts that are too detailed but as it's said in the beginning of the book - if you don't want too many details, just skip that. I think it's important for overall understanding so I'm grateful for everything that's there.<br /><br />Thank you, Tim, you're my inspiration for [[ASIN:B00C3JRGCQ Body Leverage]] :)
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I've already left a 5 star review for this. I don't know why Amazon keeps asking for a second review, but here goes. Short version: This DVD is excellent! Highly recommend! There you go...again.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Great movie, incorporated a majority of the hobbit's story within. Even the added material was Tolkien in nature, taken from later works. My only problem with the movie was that, it was too long. It was slow moving in spots, but I love how light and humorous it is compared to LoTR. Seeing as it was originally a children's story, it was very well done.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  Everyone I know that has read it loves this book.  It is a great example of well written hard science fiction.  I found the main character to be human and resourceful and, most importantly, believable. I had difficulty putting the book down.  My only disappointment was my failure to find additional books by Andy Weir.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it, think the first book was a little better, but really enjoyed both of them, cant wait to see the films. Really recommend them both for a jolly good (take me out of myself) type of read!

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My first game of this kind, quite simple, colorful. Game of the Week, liked it. The game is simple, but the &#34;addictive.&#34; The controls used quickly. I recommend.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|This is a well written show with a great cast of characters. If you're not a fan, give it a look and you'll be hooked.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Skillful, sometimes genius, writing through out this.<br />Smooth, calm direct story telling about a story so unusual most of it is unpredictable.<br /><br />If knowledge is power, ignorance can be a deafening sense of powerlessness.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Disclaimer: I love Irish stories. I hate modern romance novels.<br />This is a lovely story about real people with messy pasts and imperfect lives. But it is also about those who face the challenge of living and triumph in their simple courage. Just read it. Too many wonderful twists to the book to tell too much more. A well written tale that is a beautiful escape from candy fluff books that pass for novels these days. I do just wish my Kindle dictionary could define some of the colorful Irish terms.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This movie is not all that good.  But, the interesting stuff in it makes it worth watching.<br />Nazis on the moon turn a U.S. black astronaut into a blonde light skinned blue-eyed white man - sort of.<br />And the poor guy ends on the streets of New York holding card board signs warning people about the end of the world and Moon Nazis. hysterical.<br />but, thats a small part of the movie.<br /><br />So much craziness here it';s usually interesting, frequently funny.<br />The President of the U.S. is an obvious spin on Sarah Palin. Frightening and FUNNY.
0060873027|2.0|I finally decided to read the last book by my favorite author. I didn't want to read it for a long time, because I was sad that there would be no more... That being said, IF this was, in fact, partially written by MC - the final edit is not Crichton... as I forced myself to read on, I kept thinking this sounds more like a script for a Disney movie (except for the killing parts). MC's sci-fi-esque writing is unbelievably believable! His knowledge of all things medical/scientific and his way of explaining those in-depth parts of his stories is amazing. Anyone who is interested in classic Crichton should read ALL of his books - start to finish... but do not read this last one... it just isn't an example of his writing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game wow it's just great you need to play it it's got great potential I think it deserves 5 star rating with very few flaws.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this alarm clock on my kindle fire hd because it can wake me up on time using my own music. I love waking up to my favourite song and they are many clock styles to choose from. I like it to show the second so I chose digital. It also allows you to put it in nightstand mode and it will be on all night and change the amount of light/brightness it gives out.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very<br />fun game, I enjoy playing it. Hours of fun!!! Some strategy games become boring after maybe  five minutes of playing them, but not tbis game.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field are too of the finest actors in the business, and here neither dissapoints. Lewis' performance is a wonder to behold. He is truly great playing Lincoln, and it's pretty impressive to see. Field, while superb has had much greater performances to speak of in numerous more noteworthy pictures, especially her work in films including Sybil, and Steele Magnolia's. Speilberg's directing is excellent, the script also excellent. Production values, sets, costumes, ect. are fantastic. However the film is painfully slow, but the payoff is pretty good if you are not expecting to see any action to speak of at all. This is a character study and it excells brilliantly with that. It was also a bit dissaponting to me that I was hoping to see the actual event when president Lincoln was actually shot by John Booth. But instead it appears Speilberg felt it would be in better taste to make the audience aware of it through a messenger who appears bearing the terrible news. Perhaps that's respectable now that I think about it. But ultimately 'Lincoln' is a very slow and rather boring movie.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|\\"Song for Zula\\" is my favorite song off this CD.  That song is epic.  The video is a work of art as well.  This is my first time hearing this group and after being so impressed by \\"Song for Zula\\", I went into the rest of the album with very high expectations.  The clips on Amazon convinced me to give this CD a chance.  I was not at all disappointed.  Muchacho is an amazing CD.  At times it is heartbreaking and tranquil and at other times it is so full of fearless and intoxicating energy that I found myself hollering \\"whooo!... yeah!\\" even before I heard the band doing the same thing.  Words don't do this CD justice.  Buy it, sit back, and enjoy... there is so much here to enjoy.  In time, I will definitely be checking out their other CDs.  For now I need time to take this one in.  I saw someone on another site thank Phosphorescent for \\"Song for Zula\\".  I would like to extend my gratitude to this group for this entire CD.  Well done!  Bravo!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting the first season of The Walking Dead as everyone was. And it looked like it was going to be one hell of a ride after the pilot episode, which was directed by Frank Darabont, a fabulous director who gave us two brilliant films, The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both superb movies. And Darabont's directing of the first episode of season 1 is brilliant. But by episode 2 something seems to slack off a bit. It's actually still a great episode but it's missing the director of the pilot, and though it's subtle you can feel it. By the third episode things actually start to feel underproduced compared to the pilot and it feels more like a soapish sort of style, with a lot of time, too much time getting to know all the character and their lives and all that goes with it. But there simply isn't a lot of action or zombies through much of season 1 on through till the final episode, which is interesting, but I kept waiting for the magic I saw in the pilot to continue onward, it didn't  happen and I was left feeling that season 1 was an overall disapointment. Decent enough but not great. I decided to not take the plunge any further and did not watch season's 2 or 3 until just a few weeks ago when one night I decided to just give it another chance, and folks am I glad I did.<br /><br />Season 2 hardly resembled season 1 at all. Even when things are slow it's much more interesting, but there is a lot more action and a lot more gore and horror than season 1. The mood of season 2 is solid all the way through, and until season 3 I was left breahtless and convinced that I have never seen anything else as good about zombies. Prior to that all there was to enjoy that were truly great zombie pictures were Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead (and also the remake), and a few here and there that were worth noticing like The Horde, a French take on the zombie genre. Even the older Italian movies like 'Zombie' were good in their time, but though there have been dozens of zombie movies over the years nothing really blew my skirt up. That is until now.<br /><br />Season 3 of The Walking Dead in simply superb. The characters are all great, the shocks and scares are some of the best ever put on film, and the gore is absolutely the most brutal I have ever seen anywhere. It's amazing that AMC could actually get away with all the brutality they have in season's 2 and 3, so much so that I can't believe the FCC isn't nippin' at their butt's over it. If you saw season 1 and like me were not that impressed over all, hold onto to your guts, because season 3 is one hell of a ride. You won't be disapointed, I can pretty much promise you that. Hands down the best zombie story ever told. And season 3 will leave you breathless.ve been dozens of zombie movies over the years nothing really blew my skirt up.

B00BF11STU|3.0|Katherine Bigelow is perhaps the best female action director on the planet, having a string is really great films to her credit dating back to the mid 80's. I think of her as sort of the Michael Mann of female directors. One of her best films is 'Point Break', one of the most exciting, stylish and action packed movies ever made, and she seems best fit to action pictures with lots of bells and whistles. And it was a wonder to behold when just recently her excellent film 'The Hurt Locker' won the best picture Oscar, and it was well deserved. You'd think the subject matter that comprised 'Zero Dark Thirty' would be right down her alley, and it actually is to some degree, but it's often a little too slow and there isn't a lot of action to speak of. The film does well in it's narative, and the acting, writing and plot are solid, it's just that there have been a couple of other films made on the same subject that were a lot more entertaining and just as well made, and were definately better movies. I believe Bigelow desired to tell a more accurate version of the events, and indeed has, but in doing so it made the entire afair seem a bit dull. Still it's a great film, but the feel of it just didn't stay with me. I didn't get the sense that it was one for the books, and I pretty much didn't even have any solid thoughts about it after I saw it.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|This product is really one of the best. The quality gives you the feel of an expensive product, but any stabilizer in the world need practice and practice before you can master using it. Do not be disappointed on the first use!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Still trying to figure out how to reconfigure it to look lilke my PC FB.  It is nice though and big enough for blind me to see
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This product was made to add a light or a wireless receiver an so on, but I also use it alone as a stabilizer! I put my left hand at the bottom and and hold the handle from the center and start shooting. I like it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game! It gets hard to beat tho sometimes but I always get into it fun fun everyone should play lol
B008DYZKQE|4.0|My daughter and I really enjoyed reading this book together when it was time for bed. Very good book for bed.
0440241030|3.0|This is my first Reacher experience.  How many stars?  Tough, depends on what you're considering.  Writing? 5.  Pace? 5.  Characters? 5.  Plot? 5.  Execution? well, there is the rub.  The problem?  Bad guys have to be incredibly dumb at the right moments (Three ex-military bad guys sit around a table, not moving, not reacting, while Reacher takes them out - in turn - with a fireplace iron?  Right).  Reacher is incredibly dumb, at times, without any bad consequences (it strikes you that he would have been killed a long time ago).  The final third of the book, the conclusion, simply does not work.  It simply couldn't play out that way.  My suspension of disbelief was stretched past the breaking point.  Is it worth the read? It is a fun read, especially the first two-thirds, but ultimately, it left me dissatisfied and frustrated and anxious for it to end.  I will give Reacher another chance, but it has to be tighter if I am to read many more.
B008NR90HQ|5.0|If you love Jimi H. your going to love this DVD, it is dead on.<br />I don't think anyone could any closer the music then Gary Moore.<br />You'll be glad you purchased it.<br />NC
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Enough said, really.  Either you're collecting Disney movies and need them all on blu-ray or you're not.  High quality packaging, great features, hasn't melted in my blu-ray player after playing it many times.  Win for me!
B00B2274W2|5.0|These movies are addictive even for my age bracket (40-45) There is just something about vampires.werewolves,humans and the occasional hybrid that makes these movies make you see that no matter the person (human or not) love is hard to so no to. I even got my husband to finally watch the Twilight saga after years of him refusing and we started back at the very first one and he wanted to watch one every night up to the release of Breaking Dawn part 2. There is just something about these movies that suck you in LOL I am not much on watching movies more than one time but I really enjoyed starting back from the beginning and watching all the way through to the end. Just wish that Stephanie Myers would decide to keep the saga going with a look at Jacob and Esme's growth into thier characters and what trouble they will encounter......
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Love those free app deals, this was one of the better deals.  The ability to be productive on my mobile devices really makes or breaks how often I use them.
B005OHSNMG|5.0|This show is fantastic. Adorable, comedic and endearing; it is a show I look forward to enjoying and giggling out loud to weekly.  Hopefully it keeps running another few seasons!
0060581808|5.0|Just as good a read as when I was a child!  My 4 and 5 year olds have enjoyed this book as a read-a-loud after lunch every day.  Very enjoyable.  I am sure we will read more in the series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As always the book is way better than anything you could put on a screen. It was engaging every step of the way.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first time reading a bottom my Gillian Flynn.  I just finished two of her other books this month!  Great!  Keeps you reading until the very end!
B001OKQ7BG|1.0|After two evenings I am unable to watch this . Tried downloading last evening.  After an hour nd a half , it still was not downloaded . Tried three times tonight to watch it and am still unable .  Never again will I purchase an instant video .  I deserve a refund!!!!!
B00BRR66SA|4.0|JT as always is the bomb, like the new album. I guess the wait he made us go through for new music was worth it.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Really fun movie.  Loved all the classic arcade references.  Makes it more interesting for us adults.  Found it funny that I had to explain pac-man to my little guy.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|The quality of the film was fine, but the film itself is just not that good. I wouldn't recommend watching it.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Oh Man.  I did not want to watch this movie.  Kids hounded me till they broke me.  I had a really fun time watching it with them.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Like my momma always said, &#34;Zombies,  why the eff not?&#34;<br /><br />My ten more words that are required are here...  satisfied?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Good characters and story.  Interesting for adults and older children.  Made you think about the &#34;Capitol&#34; vs U.S. Government
0425252868|2.0|I love non fiction WWII books. I was thrilled to see this book and it's corresponding reviews. Perhaps it's jut me but I don't understand the fuss. I enjoyed the character development and I appreciated seeing both sides of the war. That being said, the entire premise of the book is broken down into one chapter in the middle. At no point during this event did I think it was the book's climax. I spent the remainder of the book waiting for some other event that never came. It was a decent story but by no means did it constitute an entire book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game keeps my mind busy while waiting in the doctor's office or at the airport waiting for a flight, helps pass the time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, Creating boards to organize interests found on web and through friends is very helpful for planning activities and events.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I heard about this book years ago. My boyfriend started reading it which peeked my interest, and once I started reading I was glad I did. This book has helped our relationship flourish. I recommend reading this as a couple.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|No maps or navigation was possible, product does not work as a navigator. Very disappointing. I don't recommend this item.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This little gem is quite impressive.  I hooked it up to my first gen Ipad via the Fiio LOD with mini port adaptor and received great sound for my headphones.  Having the capability to up the bass makes this a very nice option for most people.  I also hooked it up to my computer with great results.  It has a build quality that is quite impressive for the size product you are holding in your hand.  I might buy another one for my computer at work.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great selections!  When searching for a song, you will usually find several versions that you can choose from whether they are studio versions, live versions or cover versions.  Easy to operate as well.  There are options to keep your purchase in the cloud and or download it to your computer.  This is the only music service for me.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I thought about this movie for days after I saw it.  Thought it was terrific.  Had never heard of it before-just chose it randomly-so glad I did!
B008ASGP3U|2.0|Rankin should have left my favorite detective retired.  The plot is implausible, the feeling is tired, tired, tired., he does a disservice.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 was even better than season 1, can't wait for the story to continue.  Better than upstairs downstairs and is as good as any other Masterpiece performance
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game is very addictive.  There are days I do well and win and others that I get nowhere.  Prefer to just do the random deal so I don't win always.
0374532281|4.0|We can all relate to Pat! It would have been better if I had not seen the movie first. Still a good read since it made smile, laugh and shed a tear or two
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I watch these for only one reason my spouse, do not like them same old theme and basically Daniel Craig is to old for this part.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I have choosen this rating because it is excellent watches. Everyday I managing time on watch with time on the Internet and everything is OK. Thank you very much!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie did not live up to the reviews, I found it slow and boring, needed more action. This is not a go see, although Ben Affleck is great1
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game so much that I'm addicted to it.  I can't put the game down, when I should be doing housework.
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Absolutely the best effects and story line, just loved this movie. The actor certainly deserved an award and hope to see him again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you are a military history fan you will love this book. Chris Kyle spells out what it was like to be in Iraq and a gritty down to earth narrative. Well worth the read!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|its great, i have no problems with it syncing with facebook. I just wish it gave us more lives.  So I would recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This books was GREAT!  Loved the heartbreaking twists that made these characters so believeable and true to life.  Can't wait to read the next book!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|just couldn't get into it - not for me - and why am I required to write a statement of so many letters.  good grief
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this story from start to finish!  I couldn't put this book down for two minutes.  Everything about this book kept my attention and left me wanting more!
B00BWGISB4|4.0|There isn't much the New Kids on the Block could do that I wouldn't like. I give them props for trying something new, but new isn't always good. Some of the faster songs on here are right on point. Jordan Knight KILLS IT on Miss You More. That song you can on repeat all day. The rest are some B side songs. Fan for life, but this isn't my fave cd by far.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Dear Mr or Mrs did you know what to do I love your book is a very good book a single person in the world is going to love your book .Is cool my big brother want me to read it to him and my little sister is going to love you because your the best in this world man people are going to make you famous for this book man your the greatest in the world but not better than my lady or man but anyway let's git back to were we were ok now where was I oh yeah your the best ok man or lady your cool ok man or lady your cool cool is for loser ha ha just kidding by:Daija Tolbert.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|The levels circle through with diffuculty increasing as you progress. It would be better if it had a story or more variety.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very enjoyable. Cute prizes with carnival theme.  Additional games can be unlocked.  Prize accumulation activates power-ups which makes game even more fun.  Game is really addictive!
B007L6VR12|5.0|What a great movie.  What fun. too bad the mainstream movie goer only wnats sex and violence. this film has plot and acting. sit down with a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy the movie
B00BI5IXL4|1.0|The movie was great ... when I was able to see it and ... hear it!!!!  The reception and sound was horrible!  I will NEVER buy another movie in this format again.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|l have always loved the story - the musical was great. i recommend it to everyone who like music and likes this story.
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|Aspect ratio is broken for 4:3 or 2.35:1 on samsung phone... probably more. Videos are stretched.<br /><br />Support is non-existent.<br />Forums are not watched by devs.<br />Email is not read.<br /><br />But if you watch stuff that matches exactly the phone aspect ratio, then yay it works. Ratio is correct on the galaxy nexus with its deadbeat battery life, just not the best current phones (samsung s3 and samsung note 2).
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was very reading by the story. Very different from other books I've read. True story of loss and living with it. Also a coming to age for the main character.

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Daniel Craig is an awesome Bond! I thought Connery would always be the best Bond, but I may have to start rethinking that one.
B005UG53NS|4.0|For those who have seen the whole movies is good to see the final of this fabulous serie, with full of new events.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When I was first introduced to this series, I was taken!  Very surprised to find it on PBS, but due to my difficult schedule was unable to watch it during regular viewing times.  Needless to say, I have not stopped watching it since I found season 2 on Prime, and cannot wait to view season 3.  Great series
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This movie never gets old.  I bought it so my teen boys could watch and we could discuss the stereotypes of high school, and how the more things change the more they stay the same.
B009UZLRJE|4.0|I am totally happy with this purchase.  The only bad thing that I can say is that on some episodes the quality is sort of grainy looking.
B000009HF2|4.0|Quality of music is good, it's exactly what I expected it to be.  I will get a lot of listening out of it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|W o t.<br />D  n  b. I did not like it to slow info not clear so need more improvment.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This worked out to be perfect, when we couldn't get this series on demand or on netflix.  Would do again if we happen to be in the same situation.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I got this as a christmas gift for my wife. It's a great book she & I both enjoyed reading. Inspirational & insightful regarding a private man with an incredible mind & gift.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|So handy and convenient. Also really nice that you get more memory by referring others, considering this solution sells itself. Almost identical look, functionality and feel that you get from Google Drive. Only  gripe (same with Google Drive) is it uses a lot of memory and system resources. But the convenience outweighs that.
B00BKTWBMA|4.0|I still long for the overtly passionate Eric Clapton of the early 70's, shredding it as if his life depended on it on every album. It is difficult to live up to that hype as Eric himself talks about even today. Old Sock is an appropriate name for this release. It fits like an Old Sock, holes and all. This album sounds like he picked up his guitar, hit \\"record\\" and played a dozen or so songs that he put out as an album. A pleasant listen but it's difficult to believe this album will be critically appraised 40 years on down the road.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The butterfly affect is a dangerous challenge you must consider with time travel. This was my first King book and now i am hungry for more!
1451695195|5.0|I wonder why this isn't THE book everyone is talking about!<br />In life there really is essentially only one question: Is there a God? Yes - then my life should be on path A; No - my life can be on path B.  This is one more weight to the God side of the scales that Pascal wagers is not even up for debate - which path - if I am wrong - will be more injurious to me?
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this for my kids to keep them busy when traveling they love it . this is a fun game
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love the show and the CD is great. Even if you're not a fan of the show you can enjoy these songs. Hoping for a volume 2!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent - works well - convenient.<br />Anyone who has a Kindle should have it.<br />The price can not be beat.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Children love this, but it is not something I enjoy. When my Grand daughters come over they really get engrossed with it.
B00003CX9W|3.0|On arrival you could hear that something was loose in the case. Upon the person opening it as a gift it was clear that the DVD had been loose in the case and not securely snapped in place. The shrink wrap packaging was open on one end and the case said &#34;Not for Resale&#34;. I have not heard if the DVD worked or not since it had been a gift.
B005LAII12|5.0|This is an amazingly funny movie, great for teens and adults! No matter the age this is a timeless funny movie that the whole family ( above teen ages ) would enjoy!
B009DKFST6|4.0|Purchased as a gift.  Recipient enjoying the music, though really quite raw.  The description did saw &#34;explicit&#34; so I can't complain!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Another voice adding to the evidence of life beyond the physical one we are experiencing now.  I recently heard or read that there is a reason we forget our previous lives when we start out on this one.  It would be just too much of a burden to be conscious of all our past mistakes and experiences.  It would prevent us from getting a fresh start and creating a better self.  Some people do carry the burden into a new life, as written about by Brian Weiss, MD, and it does present problems.  On the other hand, some people bring with them some memory of lessons well learned and they are wise.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Continuing saga for the Hunger Games Trilogy.  Enjoyed this and other books by Suzanne Collins.  Amazon is an easy way to get this book.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|my kids love the game. i can not get them off ---------- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- yy
B003UBTX7C|3.0|I normally like David Baldacci's novels, but was disappointed with this one.  Very long and drawn out to get to the main point of the story.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a great story of survival that shapes a boy into a man, and how he finds his religion. A very different take on religious views and how to come into yourself. Heartwarming, interesting, fabulous!
B003K16P3M|3.0|JUST OK FOR ME.  IT WAS LACKING SOMEWHERE.  FINISHED BOOK, BUT REALLY DID NOT CARE TO GO TO THE NEXT ONE, WHICH SAYS SOMETHING.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|We rented this movie thinking that it would be something different, but it's the same old Tim Burton. The story line was terrible, the characters were copies, it doesn't keep your attention. No point in buying or renting this movie.
0812993357|4.0|This book is long, and if you are not into fashion, it's not for you.  But if you are, Grace will walk you through how Editors got started in the 60's.  Grace started as a model, then moved along and grew into her role as Editor of Vogue.  What better credentials.  She lived fashion, didn't study it.  Personally I worked at Vogue for a nanosecond in the late 60's early 70's on the business side (Merchandising).  It was certainly not as arty as the editorial side, but I did get a good peek at the world.  Fun book.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Couldn't put it down.<br />It was engrossing, entertaining and educational all at once. It is a must read for just about anyone.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Todd Thiede surprised me within this book.  Most first novels are disorganized and lacking in some way but Time Killer is focused, exciting, and well thought out. The plot was original in my opinion. A serial killer murdering time wasters was awesome. The murder scenes were graphic but not gruesome. The characters were well rounded. Thiede provides plenty of background about them during  the course of the story which makes them likable and more realistic. The book was a fast and suspenseful page turner.  My only complaint is that it ended. Can't wait for the next one!
B006VREOOY|3.0|I like De Nero and Statham and they do a good job in this killer movie. The story like most of Hollywood's products doesn't hold up well under tough scrutiny. It is an action movie so that's par for the course. It is a good popcorn movie.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I had already seen and loved the movie, and decided to give the book a try. I wasn't disappointed. -- the movie was very true to the book, but of course enhanced the story with additional conversations and character development that couldn't fit in the screen version. Emma is a lovable, yet flawed, character which is refreshing because some of Jane Austen's other main characters seem too perfect to be real -- steadfast, strong, self-controlled. I definitely recommend this book.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|great book. easy read. Lee Child novels are very easy to follow and hard to put down. would recommend it
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Political skulduggery at its best with a central character reminiscent of Shakespeare's Iago in his evil and treachery.  While the subject is Parliament it could just as easily be about the American Congress. The acting is superb as is the writing and directing. It gets only four stars because the music accompaniment was a bit annoying.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story thoroughly engrossed me. I felt I was away from my world while watching it.  I loved the characters and the interaction between all of them.  The costumes, the history and the beauty of the house itself was amazing. I can't wait to watch the next episode and I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys period pieces and hopefully to some who do not.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I gave this five stars not only because it is a great movie, but also because of the price. I literally got 4 copies of the movie for only $27.99 and then free shipping! I also have an Amazon Chase Rewards Visa, and was able to purchase this money with my rewards points. Win win
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is fast, accurate and easy to read because of the large numbers. The best calculator I have access to at this time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show has become addictive for me.  It captured me from the beginning and I absolutely love it.  I want to see all the episodes but I also don't want it to end.  I highly recommend you watch it but give yourself time because you will want to see one episode after another.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My Screwdriver arrived quicker than I though it would, two days exactly at that. It came in it's original packaging and it was easy to assemble. I'm not sure why most people or even the instructions say it doesn't work unless fully up or down, because it works anytime I slide it. Might just be me though. The UV ink/light works perfectly and the sounds are authentic enough to pass for the real thing. I'm very happy with this product and I recommend it to any Whovian out there, though it could be a little more sonic.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This app has a very nice interface and really shows you all the files on the device. Unfortunately it appears that the exploration is hit and miss. Sometimes it can find the directory I am looking for and sometimes it can't.
B003YJF068|2.0|It's beyond obnoxious that the Kindle device, Kindle Cloud reader or Kindle PC reader app can make these charts actually scale to a size that someone with 20/20 vision could read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app is very quick and works well. Photos on Facebook are very clear and I cant upload and access all information as desired
B008OOYALE|2.0|I had (have) a hard time understanding how to play. Seems like it might be more fun for smaller children than adults.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app is great at conserving resources and automatically kills apps for you as well that you are not using
B000CCBCAS|5.0|we had this movie for years on vhs format but after a few years the vhs tapes darken so we bought this dvd and looks great.thanks
B000OJFV4C|5.0|If you like period pieces with wonderful costumes, great characters and a good story you will love Tudors.  I happen to love anything about English Royalty so I watch everything if it is as good as this one was.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This was a great movie!  I am so glad our little red box goes out on a limb with these indie movies.  The story was touching, and the actors were stunning!  If you like foreign movies, true stories, and don't mind reading captions, this one is for you!<br /><br />I don't want to go into detail as so many others have, but I will tell you that this story is really brought to life!  And if they actually do remake this into an American version, as rumors go, then I will be chomping at the bit to watch that one as well.  It really was that good.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|I love amazon Prime, I get to see the wonderful movies I missed when they were showing in the theater. My granddaughter recommended this movie and I did thoroughly enjoy it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Books had a lot of twists and turns...kept your attention and kept you guessing and wondering how you would react in a similar situation.  Like books that make you think.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Liked this book because it does make one really ponder on the whole life after death experience. I've only (and recently) read a couple of these types of books, but do see a common thread. Sometimes parts of the books seem a little far fetched, but who am I to question what I've never experienced myself...
0385344333|5.0|A fan of Lee Childs, I've read about Jack Reacher for several years now, even pondered him in very quiet moments, and still can't quite peg him. So much unknown. So much that stirs the strong curiosity of this psychotherapist. I love it when the characters in a book intrigue me so much I get frustrated. Then run out to get the next one as soon as it cools from the presses. Yep--it seems that getting all the corners tucked nicely and all the quirks of human character explained isn't what keeps me turning pages! Childs gives us Reacher. I wonder about other readers' take on him.<br /><br />I found this story deeper and more interesting than some earlier books, which were also just right for the reading experience I was in the mood for, and was surprised to see that the rest of the world of readers doesn't agree with me.<br /><br />I give \\"The Wanted Man\\" a five-star rating because he is perfectly Reacher, the story more intricate than usual for this character and his adventures. When I pick up Lee Childs I'm not looking for William Shakespeare's writing--I'm, looking for a lighter, more enjoyable read that doesn't leave me questioning the meaning of life. This book gave me action, mystery, engrossing characters--all just right for end-of-day reading. This book completely fulfills its niche for me. (Ariel I.)
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a fun and easy to use app. I enjoy listening to local radio stations and checking out the weather on the nearby NOAA station too. It picks up just about every station locally that I know of and you can tune in to national stations also.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's difficult to find quality science fiction on main stream television these days.  Fringe starts out as an episodic procedural and quickly turns into a serial that is unforgettable.  Once you start, you can't stop. Get ready to marathon.
B004YKSXYW|4.0|The Rise of Rome: The Making of the World's Greatest Empire by Anthony Everitt is a very readable account of the rise of Rome and its expansion around the Mediterranean. The explanations of various events are interesting and credible. However, as an e-book, it has a flaw ... it lacks the summaries of various chapters / episodes / periods that would help a reader recap what he has read. These are necessary as, unlike a printed book, you can flick through the pages of an e-book. Nevertheless, a thoroughly enjoyable book that imparts a lot of history in an interesting way.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I finished Gone Girl just over a month ago...and have read both sharp objects and dark places since then.  Flynn is a fantastic author with a real handle on suspense.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|wonderful show, cannot wait for season 4! Oh, what will Lady Mary do and what will they name the new heir?
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Love the AONC community! I'm thinking about my own desires to work for myself and do what I love while being free to travel. Hoping these ideas and stories will continue to inspire me and others on the journey. Thanks Chris!
1451648537|5.0|I typically don't read biographies, especially autobiographies, as I prefer fiction, but I was told that I \\"had to read it!\\". And so I did. The book was wonderfully paced, gave a wide-view of opinions, and I felt that Isaacson was holding back. I came away admiring Jobs in business, entrepreneurial sense; definitely not a personal sense. I liked Jobs because he reminded me of Shakespeare's Richard III, as he seemed more like a fictional character than a person whom you would meet on the street and perhaps that is why I was so drawn to his story.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Me agradó baste y lo único q no me gustó fue que estaba en inglés y pues no le entendí nada y eso fue todo tal vez algún día yo aga algún libro que sea de mi agrado
B00B4YAQ5A|5.0|In my opion in the thirty years of listening to Saxon this is the best all around album yet!!powerful,musical.....just flat out rocks!!!
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I gave the blu ray 4 stars. The blacks were black (not smudgy), and the colors seem great, along, with a nice sharp picture. The review/stars are regarding the quality of the blu ray disc - not the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an awesome app especially if you love horses like I do. the graphics are very realistic.  you will love it!
B007TKT2SK|3.0|Many of the number combinations give odd results.  Who needs a bottom fractional number like 167?  It needs a way to round the fractions up rather than give a number that a normal person can't deal with.  Of course, maybe I'm not normal.<br /><br />For example, it should round to the nearest 16th or 64th.  That would make it a lot more useful.<br /><br />AD2
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 = THE BEST SEASON EVER! Best show of 2013. I can't wait to see what happens in season 4.  Awesome!
B008EKMB82|4.0|engaging read so far. have it on kindle and it has helped pass the time in doctor's waiting room. will update when done!
B004H6G0TI|3.0|It was fun for a minute but then it got repetitive and the controls became a hassle as all you do is fly loops and shoot at other planes.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is a difficult book to read because of the protagonist's complex chronic psychological disorders, a story peopled with mentally disturbed characters, and murder. The twists and turns in the plot along with old grudges keeps the reader interested. Many of the characters are difficult to like and then the author gives them a redeeming trait to make you wonder who they really are. Right up to the end you do not really understand what is going on. A tantalizing addictive story.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I purchased all 3 seasons actually. The whole production, thus far has been a wonderful series, yet a emotional rollercoaster. ;) I would have to say the first two seasons where the best. The end of season one recapping a beautiful love story between Lady Mary and Matthew.  The series is not dull, nor dry at all. Taking a family living during the Edwardian period, but with such a fresh take on the screenplay writing. Adding the wonderful costumes and amazing soundtrack and you have a award winning series.  My favorite character is the Grandmother, Lady Grantham! :)
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I wish it had some of the non-accapella music like the music from the beginning and end credits.  It's a little on the short side but I love the music on it.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|Overall I think these are pretty decent. I doubt very much that the response really is as flat as people claim though. They are VERY bright-sounding. That being said, these are designed to be used as studio monitors, not \\"hi-fi\\" headphones, and in their intended use (to monitor sound) they do a decent job. I find the sound too bright and fatiguing for use as \\"hi-fi\\" headphones though. My old Sennheisers are much better suited to that job, but then again they cost about 5 times the price of the Sony MDR-7506. These are 100 times better than the \\"other\\" studio favourite (the Beyer DT100) which are also supposed to be flat-response but instead just sound absolutely horrendous in every respect! The fragile material used on the earpads is a strange choice for a model which is supposed to stand up to professional use too.<br />But, overall, for the money, they're pretty decent. I doubt they can be beaten at this price level.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Very annoying sound effects, no fun to play.  Best to leave this application in the bit bucket.  Now if the do fix the sound, that might make this better in the future.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Clever attachment to historical heads of state.  The main character is a bit naive<br />sometimes.  We must accept an unlikely chain of events to make an amusing story ..
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Although Dawkins is widely reviled for his skewering of religion he supports his position with reason and evidence, unlike most of his attackers. Whether one has a religious faith or not this is a book well worth reading.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|There are a variety of problems with the Kindle version of FB. Everything from loading a photo to sharing something with a particular User/group. Like almost all Kindle apps, this needs some serious work.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This case is pretty, sturdy and perfect in my big purse.  I don't advise carrying it around as is because it is so cute others will be tempted to take it.  I would purchase it again if something happened to this one.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Does what I need it to do. I have had no problems so far. Nice App. Wish I had more to say.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Had to keep reading to finish. Adults will enjoy this book's suspense and story.  The ending in the epilog is a good finish to the story.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|A review in 140 characters or less, I love Twitter and using social media should be in ones daily habits in communications. Follow me JimHildreth and I will be happy to follow you.
B00181JGI2|5.0|You'll laugh from start to finish.  Then you'll make yourself a &#34;caucasian&#34;!  Then you'll go buy yourself a new rug!
B001AUKUS6|4.0|Released in 1985, \\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" is another in the list of terrific Ratt records. This album continues the trend of commercial hard rock that was made for the MTV generation. Ratt just happened to do it as well as anyone.<br /><br />\\"Invasion of Your Privacy\\" is actually Ratt's second full-length record. They released an EP in '83, but that was only a couple songs to get them their deal. This record picks up right where \\"Out of the Cellar\\" leaves off. It carries on the huge choruses, big production, and terrific writing of the band, and I can not see how any melodic rock fan doesn't love them some Ratt. This is quite possibly my favorite Ratt album. My favorite tracks from the release are \\"Lay It Down,\\" You're In Love,\\" \\"You Should Know By Now\\" and \\"Got Me On The Line.\\"<br /><br />Another quality release from these guys, and well worth tracking down if you don't already have this. I'd suggest buying all their records, they're all really decent, and it's no surprise these guys were one of the genre's biggest acts.
B003G94BZC|5.0|What can I say? I've watched Dr Who since Peter Cushing -1965. All of the new Doctors have been terriffic, and I really love the energy Matt Smith brings to the role. The Ponds are perfect, the storyline in season 5 is great and the writers have done a wonderful job of bringing the Doctor's humanity to light.
B003QS67F0|5.0|Great movie, has you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It I s one of those movies I could watch again.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This was a great movie.  We sat on the edge of our seats; we cried when we got involved with the characters (don't want to give it away) and cheered with others!  Great ending to the games. Anxious for the next movie!
B000669GAI|5.0|Have as a gift to my husband. He raved about it. He's 39, so it depends on the age bracket you're trying to please, but he loved the 2 CD set.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is without a doubt the best book in the series so far I have not aught to share with thy. Go buy six book.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|pure comedic classic. this teddy bear is not one for the kids. All adult. Must see if you like the &#34;Family guy&#34;
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play bingo and this game has a nice variety an∂ pace.  I wish the comments weren't on there they are distracting
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Love the Tech and the people in the movie.  I can not wait to see if they make more of these.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book was way too over the top for me in many ways. The twisted mental abuse that went on between the characters was atrocious and sickening. Nothing in the story was even remotely realistic. I will not be reading anymore stories from this author.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was surprised, I really liked this move and the story.  The people in the movie where great as well.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|Amazing story plot and even better acting.. Perfectly chosen cast too... I love the suspense in every season keeping me wanting more after each episode...... Hoping for many many more seasons!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it's so cool and fun I play this and I love it! It is such a cool game
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Excellent film, delivered as instant video for immediate satisfaction. I immediately had to watch Psycho, and read about Hitchcock. When the disc price drops, I will purchase it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it but in Sydney it won't give me a mystery box with keys inside I still love Subway Surfers
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Excellent cast and script. Instant video played on laptop had unclear sound and weak volume. If disc price drops further, I will purchase.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Refreshing to have a well written series to read.  Gave me something to do at work, and made me want to read it while at home too.  Good, solid and most of all BELIEVABLE characters acting in ways that remind me of my life and attitude, fears and hopes of when i was 17.  A solid plot that has you rooting for the lead and for her mission to succeed.  The rebellious attitude she has, anger towards authority, fears, nightmares, all of the things that make us human, and keep her human.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I'm late getting on the Firefly bandwagon, but I'm still glad I did. So sad that it was so short lived.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i am so engrossed to this book..i read it thrice already..i'm so into Ana and Christian's love story..hahaha..i'm, going gaga to this book...i stay up late just to read this book...and it helps me alot..hahaha...you know what i mean.:-) i hope theres book 4 coming up!!! can't wait.....:-) &#60;3
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game! Slow at first but really fun and addictive after you get your third or fourth dinosaur. Wonderful game for the dinosaur lover.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I have been running my entire life and have been blessed with progress. I've recently embarked on the wonderful journey of ultra running. This book was amazing but hard to read simply because I would read a chapter and be so pumped up I would have go for a run right then and there. I'm trying the whole vegan/vegetarian thing right now for my own research on how I feel during and after my runs. So far so good! love the recipes in the book and I can't wait to further my knowledge. Read this book!!!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|As always Denzel Washington did a great job.  Story of a gifted pilot and a functioning alcoholic who put his passengers at risk whenever he flew...scary thought.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and very exciting. If you like temple run 2 you will definitely love this game.GREAT APP:)
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I'm rewatching this for about the 15th time. It's reaaally good. Can be disturbing, seeing the nasty ways people were slated to die - and for stupid reasons; but alas, it's all true. Recommended, for adults.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Bought this book after hearing that he was gunned down.  How ironic that the #1 sniper in terms of actual kills was killed<br />at home.  Excellent account of his time in the service
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Lots of action, drama and history! Looking forward to Season 2. Well worth the price and time for viewing! Thanks.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love Lord of the Rings and this was just as good and maybe better. Buy this movie, it clearly lays out the background story for LOTR and it has amazing visuals.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Finally a book about running and veganism. It is hard to find account of marathoners--let alone Ultramarathoners-- who following a vegan diet! It gives me hope and Scott Jurek is an amazing storyteller! He is amazing all around and I love this book!
B00821PCJS|2.0|I only watched the first 20 minutes of the pilot.  It was boring and I turned it off.  Your mileage may vary, of course.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Finally a new band that isn't so depressing!! I listen to this at work and it always puts me in a good mood.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Being a Lincoln fan since the early 1970's, I was disappointed probably because I've seen better productions like \\"Gore Vidal's Lincoln\\" and \\"Sandburg's Lincoln\\" which showed more about the man and the complexities of the Lincoln presidency.  I figured with a movie title named \\"Lincoln\\" and a Spielberg production, it had to be great.<br /><br />The talent was top-notch, the costumes and period props were fabulous, and the sets realistic.  However, the script could have been shortened or the entire production made into a mini-series like HBO's \\"John Adams\\" to allow more expansion of this great historical figure.  There was little entertainment value in this movie and it was more of a fragmented documentary.  While a good history lesson about the 13th Amendment, I found it too long and dull compared to others I've seen.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love Fun. I have had a hard time finding alternative/rock music lately that is upbeat and positive! Listening to this just gives an all around good feeling.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|After hearing all the raves about this movie, I found it a big disappointment.  I thought this was going to be a military movie about the Bin Laden capture by the Navy Seals.  They could have concentrated more on the mission and less on the CIA woman and the torture scenes.  The movie looked to either have a choppy script or poor editing.  At the end during the Bin Laden invasion, the scenes were so dark I couldn't tell what was going on.<br /><br />The movie was way too long and very boring.  The only action was at the very end and even that didn't make the long wait worth it.  For this director, Hurt Locker was better.xclude most of the boring meetings that contributed nothing to the story.<br /><br />I just saw The Hurt Locker by the same director and thought it was so much better.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|This album is amazing- so much depth, so much complexity. The only reason I don't listen to it constantly (that is how I like my music, generally) is that the lyrics can be a bit dark. At 40, I find I'm sensitive to media and can get a little dark myself if I take it in too much. However, it is not without compassion. It is my own darkness I have to take in smaller doses. Musically, I am very curious what they'll do for their next album- how could they top this?
B000HZED8S|2.0|The film tried to capture the look and feel of movies filmed around the 1930s and the 1940s. It was a nice attempt, but a weak script and shallow premise doomed the movie for me.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I was so glad to find a good, gritty, fantasy series after seeing nothing but tween fantasies lately. So refreshing.
B00BLCHL4Y|5.0|Well made, great production value, a show that keeps you guessing with characters that have depth and intelligence. Highly recommended.
0393317552|5.0|If you have an interest in history, politics, and/or anthropology, and you don't already know how the three are linked, this will pull it all together for you.  Significantly changed the way I look at the world and gave me a much better global perspective on cultural development.  I regularly recommend it to others and recently gave it as a present.  I'm on my second copy because I loaned my original out and it never came back...
B0063M22QO|3.0|It did not wow me.<br />It is just an ok game.<br />Does not hold my intrest for long.<br />Would not recammend it at this time for adults many for ages. 6-15.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Every episode gets better. I watched the first episode and within minutes I was hooked. Definitely recommend this show to anyone looking for an action packed show.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I'm new to the zombie stories, but the narrative in this one is real good, and top speed. Certainly at some passages it turns kind of boring or too long, and another parts too short, but overall is a good piece of narrative seen from the point of view of the interviewer. Some chapters are real photos of human misery and it's desire of survival, in another a zombie shootout. Well, I recomend this book to zombie fans, and beware: they are coming...
B0080M3OGW|3.0|I watched this because I love Meryl and Robert and hadn't seen it. It was fun mostly due to the environs--this was made in the around the same time I was getting a divorce. As much as I enjoyed seeing the actors in their younger days, I like seeing the cars, the clothes, the attitudes of the times. A better title would be Falling in Love on the Train -- the train seems to be a major character.<br />Not sure about the love -- seems like two somewhat bored people following their fatal attractions (fatal to their marriages) which seemed to be very nice people. And it works out for them in the end....but forget about the kids and the collateral damage. Kind of a 60's, 70's theme, I thought.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So serious, yet so entertaining. The costumes and time period are spot on. Love the story line ranging from all walks of life.
B002SM2QDC|5.0|Love these types of movies.  can't wait for the next one.  Lot's of sci fi action.  A movie I will watch more than once
B00C1C0WCQ|3.0|Sequel is good, simply doesn't live up to the first movie. Worth watching nonetheless. Especially getting the new generation into the classic movies from the 80s and 90s
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best series ever made.  I could just lose myself in it and almost feel I was there with the characters.  I love Brendan Coyle as Bates.  I love him in anything.  The women in thus series are so elegant and gracious while being strong.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this film. It shows the ultimate sacrifice for love and your country and reminds us how hard one will fight for what they believe in
034552554X|5.0|Loved the story line and discovering the Victorian meaning of flowers!  A story about the depth of relationships intertwined with the power of love.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|original, inspiring, a joy a watch. I think about the remarkable connection that can be so profound and beautiful between animals and people.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett  mixes fiction with facts perfectly.<br />Lots of characters but easy to keep them straight.<br />Looking forward to book 2
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed Lincoln better than any other actor I have ever seen. The movie gave a better insight of Lincoln than any other.
B0068THAGY|4.0|I found Super 8 to be an entertaining movie. I had no idea it included space aliens but I very much enjoyed the movie. There were no periods in the movie when I wished I hadn't started watching. In contrast to many movies I have watched lately I could see why people would like the movie.
B00AAU7AI0|5.0|Wow!!!<br />When you find wise words, test them against your heart. If your heart identifies with them, accepts them and embraces them, then they were meant for you.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I hesitated at first to get this album because I was a bit afraid of it somehow being too saccharine.  Well, listening to her first selection immediately removed any such thoughts from my head.  She truly does make each of these songs &#34;her own&#34; in such a marvelous way that it's almost like hearing them all for the first time.  It is simply mind boggling that this incredible voice remained virtually unknown for as long as it did.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|To much profanity I did like the brief comedy but it was really hard getting past all the profane language
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|This is such a weird movie when you stop and think too hard about it. So don't. Just watch it and love it... allow yourself a few moments to appreciate Costner's 90s jeans and how good Ray Liotta looks.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|INTRO<br />I'm a semi-pro photographer. Despite doing most of my work digitally, I still shoot and develop my own film (bathroom darkroom...) and have spent a lot of time over the past few years archiving my own 35mm rolls. DBRoth sent me this scanner in exchange for an honest review, so here goes:<br /><br />GENERAL INFO:<br />The scanner allows for the scanning of negative film (color and b&w) as well as positive or slide film (color). When scanned at full resolution, images are saved at 3900 × 2600 at around 100DPI. This is pretty decent, and will be enough for smaller prints (4x6 and 5x7). USB mode works on both mac and windows computers - the SD card shows up in the file manager as if it was being read by any other external card reader. I'm going to assume it will also work on Linux, simply because most USB mass storage devices do. With a small footprint the scanner doesn't take up too much desk space, and needs only a USB connection for power (wall adapter included).<br /><br />PROS<br />- One of the fastest consumer film scanners I have ever seen<br />- Relatively simple to operate once you get the hang of it<br />- Can scan most commonly-available film types<br />- Live View allows you to see exactly what you are scanning<br />- EV compensation and resolution options give you some control when scanning<br />- Various modes (clock/music player) are unnecessary but fun to play around with<br />- TV Out for viewing slides with the family!<br /><br />CONS<br />- Quality is not this scanner's strong suit. It performs pretty well, but some may find it not up to par.<br />- As far as I can tell, the scanner does not scan the full 35mm frame, but cuts off a mm or two. Not a huge deal, but noteworthy<br />- Menu system is a little tricky to get the hang of<br />- Switching to USB mode wiped my memory card after having scanned some images. I now transfer the SD card to a card reader after scanning.<br />- Film holder had dust on the inside which was noticeable on scans<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Build Quality: 7/10<br />Image quality: 6/10<br />Convenience: 9/10<br />Ease of Use: 7/10<br /><br />Honestly, this film scanner is a mixed bag. Compared to other scanners priced only a little higher, the image quality is not as good as it could be. That said, you cannot get a high-quality scanner with these features and this speed for anywhere NEAR this price. My Epson V330 (a mid-grade scanner) takes about a minute per frame, which means you're going to be spending around thirty minutes a roll! You end up with better-looking images, but that isn't so important for some people who simply want to see what's on those old rolls of film!<br /><br />I debated between rating this as three or four stars, so please takes this as a 3.5/5 review. Would I recommend it? I think some people will find this a useful tool to scan those old family film rolls, but if quality is your main goal, I would suggest spending a little more on an office scanner with a 35mm holder. I would suggest reading all of the reviews for this scanner before making your decision - some people as you can see have been more than happy with the scanner, others not so much.<br /><br />Recommended with some reservation.scans<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Build Quality: 7/10<br />Image quality: 6/10<br />Convenience: 9/10<br />Ease of Use: 7/10<br /><br />Honestly, this film scanner is a mixed bag.

B00979CS50|5.0|Love the long songs. Most of the young peeps today don't have the attention span in their sound bite world!!!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This is not worth the  $2.00 or (2 cent) many channels but couldn't  get none of them....... a  rip off
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading this. I read through the entire trilogy in less than a week. Hated to do anything but read. Excellent.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I got this one day when I needed to take a quick note with me.  Since then, I have used this app over and over again.  It helps me keep track of items and lets me keep track of my calendar.  I just don't think you can beat it for the price (free)
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My Granddaughter loves it!  She is four years old and really likes playing catch with the animals. She also likes feeding them.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I generally stay away from depressing books and you would think a book about teens with cancer would fall into a dark and sad story. But the characters are so real and intelligent and honest and slightly cynical. I loved this book- one of my new favorites. It made me laugh more than cry.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|After reading a number of chapters, I found that I really did not enjoy the book.  It just wasn't for me!
B0018RC7QE|3.0|The movie and the story itself is just any old style romance. I watch it because I love the actress.
B008Y73XTQ|4.0|One of the best WWII movies made. Great performances, good action. It is definitely a classic. a a a a
B007TNS6JI|5.0|fun and addicting. just dont like that you need to be connected to the internet to upgrade gear. besides that its amazing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Another great Bond movie from Craig. There are some major changes to the Bind franchise in this movie, but I won't spoil them for you. Craig isn't the only one who delivers a great performance, Dame Jude Dench continues to kick ass as M and Javier Bardem is a fantastic creepy villain for this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|what more can be said, &#34;it is the word of God&#34; a true manual to how to live, love, and enjoy the wondrous gift of life we have been given. reading it daily can give you the reason to enjoy your life to the fullest. it will truly fill your heart with joy!!!
B000JMKO0A|5.0|This was a good read. I could hardly put the book down, finished reading the book in 1.5 days. I will be reading another one of his books.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Brings back memories. Never too old for a Disney movie ;-) its fun, shows girls can do anything a boy can do, and supports rebelling lol. I just love this movie.
B005LAIH9A|3.0|We all love the franchise.  The message is there that things don't always turn out like we thought they would in life and getting older changes our perspectives, but the plot is a bit contrived and maybe not as polished as past projects.  Trying to find reasons to cameo ever old character was strained and how many times can old schoolmates turn gay in one movie.  Still nice to see Stifler getting his due and worth adding to the collector's library.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show is the best. The writing, acting, it's all good.  If you like a gritty police drama, than this is a must see.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|I won't bore you to tears with a seven or eight paragraph dissection of each song, whether I felt I got screwed by not getting bonus tracks, etc etc.  You like Stone Sour?  You'll like this.  Viscerally, it appeals to me more than Part 1 did the first couple of listens.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The movie did not work on my Kindle after downloading it for a hour. I was very disappointed. I had full WiFi also.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show has plots, storylines and characters that keeps you wanting for more.  The characters are smart and inherently good natured... Yet they are very human too.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|I think Ninja Joe seems good for some time wasting, but that's about it. I like the simplicity of the game, you swipe to jump over obstacles. On the other hand, the graphics weren't that great but the comic art was kind of cool.

B00B97SNJI|5.0|Stories Don't End is the first Dawes album with perfectly refined songwriting and balanced production. It's fairly obvious that they set out to make a more focused record. While at times it may seem to lack some of the spontaneous magic that made Nothing Is Wrong so special; it's songs like Most People and Side effects that remind you that they haven't lost a step. Taylor Goldsmith has only matured in his songwriting capabilities.<br /><br />Just Beneath The Surface is a perfect opener. It has an appropriately brewing tempo that's perfectly accomplished with Griffin Goldsmith's drumming and back up vocals. The first single off the album, From A Window Seat, isn't going to blow you away on your first listen. It's a song that will grow on you and works better in context with the rest of the album. Most People may be the highlight for me. It's so undeniably catchy and will easily wear out your car's rewind button. The cover of Blake Mills' song Hey Lover is a welcome addition to the band's repertoire. It's a song that works perfectly with the Goldsmiths sharing vocal duties. From the Right Angle is another favorite and would fit in perfectly on Nothing Is Wrong. Near the end of the album comes Side Effects. The lyrics of this song really hit home for me. It accurately portrays just how skewed our perception of love can be over time. Finally the album closes with a reprise of Just Beneath the Surface. This mostly acoustic accompaniment to the first track is really beautiful. It certainly makes me think Taylor Goldsmith could pull off anything as long as he has a trusty guitar. Here are my individual track ratings:<br /><br />1. Just Beneath the Surface- 5/5<br />2. From A Window Seat- 4.5/5<br />3. Just My Luck- 3.5/5<br />4. Someone Will- 5/5<br />5. Most Poeple- 5/5<br />6. Something In Common- 3.5/5<br />7. Hey Lover- 5/5<br />8. Bear Witness- 5/5<br />9. Stories Don't End- 3.5/5<br />10. From the Right Angle- 5/5<br />11. Side Effects- 5/5<br />12. Just Beneath theSurface (Reprise)- 5/5<br /><br />If you can go see this band live before making any judgement. They have to be the most exciting band on stage at the moment. It will certainly help you to appreciate how good they really are.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Obviously something were sensationalized a little bit, but that doesn't mean that this isn't one of the most imporant discussions we need to have regarding food and its consumption in the US/World.  Ignorace on what you are eating is not bliss!  Watch this and then spend some time thinking and educating yourself!
