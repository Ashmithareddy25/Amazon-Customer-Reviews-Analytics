B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I expected Temple Run Oz to be just as fun as the second Temple Run, and I was right!  This game is so much fun to play!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Fun little game, enjoy the graphics.  Wish it would not keep zooming out and FB is a little too much required.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. Like temple run and subway surfer. You run and jump and side.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I just love this series of Star Trek. I can't say it is my favorite, but I am really enjoying it  this second time around.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great for kids. but the fight is kind of.hard. great. fun love it. awesome. how do you swich the costom.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Starts off easy, but gets more difficult as you go higher.  Fun game - strategy counts to finish faster.  Good change from playing other games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hooked.  I am so sorry to say.  I have watched my friends play this on facebook and wondered what all the hype was about.  I stayed away as long as I could and finally took the plunge.  I am so hooked.  It is insane fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Could not put it down until I finished it.  Great story of making right an injustice  of past sins of a father to try to make amends by his son
B00EKR61FM|3.0|Great deal on the movie, cheaper than costco and I'm sure the girlfriend will love it. But for some reason, she wanted the vampires on it, not the rotten were-wolf!!! (Which is the one that came, even though the vampires are the ones displayed online).  Kinda bummed but oh well...  At least she loved the special features and the blue-ray quality.<br /><br />If it matters to you who is on the cover, I would recommend requesting it while ordering.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I love each and every Jack Reacher book. Can't wait to get into the next one! I am reading the entire series in order.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Stupid but very funny the whole way. The ending is the best ---watch as the credits roll don't miss the extra scenes.
B00371XIJE|4.0|Hachi's memorial statue at Shibuya Train Station, Tokyo and the story behind it, was familiar to me.  Shibuya is also my last name.  The film captured the fiercely loyal Hachi who waited everyday at the train station for the professor to return from work at the of the day. Hachi ends up waiting every day at the same spot at the train station for nine years, even after the professor is dead.  Instinctive, strong love between Hachi and Professor from first contact, like imprinting, to the death of both characters. In Hachi's final breath, she sees the white light, and Professor, who has returned to take her &#34;Home.&#34;  Strong ancestral & cultural values depicted e.g. Samurai spirited dog through DNA & breeding as Shogun guard dog...fiercely loyal.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this song! Something about Ellie's voice that captures my ear. Could listen to this on repeat all day!
B00EI4V3X2|1.0|I bought these to replace my x12s and I have to say I was extremely dissatisfied. The volume is atrociously low. So low that it renders them useless. Searching,  I found out that Turtle Beach now, by design, hinders the volume output because of European law. I returned mine because they are worthless if you can't hear the faint footsteps of the enemy in multiplayer, or the reloading of a gun when they run out of ammo. I am apalled they charge that much for inferior quality. Until they manufacture an \\"American\\" version I am not paying for another pair of Turtle Beaches.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it but i wish there was redstone also i wish it had minecraft pc music also with there was emrilds and a nether b ut over all very good game.have fun

B00CLF80O0|5.0|what a great live album from a clissic rock n roll band.whitesnake seems to allways put something good out.what a great rock n roll band.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|It's a fun game with lots to do but I wish you could start the game over because I let my nephew play and he accidentally sold my cow and it cost $4200 2 buy a new one n it's going 2 take me a long time 2 produce enough 2 buy it without the use of milk products. So it would have been nice 2 just start over. Now I can't make any of the high paying produce like bread. Even after removing it from my kindle fire hd n from my cloud it still put me back where I left off when I reinstalled it.
B0054QS5IO|1.0|a very poor album.i thought it would be like omega conspicy.but its nothing like that.could have been a hell of a lot better.waist of time and money.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|NOT at all Free. What I did play of it was very cool and fun but in no time I was at the end of the free part and had to play to move on. It realy should be advertised as a trial and not free.
B000085RTX|5.0|great album.great band.if your in to dream theater.i think you will like this metal band.what a great singer and song wrighter.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a really good game but sometimes it gives bad calls when it shouldn't but all in all it is a great game

B002AWX6UM|4.0|I had to read this book for my geography class. It was a very interesting book. I'm in ninth grade btw.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This app is very fun but It is VERY slow. But its the best app ever it's just like grand theft auto. How ever this app says bad words you  can rob banks strip clubs but if your not allowed to see strippers you should not get this app but it's the best app in the WORLD.
B006RXPYXM|4.0|Well-acted, intriguing look into the royal family during the time of Princess Diana's death. Oh, how the Queen hated her.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|What an amazingly unique story this is. It will leave you breathless when you reach the epic conclusion. Well worth including in your library.
B008EKMB82|5.0|I loved this book because it has something to say, a lot to say about the human condition and mystery and people communicating through spirit and faith.  A complicated ploy handled clearly with beautiful writing
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Love the game I have most of the scribblenaut games and when I saw it I knew I just had to get it
B001DE29SS|5.0|Great movie. The acting is top-notch and it is a nice introduction to the genius of Charlie Chaplin. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best acting jobs and has a wonderful support cast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, I STARTED PLAYING ALONG WITH &quot;BUBBLE WITCH&quot;. I NOW FIND MYSELF PLAYING &quot;CANDY CRUSH&quot;, MORE THAN (BW).
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Like Lynne Olson's other books, this one illuminates a fascinating corner of history that deserves to be more familiar.  Be warned: if you are inclined to think of FDR as a visionary leader, this book is likely to cause you to see him in a different light.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game. Warning...it is addictive. Each level a little harder. I thought doom bubbles were awful, then got to fungus bubbles.......But the morph bubbles bite!  Then you get the levels with all 3. Very challenging.
B0013O123Q|1.0|If I could have gotten a refund I would have. This was a strange, odd movie.  We looked at 10 minutes an shut it off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love th  game I can find no flaws maybe the way to revive them with 20 tokens suck but otherwise it is an awesome game. I spend way to much time playing it when I could be studying it is so addictive
1400032717|5.0|Provides valuable insight of the possible perceptions of someone on the spectrum. I have loaned out two copies and now have none, but I don't mind because my hope is that they are continuing to educate folks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I stumbled upon this game and thought it would be fun but it was way above my expectations! It's a great strategizing game and very addicting! I recommend it to all.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Great movie with excellent special effects.  This is the best Superman so far of all of them.  This movie does a great job at telling the story of how Superman became who he is today.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's so cool this is one of their best games I'm only a tiger but I'm going to be a Megaladon<br /><br />I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|HE'S BAAAACK!!!! This CD is awesome! If you're an Eminem fan, it's a must! There honestly isn't a single track I skip on this CD. Really dig &#34;headlights&#34;, it shows a new side to him.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I didn't think they could keep up the story line again, but I was plesantly surprised. I really enjoyed Iron Man 3 just as much as the first 2. It had some unexpeced twists and turns.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fast paced and fun. Everything seems to work.  game does not hang. Can be played by kids or playful adults.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I did not like this one as much as I liked the first one, it just capture your attention like the first GI. Joe did. I also didn't like that they killed off one of the main characters from the from the first movie in the first 5 minutes.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I don't really like these kind of games but I like this one. The reason I DO like  this one is because I LOVE CATS!!!! :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)
B004AQR29C|4.0|I normaly don't watch this kind of movie but I watched it with my son and husband. I found it to be a good movie, it had humor mixed with action. I really enjoyedthis movie enough to find and watch expendables 2 and I liked that one as well.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Everytime I open it, it says Gameloft then it closes up. I cannot find a way to use this app
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is awesome the cars are mad fresh and the tracks in different places and the different types of ways to race like the gate drift and infection with all nitro
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read with riveting action and plots within plots.  Couldn't  put it down. Sure to be a must read.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|My kids couldn't watch it.  I don't know what else to say.  They finished it with a side of Legos and a health dose of rainbow looming.  I don't think they paid attention to much of it.  I recommend that you save your money.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another good one by John Grisham.  Excellent use of the characters from A Time to Kill in a story with an unusual twist and a fitting ending.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This way to eat is simple; effective; healthy and you will lose those extra pounds. Don't wait to start fasting intermittently, even on vacation. There's no time like the present. If you read the book, you are ready to start eating FAST - 2:5
0316055433|5.0|Wonderfully well written book by Tartt. Definitely one of the best reads I've had in the past few years. Dickensian is thrown around quite a bit when talking about this book, not surprisingly so, Tartt weaves an intricate web of coincidental based events that tie in perfectly with the heavy emotion-laced prose.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Provocative and well researched. If you can set aside religious bias, it is as likely an explanation as we will ever have on the origins of Christianity.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My 9yr old loves this game, he's always using my Kindle to play it.  I haven't played it yet but he said it was good.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Very impressed with this album considering Em's last couple of albums were not so great in my opinion. Lots of throwback songs that he sampled and made them his own. Hopefully people listening can respect the sampled songs tracks, and background producers involved and the influences Em has and made tributes to. This really is a sequel CD to many songs, not just on MMLP but on classic songs and references to previous works. Em has surely grown as an artist and is truly one of the greatest lyracist, wordsmith, rapper.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I watched this with my son who loves giant monster movies like Godzilla.<br /><br />This was so bad that my son asked how much longer it was going to take to get to the end.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, why didn't they use the sword earlier since it was their best weapon?<br /><br />How is a giant robot analog? When you dump cooling from a nuclear reactor how come the thing does not melt down? If you do have a nuclear reactor, how do you leak fuel?<br /><br />Worst movie I have seen since Cloverfield.<br /><br />No plot that I could see - only mindless cliche with the tough girl, the grizzled veteran, the hot shot pilot...<br /><br />Do not waste your time.
B000G6R7B8|3.0|I've had several &#34;Eco&#34; watches from Citizen and loved them all. This was supposed to work the same but it would stop running over night. This was after a full day out in the sun light. I returned it for a refund.
B000JCSBU0|4.0|Harrowing view of addiction, and the people it affects. Wanted to look away sometimes, but couldn't. Performances by all the actors were amazing.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. There's so many options, so many variables that if you played differently you couod play for months without ever playing the same game twice. Plus with all the updates (updates that DON'T delete prior game data) as long as they're willing to update, you'll have essentially ulimited game time in one of the best apps I have ever seen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the game is addictive and relaxing.  a real enjoyment to play.  I joined facebook just to play this game.  WOW
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun. I play it all the time. If anything it's too addicting. Also don't pay for lives.
B00499DRJO|5.0|Theta healing transforms life's.  Clearing out old belief patterns and implementing new. A must read for all interested in co creating more fulfilling life experiences with joy ease and  grace
B00BSB2AE4|2.0|Moderately funny but not laugh-out- loud funny. I had a hard time reading it without getting bored.  I don't think I would buy anything from this author again.
1594487154|3.0|There aren't really any new ideas in the book.  Pink just presents old ideas in a new way.  It was an interesting read, but it was obnoxiously long.  I had to read it for a class in grad school and do a presentation over it.  It felt like the author just wanted to put as many ideas as he could fit into one book.<br /><br />The book reads about like a research paper.  The author makes one point and then spends the next 2 pages giving a myriad of examples when one example would have sufficed.  The list of references in the back is astoundingly long.  The book does have some interesting concepts, but it was very tedious in explaining them.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Fairly accurate, acting and writing exceptional Tombstone is very entertaining but more hollywood than true west Quaid is excellent as Doc.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|King is trying to blend with The Shining, but fails to accomplish  his effort.  I am an avid King reader, and am a little disappointed with Doctor Sleep.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! ive always wanted a pet horse! Now it's like I actually have one!!!!! I get to take care of a horse like I would normally! My dream came true!
B008MM9630|5.0|I,like it but it tells you to buy dumb crystals and I don't even want to I mean it's just a little game.
B0036TGT2A|4.0|This was a present for my girlfriend who loved this movie as a child. I was happy it showed up in time for me to give it to her as a birthday gift.... All in all I was pleased with the service and she loved the gift. What more could you ask for!
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Loved it.  Eva Green is mesmerizing.  And so is Daniel Craig.  This one packs a punch.  007 needed an update.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|My grandkids love to play this! Especially the boys.....they feel like they are really hunting.They fight over whose going to play first.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I enjoy these sorts of games so I am really happy with the purchase of this one. It is the short,free version of the game but it is a lot of fun . One review said you could get the full version by signing up cor a newsletter but I don't know about that right now. I will probably buy the full version eventually because I do enjoy this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Keeps me occupied when I'm bored! Just wish we could get more lives. Crush on peeps!
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Rankin describes very well how  the society is  today, and Rebus is a person that you just have to love. The story is well written and you get carried away when you read it.
1608955702|5.0|Superb.  Understanding light is key in growing as a photographer.  Not amount of gear will take you from being good to being great but knowing light will.  This book takes you down that road.<br /><br />Well crafted book and something that you will refer back to.<br /><br />Thank you Neil
B00BU1DH1M|4.0|I liked this book very much, but somehow it fell short of what I expected. Rebus is, as always, a great character, but Fox seemed pale  by comparison. I think this book doesn't do him justice, and the interaction was less explosive than it could have been. Still, a very entertaining book.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|The guided meditations and choice of times as well as background ambient sound makes this app easy to use and a marvelous help in calming oneself down anytime in any place
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game it is fun and I love all the different puzzles and all the different tasks that are available.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Before the update, it was 5 stars and now it's just ehh. The game won't connect to fb anymore so trading is not able to be done. If they connect it back, it will change to 5 stars again.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|So well done and so entertaining.  Great humor!  Great references to bygone Doctors! Great heart!  Great new plot direction in the end!  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00EKTCQCC|1.0|The application did not meet my expectations!  I was mislead thinking the entire body would be displayed only to find out that I must pay additional $30.00.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun, entertaining, helps out by giving you something to do while waiting un patiently for someone or even just to enjoy at any place or time to get time to pass by.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Good Arcade Fire album.  This is a solid effort following Suburbs (and I expect many nominations to follow).  There is a few lulls in the album that kept me from giving it five stars, mainly the first few songs of the second part of the album.  But there are some really standout tracks, mainly \\"Reflektor\\", \\"Afterlife\\" and \\"You Already Know\\".  Really a great album for Arcade Fire fans, or just anybody that is interested in music at all.
0553582011|5.0|Martin has done it again!  This book is as good or better than all the others in the series...I hated for it to end.
B006WMILQU|5.0|Very well done.  A  real study in relationships with no sappy romaticism.  Such a wonderfully strong female lead!  Highly recommended for females of all ages.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Try game now! You get tokens, bananas,  costumes to ware, despicable actions, and BAD GUY BATTLES. You fight Vector, El Macho, and someone brand new named Meena. Have fun playing!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Ok adaptation.  Really disliked the shaky camera work in the beginning…cheap tool to generate agitation in the perception of the audience.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I found this game beautiful and entertaining. It is Mahjong at its best. Easy through challenging, it keeps the synapses firing.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have to say that George RR Martin did a simply amazing job at making the impossible seem entirely plausible.  Bloody Islands made me believe in the power of medicine men, and Dance with Dragons makes me believe in the power to bring dragons to life.  Excellent writing and story.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Greatest Christmas movie ever.  What Christmas is really like for most Americans.  Second best Vacation movie behind the original one.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Wonderful! An adult Harry Potter - if you like fantasy, this is one of the most interesting and looking forward to the final sequel.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Enjoyed this game from the very beginning. It's fun and challenging. Will play this game again. Fun,fun,fun. Did I mention fun?
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this story! Once I started I had to keep going. It was very inspiring to read and can't wait to read more of her books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|the cards are marked a little weirdly but spider is always fun to play and pass the time in dr office or while waiting for friends at restaurants
0062287338|5.0|A new adventure into the future which is believeable and yet surprising.  She keeps you trying to figure out how will they make it out alive, or do they!
140006922X|4.0|A very exciting read, but a little short on scholarship and resources.  Intriguing, reads more like a literary work than a scholarly one.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I read this book in less than a day. I look forward to the next one by these great authors!
B0073QNIH6|4.0|this is very realistic and finely crafted.  stands up well.  my only complaints are that the teeth are tiny and the toy is smaller than I expected.
B00F35BV64|3.0|When I first watched Star Trek, the J.J. Abrams reboot, I wasn’t sure if I liked it. The action was action like, and the effects were pretty stunning, and everything looked pretty cool, but I was troubled by the story and the characters. I kept thinking, that is not how it happened and Kirk doesn’t act like that. Of course, I was unaware of the alternate time line. When that was made clear I started to accept the film a little more. In the end I decided it was ok and when I found a copy, used, for five dollars, I bought it. However, I still had lingering doubts as to this film really being apart of the Star Trek lineage. It seemed too different from the vision of that Roddenberry gave the world.<br /><br /> Then Star Trek: Into Darkness came out. I thought that I would see it in movie theaters, because I have not seen a Star Trek film in a theater since The Search for Spock. However, I began to see the trailers for the film, and I was not impressed. I saw an underwear clad Dr. Marcus. I saw Spock being argumentative with Kirk and Uhura. I saw a very white Khan. I saw a womanizing Kirk, womanizing to the Beastie Boys. I saw enough that I decided I would not spend the money to see it in the theaters. I would wait and rent it through Netflix, so I didn’t pay any extra money to see it. I am glad I waited.<br /><br /> When it finally was available to me, for it had a very long wait, I sat down to watch it with an open mind. I really wanted to like this film. I don’t want Star Trek disappearing. I want the franchise to continue on and grow. I had high hopes with the last film that this would be the beginning of a new generation, if you will, of Star Trek fans and projects that would keep the franchise alive and well and Roddenberry’s vision clear. Star Trek: Into Darkness dashed those hopes against Hollywood’s rock solid foundation of sexist, macho, adolescent, white washing, token minority, marketing philosophy.<br /><br /> I can’t say that there was any major flaw in the film that went against the Star Trek pantheon. Though I was bothered by the similarity of the Star Fleet dress uniforms to that of the Imperial uniforms from Star Wars. Can Abrams not keep his movies straights? Also, what the hell did he do to the Klingons? When did they hide their faces from battle? When did they become such push overs? And the phasers, where are they? Everyone is using projectile weapons, even the starships are spitting out colored bullets. So, yes, there were major stylistic flaws.<br /><br /> Uniforms and Klingons aside, what happened in the film were things that happened in other Star Trek films and the various TV shows. However, it was how this film did those things that makes the difference. It is like the difference between dancing and dancing with class. Kirk does have a way with woman, and woman dressed provocatively have been a staple of Star Trek. However, the old Kirk didn’t get jiggy with it to the Beastie Boys with two women at the same time, not classy. The old Kirk liked his women, but one at a time and they were special to him. The provocatively dressed women, were just that, provocatively dressed, not in their underwear or naked. The old Kirk also had restraint, he didn’t act like a frat boy, the way the new Kirk does. The new Kirk has no self control, just acts on impulse at warp factor nine. The old Kirk always showed intelligence and thought, before taking any action.<br /><br /> Spock always defended his logic, but never argued it. He never bickered, he did not allow himself to be drawn into petty squabbles. The new Spock plays out like a tight wad who always has to have things his own way, a Sheldon Cooper with pointy ears. The old Spock only lost his cool under extreme circumstances, pon farr, or freaky plants. Now, you might say the death of Kirk would be a pretty extreme circumstance, but I say that Spock is still Vulcan, alternate time line or not. The new Spock is suicidal, worrisome, and has anger management issues, at least for a Vulcan. In short he is a basket case who makes a poor poster child for logic and reason.<br /><br /> As for the rest of the crew; Sulu is barely explored as a character, he quickly becomes a token minority with a two dimensional structure and has little to do with story, unlike all the other films. The old Scotty was a knowledgable cool headed engineer, who controlled his area of the ship with a steady hand and only gave the captain overly cautious estimates. The new one is a spaz. He does nothing be freak out and run from one place to another, while never shutting his mouth. Abrams has turned Scotty into the JarJar Binks of the Star Trek universe. The old Uhura was a forthright woman, who played her part in the missions. She was a professional, who didn’t allow herself to become distracted by the dangers that threaten the ship and crew. If she had something to say she would say it. The new one is another token minority fleshed out just to add to Spock’s personality, rather then having one of her own. She becomes overly emotional over Spock, only appears or reacts to anything in relation to Spock. Also, Dr. Marcus is reduced to eye candy for adolescent boys who acts somewhat childish, especially when her father shows up. Daddy, she calls him daddy. Also, why is the white woman the only who gets striped down? The new bones if the closest to the old Bones, however the new Bones, like everything else, is over the top. The genuine worrywart personality of Dr. McCoy form the 60’s was transformed into a hypochondriac Rodney Dangerfield.<br /><br /> Let me talk about Khan for a moment. Khan Noonien Singh, the name alone should suggest that this person is of Indian decent. Ricardo Montalban, who originally played Khan, while not Indian, was Mexican at least. He was closer to the appearance of what one would think of when thinking of Khan. While Benedict Cumberbatch, a great actor, is a pasty white Englishman. I could not help but think that this was a white wash. When Montalban was selected to play Khan it was for a small TV show back in the 60’s, so the pool of Indians to play the roll was most likely non-existent. In today’s world, finding an actor, who is Indian, to play an Indian, shouldn’t be all that hard. Also, the battle of wits that the old Kirk and Khan engaged in was turned into an ugly brute force cage match by Abrams. So, you mean to tell me that the best a superhuman with a super brain can come up with is punching and kicking? No wonder it took him so long to escape from Admiral Marcus. Again, taking away that level of intelligence and class from the dance.<br /><br /> That leads me to the last aspect I wish to touch upon, there is no intelligence in these films of Abrams. Star Trek has always been marked with a certain level of intelligence and class, even when there was action. Abrams has taken away all the intelligence, there is now no difference between these Star Trek films and other Hollywood muscle movies with womanizing men and half dressed overly sexualized women. In conclusion, I am not happy with Abrams’s vision of Star Trek. This is not the Trek I knew and loved and he has not taken it in a positive direction in my opinion. I can liken it to a bad impression. Imagine someone performing an impression of a famous person. While they say all the right things, they say them all the wrong way. That is what it was like watching the J.J. Abrams remakes. A really bad impression from someone who hasn’t studied their subject.<br /><br /> Perhaps it is time for the fans to take it from here and make Youtube shows of Trek if the big companies refuse to bring it back to TV? I have started watching the progress of a production called Star Trek: Renegades, which is using the talents of Walter Koenig, Tim Russ, Robert Picardo, Gary Graham, Manu Intiraymi. I believe they are trying to get CBS to pick it up and be the company to bring Star Trek back to the small screen. I alreadynagement issues, at least for a Vulcan. In short he is a basket case who makes a poor poster child for logic and reason.<br /><br /> As for the rest of the crew; Sulu is barely explored as a character, he quickly becomes a token minority with a two dimensional structure and has little to do with story, unlike all the other films. The old Scotty was a knowledgable cool headed engineer, who controlled his area of the ship with a steady hand and only gave the captain overly cautious estimates. The new one is a spaz. He does nothing be freak out and run from one place to another, while never shutting his mouth. Abrams has turned Scotty into the JarJar Binks of the Star Trek universe. The old Uhura was a forthright woman, who played her part in the missions. She was a professional, who didn’t allow herself to become distracted by the dangers that threaten the ship and crew. If she had something to say she would say it. The new one is another token minority fleshed out just to add to Spock’s personality, rather then having one of her own. She becomes overly emotional over Spock, only appears or reacts to anything in relation to Spock. Also, Dr. Marcus is reduced to eye candy for adolescent boys who acts somewhat childish, especially when her father shows up. Daddy, she calls him daddy. Also, why is the white woman the only who gets striped down? The new bones if the closest to the old Bones, however the new Bones, like everything else, is over the top. The genuine worrywart personality of Dr. McCoy form the 60’s was transformed into a hypochondriac Rodney Dangerfield.<br /><br /> Let me talk about Khan for a moment. Khan Noonien Singh, the name alone should suggest that this person is of Indian decent. Ricardo Montalban, who originally played Khan, while not Indian, was Mexican at least. He was closer to the appearance of what one would think of when thinking of Khan. While Benedict Cumberbatch, a great actor, is a pasty white Englishman. I could not help but thinkthat this was a white wash. When Montalban was selected to play Khan it was for a small TV show back in the 60’s, so the pool of Indians to play the roll was most likely non-existent. In today’s world, finding an actor, who is Indian, to play an Indian, shouldn’t be all that hard. Also, the battle of wits that the old Kirk and Khan engaged in was turned into an ugly brute force cage match by Abrams. So, you mean to tell me that the best a superhuman with a super brain can come up with is punching and kicking? No wonder it took him so long to escape from Admiral Marcus. Again, taking away that level of intelligence and class from the dance.<br /><br /> That leads me to the last aspect I wish to touch upon, there is no intelligence in these films of Abrams. Star Trek has always been marked with a certain level of intelligence and class, even when there was action. Abrams has taken away all the intelligence, there is now no difference between these Star Trek films and other Hollywood muscle movies with womanizing men and half dressed overly sexualized women. In conclusion, I am not happy with Abrams’s vision of Star Trek. This is not the Trek I knew and loved and he has not taken it in a positive direction in my opinion. I can liken it to a bad impression. Imagine someone performing an impression of a famous person. While they say all the right things, they say them all the wrong way. That is what it was like watching the J.J. Abrams remakes. A really bad impression from someone who hasn’t studied their subject.<br /><br /> Perhaps it is time for the fans to take it from here and make Youtube shows of Trek if the big companies refuse to bring it back to TV? I have started watching the progress of a production called Star Trek: Renegades, which is using the talents of Walter Koenig, Tim Russ, Robert Picardo, Gary Graham, Manu Intiraymi. I believe they are trying to get CBS to pick it up and be the company to bring Star Trek back to the small screen. I alreadyfeel that this will be closer to the Trek spirit than Abrams can ever get.

B00ENBTI8C|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I was mad about the ending, but it's an amazing series it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Betrayal, Sex, Violence the story line is great and easy to follow.
0545265355|5.0|I thought the books forming the trilogy were excellent and the author deserves congratulations on being able to complete the three books in the &#34;first person&#34;, always a difficult task but handled beautifully in this instance. All of the characters were brought to light magnificently and I cannot wait to see the second movie. I bought the books based on my seeing the first movie and the comments expressed by the emminent actors reflected the characterisations as illustrated in the three books. I heartily recommend the trilogy to all - they will not be disappointed.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Another  Great Scarpetta book.  The murder mystery along with the  intrigue with  Benton made this a worthwhile read and I recommend it highly.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Worth the freeness. Buy it. Now. What are you waiting for. I said now. It's the best dungeon crawler for the kindle.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Without a doubt, the best medical drama ever on television, or even on film.  It skillfully combines precision and unusual diagnostic medicine with the Human Equation.  Other medical “shows” typically neglect the medical aspect, and focus on the soap opera love interests of the hospital staff; but House delivers Medical School level academics, along with the drama seen in only the best of literature - the unexpected, realistic, and non-linear events we all have in our lives, rather than the mundane writing of hacks who are pandering to what the TV executives think will sell the products of their advertisers.  House is tantamount to The Sopranos, in its approach and methodology, and the true swings from the gritty to anguish and from transient humor back to despair, rarely - if ever - seen in the media, yet ever present in the daily reality of life.  House makes the so-called “Reality Shows” look stupider and more contrived than they actually are.  House hinges somewhere between a documentary and a true masterpiece of the art of film.  This is not a “must see,’ or a “summer blockbuster,” but a treasure that will reside in the archives of the consciousness of all who embrace it.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Those game is very awesome ! Ambush is so strong! Although Zeus is<br />Very expensive, you can hack or wait until black friday
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Very well done, but the unrated version is not as enjoyable as the theatrical version so think twice about spending money to get both in the same package.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun.  It combines puzzles with hidden objects.  I would like to see more levels and more complicated solutions.
B00G5G7FL0|5.0|Took my 10 year old daughter to see Frozen last night...<br />We were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen & our love for animated movies...<br /><br />This movie will NOT disappoint you!

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I got tired of playing the full game on Facebook a long time ago bit decided I would give it a try on my kindle.  So far I am enjoying it better, harvest times are somewhat shorter and Italy as demanding of my time as the Facebook version, which I like.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love working to destroy the world. Great to play when you don't feel well. Highly recommend especially for the price.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Author creates believeable characters and keeps the story moving. Several twists and turns during that trial makes the verdict hard to predict
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It's challenging but not impossible. Addicting and awesome graphics with great music. I would recommend this app with out hesitation.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I can't believe she killed her. So disappointed. It was a good read, but lets change the ending!! Boo Veronica!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish it had more levels.  Challenging and fun.  Husband and I have races to see who finishes first....  don't tell him I'm smarter.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love this series!  It is truly disturbing in a visceral sense. Watch with caution if you are easily frightened!  Highly recomended.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Beautifully realized storytelling. A poetic tale of the intensity of family bonds.<br />An almost a fairy tale rooted in grinding reality
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is a great game to use when nothing to do I recommend it to others<br />LETS GO MINIONS !!!!!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The boy's time in Las Vegas was too gruesome and upsetting for so many words, but the disturbing guy became a good friend.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I have played plenty of talking friends, but this is my favorite! Tom is sooo cute and I agree with everyone else that says Tom is adorable. Litterly I check every ten minutes to see if he's alright. Right now my Tommy I named Oreo is a level 7 preschooler. I've been playing tons and got 3,000 coins, plus a cutesy living space.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Joss Whedon finally gets to shine. this show rocks. its like what would have happened if buffy of firefly didn't end. character interaction is awesome, story is awesome, set pieces are awesome. i really hope this show does not get cancelled.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Thanks to Tim Curry's malevolent Pennywise, those teeth, that laugh and maniacal eyes, I am definitely afraid of clowns! This is a movie about a bunch of misfit kids bonding together to fight an ancient evil.  Yes, the end &#34;monster&#34; was a bit hokey but still worth the watch,
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Enjoy playing this game on the kindle. Hope to try the other games. Relaxing and entertaining. Love playing this game on my kindle.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|I know the later Harry Potter movies are much deeper and have stronger story lines.  But this one is my favorite Why?  Because it has the wonder
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great, easy read. And free with the lending library on my kindle! Can't wait to the read the rest of these.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|5 STARS on all episodes from the beginning to the end :(<br />SG-1 has to be the only FIVE STAR TV series ever produced (in my opinion)<br />Every episode is directed as 'good' as any movie and generally even 'better' then most<br />The best episodes are of course with Richard Dean Anderson (Col. Jack O'Neill) '6 Star Rating'<br />The episodes that followed the 'less seen' Gen. O'Neill were also excellent but just lacking the '6 Star' rating the 'O'Neill' episodes had. All-in-all still the BEST action/adventure, Sci-Fi/Fantasy ever made for TV.<br />Well made, a lot of 'thought' went into each episode, great 'bad guys', ingenious. The Hi-Tech 'bugs' have to be the most logically thought out villains ever thought of, very clever and if you think about it... probable (? ya think?).<br />It literally 'shot down' Star Trek' episodes by a ling shot (I still watch Star Trek which remains one of my favorite TV eps. even though they may be number 'two' they still hold my interest.<br />DAG
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game rocks. Plus its not just deer. It's only a 4.5 cause of the graphics, they could be better. Also tobuscus forces a friend to play so watch that for a little more recommend this to anyone over 5, so they would understand how to play! Get it now!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've played candy crush on my phone all the time and finally they have the game for kindle fore when I found out I was so happy and I downloaded it immediately.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Based God Peter Jackson does it again, and again, and again. The EE is SO worth it; the scenes cut from the theatrical release but included here are by turns hilarious and heart-rending.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is definitely a challenging game! But morbidly fun, a race to the death. I recommend it to anyone that wants to make quick decisions on the direction to take to balance transmitting a disease vs slowing cure efforts. It can change direction quickly. Worth it.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Okay where do we begin! This was my favorite series I've ever read. The final book, Sentinel was the perfect end to a perfect series.<br />The plot was great and very suspenseful. It keeps you turning the pages until your finished. I cried when it was over even though it had a great ending for both Alex and Aiden! If you enjoyed the beginning books of the covenant series, this one will have you crying and laughing until the end!! All thanks to my favorite author, Jennifer L Armentrout!&#60;3 also I highly recommend her lux series which is frustratingly great books!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because it's the best book I have read in a long time. I can picture what Katniss and Peeta talking and falling in love for real. I love the way it's written for that reason.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a very good game and involves a lot of thinking. It is, however, very difficult. If you are looking for a puzzle to waste your time away, then this game is for you!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed is collection of stories whose characters center around a single piece of property in a rural Afghan village. A walk-on character in one story becomes the protagonist in the next. These stories drew me in and kept me turning pages. A good book both entertains and educates. This one teaches us about people in war-torn Afghanistan. The characters are balanced, each having good and bad sides. Afghans are not much different from us in their feelings, desires, and interactions with others. I highly recommend this novel.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|The music is perfection, but it has lost a little something. A good listen regardless of where you place it in your rating of the Dream Theater catalog.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Being an ancient idler, it's good to keep the brain going when one can. I like Spider, even though I only play the first level.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written!  Reads like poetry... his command of descriptive phrases is wonderful.  The story was compelling and offered great insight into the human condition.  I couldn't put it down!
1465414444|5.0|Having played all the versions of warcraft I have to say this is an amazing book. Every page is full color with amazing pictures and well thought out captions for everything.<br /><br />The book is 10 1/4” by 12 1/4” with a dust jacket and glossy thick pages, weighing a few pounds easily and at 200 pages this is a coffee table book that will probably have even non-wow’ers looking through it.<br /><br />The authors take you through the history of Azeroth and all of the people and places involved. I even learned a few things in it I didn’t know about.<br /><br />I liked that they have bios on all the main characters and what happened to them. (and the main pictures of them are incredible!)<br /><br />I also like that the major cities have map locations and city maps along with the things you will find there, like Ironforge with Tinkertown and the Deeprun Tram.<br /><br />I think the only thing I miss is that they couldn’t/didn’t do the history of all the areas like creepiness of Duskwood or the story behind the tainting of Felwood, things like that, but I don’t hold it against the book.<br /><br />If you have someone who loves WOW and you don’t know what to get them for a gift… get them this book. They will LOVE IT! If you play it, you will love it.<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />Well made, all in color, high quality, it really is the ultimate visual guide to Warcraft. Easily worth the price.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book is just as wonderful as everyone says. I was expecting a much simpler &#34;kids&#34; story but Wonder is actually a very well written and unique book that features the point of view of several different characters. The author really does a great job of nailing that unique and awkward time of being a fifth grader.  This made me remember all of my own challenges of middle school just like it was yesterday.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Surprisingly awesome family movie! Clean family entertainment. Love Amazon videos because you go straight to the movie without having to skip through trailers.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|This was a feel-good movie based on a book of the same name. The screen writers took a fair amount of creative license. Most of the changes from reality were fun and worked well for the format. If you liked the movie or the premise, you probably like the book even better. One inexplicable change made in the movie was that everyone's totals were slightly inflated from reality. And of course it had the obligatory Hollywood ending.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|About 2 years ago Terraria was released on steam. I loved it and it was my favorite game and still is to this day. 505 Games made a great port for mobile devices so now you can play on the go. Many compare it to Minecraft however this game is much much larger in almost all aspects. It took what was good about Minecraft and multiplied it 20 times over in a SNES-style 2D game. The only bad aspect of the whole game is it's worlds are always small, but this is expected as the mobile devices are outshined by computers in almost every aspect. This is one outstanding game.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|This special comes through in A+ fashion for all Dr. Who fans. It is a fun watch and everyone involved in it did a great job.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|One thing that I didn't see mentioned in other reviews comparing the RayOVac to this Lighting Ever lantern is the color of the LED light. This light is the whiter LED light and I estimate about 5000K. The RayOVac is more yellow and I estimate is about 2700K. I like the whiter light best. If I were to buy another LED lantern it would be this one.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Terrible.  Was truly disappointed and I liked the first two.  Much too serious and not very funny.  It could have been really good but I think hollywood writers are getting lazy.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Best Writing I have seen in a long time-had great plot and kept your attention from early episodes right to the end
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is soo addicting. I can play this for ten hours straight its that good *you probably shouldn't play it for ten hours straight because its bad for you and may result in loss of family and friends*
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|An exciting &#34;who done it&#34; with some great plot twists and some cerebral moments that will leave you scratching your head. Loved it, it was fun and a great story.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|I was skeptical when I purchased this album, but trusted that James Murphy would not disappoint me. I like the Arcade Fire and their sound but have never been completely in awe of their brilliance. I still don't really understand their hype, but this is a great album.
B005LAII44|3.0|G.I. JOE was one of my favorite comic books and cartoon shows back in the 1980's! So, I now am used to the fact that whenever Hollywood reaches back for a childhood favorite, they usually get it half right and mess up the rest.<br /><br />Now what did they got right for this movie?...SNAKE-EYES vs. STORM-SHADOW! For just the scenes of these two rival ninja brothers going at each other is worth taking a look at this film!<br /><br />However, what did this G.I. JOE movie get wrong?..In ten words....\\"THE ROCK being the new leader of the G.I. JOES\\"!<br /><br />Dwayne Johnson, the former WWE wrestling star, does an somewhat okay job playing ROADBLOCK, I guess. Yet, here's the main problem: ROADBLOCK  was a mid-tier G.I. JOE character. He was never ever in charge of the whole the G.I. JOE TEAM! ROADBLOCK, in the comics and in the classic '80's cartoon, was just an anti-convoy and anti-tank specialist! A cool character to blow stuff up and to buy you some time for your main offensive attack, but he wasn't nowhere to even being close to the field leader that DUKE was!<br /><br />Killing off  DUKE, the real field leader of the G.I. JOE team, is like killing off CYCLOPS and PROF. XAVIER so that WOLVERINE, an extremely talented brawler but not a great strategist, can be the new leader of the X-MEN. It's like killing off OPTIMUS PRIME so that BUMBLE BEE can be the new leader of THE TRANSFORMERS! It's like killing off CAPT. AMERICA so that THE HULK can be the new leader of THE AVENGERS!..It's very lame! Very lame, indeed!<br /><br />I don't know. This movie feels like \\"THE ROCK\\" is being shoved down my throat as \\"the next movie action hero\\"! I groan whenever he's on the screen and I look at my watch to see what time it is. It's a shame, too, because I'm a big wrestling fan who loved \\"THE ROCK\\" in the ring. I think that's where he should be.<br /><br />If \\"THE ROCK\\" (Dwayne Johnson) is the lead in the next G.I. JOE movie and they don't bring back DUKE or SCARLET, I'm jut going tohave to dishonorably discharge G.I. JOE for lameness and a senseless waste of the movie studios' money in the face of really hard economic times, and  I am hereby restricting G.I. JOE from having any more active duty within the borders of my DVD collection!<br /><br />RECRUITS!...DIS-MISSED!....
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This movie could have been about 20-25 minutes shorter with less action. Overall, an entertaining watch and much better than Superman Returns.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book takes one of the most powerful words in the universe &#34;COMPOUND&#34; and breaks it down to where anyone can relate. I love the examples and there is no wonder why Darren Hardy is the Big Boss Man for Success Magazine... &#34;SUCCESS&#34; duh
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a very very funny movie, Probably the best secret agent type movie I have liked since the Roger Moore 007 run. Part 2 is even better
B0041OT9W6|4.0|Really liked this version. The book is a must  read for all.  The download on kindle was super easy. Enjoy
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|So so good.  Pet Shop Boys have gone back to their electronic roots (did they ever leave these roots?)  Standouts -  Axis, Fluorescent (so good), Thursday (seriously sounds like it was written in the 80s' again....so so good).
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|An amazing young man. I enjoyed the book cover to cover. Mr. Kyle will be truly missed by family and friends.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|This album is so good!  It's currently $1.99 to download during Amazon's black Friday deals, how could you possibly go wrong!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|An addicting waste of time. Must be good right? I'm still just starting but have spent the last few days getting through the levels. My kids love to watch and can't wait til their turn... &#34;after I pass this level!&#34;
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was a bit difficult to read in the beginning, it has a very slow start.  But once it grabs you, you can't put it down!  It's an amazing story, heartbreaking & hopeful all at once!
B00479SVBU|2.0|I tried it, several different ways and channels, I guess if you are desperate it would be acceptable, but it doesn't seems to work very well, I'd guess in a less crowded radio band it might work better. For me in Albuquerque, NM it is pretty much useless, Also too many things you have to do to get it in position, It was like assembling a lego set
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Great Series - like when the boys don't strictly follow the arch stories - the weird, frightening and unusual are usually the most fun.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I &lt;3 this game!! If you are looking for a challenging racing game this is PERFECT....<br />Even if you just want to have fun u should get this app.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|Great movie
B00E7SID9G|3.0|I accept the distinction that the author makes regarding &#34;Jesus the person&#34; and Jesus Christ, but it's hard to disregard the view that the Church feeds you of Jesus Christ. I found it a well structured book and presents the arguments well.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Still unable to get it working, the instructions are not that good nor easy to follow. How many more words do you want?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book, like every Grisham book, I enjoyed it very much.  A lot of suspense. His describing people and the area, it makes you feel you are there.
B00009YOQW|5.0|well made toy! My son is tough on toys and this one is holding up like a charm. Love it
B00BJ7G1VK|4.0|I needed a book to review for my French class.  This one inspired and entertained me.  The photos included (not only the ones of the recipes) were a very nice touch.  Let's hope my French teacher enjoys my review as much as I enjoyed this book! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome<br />Because it is veary fun i wont evert one to play it because it is sooooo fun lots of peaple play it
B007R11DKQ|3.0|I wish that movies intended for the family and tween/youths audiences could be free of the promotion of extra-marital sexuality, whether gay or straight. From DeNiro's portrayal of a confused homosexual pirate to the overnight stay between the two leads, neither adds a great deal of extra comedy or romance to the film. In fact, I find DeNiro's portrayal missing its mark and the muscial score has to up its dramatic effect to let the audience know its supposed to be funny.  Now, I do think they played these story-lines rather safe but as a mom I wonder if it should be shown to my kids. Personally, I find Princess Bride had a much more believable love connection and yet there was no implied &#34;relations&#34; to my recollection.  That being said, it is a whole lot cleaner than a LOT of other films and cartoons.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Episode 25 is incredibly well-written and is one of my all-time favorites. &#34;Live now--make now the most precious time--now will never come again!&#34; I used this at a toast at my daughter's wedding recently. Everyone should watch this episode!
B005UG53NS|4.0|Of course I LOVE Harry Potter and could watch HP marathons all day, every day. However! I am frustrated they split this film into two parts. It is definitely not short of drama and excitement but unless you watch PT 1 immediately beforehand, this one lacks a good build up. Even compared to Part One, which really did feel like a complete story.  And the end, with the Star Wars&#34;esk&#34; light saber effects it all just gets rather boring and unoriginal.  I think too that they should have left the final scenes under the cloak of darkness rather than morning dawn. It also added to its anti-climatic disappointment.
B00FN811SY|5.0|So helpful with alot of useful information to help understand bible terms. Awesome App I am very Happy I downloaded it.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I wish I could say I figured it out from the start.  Actually the ending was a bit of a surprise.  However, that did not make up for the linear plot line and flat characters.  In general, I really like Sanderson's work.  He builds new and interesting worlds.  But I have not been really impressed lately.  And this story felt like he just churned it out without any effort.  I did slam through it to find out the ending, but i did not have a desire to savory it.  And perhaps more telling, I am also really on fence about buying a sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good for the brain.  Makes you think, but simple enough so you can do while watching TV .  Strongly recommend for all ages
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a great read.  I got it to read in anticipation of seeing the movie.  However, I enjoyed the book by itself and will read the sequels.  The characters are interesting and the premise of the story is quite interesting in and of itself.  I would not hesitate to read to or with a middle school child.  I think it would provide good reading at that level.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many great recipes, ideas.  Great to have an app that is so user friendly and fun.  Definitely a must have
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fun, fun, fun.  Read in anticipation of the movie and found it to be much more engaging and entertaining.  The protagonist is believable and meets all the requirements for a good book.
B00F2362IE|5.0|I love this game I have on my ipod my iphone. it is just amaze u should soooooo get it you would love
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|great puzzle game but I finished it in 2 days....wish it was longer or you could purchase an expansion pack
B00FRN2QZM|4.0|Still good, shows progression, very much worth the purchase. Of course nothing is going to sound like Black Sails in the Sunset or Answer that an Stay Fashionable, and to be honest I'd be a little disappointed when bands hold onto the same sound for so long. The &#34;Black Sails..&#34;, All Hollows EP and &#34;Answer That...&#34; had their time as did Sing the Sorrow and Decemberunderground. These lads took some crap from others because it was a separt from the &#34;old&#34; or &#34;classic&#34; sound of AFI. I'm of the opinion that bands really start to suck when they do the same stuff over and over and over. I mean, look at Nickelback and Staind, enough said.<br /><br />Separate matter, Amazon cloud was awful for this download, had to retry downloading 10+ times before it finally downloaded and even then I had to download one track at a time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Incredible work by one of America's most talented and prolific writers of fiction. Not the usual gore and horror from Mr. King but a thoughtful and heart rending interplay of characters, both good and bad.  The sci-fi aspect takes a back seat to the relationships between characters. Dialogue flows smoothly and naturally. This book touched me emotionally like nothing has in awhile.  I can't wait for the movie.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I really really really love this album! I do have admit that there is a few songs that  skipped. Overall, this album is an EDM (Electronic Dance Music) from the begin to the end.
0061537969|5.0|I bought this book out of curiosity. I simply loved it ! I strongly recommend it. Tons of wisdom from this loyal and trusted 4-legged companion.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Not a very good movie-I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did. The acting is good
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Okay, lets get to the first problem I'm upset with.<br />Tris's death. She died. I didn't WANT her to die, she was strong, confident, and a great character. But she needed a better death. Something poetic, something everyone could live with. Like her killing David, right before her and Tobias crumple under the death serum because he wasn't stupid enough to not go with her, and have her back. Or something where she takes a stand and fights for her life instead of accepting her death leaving behind everyone who acted so our of character to have her acceptance or forgiveness or her love. I think that would have made the book better.Not something to stop the ache of the rest of the book sucking in character development, plotline, and just a generally unworthy ending to a phenomenal series.<br />The second problem<br />Tobias. He was a whiny little twit in this book. &#34;Oh wah, wah, wah. My mommy is a control freak, my daddy didn't die, and my girlfriend hates me because of my genes, not how I ran away to start a rebellion with the stupidest plan that is SO unbelievable, (and without listening to her, when she was RIGHT not jealous of some other girl)that got her friend put into a coma, and eventually dead. I' m also too stupid to go with her on a suicide mission so at least she might have chance at survival because I know her brother won't sacrifice himself for her, and if she does die I can at least kill David if she doesn't succeed. Boo hoo.&#34; I hated how out character and (bluntly) spineless and stupid he was in this book.<br />The third problem<br />The people who DIDN'T die and SHOULD have, other people who deserved a better death,and the people who shoud have lived. We will start with the people who didn't die: Peter, Caleb, David, Marcus, and Tobias. Peter, Caleb, and David were all totally unimportant and hated by most fans and characters. Marcus was the center of Tobias's childhood nightmares. He also caused Evelyn to have trust issue and really, I think that contributed to Evelyn's personalilty in Insurgent and Allegiant. Tobias, he should have died with Tris. The whole 'Romeo and Juliet' ending would have been eaten up,,like from Tris's pov: 'As the pain started to lessen, I could tell I was letting go of my life when I suddenly felt light and airy. As I turned my head I realized Tobias was lying next to me, holding a hand to his wounded chest. His other hand extended out in my direction, it took close to all of my small amount of energy to reach out and grasp his fingers lightly. He smiled and with my last breath  said  &#34;I'll see you again.&#34;' And from Tobias's pov: 'I saw Tris fall. That was right before I got shot in the chest by David. I staggered slighlty, then rose my gun up higher and shot David in the head he slumped onto the floor in a heap. That's when I hit the floor. My arms splayed out, I could tell that the bullet hit something vital, considering the amount of blood rapidly increasing. I reached up and putt my hand on the wound, I knew I was dying. I looked over to see Tris still breathing. I smiled, hoping made it out of here alive, just hoping. She looked at me and I couldn't help but smile broader. When she reached for my hand I tried to grasp her fingers with the small strength I had left. But then I heard her whisper, I could barely make it out but I knew what she said. &#34;I know&#34; I replied as the light left her eyes and the darkness closed around me.' That would be a good death scene.<br />The last problem<br />There WAS NO PROBLEM. No one had any conflict in the chapters after Tris's death. We were all torn up about Tris being dead, being in shock and all, psychology speaking: after being mentally shocked by the death of someone you have probably conected with, you need some sort of conflict to focus your emotions on. (Sadness which will be transferred to anger which needs to be focused on something or else you'll dwell on it and the hollow feeling you're going to have after finishing the last book in ANY series.) But when it came down to it, everyone just got asked basically to stop and they just said &#34;Alright&#34;<br />So in conclusion: Allegiant would have been great, if  Veronica Roth would have rewritten all of the scenes and added an actual plot, along with some characters acting like themselves. (I forgot to mention making two narrators sound like two narrators.)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book moved me to tears. I don't usually read about tragdies like the one that happens in this book, but if you have a heart, you have no choice but to be moved my Hazel and Augustus's love. Absolutely recommend.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Fascinating read! Shocking revelations how females are regarded in this country. Yay for all the woen featured in this wee written book. Have read everything now by this author.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It took a long time for me to write a review for this story because I wanted to wait and see if Veronica Roth was serious with this ending. Sadly she is. From Divergent to Insurgent, Veronica had her share of EXCUSABLE mistakes, yes. But the totally screwed us in Allegiant. This book was so horrible I literally could NOT finish the ending. And If I could I'd get my money back. I wouldn't recommend this trilogy to a friend unless I want them to be as depressed as me in ALMOST finishing it.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|A fantastic bargain and I love the watch, but the watch strap that it comes with is uncomfortable. Fortunately, this was easy to fix, and I'm thrilled with my purchase.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely AMAZING and I totally recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading it. Worth every penny and is a absolutely great read for teenagers!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I Completely love this app this game is Amazing Although you should make moss That is all I have to say
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is addictive,once you start you can't stop.Highly recommend if you like this type of game and even if you don't,thought I didn't care for games like this but,I was so wrong.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is the best game in the universe no words can descibe it &amp; there is no words to describe it
0425062651|4.0|good value for what you are need in business today.  Don't pay full price - these are brand new books
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great game just wish it had blackout rooms and such, not just straight bingo. Hard to get to far just playing by yourself, you need friends to finish the collections.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books and they make great movies.  The story is timeless and uplifting.  So believable so inspiring.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Cant get it to work.  I think it has something to do with my internet not being a residential modem.  It also seem only to work with YouTube which I like but I already have this on my TV.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like it because it gets harder and harder. So you should get this app,and it has sections you can pick from.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|If you do a lot of online gaming, it's definitely handy to have a device like this for voice-to-voice chat. And as far as bluetooth headsets go, this one from Gioteck does a pretty good job.<br /><br />While I'm not a big fan of the design (Call of Duty players might disagree), it has some pretty good features: It only takes about 3 hours to fully charge, which will give you 5-6 hours of gameplay. And though it's designed to charge via your PS3 controller dock, the USB cord will also let you charge elsewhere, like a computer for example. Unfortunately, you cannot use the device while it's charging, so you'll have to remember to plug it back in after each use.<br /><br />Because it is a single-ear device, fitting over your right ear, it is lightweight and easy to wear for longer periods of time. Although the sound quality isn't the greatest, it does a fine job for speech-only audio. While testing it out, I was also told the microphone did a pretty good job of transmitting sound clearly.<br /><br />As a bonus, this device also seems to work well with smart phones. So you could always grab this after a bit of gaming and bring it into your car to make hands-free calls. It pairs quite easily - actually easier than it pairs to a PS3 which is a 12-step process of navigating through menu screens.<br /><br />Overall, this headset does its job well, despite its small flaws.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is very addictive too me!  I get to playing it and can hours pass in what seems to be minutes.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Pretty funny, but definitely &#34;Adult&#34;---Not for the kiddies!  Lots of drug references, as well as sexual overtones (hey, one of the main characters is a stripper)...I actually enjoyed the show more than I originally thought I would.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just started to play deer Hunter and really enjoy the first person prospective it has and love playing it while waiting on the big one in my tree stand
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Absolutely stellar performance by Joe B. and his backing band.  Highly recommend this and the accompanying Blu-Ray.  Top to bottom awesome...and as a bonus...Safe for ALL ages.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome! Been waiting for Candy Crush for a long time! GET CANDY CRUSH! Just don't get addicted to it too much.
B002MFULQO|3.0|Great cast but to slow moving and long.  3 hours plus was just too much. Brought forth lots of interesting information - but I've seen the same concept covered in another movie.
B00DMZ4NEY|5.0|John Forbes Nash has the ability to see patterns in math and nature that are ordinarily overlooked. He presumably is pressed into using his ability for the government.  Alicia comes into his world and as with many great loves; she sees what others call weird, as a cute uniqueness.  We follow their courtship and then life together.<br /><br />It is the little things and the interaction among friends that make the movie.  This movie captures your attention from the beginning. You may be able to anticipate what is happening however it is not meant to be a dark secret with a twist ending as much as letting you in on what he is going through to survive.  All the characters are fleshed out and you feel that you are there.  This movie leaves a good after taste.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006BSGJ John Nash: A Beautiful Genius]]
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Arnold is back and just as good as he was or even better. this is the first movie that Arnold has been in in years as a main character. i'm glad to see that he still wants to make movies. I hope he does a couple more before he retires. this is a awesome movie. I was surprised to see that a Korean director directed this movie. he did an awesome job. the cast is great you got Arnold, luiz, jhonny and the girl who played siff in thor. and the bad guys were awesome too. this movie is great for any Arnold fan or fans of action films. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00ECUARO8|1.0|never got to watch it - it would not stream or download.  Tried but the screen said not available try later.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Great family movie...no language or inappropriate innuendo. Something the whole family (13 and 9 year old) can watch and enjoy together.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun puzzler.  I killed two hours on my first go.  I would have paid for it, but get it now while it's free.
0345529057|5.0|This series will be my winter reading. I'm so glad I could find the whole set for so cheap. I won't watch the show until I read these!
B0092MJOMW|4.0|Dude, it's classic Slayer.  When I want some good, fast, well played thrash action, this is one of my favorite choices.
0525478817|5.0|Halfway through and I'm liking it, highly recommended by everyone I know who's read it. plus, an inexpensive hard cover!
B005KH928E|4.0|Two phenomenal masters intersect and make some marvelous music together.  Together is the key as it isn't merely two greats playing in the same room.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Fun and exciting movie.  Plenty of gags and great characters. Good balance of action and comedy for all ages. Good entertainment.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This show has amazing characters, awesome story lines, action and suspense. I even love the &#34;bad&#34; guys. Sad that there is only one more season.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an extremely fun game for all. It's a challenging race against the clock as you try to infect the world before the world can cure your disease.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I want ender men and an actual nether and piston Redstone and do that  cause I'm not  playing until I see this stuff

B002KGEORM|5.0|Great show.Keeps you watching to the very end..I really love a show that I look forward to watching every week..
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this together with my son who will be a fifth grader next year. Such wonderful lessons and examples of good character. I want to read it again!!
B005T87QCI|3.0|This game is fun, HD, and includes 4 different game types: tournament, survival, free play, and tag team. There is only one problem: the developers are too interested in making money to have this be as fun as it should be. It is ad-supported, which is not good for a paid app. It also wants you to buy robots, and It has a build-your-own-robot feature that you have to buy. I would expect this from a free app, but not a paid one. I gave it three stars because the gameplay is fun and challenging, but I expected more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome I just wish it had red stone<br />and all the abilities that the xbox or computer version<br />has
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Another fantastic book by John. Love that we have Jake back again with a lot of the characters from &#34;A Time T Kill&#34;. Still reading and don't want it to end!!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It took me awhile to absorb myself in the book, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. I really fell in love with a couple of the characters & really loathed the characters I was supposed to loathe. If you like SK you will like this book.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Some times I play it but because update I can't play it<br /> Plus there is draw a still an on computer don't get the app
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I would give it 5 stars, but the Audio and Video doesn't sync well all the time.  I like Prime otherwise.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nd edition and the world is a great deal to sell the world is a y yt? time and effort to the world is going to sell their products are available Tue turns
B00873GRU4|5.0|great read, great concept with incredible detail and thought about what it would be like to live in a hole in a the ground - really makes you think
B005K0HDGE|4.0|First let me tell you that I've been a Stephen King fan for years and I've never found a book of his that I didn't like. He's simply one of the best at his craft. Yes, there are other authors that I also enjoy, (Dean Koontz, James Patterson, John Grisham,& Louis L'Amour to name just a few) but he's definitely my absolute favorite. That being said, his latest few novels have to be considered lesser works,(at least by myself) and I started reading 11/22/63 only hoping I'd enjoy it. I'd also just read a novel by James Patterson that I'd been severely disappointed in, and my expectations were fairly low as a result. Well, only 3 pages into 11/22/63 and it was obvious that the MASTER WAS BACK and maybe better than ever. Even Mr. King's fans have to admit that he tends to get long winded now and then, (usually for the benefit of the story in the long run) but he could have written another 200 pages and I still would have stayed engrossed in this one. Highly recommended and I would've given it 4 and a half stars if that was an option.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|hard to start but incredibly addictive and easy to get into. great story with plenty of amazing plots and stories - would recommend
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I just got a new phone and tablet and knew I had to have this app on both.  Have it on my old phone and tablet and it comes in very handy when traveling.  This app stores various locations so when I am on the road, all I have to do is select my current location.  It is accurate and provides a plethora of weather information.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|Well I was smart enough to get through 4 years of college. But I couldn't make it through the first 10 minutes of playing this game without continually tapping the magnifying glass for hints and solutions. So, no thanks, give me a simple match three game or word puzzle.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this game on my old phone and tablet and loved it.  So when I got a new phone/tablet I knew, knew I had to buy it again.  The game is fun and funny, both.  It's also challenging.  The zombies can be quite frustrating and funny.  I love to beat them at their own game.
0739337270|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is definitely up there with my favorites. I've read it twice now over the years. I highly recommend this story.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I just got a new phone and tablet and the first thing I downloaded to both was this app.  I use it for grocery shopping, lists of to do's and list for other tasks that I have to get done.  A great application and free.  What more can you ask?
B0090SI4LU|2.0|Story felt rushed, some crucial character backstory is missing, and the acting is questionable. Bottom line is this is a don't buy.
B0024RID6U|1.0|Are you kidding with this?  I'm not sure how you can make an album sound worse.  Maybe if you are wearing $2 earbuds this sounds good.  Otherwise, forget it.  Nice songs by the Stones though.  Do not waste your money on this.
B00BN2NQFU|2.0|Some parts were neat but over all ended up turning it off. Too weird and sensual. Felt like a bad LSD &#34;trip&#34;.
B0000025KI|3.0|Some really great songs by Bruce. The sound on this album/CD is amazingly bad.  Some songs are muddy, some are ultra-bright.  The sound levels are all over the place.  Re-master please.  Update 11/30/2014  Listened to the River from the new remastered Bruce Springsteen Album Collection vol. 1 (1973-1984).  All I can say is WOW.  Too bad it took so long, but better late than never.  If you are any kind of fan of Springsteen music and The River in particular, it is a must buy.  I really don't have the vocabiltory means to describe how much better it sounds.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|Nearly every time I try to perform a song, ads keep loading in the middle of it so I have to stop playing and back out of the ad to continue. Very frustrating. I'll keep this for my 2 year old grandson to plunk away on. Not a good adult app. It may eventually get deleted.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game! Really love playing this game!! Awesome game, really enjoy playing this game! Love, love, love it! Great awesome!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm in love with the series I wish there was one more book to read, peta's love kills me, but I love it he is her balance
B00005JKLZ|4.0|To many people try to compare this with the original movie or book.  It's based on the same ideal but kinda went its own direction. I personally like it. Could of been a little longer to add more content to his time in the future. I for one liked it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You know going in that a book about teenage cancer patients might not end happily, but this is an excellent book. It's such a gripping, accurate portrayal of love.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Just like going to the movies to live inside a dream!<br /><br />I have read some of the positive reviews here and can in no way add to the precision descriptions or enlightened conversations about the way the story did or did not unfold or the elegance in which it interlaces with the original story of Alice.<br /><br />Instead, I have a completely different take.  This is a movie that is not for children but is for the child within the adult of people like me and many of the friends I grew up with in the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />I did not compare it to anything.  My mind was open and while ready for was not prepared for the sheer entertainment of the intense visuals and comedic dryness of the many fantastic mini stories for which both this and the original are so well known.<br /><br />Pure entertainment.  A vaudevillian story comprised of stories. Flip flash.<br /><br />Currently I am the one and only IT consultant/manager/administrator for several small businesses.  When a business with 35 workers suddenly experienced a catastrophic system failure that launched me into a week of working around the clock with a sum total of 7 hours sleep in 8 days, I found that I had reached a point where I simply could not sleep.  My mind had been forced to remain on task for so long that it simply could not accept that it was time to call it a day.<br /><br />I drove to the local theater instead of home.  I purchased a ticket for the next movie that was showing.<br /><br />With zero expectation I walked into Alice in Wonderland (2010) not even realizing that Johnny Depp was a part of the movie.<br /><br />Over the course of the next hour I slipped in and out of a state that can only be described as dreaming with eyes wide open.  I missed nothing and yet there seemed to be time gaps and all the while was entertained in a way that I can only relate to those days as a child when Looney Tunes had no more meaning to me than the sound of great music soothing my soul and  joining in aworld of crazy characters as if I were one of them and yet knowing it was not real while not caring about the difference.<br /><br />Suspension of reality.<br /><br />Alice was exactly what I needed to leave the world of intense concentration that had been thrust upon me by the requirement to keep 35 people working against nearly impossible odds for a week with no chance to relax or slip into apathy.<br /><br />Alice was like walking into a dream and when I left I felt satisfied and complete and went home and slept for 12 hours.<br /><br />Let yourself be a grown up child and enjoy this masterpiece but do not bring any children.  It is an adult's child film and well worth seeing.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|great game played them all and it only lags when you have like a million towers/darts out at once<br />so best game ever please make a million of them

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Unlike most game the whole story and all the dialogue in between is said aloud giving the game a deeper level to it's characters .
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This is the kind of movie you use to show how 3d works and your home theatre gets a good workout as well. A fun great movie with decent story and characters and absolutely wonderful spectacle.

B00AIUUXHC|3.0|This game took a while to download, then I just found boring and a little bit scary, knowing you can eat swimmers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am a teacher and use this app for adding tests or quizzes. I like the size of the keys, nice and big. The kindle makes the keys bright so I can work even in dimmed light. No need to look for good lighting for my solar calculator. You can also see what number you entered last, so calculations are more accurate and it's FREE. Thank you!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a great little chess game, I have played it everyday. It is challenging and thought provoking. I would recommend this game to both the novice and expert.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Great storyline, great acting with an interesting subject matter to boot.  The 20's were a pivotal period in modern US history, this tale of how alcohol made people rich, famous and dead.  A worthwhile watch indeed!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very well done as usual. Very fascinating about the plot of the greasy spoon owner finding the time bubble access in his storage room.
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|Great character development, an engaging and quick read. Writing is good, but real value is in the story and characters.
B00GGEV828|5.0|I love the additions to the scenes, the added dialog makes the movie even more full and rich! Very nice!
B0083Z614S|4.0|A nice tale for young readers and a good reminder for young-at-heart that attitude is everything. Age of story is evident, but does not impact readability.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|I'm not sure how this faotd got so many rave reviews because it is seriously lacking in two departments. One, there are no directions. You are on your own from the beginning. Two, you cannot come back to the first room if you forgot something. You are forced to start over. I have played many of this type of game and this one is being deleted.
6305428050|3.0|We're replacing our ancient VHS with DVD's. I'm glad I found this one. We used to watch it a lot as kids.

0618680004|5.0|Everybody should ready this.  From childhood to adulthood the Catholic Church never allowed me to think logically and analytically.  Once I thought things through I religion became unrealistic and full of myths and misinterpretations.  All at for the profit of pederasts and dreamers!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Great idea but alot of bugs to iron out! ! Make sure you have the correct operating system for connecting.

006202406X|1.0|I imagine having my chest sliced open with a dull knife and sprinkled with salt would produce a feeling similar to the feeling that comes with completing this series.<br /><br />I  can see why Roth did it, but I don't really understand it. I have read several interviews with Roth about the backlash from fans and still don't really understand. (Also, based on what she said in those interviews, Is she telling us that the only way to make sacrifices is to die?)<br /><br />I have read many books that have absolutely broken my heart but in the best way (i.e., John Green's The Fault in Our Stars), yet they didn't leave me feeling like I had wasted my time. This book broke my heart for what seemed like no reason.<br /><br />All of that besides the fact that this book was not nearly as well written as the first two. It isn't as organized, it gets confusing at times, and Tris and Four have the same, boring, repetitive problems. Maybe if the details were more well-written I would be more capable of accepting the ending. I had such high expectations for this book and for Roth, but unfortunately I was not impressed.

0385737955|2.0|This is a full analysis of the book, full spoilers included. You have been warned.<br /><br />[ALSO, if you choose to downvote my review saying it wasn't helpful, please tell me why in the comments. I welcome everyone's thoughts and opinions, but if you downvote a review of this size without commenting I will be under the assumption you simply downvote all negative reviews.]<br /><br />The story itself was interesting enough for the most part, but the pace was painfully slow and Dashner committed a few things you are not supposed to do in fictional writing, ever. I'm talking newbie mistakes here.<br /><br />The second largest thing that Dashner violated was the Show, Don't Tell rule. He almost assuredly does not understand this, as a lot of his descriptions are flatly told instead of explained. \\"Thomas felt sad.\\" \\"Thomas snapped.\\" Dashner does not do a good job showing us his world or his characters, instead just telling us how things are. This interweaves with my next points a bit and is explained in greater detail later.<br /><br />For my second point, marking the biggest mistake Dashner did with this story, he began the book with the White Room Syndrome. Much like the Show, Don't Tell rule, this is one thing that almost all writers know very deeply - do not start your story off with the white room syndrome.<br /><br />The white room syndrome is where your character suddenly wakes up in a completely unfamiliar setting and knows nothing about anything - his past, his name, people he knew, etc... This is cheap because it allows you to dodge any sort of actual development in the world, its characters or the relationships that the characters have. This book in particular suffered a lot because Dashner decided to go this way.<br /><br />One particular area it suffered deeply was with character development. Partially since he had no past to develop from, Thomas was a weak protagonist with nearly no original or interesting characteristics. He seems brave at times, but everybody in this book is. He seems smart at times, but so is everybody else. To me, he is almost a blank slate designed to move the story forward. I cannot list one original characteristic about him - other characters say he is interesting, but that is not the conclusion I came to - if the story didn't follow him, he would blend in with the rest of the characters.<br /><br />The other characters were also an issue. Other than Minho and Chuck, I had a hard time picturing any of them or even telling them apart. Alby was the typical reckless group leader. Newt was the typical nicer more rational second-in-command. Teresa was a typical plain-Jane female side character designed to make the plot actually go somewhere. Minho was interesting, but Dashner could have developed him further than he did. And Chuck was a potentially interesting character, but Dashner killed him off for no reason.<br /><br />It would have been very difficult to develop any of these characters to a great extent, though, since none of them have histories or memories outside of the maze. Because they all have heavy amnesia, they don't even remember who they are - thus, they cannot be deeply developed. They are just a bunch of people trying to get out. I have to wonder if Dashner himself had fleshed his characters out any deeper than this by this point of the story.<br /><br />Another way the whole `no past' thing effects the plot is the relationship between Teresa and Tom. It was possibly one of the weakest romances I have ever read in a novel. They loved each other because they did `before it happened', not because they have actual chemistry. There was no development or movement in their relationship whatsoever - it just started off that they were in love just because they were, and that's where the book left off as well. They loved each other because it's what Dashner wanted for the story, not because it made sense for the characters.<br /><br />Let's put this in contrast to the last book series I read - Divergent. In the first Divergent book, it takes almost 250 pages to fully develop the relationship between Tris and Tobias. Tobias starts off as her superior, and slowly their relationship develops and morphs into something tangible, which is why you were truly able to feel it in that series. It logically progressed into a relationship where you could really believe they had feelings for each other. In Maze Runner, the only reason I felt they loved each other was because I was told to think that. I had no real reason to assume they had feelings for each other besides that, since there was no chemistry, development, getting to know each other or even any conversations that didn't have directly to do with the plot. It was utterly emotionless and monotone and had no effect on me whatsoever - that is not how romance is supposed to be! That's not even how a mundane friendship is supposed to be! What he had with Chuck had more feeling than what he had with Teresa.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Then there were several gaping plot holes. One that I was particularly annoyed with was how long it took them to figure out that the Griever Hole was the only way out. I mean, seriously... I figured that out the second they introduced it and tossed the rock in. I twas utterly predictable. Just think. They have been running around this big maze for two years and have not found any exit of any sort, but in this one spot there appears to be a hole you can toss thing into to make them disappear. It took them an extra 200 pages to figure out that that was, just maybe, an exit of sorts.<br /><br />Then, it surprised me to notice that Minho has noticed all of those WORLD IN CATASTROPHE: KILLZONE EXPERIMENT DEPARTMENT things all over the walls and never came to the conclusion that this was, oh, I don't know, some sort of experiment or something. It didn't even occur to the characters until the end of the book when Thomas brought it up that this might, just maybe be some sort of experiment.<br /><br />Minho was a pretty intelligent character, and so was Newt and Alby. In fact, it was a main plot point at the end that they are all technically very intelligent people. If this is the case, how did they not figure all of this stuff out a very long time ago? (Getting back to the Telling issue, the only reason I had to believe they were smart was because I was told so. I was never shown them being particularly smart, especially considering the things I mentioned above.)<br /><br />Then there is the scene where the sky disappears. I have several issues with this scene. First, why was the first conclusion Thomas came to that the sky was artificial? I was figuring that something covered up the sky at first, but the very first thing he figured was that it absolutely must be that the sky is fake, with no chance of another option whatsoever. There was no guesswork or figuring out to be done here - he just knew, just because he knew.<br /><br />And at that, where did this even come from? To me, it seems like Dashner literally came up with that on the spot. There was absolutely nothing in this book beforehand to hint that the sky was fake - nothing. If Thomas had thought to himself that this or that looks or seem fabricated or a bit off, it would have made some sense why he came to the conclusion he did so ridiculously quickly when the sky disappeared. But there was nothing. It just happened. Something like this should have been foreshadowed.<br /><br />This is something I feel he does a lot - or, forgets to do a lot. He does not develop a lot of things beforehand that eventually become important, nor does he give clarification afterwards. For an example, the telepathic talking that Teresa and Tom have. To me, this was clearly used so Teresa could move the story forward no matter where Tom was at the time being, but I would have been okay with that if there was another relevant and in-story reason why she could talk to him like that. Sure, he might answer that inthe next book, but he should have answers that in this book, since it was a vital part of this story. As far as I am concerned, since he gave no good reason why that is the way it is, I am convinced the only reason why it is there is for a cheap and easy way to move the plot forward. If there is another relevant in-story reason why it exists, he probably could have come up with it in the second book.<br /><br />That all might not be true, but if he either developed it beforehand or clarified it afterwards, there would be no confusion. By the end of this story, I am convinced it existed for no other reason than to easily move the story forward when it needed to, just like the sky suddenly disappearing. It felt like a random event he came up with on the spot so he could get un-stuck in his story.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Then, at the end, there is almost no resolution to the story whatsoever. They meet a woman who explains to them that this all happened for some sort of good reason (which I logically assumed), but then proceeded to say that that was certainly enough for them to understand and they should just accept it. She could have elaborated on just a bit more to explain a little bit of the context this story takes place in, but does not in any way mostly because she didn't feel they would want to know, or something. It seems to confuse her why making 40 people go through a maze for 2 years for less than 20 of them to survive with no context whatsoever might confused them or make then want answers of some sort.<br /><br />Then a bunch of people come in and kill her, take the main characters to a safe place (while of course explaining nothing about anything, because there's no time to explain) and the book ends. Well, sort of, anyway. The bus driver rushing them to safety explains something about sun flares and a sickness that has ravaged the world and how the maze was all some sort of mental test, but it all seemed non sequitur to the rest of the story. This, again, reflects back to the issue he has with foreshadowing. There was absolutely nothing in this book to hint towards any of this, and it all comes across as being random and on-the-spot. I was unable to correlate anything that happened throughout the book to anything relevant to the sun flares.<br /><br />There were very few answers to anything. Why could Tom and Teresa talk telepathically? What were the Grievers and why were they there? What was the test supposed to do, anyway? How was anything of the story relevant to the last few chapters at all?<br /><br />Those are the sort of things I should not have had to wait for book 2 to have answered, since they were all relevant to this story. Sure, you need to leave some questions for the next book, but the way that he answered absolutely none of them leaves me to assume he might not have had it all figured out by this point. One could argue that Dashner was clever not to reveal anything, but that is just not the case since he did that at the expense of this story not having an actual conclusion. Because of this laziness to answer anything at all, I simply have no desire to find out what happens next. I don't care what he comes up with, since he has not shown me that even he knew where he was going with the story by that point. I'm finding it hard to believe he actually had a big grand plan to reveal to us by this point.<br /><br />Take into consideration how the first Hunger Games ends. (Hunger Games 1 spoilers for those who have not read the book or seen the movie by this point. Skip this paragraph if so.) Katniss and Peeta make the government angry by making a joke out of them at the end of the Games, so at the end of book 1, we have to wait and see how they will politically fight against the government and how they can pretend to be in love when they're not. There was something truly tangible to look forward to in the sequel, and that is what drove me to pick up the next book. This was all done while making the first book a complete story with some resolution. That is how a book 1 is supposed to be done.<br /><br />Now let's go back to the ending of Maze Runner. They escape the maze to learn that it existed for some sort of reason, and the book ends with the promise that you will learn what that reason was later. There is no resolution to any questions raised in the story, there is no other major hook to make you read the next book - there is just no real reason to continue. The one and only hook that the end of this book had was that you will learn what the first book was about in the second book. That's it. Instead of building up new scenarios and conflicts to transfer over, his only hook is that he withheld vital information that should have been at the end of this book that he will give in the second one. In comparison to the Hunger Games, it's quite pathetic and lazy.<br /><br />I am not entirely certain how people can compare this book to the Hunger Games or Divergent. It's just not on the same level of storytelling in any area. The writing is full of telling, the story is riddled with plot holes and plot devices, the character development is lacking, the romance and relationships are boring and there is no real conclusion to the story. I am not certain why people put this book up there with some of the other major titles right now.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I thought the first one was better. I think this series is great for teens but not so much for adults. It sometimes feels repetitive. It kind of gives you too much instead leaving space to breathe and allow the reader to infer. Anyway, not bad.

0786838655|4.0|I'd read about a third of this book before it won me over.  I initially thought that the &#34;cool&#34; mannerisms were forced, and that the author missed some opportunities for better work early on--more descriptive scenes, richer characterizations, etc.<br /><br />But the fast-paced action and the nature of Percy's adventure soon had me turning pages so fast I finished the book in one day.  One of Riordan's best points is his visual depiction of certain places--a filthy river, an abandoned amusement park, and of course, Hades itself.  The latter was constructed brilliantly.  In addition, his characterization of Ares is fabulously done.<br /><br />I simply cannot wait to have my nose buried in the next one.<br /><br />By the author of It All Started with a Bicycle

B003G4W49C|5.0|Page turning story.  Brought me back to my early adolescence and my love of sci-fi.  Not a literary piece by any means, but powerful, nevertheless.  Females are superfluous.  All about boys, power, and violence.  The surprises that change everything are unexpected and dramatic.  I read an essay, Creating the Innocent Killer, by John Kessel  ([...] that raised very interesting issues about the author Card's \\"morality of intention,\\" i.e., everything that the hero Ender does, no matter how brutal or murderous, is excusable, even venerable, because he is (will be) the savior of humanity.

034580404X|5.0|50 Shades of Grey trilogy is a gift. It’s so raw and embarrassing to read but you can’t look away! It’s the greatest piece of erotic fiction written by a woman and it made me glad to be alive again.<br /><br />Anastasia and Christian are a great couple. I identified with her and saw elements of my own husband in the man, with his generosity and caring. The author is right on target with the modern times and the culture of 20 and 30-somethings. I even wondered if I was squandering my husband.<br /><br />50 Shades trilogy is a good story for falling in love again and captures the best of all men, young and old.<br /><br />Tropic of Capricorn and Lady Chatterly’s Lover were banned last century. 50 Shades has come of age! It’s a reminder of how far we’ve come as a culture. What a difference a century makes.<br /><br />I heard the hubbub about this book long before I read it. Actually, I was turned off, but found myself one day immersed in its fluid pages. How I got there, I don’t know, but it was transforming for me.<br /><br />The writing reminded me that the written word can take you places. I am grateful for the storyline of the book that punctuates the repeated assaults on the senses of intense sexuality and passion. Whew, it’s a much-needed reprieve. Christian’s energy is daunting. He’s so intense. And Ana’s desire for him is so deep and unremitting.<br /><br />All this—three volumes--is written by a woman! In Book One, the reader gets lost, losing track of time in real life as you are immersed into Anastasia’s world. After all, in real life, you might run like hell from this type of guy. After all, it’s still a novel.<br /><br />Because real-life issues are introduced in the character’s lives and pasts, the story is believable and the couple seems real. It’s a “You-are-there” turn-on of a tale, so interactive, that you can see yourself in the story! And feel what is going on, too! (I’m surprised I didn’t get a gag reflex with all the action!) This couple is so attracted to each other, it’s palpable.<br /><br />The author’s treat to the reader isn’t about sex—per se—although it is certainly an integral part of the story. And Christian’s wealth is incidental. Who cares? His passion and dedication to his woman is tantamount. Anastasia isn’t out for his money and he’s not seeking to keep it from her, despite his insecure, controlling ways in other areas of his life.<br /><br />The author’s treat is in the story of elevated love, like Beauty and the Beast, when transformation takes place, when people allow themselves to be opened to possibilities. It’s the story of hope, as old as time, of a couple who perseverance, leads them to the promised land of bliss. One woman disarms the beast, one moment of vulnerability. It’s the very finest a man and woman are capable of. Both in sync. If only every woman had a man like this and vice versa, what a wonderful world it might be.<br /><br />I hope there is a Book Four. Kudos to E.L.James, the author. She did something unusual and endearing at the end of Book Three: She thanks the reader for reading her work and says, “That’s all for now.” Might there be more for us insatiable? After all, I am wondering how Christian would fare if Anastasia died or left him. Would he have a breakdown or return to his former behavior with women? I’d love to grow old with Christian and Anastasia! Frankly, I wouldn’t mind having E.L. James as a teacher of fiction.

He lives in Italy half the time, and I'm sure he made this one there because it was convenient, as well as awfully scenic. Long pauses with no dialogue, only meaningful glances. Great score. The tension builds slowly as we wonder who will betray whom. The American hitman can't afford to trust anyone. He will kill his own girlfriend if he must, to get away. This is not a Hollywood thriller. It's a European one. For that, we should be grateful. It's a movie for those with an IQ above dull normal.

B007QA3AH2|4.0|A great jab at Sci-Fi, the industry and fandom. Still funny after all this time. The kids even gave it thumbs up.<br /><br />My youngest:&#34;It was cheesy, but on purpose, I think.&#34;
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Simply one of the scariest haunted house movies I have ever seen. And it manages to do it without excessive gore (there's a little blood at the end, but no guts or severed body parts or ANYTHING of that sort), sex, or profanity. It does it with atmosphere. It earned its R rating for &#34;Sequences of disturbing violence and terror.&#34; Emphasis on the  terror. I hope we're in for a collection of emulators in the near future, especially if those filmmakers do as good a job as these ones.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I love the collection, but when one of the disks doesn't work it really ruins the &#34;complete series collection&#34;.  I love the show and was excited to re-watch this series.  After several months of watching it, I have come to the final season and disk 41 does not work.  After getting one episode in, it goes pixalated and won't continue playing.  There goes 3 episodes out the window since it is not even a scratch or smudge but a defect to the disk itself I can't even salvage it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've always love Enders game, and now that the movie is out I wanted to read it again to refresh my memory of the book. Just like I remember it an excellent book
B00459EZLW|4.0|Ended too soon.  Would have enjoyed more seasons.  Liked the way the show ended and was hoping for a sequel.
B008LXZEYU|1.0|I rented this movie because I can't seem to make it through a Reddit thread without it being quoted.  They are even making a second one, something that should indicate enough people liked this movie to warrant the production of a second.  I'm not sure if the fault lies in my television, Roku, internet service or if I was just streamed the wrong movie, but the images and sounds to which I was exposed did not warrant a laugh during the entire runtime.  I did notice the description on Amazon states that they work for &#34;Channel 3&#34; however the movie I watched had them working for Channel 4.  I believe this is evidence that I was provided with an inferior non-humorous version, either that or there is a massive conspiracy in the review sections of both IMDB and Amazon.  I hope Amazon will work with Paramount to obtain the correct version of the film so future customers will not have to suffer through the movie I had to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It makes me think and I really love a challenge,<br />My older brother is the first to discover the amazing game my whole family plays it.

B002MFWLXK|5.0|Well done movie about Jim Garrison's investigation into the assassination of JFK.  I especially appreciated the frustration he met with when his witnesses were killed before they could testify in court.  And the fear they felt before they were killed.  My congratulations to the Military Industrial Complex and the CIA.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|My library hold finally came through (so happy I didn't purchase this book) and I was so looking forward to reading this over the Thanksgiving weekend.  What a disappointment and huge waste of time.  I found the book annoying -- the use of GAAAAAH over and over made me crazy.  I skimmed through much of it and didn't even bother finishing it.  I would think at 50+ years old, having suffered through the loss of her husband and being the mother of 2 young children, she would have some depth to her.  Her insecurities and missteps might have been charming in her twenties and thirties, but in her fifties, she came off as vapid, selfish and ridiculous.  Obsessing over twitter followers, weight and a boy toy?  Really?  It reminded me of  those movies that have a multitude of movie stars and you wait and wait for it to get better and it never does and you suddenly realize it was a vanity project and you the viewer have been seduced by the director's  past successes.  Helen Fielding should have left well enough alone!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is written as if the character is talking directly to the audience.  It hilarious with a great plot.

0385493622|5.0|This book takes you on a riveting journey of solving Mathematics' most famous and extremely difficult of riddles, Fermat's Last Theorem.  The riddle, Fermat's Last Theorem, itself is very simple to understand but equally extremely difficult to prove that it took over 3 centuries (358 years to be precise) to be proved in 1993 by Sir Andrew Wiles!<br /><br />Everybody...and I am sure everybody, who has been to high school knows or has heard of Pythagoras's theorem or equation which states –<br />X (raised to the power of 2) + Y (raised to the power of 2) = Z (The Hypotenuse) (raised to the power of 2)<br /><br />Fermat's Last Theorem is a sister equation of Pythagoras' equation. It states -<br /><br />X (raised to the power of n) + Y (raised to the power of n) = Z(raised to the power of n) has no whole number solutions for n &#62; 2<br /><br />The 17th Century French mathematical genius by the name of Pierre de Fermat created this equation while studying the book Arithmetica. Fermat was also notorious for stating a problem and then intentionally not stating the solution! He would also go ahead and challenge his fellow mathematicians to find the proof. Not surprisingly, this used to frustrate his fellow mathematicians who loved to collaborate and build up on one another's methods...This habit of Fermat of hiding the proof of his theorems not only tortured his contemporaries but generations of future mathematicians.<br /><br />So when Fermat scribbled his above theorem in margin of Arithmetica, he did not explain his proof of the equation. As expected, this mischievous mathematical genius also made a tantalizing note which infuriated and haunted current and future mathematicians.  Fermat simply scribbled - “I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.”<br /><br />...and with that was born a legendary mathematical monster -  Fermat’s Last Theorem (‘Last’ because it was ‘The Last’ remaining theoremof Fermat’s that remained unproved) and the race to prove it which took the next 358 years and 19th  and 20th century mathematical techniques to prove it.<br /><br />This book is not just about how the talented Andrew Wiles solved the world's most fabled mathematical problem but also a very absorbing journey of Mathematics' famous and infamous legends and their intriguing stories  - some tragic, some pure genius and some shockingly astonishing. For example, Calculus was not developed by Issac Newton independently but by someone named Pierre de Fermat!<br /><br />If you are a Maths, Science or a Engineering student or professional you will find this book absolutely delightful to read as the topics will naturally appeal to your technical self.<br />Even, if you are not inclined towards mathematics, at worse, you will find this book to be an enjoyable read!  Simon Singh does a brilliant job of explaining the most arcane of mathematical concepts so much so that you will consider taking up mathematics! Go buy a copy. You won't regret it.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Silly, unbelievable, trite (yes, even with extensive S&M).  The moral of this story is &#34;Good girl gets bad guy to become good guy by being  bad girl.&#34;  And the writing isn't all that sucks.
B003274QH6|5.0|My introduction to the greatest TV drama of all time, and the beginning of Walt's downfall. &#34;Crazy Handful of Nothin&#34; is the episode that hooked me, with one of the coolest  Heisenberg moments ever!

B005J9ZE5I|5.0|My favorite movie of the 80s! I think I wore out the VHS copy from the video store back then. And I've owned many copies over the years since ... many of them being stolen.This Blu-ray features the classic movie with plenty of extras for the die hard sucker for extra fan like myself. Bruce Campbell, chainsaw & Deadites what else can you say!!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This is an excellent story with all the characters fully introduced with deep descriptions. The story is a bit of mystery with a happy endings. A great read!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This isn't &#34;your dad's Evil Dead!&#34; But why the heck would you want it to be? Isn't the purpose of the often dreaded remake to offer previously unsought of ideas with characters you love. The thing I really like about this film is that it features an all new cast rather than recast old favorites. I can't see anyone other than Bruce Campbell playing Ash & how can you have Campbell without Raimi? This movie does however  offer the tropes needed to call it Evil Dead; Deadites, over the top gore & a reluctant hero with Jane Levy (whom I'm in love with). &#34;Not your Dad's!&#34; but still worthy of being called Evil Dead!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this book.  So many twists and turns. Didn't want it to end.One of Grishams best! Recommend it highly for a great read
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Walt desperately tries to keep dark secrets from his family, while avoiding Hank & escaping the crazy Tuco. Each episode is hotter & more tense than the one before, ending in an explosion bigger than season one. Nobody does it better!

B009UX2YAC|2.0|It sometimes freezes but it is a pretty good game. When you suppose to die you just keep on going
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I feel like many others do about this ending book of the series.  I didn't like it at all.  The first two books were great, deserving of 5 stars, but this was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />I didn't like the switching of narrative from Four to Tris!  It was very difficult to get into the characters switch and I found myself confused several times and had to re-read many pages.  I have never seen this type of narrative switch and if I find that it is in any book, I will definitely pass on the book.  It has no redeeming value.<br /><br />The narrative was boring most of the time, with a weak story line that didn't fit the first two books.  The answer to what was outside the borders of the first two books was, in itself, a disappointing twist.  I started to say that it wasn't believable, but that is an oxymoron in fantasy fiction. It just didn't seem to suit the story line.<br /><br />The way it ended was extremely disappointing ! ! ! !  To come that far being a champion of Tris to see it ended in that manner made me want to stop reading immediately.  I kept on, thinking that Roth would come up with some twist that would negate this egregious turn of the plot.  That left EVERYTHING in seeming limbo with absolutely no good feelings about how the book ends.<br /><br />A very big disappointment overall.
B00EK0UBPU|2.0|This book is far too verbose and the storyline is convoluted to the point of tedium. The intention seems to be to enhance the depth of the characters by witholding the &#34;real&#34; story of their involvement in the plot until the last few pages; it simply doesnt work.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I have watched all 8 seasons of Criminal Minds and have loved all of them.  I am glad that most of the characters have<br />returned for Season 8 and also Season 9.  Great acting, story lines, would highly recommend this series.

B009OYSFDM|2.0|This was my first episode of Arrow and it was enough to realize that it was just another mass produced tv show without any real creativity. A great big yawner, despite the welcome presence of Ben Browder.
B00GIY5OGC|4.0|This was a fun movie for my kids (ages 5 & 9) and for me.  Not all animated movies take adults into account, but this one certainly did.  I'm sure my kids will want to watch it again at some point.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Sandra Bullock is as cute as they come. Ryan Rynolds is cute and funny, plus you get a glimpse of most of his chiseled body... And movie was very cute too, with a great supporting cast.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|I actually stopped watching it with about 25 minutes to go, and wish I had stopped sooner.  Parts of this movie were fun to watch, but it really dragged on, and at points made me completely lose interest.  I literally just got tired of watching.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|What I call a &#34;feel good movie&#34;. Story of friendship, love, and loyalty. Great storylines. Plus can't go wrong with Chiwetel Ejiofor...fabulous actor!
B00B7FOQCK|3.0|No problems with the digital performance.<br /><br />The negatives:<br />All 4 sockets are VERY tight and don't allow for easy plug-in (tested with many USB plugs - the problem is with the Anker Hub).<br />Size - It is physically larger than it needs to be.<br />Power - plugged into a USB3.0 socket,  the Hub would not deliver enough power to run one of my external DVD drives (the drive demanding power from 2 USB 2.0 inputs).
B009WUBERW|5.0|This is a great action-packed movie and with all the popular actors who still have what it takes to give a performance.  I loved it.  I have looked at this movie 3 times already.
B008M721MS|1.0|I am disappointed because my Kindle Fire did not come with Skype loaded as I had expected I have tried to download but with no success.  This could be because at the moment I am in Mexico.  I there any way you can help me. Mary Wingrave

B00GH4R95C|4.0|Lots of fun! Sure the Supe is still the Supe..and the story is still the story. But, this has a good cast.. doing very well.. with<br />a  decent enough rewrite of the usual details and aspects. I think the problem with Superman is they keep retelling the<br />same story, and ought to just give us an 'issue'... an adventure, a nemesis, a romance--in fact, I'll say no new krypton for the next 20 years.<br />But, I digress. It's fun. Well shot.. exciting, plenty of good acting and dialogue, and fancy stunts.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|A bad rip off of Transformers mixed with Godzilla.  Don't waste your time.  Nothing more to say about it than don't watch it.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|One of Woodys best, IMO. I rate Sleeper, Zelig, Deconstructing Harry as Woody Films at the top of my list, if that helps you see how my taste runs.<br />For me, this had everything a Woody film needs to be just that. It's smart, it's funny, it's sci fi, it's romance--it's art.<br />Really do rent this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you know temple run it is way better than temple run.I am addicted to the game. Once I start  I can't put my phone down I keeps me entertained for hours and hours I love this game. You can get all different characters and every time there is a holiday there is a new character and there are keys that you have to find to get that character,and there is a time limit like 20 days or something so u have to play all the time to be able to get the character.GET THIS GAME IT IS A VERY GOOD GAME FOR KIDS WHO GET BOARD EASILY
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was one of the most moving stories I have read in many years.<br />I was glued to the pages.<br />The author paints vivid pictures with his beautiful words. One can visualize each setting and each character.<br />Each character's story segues smoothly into that of the next and at the end everything comes full circle.<br />Hosseini writes in such a poignant style that one hopes for more.<br />I learned about the region, both geographically and politically.<br />I longed for each character to have a resolution to his or her problems, hardships and difficulties.<br />I was sad to come to the end. It was with a sense of loss that I closed the book on the final page.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great Book and movie - very thoughtful on WAR. A fine book read. I think I will get the sequel.
B00F9040HU|3.0|The game it self was easy enough and fun, but even for free it wasn't worth it. I only got to play maybe 5 levels before it asked me to &#34;buy&#34; it!
0375415297|5.0|A comprehensive and highly-readable presentation of the musically rich historical period into which Bach was born and within which he became a premier composer.  John Eliot Gardner offers insights from his own distinguished career as an interpreter and conductor, especially of Early Music.  Readers with interests in Bach's biography, his self-taught compositional style, relationships with patrons and city councils, and his exceptional performance skills as an instrumentalist and singer will be richly rewarded.  There is much to delight church and concert audience members like myself as well as seasoned musical professionals.  Numerous illustrations, frequent footnotes, and extensive endnotes stretch a reader's mind and imagination.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|I'm still not too sure how I feel about this album yet. I am a very big fan of Lady Gaga & absolutely LOVE her previous albums & work she has done. I've never expected her to &#34;out-do&#34; herself, because since she burst onto the scene she pretty much took over. It's very hard to top that when you start off at the top. Unfortunately I don't think this album compares to her others. The songs are very different, and don't really appeal to me like she has in the past. There are a couple of really good songs on this record, but other than that I don't have an interest in it. &#34;Born this Way&#34; also had a very different style to it, and I think it was some of her best work yet. &#34;Artpop&#34; just doesn't quite do it for me, and I've always been a huge fan of Lady Gaga.

B00G15MDI0|5.0|Those who love Markus Zusak's The Book Thief as I do will know that it is an incredibly complex novel - the way the main characters intersect each other's lives and the themes that are developed throughout the novel are deep and layered and would make for a daunting on-screen translation. Yet director Brian Percival manages to make the movie accessible to viewers whilst staying true to the source material. This may not be a blow-by-blow, faithful to each and every word adaptation, but to me at least, it is a true adaptation in portraying the essence of the story. I love the book but I also loved the movie, for similar and different reasons.<br /><br />The story of The Book Thief begins with the narrator, Death (Roger Allam), providing a sort of overview/introduction. Fortunately, the narrator's voice is not dominant throughout the story as it would (to me) have been a rather distracting voice, but the narrator's presence is felt nevertheless. The protagonist in this film is Liesel (Sophie Nelisse in a ground-breaking performance), a young teenager who comes to live with her foster parents, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, the acid- tongued Rosa (Emily Watson). The setting at the beginning of the story is Germany in 1938 and the story goes on till the end of WW II. Liesel's mother is a Communist and has been packed off somewhere, presumably a camp, for this is after all Nazi Germany.<br /><br />The story focuses on Liesel's relationship with her foster parents, her best friend, Rudy (Nico Liersch), and her life-defining friendship with Max (Ben Schnetzer), the young Jewish man hiding in her parents' basement. At the beginning of the story Liesl is unable to read but this slowly changes as first her foster father Hans and later Max help her see beyond the words to the very notions underlying those words. Soon Liesel is reading voraciously and also developing a keen sense of what it means to live in such troubled times, and who by the end of the story, has come to truly understand the power of words and what defines moral courage.<br /><br />The themes in the book are manifold and I felt these themes were beautifully portrayed in the film. The ideas of friendship, paternal and maternal love, loyalty, and courage, not to mention of course, Death, are credibly-woven together in such a way that these themes flow throughout the film as a whole instead of distinct parts. The cast, especially Nelisse as Liesel, delivers a finely-nuanced performance, every emotion captured by those beautiful, wide, expressive eyes, and Rush as her foster father Hans portrays the very symbol of paternal love and moral courage (especially in the scene where he stands up to a Gestapo officer in defense of a friend).<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13, but I watched this with my husband and 9-year-old (who has read The Diary of Anne Frank and is somewhat familiar with the history of the Holocaust), and she was absolutely captivated by this film. There are no scenes of extreme or prolonged violence - some scenes of kids fighting, Nazis dragging people off, Nazis burning books, children chanting pro-Nazi slogans (which is disturbing to me but of course given the context of the film, it cannot be helped), Nazis and collaborators destroying Jewish property during Kristallnacht, but nothing like the scenes one sees in movies like Schindler's List. It made for an interesting family discussion after we finished viewing it.<br /><br />The film's ultimate message is positive and there are certainly many interesting issues that come up for discussion - moral courage being one that I felt was significant. Do we stand by and watch atrocities and injustice perpetrated without voicing against it, and if we do, are we prepared for the repercussions? These and more are satisfactorily addressed in this film, and I count this as one of the more memorable films of 2013.come to truly understand the power of words and what defines moral courage.<br /><br />The themes in the book are manifold and I felt these themes were beautifully portrayed in the film. The ideas of friendship, paternal and maternal love, loyalty, and courage, not to mention of course, Death, are credibly-woven together in such a way that these themes flow throughout the film as a whole instead of distinct parts. The cast, especially Nelisse as Liesel, delivers a finely-nuanced performance, every emotion captured by those beautiful, wide, expressive eyes, and Rush as her foster father Hans portrays the very symbol of paternal love and moral courage (especially in the scene where he stands up to a Gestapo officer in defense of a friend).<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13, but I watched this with my husband and 9-year-old (who has read The Diary of Anne Frank and is somewhat familiar with the history of the Holocaust), and she was absolutely captivated by this film. There are no scenes of extreme or prolonged violence - some scenes of kids fighting, Nazis dragging people off, Nazis burning books, children chanting pro-Nazi slogans (which is disturbing to me but of course given the context of the film, it cannot be helped), Nazis and collaborators destroying Jewish property during Kristallnacht, but nothing like the scenes one sees in movies like Schindler's List. It made for an interesting family discussion after we finished viewing it.<br /><br />The film's ultimate message is positive and there are certainly many interesting issues that come up for discussion - moral courage being one that I felt was significant. Do we stand by and watch atrocities and injustice perpetrated without voicing against it, and if we do, are we prepared for the repercussions? These and more are satisfactorily addressed in this film, and I count this as one of the more memorable films of 2013.

1591841992|4.0|In our increasingly digital workplaces the skill of communicating with a pen and paper is dwindling.  This book pitches some ideas to help even the non-artists to communicate with sketches, I liked this book enough to recommend it to people at work and my copy has been lent to people in my team.  Rock-solid ideas, I recommend it.  If you have a tablet and a stylus you can even take these ideas digital.

1400064287|4.0|Simple ideas on how to make your ideas more sticky.  You could sum this book up into a one-pager (in fact they do) but I still recommend it as a light read with food for thought, for when you're trying to make ideas stick in your organisation or community.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|It seemed like a promising game, and I was even having fun with it! But as soon as I attempted to link it to Facebook, it crashed on me. Now, every time I start it up, as soon as it is done downloading from the Internet, it crashes. I'm just lucky I didn't put any money into it, though I can't say the same for other users... Please, get your programmers together and fix this mess!
0789723107|4.0|Simply put - one of the best books on user experience ever written.  The references have dated but the principles hold.  Don't make your users click twice when you can reduce it to once, don't make them search for things, basically as the title says...
0321934962|4.0|I'm a longtime complex camera shooter who's happily used a D300 for the last 5 years - a camera with most of the same extensive customization setting capability as my new D7100. I was looking for a book that would quickly get me acclimated to using the extensive features of the D7100 in the context of real-life photography. Nikon D7100 From Snapshots to Great Shots very successfully filled the bill for me, showing how to use all of the important features in a wide variety of photo situations. I believe this book would be very useful to any D7100 owner who is serious about learning to use the myriad capabilities of the camera to make great photos - whether they be beginner or experienced DSLR photographer. For more experienced and advanced DSLR photographers, Darrell Young's \\"Mastering the Nikon D7100\\" may be a better choice with less general photography info, and much more extensive detail about the what's and why's of setting up and using almost every camera feature.<br /><br />The 12 tips are a great way to start the book and together with the first chapter very quickly get you shooting. I found the book chock full of useful tips and techniques to make better photographs - using well-explained color photo examples and clear instructions and screenshots of how to set the D7100 for each of those examples. Usefully, there are frequent, but not excessive, references to specific pages in the official Nikon manual for further detail on specific settings.<br /><br />I would have liked more \\"do this because or you might want to do this other thing because\\". A very basic example is Playback after taking a shot. Why turn automatic preview ON rather than leave it OFF. John prefers ON, I prefer OFF. Why might you want to set the AE/AF button to any of the different available options - e.g. AF ON which I like. In the area of memory card selection there's no mention of the role using an 80 or 95 MB/s rather than a slower 10X or even 6X card plays in being able do continuous RAWshooting. One last nit to pick is that the D7100 uses an APS-C-size sensor resulting in a 1.5X multiplier in effective focal length. I didn't find anywhere in the text where John Batdorff made clear that the focal lengths shown in the example photos were or were not focal lengths as actually used on a DX camera rather than 35mm camera equivalents. It makes a huge difference - and forgive me if these old eyes just missed the citation.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Really enjoyed getting sucked into the Discworld for another tour.  This time following the evolution of steam engines and science penetrating the magic world.  Lots of old friends feature in the book like Harry King and The Patrician and even a very brief mention of the Nac Mac Feegle, bu it really is all about the railway.  Loved it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I was very disappointed to find that my new HDX version of this app has permanent ads as my old Kindle version had none<br />.  I am looking for a different weather app to replace it.
0316017922|5.0|This is probably one of Gladwell's defining works.  He digs into why the kind of success that creates what we perceive to be those outliers like Bill Gates is usually a whole lot more than just serendipity.  Highly recommended.  I'd argue that this work is as much a philosophical piece as it is scientific or business.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the AI is quite an upgrade over previous versions. The tablet controls are well done, allowing for immersive game play. If you enjoy CCG/TCG games I would certainly recommend this one. Regarding the hiccups... the game has crashed a couple of times, but not often enough that I have found it to be a hindrance.
1591840562|3.0|Dated, but a reasonable book by someone who's been there.  I'd search for the video of Guy Kawasaki doing this presentation with the same title at TieCon and watch that before forking out cash for a paper copy.

B00DXP7L88|4.0|Happy to have the final season, I have all the others. It has been running for 8 years, but I haven't really kept up with it.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|What a great movie! We loved learning Mike and Sully's backstory and seeing all of the new monster characters! My 3 year old son absolutely adores this movie! We have watched it over and over! We love the quality of Blu-Ray and the digital copy is great if we are going to be away from home for a long period of time. I can pull up the movie on my Amazon instant video and my son can watch it anywhere!
B00915G6WQ|4.0|Been following this series for a while. I love the character, after seeing case after case, something has to give.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Very different than his usual music, but enjoyable none the less. I especially like &#34;Can't Stay Alone Tonight&#34;. Some seems countryish, but that's ok.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This a typical John Grisham plot.  He does make the characters come alive with interesting lives but it needed to end sooner. The ending was predictable.
030758836X|2.0|I liked the first half of the book.  Part II starts and from that point forward, the characters and all the actions that take place are completely ridiculous.  Unbelievable.  Would never happen in 'real' life.  It basically took a turn for the worst - and that's how it ended.  Terrible ending.  I was so disappointed.  The beginning showed real promise.  I found both main characters interesting and could barely put the book down.  Unfortunately, by the second half of the book, it took me forever to finish the book, because I was starting to lose interest.  The story was turning into a very bad (made for TV) movie crime drama special that you wish you never wasted your time watching.  I am hesitant to try Dark Places.  Some friends have said it is good and better than Gone Girl.  I sure hope they are right, if I decided to buy Dark Places.  If I find myself finishing another book with an idiotic ending, I am not going to be happy.

B00ENXBUR2|5.0|I got the Man of Steel Collector's Edition combo pack, number 17,444 out of 50,000. Obviously I didn't buy it here. Got it directly from Warner Brothers online shop. Anyways it comes with what you see in the pictures. It's great to have on display(comes with a stand). UltraViolet makes it convenient to watch the movie online rather than using the physical discs. Still the discs are convenient for when you don't have internet. Then there's the special features disc, where you can see the making of the film and how much work they have put into making this movie such as the CGI that they use to create Krypton entirely or how they put together the Superman versus Zod fight, or how the actors were so great at what they do in certain scenes, such as the part of where that one trucker was being a bully to Clark Kent or how young Clark was sensing everything and ran to the Janitors closet. I am very satisfied with this. As for the movie itself, I will do sections of what I think of it.<br /><br />The Story -<br />Lots of action, it never gets boring. Unlike Superman Returns where it was slow and dull. Man Of Steel gets right into action where you see Jor-El fight off Zod's forces sometime after Superman's birth, that's how fast the action starts. There's some flash backs to Superman's childhood, I was able to relate to him because of those flash backs, due to him getting bullied and feeling like an outcast, I went through the same thing in my childhood. The action is exactly like the comics, because there is a lot of destruction of Metropolis. Just go read Action Comics #700 for proof of that. Anyways the fight scene between Superman and Zod was excellent, it was like a live action Dragonball Z fight. The part were Superman snaps Zod's neck got a lot of criticism, but did they not read any of the comics? Did they missed out on what Superman did to Zod in Superman 2? Superman kills Zod. There is no other way to stop him. Hell he even kills Nuclear Man in Superman 4. Anyways over all the story was great and epic.<br /><br />The Music -<br />Hans Zimmer does a fantastic job of scoring this film. It's one of the main reasons I love this film, it was a very epic and poetic score. What else is there to be said?  It's the same guy that scored The Dark Knight trilogy.<br /><br />Content -<br />When you get the Man Of Steel Collector's Edition, it comes with four discs and a code for the digital copy. The special features gives you many details about what happens behind the scenes when creating this movie. It also gives you a closer look at Planet Krypton and how much work they put into every last detail, including the language. I have yet to see the 3D version of the film, but since I don't have a 3D HDTV, it will have to wait. I have not used the Blu-Ray version of the film since I got my digital copy that I can view instead. I did however use the DVD version when I went to my brothers house, since they don't have internet, however one of them took the PS3 controller with him, making it impossible to see this movie on Blu-Ray without it. So I had to use the DVD version on the Xbox 360. Which solves everything as we eat pizza and enjoyed the movie. The casing that houses the discs folds out. The steel case looks nice when it's on the stand when being displayed. The magnets on the stand keeps that S-shield in place.<br /><br />Overall -<br />There is less than 50,000 of these available. So buy it when you have a chance, because once it's gone, the value of this will go up just like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collectors edition party wagon of the 1987 cartoon series. Should have paid $99.99 for it when I had the chance, now it sells for $400 on ebay ridiculously.  It is highly recommended for hardcore Superman fans out there, so grab it while you can.over all the story was great and epic.<br /><br />The Music -<br />Hans Zimmer does a fantastic job of scoring this film.

1442337966|5.0|I listen to this CD over and over, when I am feeling a little negative, I just listen to this and it helps me turn my mind set around....keeps me postive
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game was fun at first but then I found myself bored after a week or two. I didn't even over play it. Other than that it was a good game and it entertains well. :)
B00004VVND|4.0|Classic from the 70's.  Remember watching this as a kid, loved it then and still today. Even with todays computer generated special affects this movie still entertains.  If you've never seen it before its worth the watch.  If I'm not mistaken this movie inspired Jurassic  Park.
B00EH0K9H8|1.0|did not get a chance to play the Blu-ray DVD ... it did not play in my HP laptop or Sony Blu-ray player ..so I sent it back
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's a great little device that makes watching YouTube videos and Netflix incredibly easy. With the upcoming release of the development kit, hopefully we'll get some more apps to play around with!
B00E9O6C96|5.0|I've been smiling from ear to ear since I first booted this beast on. If you can live with the rough edges you won't find a better sounding dap in this price range. The sound is detailed and expansive with great dynamics, it's in a different  league than any other stand alone player I've owned - that includes Cowons, top end Sony's with the digital amp, Irivers, Zune, Mpio, Creative, Samsung, Sharp, Rio and others I can't think of ATM.  The build quality is very good , but the UI and navigation may put some people off.  Another thing is it runs a bit  warm and has froze a couple of times, I'm going to update the firmware and see what improvements Fiio has made. I've owned other Fiio products and have complete cofidence in them, they are not a fly by night company and build nice gear for great prices.    If you are looking for amazing sound from a stand alone dap and don't mind simplified browsing and UI and know a bit about computers and daps don't hesitate to grab this gem, your ears will thank you. :)    Of course I should add that with the high end Wolfson dac anything encoded with a lower bit rate is going to reveal lots of audio artifacts, especially with high end iems. I personally wouldn't use anything less than 256 kbs.    Edit : I should maybe explain a bit more on the sound qualities on the X3- by detail I mean the separation of the instruments is more pronounced and the tones more rich and complex. By dynamics I mean there is a proper difference between soft and loud passages. And lastly expansive refers to the sound stage in general, it sounds bigger and fuller not thin. In other words if you listen to the X3 a while and listen to the identical track say on your iPod it's going to sound constricted, lifeless and weak in comparison.    Edit 2, just to let folks know beta 3.2 is out and fixes album art and adds an 'all songs' option to the artist tab along with some fixes. Just do a search for Fiio x3 firmware and you will find the headfi link for downloading 3.2 beta. It works a charm, cheers! Firmware instructions: unzip firmware and place file in the root (base) folder of your micro SD card, turn off unit then hit the back and power button simultaneously and your unit will start updating- let it do its thing and you're golden. Select language, update database and boom-audio bliss.    Also to maybe help cut down on the one and two star reviews ..... THIS is not like an iPod in any way shape or form..if you're expecting to hook it up and have it populate your music on the device it isn't going to happen. My advice is if you haven't messed with an older mp3 player like a Rio, creative, cowon (iaudio) I would simply not buy this. I gave it 5 stars because I knew exactly what I was getting into- drag and drop simplicity with simple folder or tag browsing with awesome sound. Things have gotten a little better with firmware upgrades, but that's not going to help if you can't upgrade the firmware in the first place.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I loved how well-rounded this season ended up being and how FINAL it could have been but it just keeps going.  This is where it could have ended, and ended on a really good note (sort of, in a self-sacrificing sort of way) but the creators opened it back up.  Knowing what comes after this, while I still do enjoy it, it's just not the same.  Season five ended  Kripke's hand in the show, for the most part, so you really need to savor the last of it here.<br /><br />Changing Channels is one of the best episodes in the entire series and, really, you can't go wrong with the appearance of the Trickster.  Any episode with him in it will have you crying laughing.  And then The Real Ghostbusters where they knock a hole through the fourth wall and peek through it.  Again.  I'm not the biggest Becky fan but I appreciate a fangirl homage when I see it.<br /><br />Get it to finalize the Kripke reign and be happy.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Of the many, many books I have read, this is one I know I won't forget. Lovingly crafted, horrible in parts and hilarious in others, you won't put it down until it's finished. James, his friends Rose and Paddie, the schoolteacher, Lydia, the old &#34;glamour photographer,&#34; are all unforgettable. Grab a pot of tea and enjoy!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Before angels and demons and heaven and hell it began with an urban legend.  This is the absolute root of Supernatural and where Sam and Dean really grew roots into my cold, dead heart and made me feel again.  This was when Supernatural was all about horror and being scary with only a hint of Sam emo faces and FEELINGS and what the hell is happening in heaven now? going on.  The brothers are still under the shadow of their absent father and hunting a creature that pushed them onto this road to hunting in the first place.  Their end game was personal, their missions were contained and localized and they were still able to wrap their heads around the worlds they were straddling.  It was a simpler time, really, and I love me some simple horror.
B00079ZACM|4.0|Timeless, an amazing movie for its time. Still a pleasure to watch and see the  warm reaction of friends who view it nearly 75 years after it was released in 1939.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Even to this day, it is such a good read. Makes you wonder about what's next for mankind in space exploration
B00FPH6M82|1.0|I would go lower if it was possible. What a waste of my hard-worked money. This is an outrage from Will Smith to think that because he is well regarded as an actor, he cane dump this home made video on us and make easy money. It shouldn't even be offered as a feature movie at Amazon Instant Video.  This is a rip-off.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|.<br />My Granddaughter collects these and this by far is the prettiest one of all.  I love it and so will she.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Better and better than expected, great Ringo songs, and great songs of the other members of the All Starr Band, I was at the show in Lima and was the same than this DVD except little changes, highly recoomended
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great writing, directing and acting.  A true must see. It gets better with each season. I love it, my adult daughter and son in law agree
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|To me, best Paul's album at date, very beatle style mixed with Paul style and modern resources, highly  recommendable for any Beatle fan
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I got this for dad- who loves this movie, and wanted a copy for dud TV nights.  He's happy, which makes me pleased that I could find something for him that he really likes.
B004K58GSO|5.0|One of my favorite John Wayne movies. I have an old VCR of it but, seeing it in HD, on my BIG TV made it as enjoyable as seeing it the 1st time in the &#34;walk-in&#34;.

B006MW3UZW|4.0|It's entertaining and follows history pretty well...it's a bit hard to follow if you have not watched it from the beginning, but my wife loves it and the three episodes I've seen are certainly entertaining.
0307279189|5.0|I am not a runner but a friend recommended this book and it is a VERY enjoyable read.  Interesting, thought provoking, fluid reading, page turner.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Really great game with awesome graphics and also addicting. It's hard to stop playing once you start. Definitely hope they continue making more like this one. Only complaint is that I wish there were more missions and had different options for point of view.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|When I decided to get this app, I ignored all of the bad reviews. They are, sadly, true. I can't even get this app to download! If someone can get it to work I guess it could be a good app which is why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic  King.  This is a must read if you're going to read  Dr.  Sleep.  catch up with the characters  and location from  the Overlook  hotel.

B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|You can't drag things in your inventory. It's tutorial is lacking. I figured out how to get things into my hotbar, but it could use an update. I like it, but I would only suggest getting it when it's on sale. It isn't worth the regular price

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Like his other books I couldn't put it down. Of course I love his books so it was no surprised that it was a good read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|great book as always, loved the story and characters, i would recommend highly, great reading anytime, always like his books, legal stuff is still interesting to read
B004FOA84A|2.0|this game needs a help buttom, to at least help in the aero you are in on the game, i have gotten half way thru and for the life of me i can not get any far on the game,
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an all time great book. I don't read much at all, but got talked into it and couldn't put the thing down. Changed my whole outlook on the world. Marcus, and all the other SEALS, are true heroes. Heroes isn't really even a string enough word. Do yourself a favor and read this and then get everyone you know to read it and they will thank you.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this i play everyday, would like it to work better on the kindel. i play on my computer more then the kendel.
B0032KPE0G|4.0|It's a very smart movie and pokes fun at upper-middle class English life.  Unfortunately for that type of life in my opinion it didn't have much integrity.  I give the movie four stars for it being very smart, and I don't give it five for being little else but cheeky.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This is a fairly short story.  It gives a good look at a well thought out world with another magic system that is unique and fun to read about.<br /><br />The very basic synopsis is the world has been overrun by humans that have gained magical abilities making them in Essence Demi gods of varying strength.  And a lone force of 4-5 people are fighting back despite the horrible odds.<br /><br />There is action there is love there is future weapons and current weapons, magic and technology mixed in a believable and compelling way.<br /><br />I'm excited to see where he takes this world.
B00G4ZACLC|5.0|Love this version.  It's so nice to have different tiles.  Not much else to say<br />about this one.  It's GREAT!
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|Pure trashey words and behavior. For someone trying for excellence, for an elegant lifestyle this is not a 'How To' book for you.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This has been a really great, fun game but I seem to be out of<br />bubbles to play with. I can not afford to buy the extra helps.
B00BEIYM42|5.0|The film has excellent acting, all around, especially Terence Stamp and Ms. Atherton.  There is plenty of tragic situations intermixed with great  humor.  The storyline and plot is engaging, and rings true to the life situations in which the characters find themselves..  A story of human growth and the courage to face reality.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The book kept you interested all the way through. Twists and turns in the story and the dialogue were entertaining.
1476733953|5.0|Amazing book!  I bought it for a flight and it was so good I kept reading it after I landed where I was headed.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig is one of my favorite Bonds.  The movie and music are great and the series continues to rock.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app is so cool! I had never heard about flipboard before but now I use it (and pocket) all the time! It is perfect for keeping tabs on all of your social and web-based goings on and it lays it out in a fun and beautiful (not to mention easy to navigate) interactive magazine format. I am so happy I found this app!
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book goes far beyond any expectation I had. The detail that Daniel Kahneman goes into to explain how humans think and make decisions is not only eye opening but also unparalleled.<br /><br />He introduces how people think then goes into how they make decisions,  how emotions can be brought out and then goes on to explain what influences effect decisions such as environment, frame of mind etc. He cites countless scientific evidence to back up his explanations. While this book may be very deep for some if you take your time to truly understand and read between the lines you will also learn far beyond the thinking and decision making process such as realizing marketing companies, salesman and others have used techniques to frame your thinking patterns to make your decisions favorable to them.<br /><br />The unintended benefit of this book is that once you fully understand how people think, how they make decisions, what influences their thoughts and decisions you realize how easily all of these things could be manipulated.  Until I read this book I was not aware of how much of the things I view and read were done a specific way to affect my thinking and make me either want something or feel a particular way. Knowing this in turn can make you a better informed consumer, a better informed decision maker and a better negotiator.
B001E9641K|5.0|One of our family's favourite games!  We have been playing with this since last year (yes, I forgot to leave my feedback on this) and we still enjoy playing it every single time.

B000GIXEIG|3.0|ok movie.  They could have done it better but I guess it is what it is.  I'm not really impressed or enjoyed the movie.

0061205699|5.0|This is the class novel. It is a book that you can re read and can keep it in your bookcase.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is just awesome. I play it when I'm bored and I end up learning from it. It mentally makes you stronger and helps your eyes.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We are crazy about board games and we own more than 20 sets.  This is one of the sets that we often bring out and play.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I really like this game, it has given me hours of fun, and it can be a challenge. The different levels are good and the right moves can help you.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I've owned this for about a year now and have recommended it to co-workers. Works great with 13&#34; and 15&#34; Macbook Pros, and looks like it was made by Apple at a fraction of the price. It looks weak when you put it together but once you put a laptop on it, the weight of the machine will make the stand sturdy. Rubber strips at the top will keep the laptop from sliding, and there are plastic attachments you can clip on the ends to ensure that the laptop stays where it should. Sleek and functional.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great script writers, director, actors.  I hated the ending but hope season 4 will help to redeem it back to the way it use to be.
B004RL9T50|3.0|My kids were divided on this movie. Half of them love it and half seem almost angry about it. Word.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|love my first Seiko watch, the sweeping second hand and see-thru bottom shows off its mechanical engineering. the band could be nicer but over all the watch is way better than i had expected
B004EKCNMA|4.0|This is pretty true to the original story, but a little frightening at times. My kids ages 6-13 enjoyed it.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Dragon Vale is better than this but this game is ok but dragon vale is the better game this game is dumb because it's just a  rip of of dragon vale
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Good family movie, although I think the cartoon skirts could have been a tad longer. My kids liked the movie and I got a few laughs out of it, too.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It's the best game on the app store you can save your progress and continue right from that spot if you want to take a break co-op is really fun as well you can play with your friends or you can team up with someone random and See how far you can make it so I would say don't waste time just get the game now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun and addictive game to play that helps you focus and think outside the box which increasingly helps us with everyday life.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a awsum game love love love it would recommend to friends play all the time never put it down
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great!  Waited a long-time for this app for my kindle.  Enjoy exploring with candy crush.  It gets better an better and a new challenge every time.  Thanks
B003O86FMW|2.0|I mean I liked the first book,but  this one was predictable.<br />.'................SPOLER  AHEAD......................'......................................<br />THEY go back into the arena and u know Kattniss is gonna stay alive because how do they make the third book with out her.<br /><br />That's all I really have to say mean it was a good book and all but the only really surprise was is that district 12 is no more.
0380788624|5.0|An incredibly good book. It is a truly intelligent treatment of a very tough scientific subject (cryptography), which still manages to be fun and readable. The book follows several time separated stories - some much better then others. Yet even the ones that were not as thrilling for me made me stop and think more than once and infect my favorite part of the book is in a section I thought less interesting until that point. I only discovered Niel Stephenson's writing recently, but he is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. Get this book, get Anathem, and you'll see what I mean. It is fun, intelligent, educational, and just plain GOOD.
B00E6895M6|5.0|Amazing!!<br /><br />Really great quality,sounds good and they are great live too!!<br />I would recommend this cd to everyone, I will definitely buy their next album!!
B001974DG0|5.0|One of the best Dean koontz books I have read. Absolutely fabulous. I w recommend to one and all dog lovers.
B006QPX6IG|4.0|My 9 year old son watches this repeatedly.  He knows more about the Civil War than we do.  He loves this movie because it tells him the personal struggles of the men who fought.  He also enjoys learning about the battle strategies.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|if you are looking for a video site,this is the one for you.<br />you can watch any video at any time.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Just ok, not very challenging.  To be fair, I didn't get past the 6x6 because I got board.  But it was free
B00BP0MREQ|2.0|I received the book within the time frame stated.  I was aware it was used, so I didnt expect it to be in great condition. But the review stated it was a library book (no indication at this at all on book), sticker on front (but there was none) and used condition.  I was very disappointed, I was surprised at all the markings and writings inside the book.  It appeared someone was using it as references for maybe a book report.  Being it stated &#34;library book&#34; is why I was surprised at the markings. Every page has underlines and references writen. It is difficult to read the book in this condition. If the seller had been more clear about the markings I would not have purchased it.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|...am giving it only 4 stars b/c of the way Season 3 ended. That was a horrible plot twist at the very end! However, it is a wonderful series. I absolutely love it and can't wait for Season 4. I hope it won't disappoint!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This was a great series. The acting is nuanced and superb. The story and the atmosphere were compelling in every episode.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great story line and great acting and characters!  I've just finished Season 2 as well and it's equally as good.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Most are aware of the difficulties with alcoholism prior to seeing this movie and the endless cycles in the movie of Whip falling off the wagon seem rehashed from every other movie about alcoholics.  It really did not need over 2 hrs to tell the story and ultimately felt like a complete waste of time.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Honestly was a little dissapointed. I thought that the explanation for their divergence was very anti-climactic. And was especially dissapointed in the end. Not at the ending itself because it was surprising and well played but it contradicted what she had written several paragraphs before. All in all though, I enjoyed reading the series!!
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I normally like James Bond movies but this is the only one that I didn't watch until the end. It gets too implausible when the head of MI6 is hiding in an old house in Scotland, to be defended by only James Bond and an old man. This is the James Bond version of Home Alone. They could have done much better.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is a really good game, but if you don't have a microphone an your kindle fire, just use the settings and turn the plane game off.
052129374X|5.0|This is an important play. The guy who wrote it might have been beaten by somebody paid by rulers who want to get some real killers for all their expletive deleted activities.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|#BLUNDER purchase... wanted full soundtrack... wanted (to use in movie file) &#34;Do you hear the people sing&#34; &#34;Highlight&#34; soundtrack does have it and just found out you can't return Mp3 files to Amazon... AAAARRRGGGG! So if you're planning on getting the soundtrack for yourself or as a gift, DO NOT ORDER THIS Mp3 / CD. Get this one instead &#34;Les Misérables: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack [Deluxe Edition, Soundtrack]&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!!  Requires skill and thinking combined.  Would recommend candy crush but please have patience cause the game can stress you .
B002ZG980U|5.0|Inception is a trippy, fun movie that you will glad you watched it.  This movie comes from the mind of Christopher Nolan.  This movie features actors - Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, and many other great actors.<br /><br />Inception is directed, written, and produced by Christopher Nolan.  Christopher Nolan is best known for his Batman Trilogy, but this movie was made between \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Dark Knight Rises\\" and shows his brilliance.  If you liked movies like The 12 Monkeys or Fight Club then you will like this movie.<br /><br />The movie plays with ideas of what reality is.  Is reality what we see when we are awake or is it what we see when we are asleep?  The movie features ideas like dreams within dreams, and like I said its trippy.  But I loved this movie and its the perfect movie to own on DVD, because you will want to watch this movie more than once.  I enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|For those of us in the airline business, the early scenes of Flight hit too close to home. I see myself and my cohorts as potential causalities in these scenarios and it's plain uncomfortable. It's a dangerous job we do-- when rules aren't followed. I've never been guilty of intoxicating late night overnights; in fact, most of my cohorts are darn responsible on short overnights and follow the rules. Believe it or not. However, every apple has it's seeds, bad ones included.<br /><br />Whip's expert recovery skills are nothing short of impressive. Sober or not, his ability to recover an inverted plane is heroic and left me, guilty so, internally applauding him despite the fact that in preceding scenes he is shown illegally consuming alcohol from the airplane's galley.<br /><br />I felt conflicted. Is he likeable? I didn't know what to make of the Whip. I spent the entire film with a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other, both being little Whip's trying to change my mind.<br /><br />On one hand, he's an arrogant prick that breaks all the rules. He's in denial and doesn't believe he's an alcoholic and drug addict-- this tragically resulting in a divorce from his wife and estrangement from his son. He is a liar, who immediately after the crash, tries to shift blame on faulty maintenance and manufacturing issues. At the funeral of Trina, a flight attendant with whom he had an affair, he selfishly and inappropriately asks a surviving flight attendant to lie to the NTSB about his condition that day, leaving her in disbelief.<br /><br />One the other hand, he does show genuine remorse. Guilt even. He trashes his alcohol and flushes his drugs, determined not to use again, then he relapses. Again. And again. There is a long pause in a hotel scene where he puts down a bottle of alcohol. We wait. We think he's resisted only to see his hand violently grab the bottle after all. He is a struggling individual and I sympathized with that. He's relatable because many of us have addictions and we all have internal struggles. He rescues a drugged addicted woman from an abusive landlord. He is also a talented pilot that calmly saved all but six lives on his plane, a feat every other pilot failed to do in a simulator.<br /><br />In the end, we see an epiphany in Whip. Ironically, what happens to him is a happy ending. He is no longer lying to himself and even states that he is now \\"free\\" and is approached with a question from his son that many of us struggle with, \\"who are you?\\" Once again, a question I was conflicted on throughout the film when trying to determine if I liked Whip or not.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable film. It does a very interesting job at examining the complexities of a human being. No one is strictly good or bad, right or wrong. We all have faults and we all have strengths, as evident in Whip's character. Great film.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|One of the best releases by Stryper ever. They set out to recapture that 80's vibe that they were known for, and I say they did it! Don't misunderstand though, it does not sound dated at all, it just sounds more like them throughout. Most people rank this as their most consistently heavy offering - meaning on the whole, there is more of a heavy feel throughout every song on this release than usual. Whatever the critics say about it, this is one fan who is loving this release.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is so much fun it is awesome I cant even describe it.From a scale of one to ten through the roof.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I think this release is a more consistent release, and they have really found their groove throughout. Jame's vocals sound much more relaxed throughout, and the band shreds as usual. More of a prog feel throughout, with less of a metal feel, and I keep hearing hints of Rush here. I enjoyed the last release, but feel this one is a tad bit better and sounds like the boys are more comfortable with the new line-up. Overall, great stuff.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|When they say in app purchasing they mean it, you  can only play the game so far until you run out of &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34;. The only way to get those pearls is to either open a treasure chest (which cost 5 pearls to open) or purchase more for real money. The first couple of chests will give you 8 pearls for5, not too bad an investment, then a couple more...when they have you hooked on the chests, they start giving you 2 or 3 hundred algea (food for fish &amp; plants)...I got to the point in the game where I can't go any further in the quests because they all require pearls if you want to purchase a plant or whatever. I'm done, gonna un-install it.
B00F1W1SHG|5.0|Great quality recording, great shots, great musicianship as always. I love Mangini, but as a huge fan of Portnoy, I do miss his style of playing on the older songs. I am not even going to go any further on the topic though, Mangini and the boys shred amazingly on this set, and the bonus material is always fun and insightful, and does so here too.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Just finished this and I highly recommend it as an amazingly brave account that anyone interested in the struggles of modern Pakistan should read.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|I love most everything Gov't Mule does, and this new one is no exception. Lot's of great songs filled with bluesy riffs and feeling - and the second disc of other band's playing their tracks is a fun time too. Different feelings are brought to the songs, making for a whole new experience.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Well it's fun butt what is an easier way to get coins and what about better graphics. It is real fun.though
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Summary: 4 Stars for the Movie, 2 Stars for the features of the Blu-Ray. Overall, this movie was enjoyable, although it relied on action sequences too much (especially the over-long final fight sequence), but it is a nice reboot of the series, and Henry Cavill is a great Man of Steel. What Disappoints me with this release is the fact that it only offers the &#34;Ultra-Violet&#34; Digital Streaming capability and not a full digital copy. When will studios learn that this isn't not a feature anyone enjoys? Just give me my digital copy.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I loved this movie more the second time I watched it. Clearly setting itself apart from the Superman films that came before it, Man of Steel delivers a Superman for the modern age. I am looking forward to Zack Snyder's follow-up to this film which will feature Batman alongside Cavill's Superman. The extras in this set are great and I love that we are not missing features on the basic release of the film, as some studios decide to only put the good stuff on the 3D sets. The sound, picture, and features are what to be expected these days and I suggest Man of Steel to any superhero fan out there.
B0072OFM28|5.0|great series fast shipping amazing series with a wonderful ending! I was amazed by everything in the show!  would suggest to others!
B00GINENG0|5.0|This game is so addicting! Forget Pou and Boo, this beats those games by a kazillion! You know those games that you're so good at, you could write a book about? Yeah, this is my game. Bottom point, you get that I looove this game.
B00B52F278|5.0|everyone show see this show! I have seen it numerous times it is so amazing!  I just cant imagine what life was like in that time!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It worked fine, I set it and it woke me up, not sure what more I could want from an alarm.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|amazing book! Very well written and helped with some quests that I have always had with what happens when we die
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Very Good album. I bought it for the Deep but the rest of the album is also very good. Not really my style in music but she is a great singer.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|amazing book that is so much better than the movie!  The movie was good but within the pages of Shutter Island I was able to truly connect with the charachters
B00000634J|5.0|John is the closest thing to a God in music. What else can you say about all of the Beatles and John is the KING. Must own.
B00FHB7398|4.0|Good story line but keeps kicking me back to main page. Otherwise would give five stars. Love the hidden object scenes.
B0012GMY64|5.0|A great album by a great and classic artist. Some voices are just classics. When you buy this album, you will she what I mean.
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|needs to work on these apts..started out getting it but had a hard time getting to download so I cancel it..
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I was not familiar with these guys. I heard a great song and bought the album. I am pleased with the album and will recommend it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The game is a fun game that is challenging, but not too hard.  Even better is that no permissions are required.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|The most underrated of all the Beatles, except Ringo of course. Just a great album, with fantastic music and words by a true LEGEND. A word used too much in R and R. It's a great album.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you like Grisham, you'll love this book. It's been awhile since I've read one of his books and it was hard to put this one down.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Incubus rocks. This is a surprisingly good album and I like most of the cuts that are on it. Very good and a good buy.
B005D0RDKW|2.0|BRUTAL acting. Really. Really. Really. Bad. The musical performance is OK but ruined by the acting. Not recommended at all.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great movie, I & my granddaughters love it, I think we have watched it many times. We can't wait to watch the next movie. Funny. :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that minion rush is soooooo awesome.I play on it for hours.if u don't have this app u should really get this app Cuz if u don't then ur missing out allot of fun.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Easy interface with a richer strategy choice than a lot of mmo.  Money eventually becomes a requirement. I have Benn playing so far for two days.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Go on a adventure with your friends and explore the village it is the best selling game in the wold so cool
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />This story seemed--to me--a refreshing change back to the &#34;old-style&#34; Pendergast.  His character seemed to regain much of his beloved &#34;superiority&#34; and unerring instincts that were sadly lacking from some previous books.  Although I'm not a fan of Corrie Swanson (with the exception of her debut in STILL LIFE WITH CROWS), her character didn't bother me quite as much or &#34;detract&#34; unnecessarily from the overall narrative.<br /><br />Also pleasant to note was that this was a stand-alone novel, and not the start of yet another trilogy.  I really enjoy most of the Preston/Child novels, and hope that the authors continue to develop Pendergast's character as the enigmatic force that he started out as, through additional non-series novels.<br /><br />Recommended!
B00003W8NM|5.0|When you are planning an at home movie night and you say \\"Fight Club?\\"... when your company looks at you with innocent and curious eyes; all you can hear in your head is Tyler Durdens' voice.<br />Being the one that knows the film word for word and watching the one who doesn't know the rules is intense and exciting.<br />I am Jacks' endorphines.
B00F522C7C|3.0|I only wanted one copy and was sent and charged for 2.  I did get a friend to buy the other one, so not a big deal.
1451666179|5.0|Strangely inspiring, and has a very unique illustration style. Also it's hilarious and definitely worth the money.<br /><br />All the monies.<br /><br />Sorry.
140003180X|5.0|His books are very entertaining. My husband has read them all. Watched some of the movies too. Takes you to a different way of life.
B000055ZB8|5.0|The grandaddy of all vampire movies. It takes more than one viewing to really get it. But there's something about the old feel of this film that can't be replicated with newer, gorier works.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I chose this rating because I'm hoping that if I rate it high enough you will see the advantage to actually making this App compatible with the Kindle Fire
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|From book 1 to the end of book 3, wonderful and thought provoking. Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing this.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|This is a fantastic music album.  I love all of the songs on this CD...  good beats, great sound and honest, down-to-earth lyrics.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book. It was very exciting, both in action and the relationship between characters. The only part that let me down was the revelation about the two lead characters toward the end of the story. I hear that the twists and turns aren't over, though, and I'm excited to read more.
B0026P3G12|5.0|We love Susan Boyle's journey and her songs!  Bought 10 as Christmas gifts Dec 2012.  Everyone said they loved the songs and was uplifted for the Christmas season!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|wasn't sure how this was going to play on a kindle but its pretty easy to control and easy to use.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|had trouble making it work and didn't want to mess with contacting anyone about it, too time consuming. no good.
159448385X|5.0|I had never read the Kite Runner, so didn't feel tempted to make comparisons, positive or negative. This book was recommended to me as a good example of Multiple POV in a novel. So, I borrowed a copy from the local library, along with two others that were supposed to be models.<br /><br />I started reading this book  as the second choice, but didn't expect much, to be honest. I couldn't quite see myself interested in a book about two Afghan women married to the same brute of a husband. I was very surprised in that the author's prose style captured me right away, and then the developing story of two Afghan women from different backgrounds and different generations put hooks in me fairly soon, so I kept on reading.<br /><br />I knew very little about Afghanistan and its culture, basically what I gathered from various news items during the long term of our military engagement there, so I was clearly a neophyte. I feel that the author revealed a lot about the Afghan people and their customs. It also gave me a glimpse of their history from the beginning of the Soviet presence - and what led to it - until the Bush administration's attack on the nation that harbored terrorist camps and Osama bin Laden. But I was most engaged by the tale of Mariam, the first protagonist, and her limited early life in the country as a shunted-off illegitimate child of a married man and very negative mother. You see the limitations placed on her from the very beginning, and how she was brought up with very little learning and only vague aspirations for a future for herself.<br /><br />Later in the book the other protagonist, Laila, an educated fair-haired girl in Kabul, is introduced as a young child with a former teacher for her father, and a neglectful mother, both of whom had become estranged with each other in later years.<br /><br />Well, the story has been described by earlier reviewers, and I don't want to reveal highlights that might spoil the book for someone who hasn't read it yet. But the two women wind up being married - not by their free choice - to the same much older man who is brutal and likes to beat them and kick them around to show he's the husband and the boss of his house. Wow! A perfect example of the  shameful treatment of women in a religiously conservative  patriarchal society.  I was very pleased when Mariam attacked her husband, but not what it led to for her.<br /><br />I read a couple of the one-star reviews and couldn't disagree with them more. I was fully engaged with the characters from the beginning, liked the author's prose style, and the ending left a lasting impression on me. It's not a book I'll forget, and I was glad that I read it, though it put me on an emotional roller coaster. It's not a cheery or  fairy-tale story, but is full of life with all its sorrows, but it does end on a positive but reflective note.<br /><br />One aside: I don't think the author wrote disparagingly of Islam, but by merely telling the truth he showed to me that all religious beliefs can be perverted  to serve brutal ends. The restrictions placed on women in Kabul when the Taliban took over are things I can't excuse or forget. They must really hate and fear women, in the final analysis.But the two women wind up being married - not by their free choice - to the same much older man who is brutal and likes to beat them and kick them around to show he's the husband and the boss of his house.

B00005JA8B|5.0|One of the best all time horror pictures.  The &#34;monster&#34; is a work of art and completly believable.  No computer tricks in this film; just pure suspense.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|Written with the usual Halberstam style and attention to detail. This book is not only entertaining, it is educational at multiple levels. The book provides insight into history along with the personalities, motivations, and behind the scenes positioning that made things happen. This book sets the record straight and corrects many legends of the American media.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love Nathan Fillion, and the series is very good. The plot seems<br />believable and is carried out with action and humor at times.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|this is a book that really has many other stories in it. There were abrupt changes with those stories and I was wondering where is the author going with this and how is it related to the rest of the characters. I did like the initial character and their story line.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It looks like fun, I just haven't figured out how to play it yet. The graphics are amazing! The End
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I think this is the best book of the trilogy. I wish the author was still with the living and contributing further to this literary world.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Hey Its Sunnydale Chick here.....You know when there's that one girl out there who knows all about Scary Movies (cause I've seen them since I was a kid) and EVERYBODY might hate her review? Well this is her; and I was actually going to give this movie a 1, but I only absolutely LOVE 1 scene. I LOVE the gory stuff, not to common...but my favorite scene is also like the Urban Legend of the high beams.....The rest is a rant....which we'll get to in a minute. But my FAVORITE scene is when they're in the car....and they play that cool version of Jeepers Creepers on the radio.....while completely oblivious to the creature who's on top of the cop car behind then....THEN.....it hacks the cops head clean off! Now for the rant......1st and foremost...why do they keep changing the creature? It's like 3 times in the movie, the cat lady scene is confusing and REALLY NOT needed.....and they should've had an ending that made sense.....cause a creature (who's changed 3 times.....suddenly has become like a human stalker that knew about this guy like years back because he was keeping tabs on him? That Doesn't make sense! And it certainly doesn't add up to let's go make some sequels....so except for my scene....I'm giving this a big thumbs down!
B008JFUOWM|5.0|If you like cars and action this movie is for you. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are the best dual action stars in action entertainment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cute game. Lots of challenges.<br />Too many that require actual purchase. Bummer. Not enough that earn coins to buy extras.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Excellent Movie, I really like the Christian Bale he an excellent actor. Christian doesn't disappoint I've watched it many times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read . I love the shock of things happening and all the violence never ever have I read such a good book!

0316726729|5.0|I am a RHCP fan. This is a book that details Anthony Kiedis' journey. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to another RHCP fan.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found this to be a very interesting perspective on Christianity. Hard to believe that this history is not more widely known. It makes sense and really causes one to think about how differently things may have played out.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I cant forget the times I pay for the tokens and games get lost and u cant get the back or get credit for the games u loose please get better with this game or people will stop playing or will u continue to cheat people get it together God watching u and so r ur consumers and Christmas. is coming.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I got to admit, I was skeptical at first I kept thinking &quot;oh just another lame racing game, it's not worth the download&quot; but then I tried it and haven't stopped playing it since.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I think this is a fun game, however the need to purchase coins to accomplish some of the tasks is annoying and too costly.  I think charging 200 coins to fully upgrade everything is too much.,
0385523912|4.0|Fascinating read about the real lives of North Koreans and how sheltered they are from the rest of the world.  Would recommend to anyone interested in what's happening in North Korea.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator I have found.  Large keys clearly marked makes it easy to use (no mistakes due to fat fingers). Like the feature of seeing running total and amount being added or deducted as long calculations are made.  I highly recommend this calculator.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Time to Kill was one of the best books I ever read.  This 'Continuation' of those magnificent characters is like revisiting a favorite place!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the simplicity of this calculator. For someone my age, the big buttons are a huge plus. I recommend it highly.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I'm always leery about getting these types of games.  I start playing and the progression takes too long, so I quit because I get bored. So far, and I've only been playing this for a few hours,  I'm pretty happy with the game.  The added bonus is so far I haven't been prompted to use my own money to buy features. I guess only time will tell with that.  Overall a decent game thus far.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I can learn and practice as much as I need and translate the internet. Two very good things for free. :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game on glad it's on kindle they need to hurry and update with more levels soon I am addicted.
B004FDMJOS|5.0|The classic American celluloid.  And, my wife tells me the Madarin subtitles are good.  At this time of impending international crisis, I wish Americans would remember who the Axis Powers were.  China is not our enemy.  Japan brutalized all in its path........
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses you'll love this game. Even my 3 year old wants to play it now. Love love love it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i luv this game but there are too many pop ups. when i want to play i want to tap it and an ad won't come up in my way and lead me to something i don't want to buy. but this game is great for the whole family to enjoy.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Very entertaining.  A fun movie. Loved it. Fun for the whole family. Great parody of the sci-fi sitcoms I grew up with,
B004MPJZ1O|2.0|I wondered what was the purpose of this movie. Was it to reveal the horrors of rape? The idiocy of those men, one with pathetic mental disabilities who was cruelly used?  The acting was like a teenage horror movie. The revenge a display of lots of blood.  For those of us horror fans, I wouldn't recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a awesome game to play so get it so have a awesome day today 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8 9 10
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very good read, as usual.  Grisham has a real way with words!  However, this was a lot like all the rest.  The Deep South, Blacks and lawyering.  Grisham never fails to entertain.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was a wonderful read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in it. You should totally read it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan's analytical text offers a comparative picture of the historical Jesus and that Jesus distorted by organized religion.  Aslan's book shows that present day organized religion is virtually identical to Judaism of two thousand years ago. Jesus opposed the distortion offered by church leaders.  He did not, however, abandon the faith in which he was raised. He was a jew and believed it unacceptable to associate with non-jews. Contrary to modern belief, he did not declare himself God. I urge everyone, including those adhering to a faith community, to read this book.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|First of all, I was putting off finishing the trilogy because of all the horrible reviews this book has received.  Having read it last night, I am glad that I finally decided to stop paying attention to the reviews and judge for myself.  I will say that the first two titles in the series are, in general, better books, but Allegiant was certainly not terrible, nor a disappointment.  I'm not going to go into plot details here, because I really think people should judge this one for themselves.  The alternating points of view from Tris and Four was a bit confusing at times because there was not enough differentiation between the tone of the two characters to always be able to tell who was speaking, but that certainly did not make the book unreadable.  To say that I enjoyed the book would be a little dishonest, as there is little enjoyable material in this part of the story, but I am glad that I read it,  and I think fans of the series will benefit from finishing it.  After all, fans of a series cannot expect all the conflict in the story to be happily resolved and neatly wrapped up at the end.  Life doesn't work that way, which is precisely what makes this story more &#34;real&#34; and more plausible to me than a fairy-tale ending where all the characters lived happily ever after,
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I'm very happy with my purchase, I'm a big fan of the show, and look forward to watching this with my daughter
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Such a captivating story! Once I started I could not put it down and read it in an afternoon. Excellent.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I'm very happy with my purchase, I'm a big fan of the show and look forward to watch this with my daughter
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best Masterpiece I've ever seen -- much better than Upstairs Downstairs, the only series that was even comparable.  Beware of Season 3's surprising losses of characters you loved -- the actors playing them wanted to move on to other things.  It's well worth watching.  I got so hooked last year that I cheated and watched the UK Season 4 online before it was available here.  I liked it so much that I'll still watch it when it is available here.
078322799X|4.0|I'd completely forgotten about this little gem. This is before he began his stint on Spin City, and amongst other things - remembered it on a whim.<br />Glad I did as this movie is a rather good one. Memorable scenes, amazing location, a plot that isn't the newest or mind boggling type, but still one that'll grab your attention and keep you wrapped on the &#34;Guess Who&#34; mentality.<br />All in all, definitely 4 starts.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|I'd  heard about this books awhile ago but just got around to reading it. I enjoyed the setting and the characters very much.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty cool app. Wish they gave free dreesup thing and the feed would give energy. It would also be nice if you could pick your horse in the beginning
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is not entirely plug and play, but very close. Use your computer to guide you through the website instructions while connecting through your smart device.  Currently streaming Pandora through my HDMI equipped Stereo and the sound quality is great.  Wife is gone so I am testing, only a few broken knickknacks shaken off the shelf.  Maybe later Ill settle down and watch something on Netflix, maybe.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rules the world. Sure, it's 7 bucks but who cares? It's worth it. If you like to play minecraft, and you're on these long car trips to Canada or something, don't bother to bring your laptop. Just bring your Kindle! I love this game.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Leo and Toby are AMAZING in this movie. Increadibly well done. I haven't enjoyed a movie in a very long time and this one was definitely worth my time.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The collection was a gift. And they loved it. The only thing I would like to have seen is that it didn't show up when they said it would,<br />it was late by 3 days.
B006QV30JU|4.0|Good old musical. I recently saw the play and had to see how the original was done. Decent Gene Kelly movie.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I love Eggers writing.  I heard very negative things from some of my silicon valley friends that stood in stark contrast to the literary reviews I've seen. The literary reviews were correct - this is a spectacular book at many levels. It's especially important for any working on - or living in - the future.
B0088WLEL6|5.0|Excellent writing acting and plot. Like Firefly it ended way to soon. SYFY has such a low tolerance for slow to catch on shows and it is a shame because both series' have been extremely popular after they were cancelled. Ah such is life when turds like Warehouse 13 are being considered for a 5th series and these fine shows are no more. If SYFY as it claims made a 2nd season finale that tied up lose ends they were wrong in typical style they left us with a cliff hanger that will never be finished at least by them. Ah SYFY how I love to hate you.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch is a well written long book that is hard to put down. One of the best reads of 2013.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I had this for my dsi- I was real excited to find it was on amazon! its so imaginative and allows interpretation. one of my fab games!
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Agent Pendergast and couldn't wait to read this next installment.  It was, however, disappointing.  It wasn't the page turner that I've come to expect.  Normally I finish these books in a couple sittings but this one took me a couple weeks to get through it.  I never really got into it and found other books to read in between chapters.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The name Steve Jobs has almost become synonymous not only with the company he co-founded, Apple, but also the miniature electronic gadgets that he helped create. Whether you are an Apple disciple or have never owned an Apple product in your life, there is no denying that Steve Jobs has had an enormous impact on our world.<br /><br />Jobs was born in 1955 and grew up as a child who loved tinkering with electronics. After dropping out of college, he and a friend of his, Steve Wozniak, would found Apple Computer in 1976. Wozniak was more the brains of the operation in building the first Apple computers while Jobs knew how to market and design the look of the products.<br /><br />The success of Apple would only continue to grow. Although there would be failures along the way such as the Lisa computer, Apple would find success with its famous Macintosh released in 1984. Tensions between him and Apple management, notably with then-CEO John Sculley, led Jobs to be fired from Apple in 1985.<br /><br />During his time away from Apple, Jobs pursued two separate endeavors. First was NeXT, another computer company aimed at niche markets that ultimately was considered a failure. Jobs was a key figure in the spinning off of a division of Lucasfilm that became known as Pixar. Pixar became famous for its high-quality animated films.<br /><br />Apple seemed to be directionless for the time Jobs was away. In 1997, he came to an agreement to return to Apple first as interim and then permanent CEO serving in that position until he resigned in 2011. During this period, Apple became famous for branching out into other industries such as music. A slew of products came out of Apple such as the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad.<br /><br />Sadly, Jobs' health seriously declined during his last years as he suffered from pancreatic cancer. He died in October 2011.<br /><br />Despite being more than 600 pages in length, the book moves at very brisk pace. Jobs was a man who did a lot duringhis life and as such the book is full of stories and anecdotes that not only concern his professional work, but also his personal life.<br /><br />The book looks at Jobs's many strange behaviors. He practiced some form of vegetarianism/veganism for most of his life often to extremes and sometimes unhealthily. Early in his life, he became convinced that his strict diet meant he did not have to use deodorant or take regular showers much to the consternation of others.<br /><br />He could often be mean to others in his conduct in his work. Jobs was a perfectionist and accepted nothing less than the highest quality of work. He had a dichotomous view of things, such as how when confronted with an idea from others it could either be totally awesome or completely crappy with little thought in between. Likewise, employees could either be a genius or absolutely moronic, sometimes in the same day.<br /><br />The book also discusses Jobs's \\"reality distortion field\\" and how he could simply will something to happen. If an engineer said it could not be done, Jobs had the ability to convince them otherwise.<br /><br />Finally, the book also looks at Jobs's numerous and sometimes difficult personal relationships. He fathered a daughter with his girlfriend in his early twenties and ended up having a difficult and sporadic relationship with her. He seemed to have trouble finding the right woman and his odd behaviors made it difficult.<br /><br />I found this to be an excellent book on the life of Steve Jobs. Whether you love him or hate him, this book was an exciting read that I found difficult to put down. I would recommend this book to those interested in Steve Jobs or the history of the computer industry.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Great new sound from Robert Plant, and a fantastic group of musicians backing him on this album!  Buy it!  You won't be disappointed!

0062238868|3.0|I can't give a full review or rating on this particular book as it was purchased as a gift for my brother-in-law. I can say that he liked it.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I've had these for a couple of years now.  When I first got them, I was really wowed by them.  They were much better than the over the ear headphones I had been using, and enabled me to hear things I had missed before.  After living with them for a long time, however, I have come to the conclusion that they are unnaturally bright.  What enabled me to hear things I missed before was a nasty peak in the presence/high frequency range.  I use them for voiceover work (dry, deep male voice.)  They overemphasize sibilance and they also have an audible metallic resonance to them at higher volumes.  Like the old JBL L-100 speakers back in the 70's, these are the &#34;studio standard.&#34;  They are great for the 99th time you've listened to a mix and you want any flaws in it to really stand out, but are fatiguing for long term listening.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|It is very very fun I practically play it all day even though it runs down my battery:(... but still super fun!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I rarely give a book 5 stars, but this one is ridiculous in every silly and adorably way. I recommend it on the regular. The plot is literally in the title so no surprises in the basic story, but the storytelling is full of zing with the fun and colorful characters. The circumstances are silly but oddly logical for the characters and their circumstances.<br /><br />I don't usually read 'vampire' novels but this doesn't have the same dark nature and depressing solitude many vampire romance novels rely on.<br /><br />&#34;How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire&#34; will pull you into the rest of the 'Love at Stake' books, so clear your reading list.
B00E5MXU4C|5.0|You have to ponder some of the meanings like \\"shit hot\\" and crisps but it keeps your mind agile! The mysteries are intriguing and the characters endearing. So grab one of her books and enjoy!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book teaches such a valuable lesson of kindness.  While I liked some of the perspectives better than others, they all helped the reader fall in love with the main character Auggie.  I can't wait to recommend this book to my 5th grade students.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Very fun movie!  My daughter and I have been watching this movie since she was a little girl - she's now 26.  It's one of her favorites.  Everyone should have s copy of this in their library.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great story.  I loved it so much I am sending to my nephews for Christmas this year.  There are many great lessons to learn from this story.  The story is told from the point of view of several characters.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Thank the stars that Pierce Brosnen is no longer OO7.  I love how Daniel Craig plays the character, and this movie gives some great backstory on the character of James Bond.

B0028MBKVG|3.0|It is a good entertainment, however the author sometimes exaggerates and add lot of personal feelings.  Sometimes, I had the feeling that he tried to make it more exciting - artificial than it really was.
0553801473|4.0|This book doesn't have the &#34;fire&#34; nor the &#34;ice&#34; that the previous four books in the series.  The author said that this book was so long he had to break it into two books.  I think that this fifth book could have been seriously edited so that he could have finished this part of the story.  Perhaps I am just frustrated and disappointed that I have to wait another five years for the next book to come out.  Arrgghh!  And then another five years for the final (or next to last) book of the series.  I fear the story will never be finished.
B002A9THA8|5.0|Great movie.  Everyone will enjoy this movie.  Well done and it even plays well on this free player that amazon makes us use.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great interface, easy to use and excellent visual to interaction with your Kindle Fire and management of storage, memory and other stuff that's make your tablet crashes and get slow...
B0055SWM08|4.0|I have never played any game like this before.  It is fun and I can feel my brain working.  Reminds me just a little bit of Minesweeper.  Quick and addictive.
B001UW58YK|4.0|Good sound and nice image in Blu-ray. Buble is a great singer and his fans get what they want with this show.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It is a well thought out book, goes beyond the Zombie genre. A satire on the modern and not so modern world, the way we know it today. Though the interview and conversation structure does distract and is at time annoying, making you want for a streamlined plot line. But a good read, maybe not as engrossing as I wanted it to be.
B00E5N8DGG|4.0|Nice quality sound and picture. The boys are ageing but can still rock. You can tell the show was fun in a small venue.
B00EKTCQCC|5.0|This is great!  All body systems in high detail for only $29.99  That is a great bargain!  I am sorry for the ones who rated this ap at only One Star; this ap is worth every penny it costs.  What is more of a bargain is that I only pay one time and I can install the complete ap in all my devices.  That is gold!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is helpful and also it helps the creativity in your mind it helps all ages!!:)is t helped me a lot and the game is amazing !the unicorns and Pegasus are amazing !!!!:)
098357670X|5.0|The most comprehensive, intelligently written and visually stunning book on caricature ever!  Tom Richmond is truly a master at not only his skill but also getting the educational elements across to those who are interested in art and learning the skill of creating quality caricatures.
B0042JSSVI|5.0|It mixes known facts and historic events in away that brings the characters to life and we find ourselves emotionally involved in their lives.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this book! Grisham went through a period of writing where the story lagged along. This was a good story and a good ending. It was a mystery and done well. I have recommended it to others and will give it for an xmas gift. NJH

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Best game on PSV so far, the Vita is lacking on RPG and P4Golden delivers like no other, I played the original version for PS2 and this one has some added content that adds even more value to the whole Social Link business. I would recommend to go into settings and activate the auto text thing on spoken dialogue, it makes the experience smoother without all the X smashing, platinum is hard if you don't know what to look for, but all in all with 175+ hours on it I still find it enjoyable, can't bring myself to delete it (now I wish I bought the card)
1623360277|5.0|I found the starch centered diet through the documentary, &#34;Forks Over Knives&#34; and then &#34;The Starch Solution&#34;.  This way of living has changed my experience of my life.  My father and brother dealt with Type ll Diabetes and both died very young, my father before he was 50 and my brother at age 54.  I felt I was heading down a similar path, the low carb diets just did not cut it long term.  I have lost 61 pounds eating plants, centered around starches, but the changes in levels of pain and inflammation began even before the weight started coming off.  &#34;The Starch Solution&#34; has been a revelation of scientific proof as well as proof in my life and the lives of thousands of others who have taken the opportunity to change their lives for the better.  I am purchasing enough books to give as gifts to friends and family this year.  I have two that I lend out and it's just not enough.  I must thank the people that have given us the information to transform our lives and the paths that we choose.  Dr. John and Mary McDougall, Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyne, Dr. Neal Barnard, Dr. Pam Popper, Doug Lisle, Jeff Novick , Chef AJ and the people at True North, and countless others.  Very Thankful for you all!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game,it's fun to play and really helps you learn how to take care of a horse. I love horses and when I saw this game I really wanted to try it since I don't have any horses in real life. The only two problems are that there is to many adds that pop up when your trying  to take care of your horse. The other problem is that it lags and freezes sometimes but ,it usually always goes back to regular but It's kinda hard to compete when it lags. I think this is a really good game and everybody who has a device that can download games,and loves horses should get this game.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great little tool to carry in your hunting bag or for camping. Puts a great edge on your knife and with the diamond rod and  it's good for a serrated blade too.<br /><br />I take this with me on camp outs with the scouts.<br /><br />Nice price...

B00FXMECS6|1.0|Awefully boring. Slow. First one 5 stars in my opinion. This was not even worth renting. Don't waste your time.
B000YMHOUS|1.0|It's my opinion that the best films instruct and inspire; they offer up such a desirable image of what life could, and should be, crystallized onto the visual medium, thereby powerfully motivating us less-visionary beings into recognition, desire, and ultimately covetous positive action. We need more of what we see exemplified on screen in our own lives, we realize, and we then reach out to bring that material into our reality, perfecting our helplessly imperfect state, even if by only a thought. Assessing the merits of this film from that basis, I arrived at a 1 star rating. In the next paragraphs I will try to elaborate and justify this low rating, explaining why the film has nothing to offer based upon this criteria.<br /><br />I will pause here to reveal a little about myself at this moment, least I be mistaken for some religious zealot or anti-feminist male chauvinist. I'm a woman; my mother is feminist; I grew up in a largely secular environment; I worked in a male dominated, scientific field; my best friend is a liberal. I still maintain this film has nothing positive to offer the world.<br /><br />The film opens with some problems that are very close to my heart: a declining standard of living in the States, families struggling with divorce, parents unable to provide adequate time and attention to their children, and children consequently growing up neglected, without the ability to develop and sustain respectful, lasting, loving and intimate relationships. These problems are very well depicted in the mother who cannot compose herself enough to be a present role model for her son, who devotes his life to a 50s TV show which he watches religiously, pining away for the idyllic life he feels he sees there. They are also on display in the self-absorption of the sister, played by Witherspoon, who not only continually expresses herself rudely, but is the patent definition of a nymphomaniac.<br /><br />At first the author seems to portray these occurrences as negative, mocking the intelligence of the girl and her tendencies, and lending sympathy to the plight of the boy. However, this auspicious start disintegrates once the characters enter the fictitious 50s show.<br /><br />Without any justification, the girl immediately rejects the prospect of enjoying her time in Pleasantville. Her character is so far removed from the actual needs many girls that age have - needs almost perversely denied to her character - such as attention, love, commitment, romance - that when she is presented with the adoration of the Pleasantville boy who is her boyfriend, a boy she admittedly finds attractive, she cannot enjoy any of these interactions but sets immediately to whore herself out, and reduce every interaction to a type of sex that is devoid of all intimacy. In this aspect - this masculation of the feminine ideal - I found the film to be more like the Woody Allen film where he sleeps with an underage girl who is mysteriously also into sex without emotion. I guess this film is a little better in that she is not paired with an octogenarian, but rather with a good looking 50s guy. Still, one has to wonder - is this supposed to appeal to women as \\"a better way to be\\"? Watching it, I felt the converse - as though she was a like a wrecking ball of narcissism, unnecessary roughness, and hedonism in a previously innocent and structured, if vacuous world. Is this a woman's dream of freedom or a man's dream of reducing anything of the sublime in a woman to the level of common prostitution? Perhaps the latter would not be so terrible, as a prostitute at least gets paid, and perhaps in her heart of hearts longs for something better, rather embracing her empty existence with empty, conformist, abandon.<br /><br />Taking center stage, her behavior infects many characters in the film, who each begin to pursue sexual gratification and women's liberation - perhaps a misnomer as no rational woman would actually crave that kind of empty, sexually based \\"liberation\\" (whoredom) - to the demise of their interpersonal relationships and societal peace. The character's mother, for example, we are to understand, places so much value on her newfound ability to have an orgasm (learned from the daughter), that she no longer feels she has any need to be with her husband on any level; she finds her calling instead in having mindless sex with the burger shop owner, who has recently found he cares more about painting atrociously bad modern art, rather than providing an even semi-useful function to society as a food businessman. As a flattering? gesture to his new amante, he paints her nude and displays this rendering publicly (in the gist of some famous artworks of prostitutes - too telling) - and we're to understand that she was still in the right to seek refuge in him rather than confide in her husband emotionally, because her husband, she suspects (without even giving him a chance), would never accept her new-found \\"colored\\" state - which she desperately covers with make-up (a suggestion of her forward thinking son, might I add!). The husband is later depicted as a man devoid of all character in that he primarily values his wife for her cooking and cleaning - and he only attains color when he is helped by his do-good son from the future into realizing, with great effort, that his wife means more to him than a well kept home and dinner (this is is just yet another instance of \\"experienced\\" youth patronizing their parents - a potentially great concept in a film like Romeo and Juliet, but here, just the newest incarnation of disrespect for the people who spent so long raising them).<br /><br />I'm not a man, but, if I were, I too would feel cheated as one of the men in this show. Perhaps my views are somewhat biased as I'm presently staying at home myself to raise our children through their early years, but, I would think the woman should be a little ashamed of herself for living on her husband's dime and then feeling justified tohave an affair because (gasp) he expected her to do something at home; I honestly have never understood the indemnification of such simple, vital, and needed tasks as preparing dinner and keeping a clean home. It's not multivariate calculus, or perhaps advanced engineering but, it's vital to keeping a happy and healthy family, and most men respect their wives if they perform these tasks; they do not love their wives FOR the tasks, they love them as human beings - and even this film had to acknowledge that at some point (it's one redeeming feature). However, no matter how monotonous or exhausting such a situation (elected by the individuals in it), might be, it in no way gives one partner the right to just go off on some hedonistic rampage - completely inhumanely, selfishly, and abhorrently disrespecting their life partner (hopefully the most important person in the world to them, short of their kids). I've seen so many movies that have bashed men for doing this; why does this film presumptuously think that because the roles are reversed the audience should be more accepting of failed emotional covenants? My conclusion is that he believes women are so stupid that they will voluntarily side with this plot simply because it condones all behavior, even atrocious behavior, for women - which, could be misconstrued as empowering - when in fact, it only empowers men who want to poach on this rebellious behavior and have a good lay.<br /><br />If it isn't apparent, I believe that sex without intimacy leaves lasting scars on individuals; when this takes place alongside betrayal, it's all the more reprehensible. I guess for me personally, the trend towards sex and hedonistic modern art were not positive ones, were not encouraging, and the unrest (both spiritually and physically) were not desirable, motivating, or beautiful. They were ugly, unnecessary, and disgusting.<br /><br />I understand that the film, on some level, was supposed to espouse compassion and tolerance; however, tolerance became nihilism and compassion just became moral relativism. Juxtaposed next to the benign fascist alternative, the fascist alternative actually started looking, comparably, desirable and orderly. And I'm sure that's not a conclusion anyone wanted.<br /><br />I guess I'm still hoping for a film that is truly refreshing; where it's not so reprehensible for both women and men to be emotionally vulnerable, sensitive, and dependent upon one another; where sex isn't the end all be all, and art devoid of meaning and grace isn't mindlessly exalted, simply because it's \\"art\\" and art is \\"cool\\". Where learning is more than reading famous novels, but critically thinking about daily life, and arriving at sensitive, self-sacrificial, honorable and win-win conclusions for all. Where being rebellious and disdainful of power structures isn't an end in itself, but rather, a means to an end. Where every individual is truly striving to be the best they can be, and more so, to help elevate those around them to the best they can be as well. Where needless arguments are minimized, and graceful care is the name of the game.<br /><br />This film left me overall depressed, and more than anything perplexed as to why Tobey Maguire made it. Does it he hate women? Does he hate men? Does he hate civilized society? Is he trying to be fashionable? Does he honestly think he is improving society? Is he trying to trick and enslave society? Does he not even care as long as he makes a profit?<br /><br />I just go over and over it in my mind. I wish I could sit down with him and really understand why he made this film, and if he can understand the damage that that mindset can do. I wish I could ask him if he really doesn't want a better, purer world - if he is actually a true nihilist, or if he's just pulling off a great con.<br /><br />Anyway, I've talked too much. Just my thoughts.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My kids love these movies. Thought this was a great deal for three Disney movies. Only downsides are no DVDs (blu-ray only) and those annoying thick blu-ray cases that barely fit on my blu-ray stand. Very happy with this purchase overall, though.
B000002NAK|5.0|Wonderful cast with a timely plot etched in  perfect lyrics. I enjoy listening to it and working out to it.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|Love this movie... The best Iron Man, in my opinion. Focuses on character more than special effects (although there are plenty of those, at least it doesn't feel like the plot was designed to showcase the FX).
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Never before has a book so grabbed my attention on the first few pages and then held it throughout. Zusak is a marvelous writer and his tale of death and Death and human love and frailty and crimes, small and monstrous, deserves a far better accolade than I can muster.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is great!  My grandson, who is 7 and I love to play it.  Helps with hand eye coordination.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I was hoping it would be like the other castleville game, but it isn't.  It does not let you things or move them once placed.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I just finished...it was quite unlike what I have previously read. I don't know whether to recommend reading it for its beauty or advise against it to protect from its brutality. All I know is I am deeply affected and humbled. I guess, in a way, I am left in the state any great story should leave me. Read it. (And I'm sorry).
B004GE15MI|3.0|There are many reasons to go ahead and watch this 1967 movie:  a very handsome and young Albert Finney (before Erin Brockovich, 2000), Audrey Hepburn, and all the mod 1960's fashions, hairstyles, colors, autos.  The story of two married people on the verge of a divorce and driving in a car arguing and re-living their beginnings ... well, it bored me.  I stayed with the movie only to see the many outfits that Audrey Hepburn changes in and out of.  This movie could use a re-make, really, the interaction and dialogue between the actors is dated. Infidelity and forgiveness must have been much more easily accepted in the wild, carefree, 1960's.  I'd like to see how same would be handled in the now.

B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie was terrific!  It kept me interested as well as entertained from start to finish.  Brilliant storyline,  not the run of the mill, \\"... seem it all before\\" type of movie.  Fun to watch,  even by myself.  Worth buying.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! Much easier than trying to play on my phone. My<br />Husband both downloaded this game. Addictive and fun
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Once you get the hang of this game, it's super addictive. Very easy to play and advance without paying for extras.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Been having fun with this newer version. Definitely would recommend this to people. Nice little game. Plus it hasn't gotten ridiculously time consuming.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Best game in the genre hands down and the boost sometimes is a little touchy but other than that it was amazing<br />Get this game
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Works perfectly as designed.<br />I use this for my mid 2012 MBPR.<br />Apple products work well with other apple products. I have not used third party to compare.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Sort of Aron Brokovich pulling for the little guy story line. Scary but this is what our insurance companies probably do…at least it feels that way every time you try to submit a claim. DeVito is surprising in his role. Ending is not what I expected but probably closer to real life than some fairy tale ending.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh is a Lynda-Barry-level genius.  Her drawings don't have the detail and beauty of LB's, but that's not her style.  Brosh tells funny and affecting and up-to-the-minute stories of her childhood, her dogs, her depression, and a few other random things including how to be an adult.<br /><br />Sounds like some self-centered snoozer, right?  Not at all.  The essence of genius is to look at ordinary things in extraordinary ways, and that's what Allie Brosh's gift lets her do.<br /><br />On the surface this seems aimed at young slacker types, but this geezer baby boomer didn't stop laughing at the funny stuff or being stunned by the emotional impact through the whole book.<br /><br />Look at a few pages, and I defy you to stop reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please add mine carts and tracks also give new graphics like fatter blocky clouds rain blowing up TNT in creative mode add most things in pc version like potions Wait don't forget sprinting I move so slow and its hard to parlour (sorry auto correct is on) add a breeding system as well. Well that's all I got to say<br /><br />For now at least
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Rich, luscious tenors.  Men's harmony as it should be.  Being ethnic Italian, I've listened to this style all of my life, and these guys are the best of the best. There are four or five (depending on how you classify Ave Maria Italian classics in the mix.  But they are not of that style, more English that not.  Accompaniment is just right, Stays in the background where it should be.  Good mix. Technically very good.  BTW-Befana it the Italian christmas witch who brings the presents<br /><br />Arrived on time, well packaged.  Got the MP3 version also.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Brilliant once again another favorite Ken Follet is at his best once again, Great reading true to life, will read again.
B0018QCXH8|2.0|The delivery was great.  The acting was very good acting.  Some people will apparently sacrifice their first born for success. The movie's plot left me wondering - What's the point?
B004S9AK3G|5.0|The follow on to Pillars of the earth well written of course. I enjoy all Ken Follet books he's my favourite writer. Knows how to keep you  interested
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A good, fun, quick read for any age. I like the movie a lot too, could be more reality like though.
1451695195|5.0|Loved it, I will recommend it to everyone. The book was everything I hoped it would be. If your have any questions about what happens after death, this book can answer them.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Very good rendition of the &#34;reluctant&#34; Superman story. The movie is a fresh take on the old story, but well modernized. I was pleasantly surprised to see good character development in addition to the expected special effects and action.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Better than the last one.  Entertaining to the end.  They do a nice job leaving the door open for future episodes.
B0063GORYU|1.0|First of all it is way too small to enjoy playing the game.  I can hardly see the cards. Also, my moves don't always go through, and I have to repeat them over and over.  This game needs improvement.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Cool game. Gets your mind going. Really love the puzzles.  Nice and challenging.  I recommend this to everybody. Well worth 2.00!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have never read a Grisham book until now. No more Steven King for me.....just John Grisham! I knew all of the movies from his books were good but I should have been reading the books first. Like now. Sycamore Row is hard to put down and I am already selecting the actors for this movie.  :  )

B00BATG18K|2.0|I was very generous with this rating as I gave it up 2/3rds of  the way through.  I really felt it was one of the worst books I've read.  I usually love this authors novels, but just could not get into this one.  The story rambled pointlessly and seemed more about descriptions of the locations and times than the characters who seemed hopelessly foolish and self centered, not to mention easily duped.  I was bored through the whole thing so just gave it up.  It seemed poorly written to me.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|as soon as I was actually getting somewhere in the game (I unlocked most of the elements of harmony), it crashed. all my progress was lost. the game completely restarted itself. I was so frustrated I uninstalled the game. it would be an amazing game if it didn't crash and if some ponies wheren't so expensive.
B00C74SHRK|2.0|Very boring and long-winded story, far too much direct speech for potentially intriguing parts of the story. Protagonist came across as mediocre and uninteresting character. Drugs, criminal activities, who cares? That's at least how it came across. Sorry, not for me, at all of that over 800 pages.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Love this movie!  It is filled with a humorous view of all-too-familiar events experienced during the holidays.  The characters are delightful.
031623480X|4.0|So far the book is interesting and really makes you question what is in the food we eat and how it makes us feel.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have had this app for a while now, since before the 'facelift'. Needless to say, I truly believe that weather channel is more concerned with making the money off of the ads than truly delivering a quality service like they use to have. I had sent them a recent email asking why there were so many ads, to which I got a reply that they were to important to remove.<br />To me, the ads make it difficult to navigate and run much slower. This app use to be very useful, and to the point. Now, the company is just too money hungry, and has over filled the page with useless stories and ads.
B00BHWG0HW|4.0|Great packaging and great product. There's nothing like good stories with a lesson and morale to them. Hollywood is a joke now. They rarely make good movies or television shows anymore.
B002G1K82Q|1.0|This will not play on my DVD player.. it will on my computer..plays all previews and goes to beginning of screen to choose  selections..DON'T know why it won't play movie?????  Very disappointed!!!
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Quirky remake of the classic, great casting, acting and camera work.  True to the script for the most part, you need your whole brain to understand the original but it is so worth it.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|This book was completely mind blowing.  There were a lot of interesting twists on how people use religion and science.  As with many Vonnegut books, the ending is perhaps a bit depressing so be prepared for that.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Bryson does a good job of bringing 1927 to life. If you are interested in aviation history, this is the book to read. It helps if you concentrate on Lindbergh before his association with the America First movement and the children he fathered with two German sisters. In 1927, America adored Lindbergh and thought of him as a reluctant hero. The story of Ruth Snyder and her husband was interesting, esp. because I am a fan of Double Indemnity, a film inspired by this awful story of murder and greed. I did feel that some story lines received too much attention and others too little. Just my personal preference.  Overall, a good read.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|It was a lot of fun and during the game you have to remember puzzles that you haven't finished and see if any of the clues you found will go with any of them. If you like adventure games or puzzle games you'll love this one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Installs easily,  works well love using my tablet or phone as my remote. Use HBO to go,  hulu and Netflix with no problems.  Streams videos from my desk top chrome browser no problem.  Have yet to stream a movie from the play store, but I imagine that'll work great too.<br /><br />Minus 1 star due to lack of apps,  but I understand that Google is releasing development tools now, so that should change soon.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game but when I updated I had to Start all over again from the beginning. I was just reached level 27.So unfair.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited I am able to finally play on my Kindle Fire!!  Been waiting forever for this to happen and couldn't be happier!  Thanks King.com!!!
0345479092|5.0|A lot of the info here is common sense, but as a first time parent, you need to somehow &#34;acquire&#34; this common sense. It really helped me understand and communicate with my children - and they couldn't be more different.  This book has probably spared me a lot of frustration and tears.<br />Several of my cousins recommended this book and I can't thank them enough.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I hate this app. it is no fun. everything costs money and there is no real point to the game.I hate it
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren what a great combination for classic piece of cinema that is considered one the best epic movies ever filmed. The movie presents the life of the Spanish hero of the Reconquista El Cid and even though takes some liberties, it is for the most part historically accurate. It places a particular emphasis on the fact that is true that El Cid was open to work with both Muslims and Christians and was inspired and respected by all, something that even in our own time has proven to be difficult all over the world. Hence we have a historical figure that was beyond his time and ours too. The romantic story between Jimena and El Cid also presents the challenges that a wife has to endure when married with a national hero and how much she had to suffer because of that. The epic scenes filmed in Spain are considered the best ever created for a movie and the castle where they were filmed is a tourist attraction near Valencia. I strongly recommend this movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again  John Grisham has proven why he is such a master at story telling.  The many twists and turns, not to mention the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat.  I would love to see this on the big screen. Just brilliant.

B00EI4V3X2|4.0|Another gaming headset with a microphone attached to it? Not saying this incredulously. However what question I do have is: Is the PX4 any different than the rest?<br /><br />Yes, it is.<br /><br />******<br /><br />Does this headset feel cheap?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />Upon picking the headset up it is made, and feels, mostly plastic because it is all plastic. The type of plastic is on the cheap side however the band (which is the most important) is thickly padded and stitched with a comfortable cushion. It is wide and bending/twisting the band does not give as much play to make you think it will break easily. For the price paid you should be getting one of the best gaming headsets and with the sound and feel of the PX4s you will definitely be getting close to it.<br /><br />******<br /><br />Sound Quality : 8/10<br /><br />Where the sound lacks a bit is the bass response. It is the most subtle sound on the PX4 and can be bumped up by the 'Tone' setting on the side of the headset. Having had previous headsets before that have lots of rumble, this headset somewhat took away from the 'intense' experience of feeling explosions and various other louds noises. While the bass takes a lower profile do not mistake this for the headset having bad low-response because it does not. When the bass is there it performs very eloquently though it may not be enough for a lot of gamers out there.<br /><br />This unit, when connected to the 'wireless' box, can turn audio signals (digital and analog) into Surround sound--whether it is native or not. The feature turned music and games into a much more dynamic, full, and 'spacious' audio experience. The band from music appeared to be multidimensional around my head where I could sense that an instrument was to the back left to me and others were dualy surrounding the area. There are, however, (6) different 'spaces' that you can change on the fly so that the virtual surround speaker placement can be changed by pressing the SS button on the wireless receiver. This function places different parts of sounds in different areas, giving you multiple sound arrangements as you are positioned in relation to the audio.<br /><br />When turning the Surround Sound function off, music and games were simply too flat with all sounds muddled and fighting each other for hearing time. This will be the first time I have said this about the 'virtual surround sound' function however, it sounds much better on all sources of audio.<br /><br />Now with the quality of sound in general I had the audio from my computer connected to the wireless device through digital optical. Overall general audio output sounded much better than analog equivalents (the headphone jack). There was no 'digitized' audio tones and it was simply a perfect replication and organic. Very impressed with the level of quality as compared to some other expensive headsets.<br /><br />If you are wondering where the money you are spending on these headsets are going (and we know its not the body molding), after your first listen you will have a very good idea.<br /><br />General:<br /><br />Setup is easy after briefly reading the manual however in general there are certain areas of functioning the PX4 that will not translate well to a lot of people. As far as I am aware there is no 'software' that allows you to adjust qualities on the headset--everything is proprietary through the device--meaning you will have to click buttons that gives indication of any 'change' through understanding a 'morse-like' beeping in your ear or with the sequence of dots on the wireless receiver.<br /><br />The first step to start using the headset is to pair it with the wireless receiver. To do this (as mentioned in the manual) you turn off the headset (holding the power button down) and then holding the 'connect' button down for 5 seconds on the wireless receiver. Next, hold the power button down on the headset for 6 seconds and let go when it beeps twice. This will connect the two units together.<br /><br />**Note that the sound only comes from an optical out connection or from an audio analog cable when using the receiver** It does not come from the USB cable.<br /><br />***Personally I used this on a PC however it will work with all gaming systems with an optical out however you will have to purchase *separately* an audio conversion box if you have an older Xbox 360 Fat or the Xbox 360E.***<br /><br />Wireless, when connected, works fine and will transmit audio from my tests up to 20 ft through a few walls.<br /><br />Volume is more than fine and can get very loud if you want.<br /><br />Comfort : 9.5/10<br /><br />The fact that is made out of plastic (and not the heavy kind) has to have benefits somewhere, whether it is from the cost incurred by the company or, in this case, a lighter headset. These are extremely comfortable on the head and is unnoticeable when wearing. On the PX4s, the ear cushions are plush and thick. The ear cups have a fairly big area at around 3\\" across. This is one of the first headsets I have used that have not made the ears warm. The most pleasing headset to have on my head that I have ever owned.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />While the outside feels cheap and not having an 'equal' feel with regard to what you paid, ask yourself whether you care about how it feels in your hand or how it feels on your head and sounds in your ears.

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Just like the movie the book drag out in certain parts. It was hard to keep reading the book sometimes. The book and the movie were about the same. Even a friend had a hard time reading the book. She is one the second book and is having the same problem.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Beautifully written, with lots of historical information about World War 1. The author has intertwined love stories, courage and heartbreak with the drama of battles and revolution. Truly riveting!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|&#34;The Lies of Locke Lamora&#34; by Scott Lynch is a terrific fantasy/adventure story that YA 15 and older will love. It is overflowing with action, skullduggery, frenetic pacing, and intense situations. The protagonists are all likeable and unique and the dastardly antagonists are vile, despicable, and cruel...what's not to like :-)! It starts a bit slow but will have you gasping for breath right up to the last page. 5 stars!!!!!

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Reflektor is a unique album. Musically, lyrically experimental, Arcade Fire brings in loads of influences from across the world and through time. But while this double album is ten minutes longer than their previous work, The Suburbs, it feels less substantial- perhaps because the songs here are much longer. The Suburbs is an album I find hard to cherry pick, the whole thing fits together so well. With Reflektor, there are definitely songs I like more than others, that I overwhelmingly favor on the replay. But this comes down to preference and time. Arcade Fire has shown a consistent and impressive evolution since their debut LP, and while Reflektor feels perhaps more esoteric in its concept than Neon Bible and The Suburbs, it is by no means a poor edition to their discography.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love it! Its just as good as the other version. The only bad thing, is that you never get enough lives!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story, with a twist at the end. I liked the character development throughout the story.  Not really a thriller, but has some suspenseful events.
B007N0REX6|5.0|This is a great great Heavy Rock album from the legendary SLASH!!!! I really like the Slash years on GUNS N ROSES, and this one APOCALYPTIC LOVE is like a modern HEAVY inspired version of what GUNS should be today....The singer Myles is GREAT!!!! His vocals reminds A LOT axl vocals, but that´s actually a cool thing!!! Man, this album is GREAT!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! WELL DONE, SLASH!!!!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is so fun and entertaining. I think kids will love this .Good job on this game.<br />I am 14 and I love this game
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I like Gaiman's work and this is really a phone-in effort from the master of modern mythology.  It has all of the elementd of a Gaiman fable:  ageless magical creatures, childlike wonder, an unseen world of danger and mystery juxtaposed with real world drudgery.<br /><br />But in chosing a child protagonist it immediately became simplified and derivative of his previous work.  It's like a vignette from the Sandman but without any tough decisions or moral ambiguity.<br /><br />A magical Gaiman-esque turd is still a turd.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|perfect choice for anyone who just wants to play chess. there are a few extra hints and helpers too. you can use 1player or 2 player and have fun.

B000HF6XV8|4.0|The movie closely followed the storyline of the book. There were beautiful landscape scenes of England.  The child actors were well selected.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Boring. No feeling of accomplishment. It felt like the same thing over and over again.  Don't download this boring game.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun to play<br />Would buy again.<br />Enjoying ready to get back to the game. Would  recommend to my friends. Thank you.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. I have played other bingo games and this is one of the better ones. Awesome!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham in my opinion is the top author around. Sorry he does not put more books out. They are always suspenceful and keep you on edge.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Watch this instead of &#34;This is the End&#34;. &#34;The Croods&#34; is very funny and very well done. It's a winner!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Best game ever!!! I had it on my old kindle but I got the kindle fire hd and It wasn't on there any more. But I am downloading it right now. Sooo yeah.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|Loved this movie. All the actors do an outstanding job, absolutely one of the funniest movies I ever seen.<br />I will watch it many times.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a great pass time! My only issue is with the &#34;lives&#34; rule. The lives that are sent by friends are always lost because the maximum is 5. Maybe some changes could be made to fix that.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Jennifer Armentrout does amazing in this series. All I have to say is read these books. I'm going to miss Alex and wish her story could go on, but it ended perfectly and I can't wait to read Seth's book. Wonderful
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|The actual flight was amazing, the story about the struggling alcoholic that followed was hardly worth watching and I shut it off half way through. Watching yet another alcoholic make the same mistakes over and over again may appeal to AAA member but to few others!
B000022TSY|5.0|all time classic  nice bikes  early Jack one-liners  gotta have it in your collection very typical stereo-typed movie about wilder times
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Got addicted to this game on FB and waited for it to be available on kindle and now it is.  I'm so happy
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I loved it. Classic Grisham . What more could you want.  The story reverberates of A Time To Kill .
B0050AV5MW|5.0|What a great read. There is something for everyone in these books and I can't get enough of them! Don't hesitate.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is great GET IT!all you need is a brain to think things to type and fingers to type it.<br /><br />You can get whatever you want pretty much
B00CFNUMD0|4.0|We enjoyed all the antics but after a while the lack of &#34;real&#34; dialogue made watching not as much fun
B008602KQI|5.0|the movie, Hunger Games,  was very engaging.  I am anxious to see the next one.  I am new to this streaming stuff so look forward to more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game.  excellent graphics and it could not be any easier to use. it is next best thing to being there.  thanks for making this available to us.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush because this game has a lot of levels and because its hard but its fun my gmaw and I play it shes on level 117 and I'm on level 200 but I quit playing for a while then I started playing again so now I'm on level 8 lol
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This  is now my all time favorite book because it has action, drama, and more. I prefer this to everybody who can read!! :)
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I heard John Grisham on NOT talking about the book.  Since I enjoyed A Time To Kill I was intrigued to read this.  A good read. An interesting story of someone trying to make amends, in death, of a wrong his family did.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I am adult who couldn't stop reading this book; finished it in a day.  Sweet, story from days gone by but a simple example that we have lost in today's attitude and response to life's problems.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Heard this band at Austin City Limits. Couldn't believe how good they sound for just three women. Every one of them plays multiple instruments along with singing. Hope they go far.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. It is reasonably realistic and great for stress relief for people who have to deal with the general public. Destroying humanity with science!
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I like this app.  It does have problems with either my handwriting (scribbling) or interpreting the COSINE function and the Pi symbol. I've tried numerous times entering COS (Pi/4) and got garbage.  I did find that there was a way to change from &#34;degrees&#34; to &#34;radians&#34; but it was not obvious.  Overall though, I like it.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought I had made the mistake of choosing a book which was particularly for male readers. I was definitely wrong.  Reading this book helped to bring together what happened at a particular time - many of which I would not have thought of as being contemporary events.  In addition to reading about events, I was enlightened about the personalities of those people who were a part of the events.  I wish I could find more such books which would permit me to see the connection of events and to better see them in a particular time - rather than just gaining knowledge about one event.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I loved the movie.  It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was entertaining and I hope they make a second.  I gave it a 4 star rating because I didn't feel the idea of the &#34;casters&#34; was a bit fluffy, and would have been more interesting had they infused more elements of the occult.
147676459X|5.0|I can't even approach how good I think this book is. Somehow in writing about herself and her outrageous life experiences, she manages to articulate the absurdity, heartbreak and joy of being human.
0761172726|5.0|I've purchased this calendar for the last four years... LOVE IT!!!!!  Helps me keep on top of the family's different activities!
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Excellent movie, i loved it, have different stories and the characters are very good especially Judi Dench who is tremendous actress. The theme of this film is very interesting and versatile
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I very much liked this sequel to The Shining. Story is very well constructed and it gives an inside view on AA culture and rituals. Very enjoyable reading. A page turner. It helps if you have already read The Shining, but it's not mandatory. But if you haven't read The Shining, what are you waiting for?
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Very romantic with a happy end, very good actors and character.  Is a movie without violence, where there is respect
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Good balance of character development and action.  Minus one star for the aliens being a little over the top. My wife liked this one, and she usually doesn't go for action or superhero movies.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Too many battles and less human interactions.  The battle strategies became so tiring and tedious.  Had a hard time finding a character with any redeeming qualities.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Gives me a fun time when I have to just sit,and elevate my broken ankle. AWESOME fun.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game game is really awesome. It has a lot of world war two guns I recommend it for weapon fans
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Anything with Jake Gyllenhaal is worth watching.  I originally saw this movie in the theatre and really enjoyed it so I decided to purchase it and have watched it several times.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|'This' book is gripping for most parts, of course. But it sets you up for disappointment for the remainder of the series. I think the series is trash, especially after book 3.<br /><br />The way the story evolves in later books reminds me of the tv WWF. Anyone joins hands with anyone, new characters come in, play their important parts and suddenly die. At some point you start to wonder whom you're even supporting. The story becomes a soap opera where bubbles just form all the time.<br /><br />If I compare this to LOTR or Harry Potter, the thing which held those stories together was that there was a hero and a villain and everything happened as part of a grand plot at the end of which the hero defeats the villain. Not so in this. There's just too many characters and not enough centrality of plot. The author just introduces a million characters for no particular reason except to help keep the soap bath bubbling. I'm disappointed.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Not a new reimagining as Abrams' last Star Trek movie; seemed like a rehash of the original, yet was fun to watch.  Really like the new characters and I hope the series can continue, though perhaps with some more original script ideas. Would also be interesting to see how often Abrams can bring back the talented Leonard Nimoy; almost comforting to see him don the ears once again...
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best game I easy played. U have to get this game. I play it all the time. U go around the world to hurt land animal,earn $, and make your own gun and more! Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent...so often, sequels are disappointing, not the case with this one! I loved the combination of the new story of Dan as an adult and the back story from the The Shining. Couldn't put it down.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Love it I'd give it ten stars if I could , I'm a huge diablo fan and this is giving me my fix when I can't get to my Xbox . So thank you gameloft you have done it once again and made it free two big thumbs up
B00B5HQL50|5.0|great cast, acting, and direction.  the action and suspense moves perfectly along - no dull or dragging moments.  Javier Bardem played the villian to a T.  even if you are not a Bond fan, you will enjoy this movie.
B005CAPS0K|4.0|My grandson and I Love this movie. We sat together with some popcorn and totally love it!!! Don't be afraid!!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Interest in<br /><br />Interesting  but  courtroom scenes too long too much time getting back<br />Angell to tell the story too much about Lucien drunken press<br /><br />  All together a good if not long slow read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun game for all ages with fifteenth places to play the fun never ends until u beat it
034537410X|5.0|best book ever written on lucid dreaming. Made me understand the basics of budism in a scientific way and the roots of modern religions, near death experiences, out of body experiences. made me think that the supernatural was perfectly natural and all was in our heads.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love  this game. It's really entertaining and I could play it all day. I play this with my sister and we both have a lot of fun.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Same old stuff about how his life is so difficult and how the white man gets him down.  This guy is full of crap
1592407889|5.0|I was surprised to find this so well written and very entertaining.  I had a childhood similar to this but no parents to call for help ever; so I guess Shirley MacLaine looks pretty good compared to my mother.  I don't believe she is trying to bash anyone here; this seems more like a self help therapy writing which Sachi does very well. There were some truly laugh out louds like the brown panties...  I am sure many of us have had to endure more than our share of people having children and then deciding careers were more important; or they were just as clueless as us trying to find their way.  Who knows.  All I know is the only mother and father I ever want to have ever again are Mother God and Father God.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|it not what  you think it just great love story and sci fi movie I like it after renting it out of red box went out and purchased it for my 600 plus movies I have  I would recommend for familys and teens not for small children
1250038820|5.0|This is a great coffee table book. Great photos with stories. I love the Facebook page and this was great to have at home.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm addicted!  I have this one and Spider Solitaire from MobilityWare - both are great fun!  It would be nice to not have the ads - but the game was free and I know how to skip the ads quickly!

B007IL59D2|4.0|Portrays the role of the high born lady in medieval society.  She is not much more than a pawn in the power struggle of men.  Well researched and excellently written (as ever).  This was an interesting character to portray.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|does the original  justice with out being korny  like the return to oz was  great for all ages and would recommend this movie
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliant, it kept me interested to the last page and this is not something which usually happens.  The whole book was excellent and I would highly recommend it.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you turning the pages.
B00CFA227C|5.0|great movie for all ages great action and story line I was skeptical at first but the I rented it a fell in love with it now I own it
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|Just a tad short of 5 stars for me...  some of the characters are finally starting to become a little more interesting after 5 episodes.  However, the resident hunk is almost a nameless chunk of meat.  Is it the acting or the writing?  A little of both, I think.  Stories are tight, taut and interesting, but lacking fully-drawn characters - in the villains or the protagonists.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome. Awesome, superb movie.  I love Chris Pine.  I love this movie - action packed and high energy- yes! adrenaline all the way
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Compelling viewpoint of how the poorer elements in Nazi Germany survived the ravages and bigotries of war. Highly recommended, especially for those of us who thought all Germans in WWII were the &#34;bad guys&#34;.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Lots of fun.<br />Great graphics and reasonable quests. Don't have to buy a lot, just have patience.<br />The colors are brilliant. The dragons are expensive but not necessary.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Both Danny Torrance and Stephen King have returned with an outstanding tale. The book continues to be a shining example of edge of your seat reading.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|After four family members looked over the instructions, everyone was confused as how to play. The experience almost us dissuaded from playing.  I looked up the instructions on youtube: [...]  It cleared up a lot of our questions, and the game is very fun!  I highly recommended it for people who like strategy card games but have little patience for drawn out games.  Rounds are completed quickly.  At our first go-around of 3 players, there was a winner within  an hour.  I imagine with more experience, games will last as little as 20 min.
0767903862|5.0|The book introduced me to Australians like I was there.  I got could visualize the places Bill saw and got a real feel for them.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I THOROUGHLY and heartily encourage you to buy this documentary. It is entertaining while knocking you off your chair with information that will educate you about the state of health care in the USA and how it compares with health care in other countries. We take a trip to Europe (France, UK, Norway, etc) and to Cuba and several other places to see how these countries provide health care. You will be very surprised if you think the USA is at the top, try near the bottom!  We tend to think we are living in the greatest country that can do no wrong...until we get around and see what it's like other places. I hope this documentary will help our country fix our dismal health care system by modeling it on the healthcare of some countries who really have good health care and much lower rates of mortality and higher life expectancies.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Great action-comedy, all-star cast.  Retired agents from a three-letter agency fight evil, yada yada.  Plenty of surprises and laughs.  I can think of much worse ways to spend two hours!
B00G32QIEG|2.0|did not make any sence,hollywood ran out of stories,have to be a better way to spend money,i rest my case
B000055Y0X|5.0|Every scene is hilarious.  It's a thoughtful criticism of our political and military leaders, wrapped in high drama, and doused with comedy.
B005OV0PS2|5.0|over the line!! mark it a zero or you are entering a world of pain!!! this movie is the best and never gets old
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|I think it is a pretty neat app. I am still learning how to operate it but so far it seems to be cool.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Interesting visual (ie cgi etc) and overall a much better variant than the one years ago. Oddly enough it has the visual flavor of the original 'Crow' movie...
B00BL9860K|4.0|David's up to his usual high standard and once again I had to start and finish it in one go, but will K&M ever get it together again?
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Free App of the day, will have me looking for more from Fire Maple!  This has been the most entertaining treasure hunt type game that I have ever played. The graphics on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 were amazingly crisp and detailed.  The background music was subtle and added to the mysterious air.  Great puzzles to solve.  This is a game that I will reset and go back to play again.
B005HED08I|4.0|The remastering makes these a lot more enjoyable. Many of the non remastered episodes look like they were shot with a cell phone
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautiful and sad all wrapped up into a brilliant story about a girl, a horrible war, love and lose.  The characters draw you in and make you appreciate the resilience of the human soul.  Well done!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love Dragonvale so very much. I got addicted to it for about seven months got bored with it, I came back cause I got bored with the other game and BOOM. I`m addicted again.

B00C2U6EUG|5.0|This is Hans Zimmer's most emotionally complex and compelling work. It's a fantastic soundtrack with beautifully moving music. What's especially interesting about the collection is the variety and subtlety of the rhythms and sounds included here. There's a diversity of palette that Hans has put together that belies the fact that the music is all about a superhero. There are some wonderful flourishes particularly for the villains' introductions and where the action picks up. There's a fantastic horn that's used very judiciously in some places, which underscores the alien nature of Superman's adversaries. There are also some wonderful piano riffs that are moving and intimate. And of course, there are suitably powerful and amazing anthems which perfectly compliment the big action when it needs to. Frankly, the music here is sublime, and it's nuanced and diverse enough that even the most jaded listener can't fail to be moved or to crack a smile. I loved this movie, and this soundtrack was a huge contributing factor to that.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and I play it more than he does!!!  Very relaxing and fun, with a plethora of sea life.

B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|This is a fun competitive game with great graphics. Issue is that it takes too long to earn crystals that u need. If I read a review with this info I would boycott the game. It is an issue that needs to be addressed because it could be a good game otherwise.

B008JFUS8M|4.0|My review of The Hunger Games was a little negative due to the weak acting of the supporting cast, but that's vastly improved in Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence, who impressed me with I Am Legend, replaces Gary Ross, and I'm happy with the result. Lawrence will also direct the final two installments.<br /><br />As in the opening movie, Jennifer Lawrence is the key ingredient. Remove her from the project and it just wouldn't be as good. She rightly received an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, and has to show a whole range of emotions in Catching Fire. You'll see what I mean during the opening scene in which she has a flashback to events we witnessed in the previous movie. If I had to list the most promising actresses under the age of 30, Lawrence would clearly be right at the top. In fact, there are few actresses of any generation that I would rather watch.<br /><br />For the purposes of this review, I'm going to assume that you have seen the first installment. If you haven't, don't attempt to see Catching Fire before you know how the story begins. You'll miss some of the references for sure.<br /><br />We learned in The Hunger Games that victorious tributes could look forward to a better life. Hunger and poverty were supposed to be a thing of the past, and the fear of being asked to fight for survival could be removed forever. But it wouldn't be much of a sequel if Katniss just rode around waving to the crowds, would it? President Snow (Donald Sutherland) devises a scheme to get her in a new battle, only this time it's bigger and better than ever. Without giving away too much, let's just say that there are no tributes that are easy to kill in this sequel; those involved are generally older and more experienced.<br /><br />The different tributes aren't the only characters who are new to Catching Fire. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) and his questionable facial hair has been replaced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Hoffman gives a typical multifaceted performance, and the motivations of his character are hard to guess. During a conversation with Katniss, he claims to have volunteered for the position of Head Gamemaker, even though the life expectancy is not great. Does that mean that Seneca Crane wasn't the only one who was punished for disappointing President Snow in the past? Have other tributes caused trouble for Snow?<br /><br />The main difference between this sequel and the first installment is the depth of story and the quality of the acting. We learn a lot more about Katniss. Who does she love, and to what degree? What sacrifices must she make in her life to fit in and protect the people she loves. If you think about it, we all do similar things in our own lives. We socialize for the sake of our families or our careers, when a lot of the time we would rather spend our free moments pursuing things that we enjoy. Many of us give up things for our children or ailing relatives. We can identify with Katniss, even though we won't be asked to fight to the death. As for the acting, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and others, give the characters more depth than in the first movie. We are also given more information about Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). I wonder how much of this is due to Simon Beaufoy's part in the screenplay? He's on a roll after writing Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.<br /><br />One of the best scenes comes early in the movie as Katniss and Peeta deviate from their prepared agenda during a tour of the other districts. Instead of mouthing the carefully prepared scripts, they choose to make a more meaningful contribution. I won't reveal what happens, but it's a memorable scene.<br /><br />The Capitol is portrayed as being particularly evil in this sequel, just in case you were in any doubt. Its dubious agenda is enforced by stormtroopers who look like they stepped straight out of Star Wars. Although some of the first 90 minutes is fairly predictable fare, I welcomed the chance to explore this world and its characters in more depth. It's hard to care about someone if you don't understand who they are, or what they are fighting for. Francis Lawrence did a great job of avoiding clumsy exposition in I Am Legend, and he avoids that trap in Catching Fire too. Instead of spelling out the reason for every little action, he allows scenes to naturally unfold so that we can see their significance for ourselves.<br /><br />Fans of action might be disappointed with Catching Fire. It takes a long time for the tributes to make it into the arena, and once there, they rely more on alliances than before. This story is more about teamwork and figuring out who is good or evil than it is about slaughtering everyone in sight. It's a richer story overall.<br /><br />Another reason for disappointment might be the abrupt ending. Like The Lord of the Rings, the story is split into several parts, and this second installment of four won't have a conclusion that neatly resolves all of the conflict. For that, you'll need to see the next two movies.<br /><br />I think that Francis Lawrence has improved upon the first installment significantly, and I'll be seeing how things pan out. I might even read Suzanne Collins' trilogy before I see Mockingjay Part 1 next year.e of the first 90 minutes is fairly predictable fare, I welcomed the chance to explore this world and its characters in more depth.

B003KK6GOQ|4.0|For some time near the beginning, I'd considered abandoning this book, and later on, found myself wondering whether or not to give it five stars. That was how drastically my opinion changed while I was reading it.<br /><br />The story is entirely made up of letters between the characters. The time period is 1946, just after the second World War, and the setting is Guernsey, an island in the English Channel. It's almost impossible to give a quick plot summary, but I'll try. Juliet Ashton, a London based writer, is urged by her publisher to begin a new project but she's having trouble coming up with anything. She begins corresponding with members of a literary society in Guernsey. It turns out not many of them were really interested in reading books at the start, but they were caught by the Germans after a clandestine pork roast dinner, which could have had them in big trouble, and made up a lie that they'd been having a literary society meeting. Then, they decided they'd better form an actual book club, just to be on the safe side, to give substance to their ruse. From then on, they were each amazed by the pleasure they derived from books, and wrote to Juliet all about it.<br /><br />My initial impression was that it plodded on too slowly at first, and a whole lot of characters were introduced too thick and fast to keep track of and keep up the interest level at the same time. It really grew on me as I decided the anecdotes about living during the time of German occupation make a fantastic legacy for present day readers. I'm a member of Gen X, and felt as if I was right there, sharing the experiences which were sometimes hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking.<br /><br />There are two heroines. Apart from the witty, feisty Juliet, there's Elizabeth McKenna. She's an unusual character in that she only appears in reminiscences and never in person, yet in many ways the book is all about her. We can learn a lot from her attitude of kindness and the impression her simple gestures made on others. I liked how their stories came together, and Juliet's decision that they had a lot in common, because they were both 'noticers' of simple, beautiful things that others might have just passed by.<br /><br />Good characters soon begin to stand out from the rest of the huge cast. There's Dawsey Adams, the shy, stuttering pig farmer with highbrow literary tastes (he was gorgeous), Mrs Amelia Maugery, who probably looked more beautiful at 60 than she did at 20, Isola Priddy, the eccentric herbalist who developed a taste for the Brontes and Jane Austen, Sidney Stark, Juliet's generous editor, and John Booker, the servant who got away with impersonating his employer, who'd flown the coop. This is just scratching the surface. It's easy to see why this book became something of an obsessive life work for Mary Ann Shaffer, before her death.<br /><br />It left me with a lot to think about. These days, we expend such a lot of angst wondering how to make an impact and achieve something notable. Back then, people were too busy simply trying to get by from day to day, keeping food on their tables and clothes on their backs, an achievement in itself. It's clear that love, loyalty and friendship really are the most important things. This is just as true now, but we can easily overlook that in the easier times we live in.<br /><br />The book is full of quotable wisdom, and I'll finish this review with a good one. &#34;That's what I love about reading: one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you on to another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book. It's geometrically progressive-all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment.&#34;estures made on others.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think it is a lot of fun to play.  What I don't like is how they try to hook you and then get money out of you.  If you can't pass a level you can't play again for so many minutes, which increases each time you don't pass a level.  If you have a hard time putting something down, this would not be the game for you.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the easiest, most convenient way to organize your life.  I used to have lists all over the place for things to do, books to read, musicians to follow, places to go, gifts to buy, things to ponder, ideas to flush out, playlists to create, etc.  Some lists involved immediate attention, some were for the distant future.  Because they're all so varied, there was no one place to keep them all - until I discovered Evernote.  Now, they're all in ONE place and simply organized.  The fact that I can add or edit them from my computer or phone and everything is synced - it's a real thing of beauty!  I recommend it to everyone I know.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I usually enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks books, but this one was not as good as I expected it to be. The ending left you kind of hanging which was a disappointment to me. On a positive note the story was endearing in that it poignantly described the mental torment that war inflicts on soldiers and their families and how thankful we should be to live in a free country. It also made me think of how no one ever really wins in a war.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I finally downloaded and played this game and I love it. Keeps getting harder which is nice. I like that you can give and receive lives.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|his is the best game ever unroll you fight vector. I thing everyone should. ty it it is so much fun unroll vector come out in the game.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is probly the best free real steel game in the app store I cant stop playing it.  this game is a must have.  you will love it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Love! This book has an interesting perspective, fabulous imagery, and a hearty subject matter. I will be teaching this novel to my sophomore class and can't wait to get their opinions on it. Heavy subject matter so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone in middle school quite yet.
B0035WTE2U|1.0|One of the 2 CDs does not play. Not worth the good price if the item is unusable. Thanks anyway.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It's definitely not as good as the first book or even the second. The beginning started out slow and confusing because I read the second book when it came out and couldn't remember a lot of the stuff that went on. The end definitely picked up and I was invested by the time I got 3/4 of the way through it.<br />If you read the first two, you'll have to read this one but don't expect the same type of page-turner!
0553801473|5.0|I never grow tired of the various heroes and heroines.  Keep making new adventures for me to read.  Keep'em in print. coming.
0783225857|5.0|It's one of the all-time best movies ever made. This is a movie we purchased for our grandchildren so they would know what life was like when we were young.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|This is a very good movie. The acting is great with all actors. Even Jodi Foster, which I usually detest her femdom acting and roles, did well. The story is well done, however, the director is going through some growing pains. He has a bright future ahead. the CGI was stunning. I took one star off for the violence. It was grotesque.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Great and wonderful book!!!<br />Love it!<br />i recommend this book to everyone.<br />You'll know a lot more about yourself.<br />And the way Gary writes is very funny!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great read, could not put it down.  Hoped for a good ending and surely received more than what I expected.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think is a good game for people that love animals. Also people that love horses. I think it teachs you how to take care of a horse or horses.
B009CGGOT4|4.0|Not the Robin Hood that I was expecting but a very good movie and storyline just the same. I liked it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so much fun, and I thought it would be more of a children's game but I don't know when I have had more fun!!!! :)
0792844890|4.0|great spoof, one of Brooks best. Whether you prefer Star Trek or Star Wars, or any of the older space movies or T.V., they all fall victim to Brooks humor with Rick Moranis, Bill Pullman and John Candy at the helm.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Everyone needs  to watch this series. The writing is awesome! I love it, I grab some popcorn get all nice and comfy and the fun starts.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|These CDs were bought as a gift for my daughter. First the delivery was vet delayed.<br />Second they were remakes not originals. They were not cheap and I expected better quality my daughter dose not Sven view them because they skip and they are if poor quality. I would not recommend these very poor quality
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones so much, I have at least five of my close friends who went out and got it. I work at a hospital, and during our breaks we sit around and talk about everything going on in it. It makes you loose yourself in the movie, and you almost feel like you have become a part of it. Great writing for this movie, I can't wait until next season to come.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The writing is amazing and the story though sad is a great love story in the end. Make you look at things in a different sense.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has the ability to turn history into a page turner.  Her emphasis on what Lincoln did in terms of seeking the advice of his adversaries can sometimes be overlooked....This is a  major work.
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|It is a good game but the combat is dull and boring I suggest the option of watching your units in a battle simulation where you can see which tactics work and which do not.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This is Reznor's best since the Fragile.  &#34;Everything&#34; is still a bizarre choice for the album as far as I'm concerned, but there are so many other powerful cuts here.  If you're getting into NIN right now, start with the Fragile.  TDS is a better album, but less accessible.  This one's very accessible and the live performances make the songs even better when you go back to them on the LP.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|This app is actually very entertaining for like an hour than your like ugh , it also took like 15 minutes to download and I have high speed Internet so really it's a waste of time even if it is free and that's my opinion
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Ask yourself what you want from a live Metallica album. This one's their best since LSB&P, maybe even better. Great energy and solid performances. I only would ask for it to be longer.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game my daughter and I both love it. It is great for just killing time. Love it
0525953728|5.0|What's cooler than DEVGRU? DEVGRU killing UBL.  This book's a giant rush.  Mark Owen's a giant American hero among giant American heroes.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game is awesome you can collect different charcters every time you get to the score that you need to collect the character's
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|What the hell is this? Who are David Bowie fans? Are they real? I got introduced to Bowie's music by way of Trent Reznor's work on I'm Afraid of Americans back in the 90s.  I've tried many times since then, buying Bowie albums when they come out.  If this one isn't his last album, it will be for me.  It's just awful.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very addicting. Can't wait for thing to finish.Just sit watching and eating so I can make more stuff.<br />Great game.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Great timepiece, impressive action, and above-average acting (for a martial arts film). One of a select few blurays I own.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Stays fresh, in fact it keeps getting better! Just when you think it might start to get stale, they throw in some amazing twist and it's all new again!
B0088W7VNG|4.0|The cast is less than the original 'Stargate.' No Amanda Tapping, no Dean Anderson, no Christopher Judge. So it gets one star less than Stargate. Now you know.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app shows you exactly what you want to see and whatever state  city.  And I love the new m points so easy to get.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Love Tom Cruise.  He is SO serious in this movie though.  I know he can be funny, but didn't see it here much.  The tech thing was over the top.  Like the tech was taking place for the lack of a solid story which left me somewhat flat.  They need to stop worrying about keeping movies in that 90 minute window and get back to telling a good story.
B00190OHD6|2.0|Boring and unbelievable.  I wanted to see it for the scenery of Ireland, but the storyline was awful!  It was very disappointing!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This is definitely my kind of game! There's lots of investigating and mystery and puzzle solving... I highly recommend it!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|This is a great movie!  I happen to like it over all 3 LOTR movies myself.  The only thing is do not buy this thinking the Ultraviolet will work.  Its horrible but in Blue-Ray....  wow.  I can't wait to buy the second one when it comes out!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really like the different levels you can play in the game. Lots of deer to shoot. But also other animals. Fun stuff indeed.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was an enjoyable book. ..funny, and some drama. Good storyline and will keep you guessing. I give it 3 stars
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app closes apps your not using, cleans old app and junk you are no long using along with anything deleted apps leave behind. You can also delete app with this. This truly dose as stated.
B00EIRLQ2M|2.0|Like Flippix apps much better.  This was kind of &#34;ho-hum&#34; and more difficult to play.  If you like these type of games I do recommend the apps in the Flippix line.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This is a very fun game, but the issue of buying a better chance to win is irritating, and the minutes you must wait between games is a turn off.  But it's a hit game. I saw several people playing on airlines a week ago. They must have more money to sink than I have.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Great book would have loved a more definite reunion between the two, when is the next book coming?  Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome because it's so much fun for the little one's it's my favourite game you should totally give this game a try
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it was ok some times it freezes but other than that I love it and am addicted to it! !
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This was one of the best, if not the best, puzzle games ever! It's graphics were great and I loved the story line!
B00942Y35S|5.0|Great family movie with inspirational message about loving yourself for who you are.  Cute and funny with a heartwarming ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it's finally available for my kindle!! I have been waiting forever. And back to my original level. Happy!!
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Ultra Violent when not necessary, and a gruffy voice make this film rather...uh...dreddful.  While many of the special effects were very artfully done, this movie isn't worth the hassle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played for real it's awesome I will play it forever and forever
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Love 007 movies. Always lots of action and espionage, love all the gadgets they use.  Would recommend if you enjoy 007 movies.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I love the app but take away the ads. My nieces be searching on here too you know... but love the app still!! &amp;#60;3
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Too depressing . Could not watch the whole movie.  Just thought it was not something I really wanted to continue to watch.
B00G9QLP9Y|1.0|THIS APP IS AWFUL... IT IS HORRIBLE... I HATE IT... IF I COULD, I WOULD RATE THIS APP ZERO STARS!!!!!
B005HTC57K|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to this album, and now, I have no idea why.  This album is amazing, nothing short of a brilliant follow-up to Person Pitch.  With the limited ed. 4 LP set, there's even a bonus track included (The Preakness) not found on other pressings.<br /><br />As mentioned in another review, the arrangement of tracks is somewhat different due to the bonus track, but for such a good cut, missing out on the infinite runout is a small price to pay for The Preakness.<br /><br />Presentation here is great!  Sturdy box with individual LP sleeves for each record and an art book.<br /><br />The 3rd and 4th records are bonus discs that include single mixes, instrumentals, and acapellas.  The acapellas are a bit misleading, in the sense that they don't have additional vocal tracks recorded to replace the instruments, they're more &#34;vocal tracks only&#34; versions.  Still very interesting to hear given the talent of Mr. Noah Lennox.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Ah PBS... what gifts you bring.  Love the writing, love the costumes, love the acting.  Great series.  Can hardly wait for Season 4.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|I bought it for my wife and my wife likes this album.  She is not normally a big fan of Sheryl Crow but she does like this one.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Got this app fort grandsons. I thought it. Was nice how they combined angry birds with star wars, a nice change for the birds.
0385523394|5.0|It was exactly what I ordered and it was at my door fast! The book? eh, the series is better.
B005LAII12|5.0|A FUN WEEK END MOVIE TO WATCH NOW THAT WINTER IS HEAR AND YOU SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME IN FRONT OF THE<br />T.V. VERY FUNNY, WATCHED IT A FEW TIMES NOW.
0761169431|5.0|Exactly what you'd expect it would be. I did two of them and now it's collecting dust on a coffee table.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|This show has taken a 180 deg turn. It was very very good before but this season has been great
B009BWGQRE|5.0|High drama, great climbing shots.  Just imagine what climbing was like in the early 1900's, terrible clothing, little weather info!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it.  Only problem is I'm addicted.  Took it off then put it back two weeks later!  Like I said.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Er mer gersh ! I love this game... it challenges my brain and the colors.....,. they're so bright and. I lurv therm.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Not better than the Emma Thompson/Kenneth Branagh romp from a while back, but surprisingly good. And, of course, Nathan Fillion's Dogberry is much better than Michael Keaton's turn in the clownish role. Keaton seemed to have wandered into the lovely period comedy from a nearby Monty Python sketch. Fillion does some subtle things with the comic lines that took me by surprise - and his performance fits the production, does not jar as Keaton's does. Amy Acker is surprisingly strong as Beatrice. I expected a stronger performance from Alexis Denisof as Benedick. But, over all, this version of one of my favorite plays did not disappoint.
B001VFTYW8|3.0|So many of her books with Scarpetta are repetitious. One minute the characters are best friends, then they hate each other, then their best friends like family, Then they hate each other. Then their sick, but you don't find out if their cured or still sick,but their still flying helicopters.Back a bunch or books ago Lucy was working with an ex FBI guy and he was like her second in command.<br />The next book he's gone. What happened? I love series books, but this is to goofy. Some bad guys she keeps bringing back, that would be alright I guess if some of it wasn't complete nonsense.
1600108512|5.0|It came and was so shiny...I could hardly bring myself to touch the pages...but my six-year-old granddaughter caught sight of it and devoured it in an evening. Very nice to have this lovely tale in a graphic novel format that can be enjoyed by someone who, while a precocious reader, is not yet up to the full novel. As luck would have it, we had tickets to see a screening of the film with Peter S. Beagle in attendance the very next week. I was very proud to introduce my granddaughter to him. She complimented him on his really good story, and got the book autographed. She draws unicorns everywhere now.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I would have given it five stars, except the picture was to dark. This is a different kind of scary, that makes you keep coming back for more.
B003QSLDTA|5.0|i love this movie it is really funny and clever on the words i really really really really like it
B008Y7FQ6E|3.0|it's sort of boring! If not for Tommy Lee Jones, This would be a real flop. If your having a boring day, you can put this on to take up some of your time.
B0098XY5VK|1.0|its good for the first part but then you save you think its saved but its not it doesn't save your place so you have to start all over
B008Y212PI|4.0|Got this awhile ago when it was the free app of the day but just had a chance to play it.  I like it a lot and have become a bit addicted, keep doing just 1 more....<br />Have to think a little bit but not enough to make it frustrating.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|The discription of this movie intrigued me so I thought I'd try something different and rent it.  Loved the movie and bought it after.  Exciting, suspenseful and thought provoking throughout the movie.  Friends I've told about the movie have loved it as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite reads. I read it many years ago and it has shape my thinking in many ways. Today as a pastor I am called to do many funerals as I prepare and preform the service it is always presented as a speaker for the dead. Pastor Jimmy
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Switch was absolutely phenomenal! It's a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone who's found themselves in a rut, and is looking for a way to get out
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I love these guys, they are very calming me. I go to sleep every night to them. And some nights I don't sleep.they
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is a great game. I have the kindle fire hd, and it runs smoothly and amazingly. Game play is great. I keep winning. I guess that's why I like it so much. Ha ha.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Fabulous app.  Quickly, easily and effectively cleans out captured memory and deletes junk files.  In five clicks I've done it all.
B00GIXWXEO|2.0|Terrible movie. I only gave it two stars because we finished it, barely. There are much better movies for rent.<br /><br />For comparison, off the top of my head, of the movies available at Amazon Instant Video, here are movies that both my children and I always (or almost always enjoy):<br /><br />Tangled; Incredibles; Finding Nemo; Monsters, Inc.; Despicable Me; Toy Story; Toy Story II, Toy Story III; Shrek; Megamind; Kung Fu Panda; Ice Age: The Meltdown; Bee Movie; Tarzan; Enchanted; Cars<br /><br />Here are the movies that my children enjoy, and I sometimes enjoy:<br /><br />Bolt; Meet the Robinsons, Monsters U; Brave; Shrek 2; Shrek 3; How to Train Your Dragon; Rio; Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs; Madagascar; Madagascar 2; Mulan; Pocahontas; Bug's Life; Lilo & Stitch; Hunchback of Notre Dame<br /><br />Here are movies that are great, but both my children and I must be in a certain mood to watch:<br /><br />Wall-E; Up; Ratatouille; Robin Hood; Sword in the Stone; Alice in Wonderland; Most of the older Disney movies<br /><br />Movies that don't make the cut, which means we only watch them if we're desperate and my children lose interest fast:<br /><br />Turbo; Planes, Emperor's New Grove (though Kronk is very funny); Cars 2; Madagascar 3; Hercules
1582701709|5.0|Absolutely one my favorite books, have read and reread. Great way to start you on your destiny. Its definitely an intro to LOA.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|This is not a how-to book on parenting, but as a parent, it certainly made me rethink some of my approaches and definitions of success. A good read!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Amazing book! Some of the experiments on it will literally blow your mind. A must have! I have recommended to many!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Love Leonardo Dicaprio but thought this movie, way, way beneath his acting ability. Of course, the fact that I only gave it 25 minutes before turning it off as a waste of my time, maybe it isn't fair that I review it. Had I been at a theatre I would have demanded my money back. I suppose that's not possible with Amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Keeps you going back and trying to go further I'm stuck on 7 would like some instructions on how to go to next step
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever I play it all the time I even have it on Pc but the updates for pe are very slow. :)
B008JFUPZI|4.0|Interesting movie but I felt like I was watching &#34;Men in Black&#34; adapted to dead people.  Jeff Bridges was a bit much in his performance, more ham than character
B002M9WW30|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  He's always been a Rocky fan and requested the set for Christmas. He loved them!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I loved this game even though it is terribly addictive, but now, for an unknown reason it won't load. I don't know what the problem is, but I miss playing.
B006GSRFOY|5.0|The Nightlife Deluxe package stands out with the best of the re release packages. The album itself is great from the very bluesy title track, to an obscure song with piano like 'Frankie Carrol' to the stand out solo by the one and only Gary Moore on 'Still In Love With You.' The bonus disc has some great BBC recordings of 'She Knows' , 'Dear Heart' and 'Philomena.' My favorite 2 bonus tracks are the 2 alternate version of 'Still in Love with You.' ONe has Gary Moore basically singing duet with Philip Lynott, the other is  a rougher recording that shows just how studious the band was even at the beginning when Robbo and Gorham joined. I always thought Robertson's playing reminding me of bird's chirping.I must admit the lead playing on both versions of 'She Knows' has to be one the best rock guitar pieces I have ever heard. And certainly this record was wrongly overlooked. If you like funk , jazz , blues and rock... buy this record in the deluxe edition... it's a gem in the Thin Lizzy catalogue.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|An amazing book told from an amazing point of view. Couldn't' t put it down. Must admit that tears flowed more than once.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|All the numbers and symbols are large. It shows several numbers and opperations that you have entered. I love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they finally have Candy Crush for Kindle. The only thing that would make it better is unlimited lives! :)
B003GQM52Q|3.0|I watched this because I desired to see the similarities to Tombstone. Wyatt Earp goes deeper into his youth and may be a bit more accurate and revealing. However, Tombstone, especially the ending I found more exciting. I did fast forward a bit as I watched Wyatt Earp.
B007EC27QM|4.0|This app is just so easy tipe in what numbers you want and BAM it will give you the answer it's easyer  then a old school  calculator;)<br /><br />PS  do not listen  to the bad  reviews;)
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The movie arrived promptly and in good condition.  This is a Christmas gift for my daughter and I know she'll be thrilled!
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|very good app. I hope it continues to work this well. will be looking forward to any additions that may come.
B001NLL93W|5.0|It was a very good book romantic and a lot of action I didn't want it to end I loved it
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Love her voice and keyboard play.  Songs are in a different order than in movie, but that did not affect anything.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Both my husband and I love this movie. We watch it often -- and that's unusual considering my husband doesn't like movies all that much, but he'll pick this one out and indicate we haven't seen it in a month. Ruth's attempt at swearing is a little odd but overall the movie makes for a wonderful story about the interaction between humans and an alien and our attempt to help the alien get home. Even if the alien is &#34;a bit rude,&#34; that's what makes him like us and creates the bond between him and the characters in the movie. The &#34;big guy&#34; is a hilarious reference to another movie about aliens, and when Tara delivers her line and punches the big guy, it's even more so. Great lines. Just wish they'd do a Paul 2!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game, a little challenging at times.  Mostly play when on line, or waiting at a doc's office.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Dialogue is not very sharp and the plot is not very good.  She needs to spread her wings and try something fresh.  Characters are stagnant.  I have read all her books.  She's got too much talent to waste.
B008602KQI|4.0|I am not sure I like children killing children, but the society thing is interesting to say the least. The actors did a great job. Very thought provoking.
B009CVRQLY|3.0|I listened it, but did not love anything on the album at first. I guess it will grow on me, but her songs were not like I was used to 15 years ago. Her voice is still great and that is why I listen to her music still. She needs R. Kelly to be writing for her again.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Finally an action/rpg worth playing! I've been enjoying this high speed action packed game since I downloaded it yesterday.  Highly recommended.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Love how they packaged the movie collection, and the DVD's have commentary. I would get the TNG box set next just to complete the set.
B00F88U4J6|5.0|This is great for studying. It would be awesome if you could download pdf' s too.I would recommend this product.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|It has all the shows in a nice box and its all in order. Each DVD is nicely labeled with the name of the episodes on the DVD its self. It you a TNG fan I would say get it and you will be glad you did!!
B00FN811SY|5.0|We are so happy to have this. It is very easy to use and it has so many wonderful features. It makes things so much easier.
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|Really good movie.  Good story. Good acting.  All about the circle of life for an orphan who ends up being groomed for his future by his mentor at the orphanage.  He is given his chance to explore the world but ends up in a place he was not aiming for and realizes he has been trained for this moment his whole life.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I give this game two thumbs up! I have a long way to go to get good at it, but it certainly is fun. The graphics and sound are great. Have fun playing Tony Stark!!
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|I like the game but it takes to long to wait to play again and a lot of times it doesn't let you watch a video to play again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game deserves a 5 star review it's amazing. I love to play it when I'm bored or doing nothing fun except of course this.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I choose to read the book because it's very popular and I wanted to realize why.<br />I belive this is the reading for housekeepers with luck of interesting activities in their lives and do not like it very much. Too many descriptions about everythings and too easy e
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I like it because you can be a huge shark!<br /><br />:D my favorite game for life!<br /><br />O.O<br />:3<br /><br />And I just want Too say..... that whom ever made this game... is awesome, and had a great idea.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|We continue to enjoy The Good Wife with the exception of the unnecessary sexual interludes that add nothing to the series.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Loved the TV Movie, Doctor Who is a great TV Show, the next episode is eagerly anticipated.  What more do I say.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This is one of the best actions movies I have seen.  It is action packed and has a pretty good story line.  It kept you in suspense most of the movie, you really couldn't tell which way the movie would end.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|As someone who is and was not a religious person, this was an eye opening account of Jesus of Nazarth. I learned more about history through this book, and the author's writing is engaging as well. Some parts confused me, I must admit, but overall a great learning experience.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|My partner is a star trek fan and he was very happy to get this movie and he also was very pleased with the movie.
B009AMANBA|5.0|whoo he was a strange man and I very much enjoyed the movie. Not sure if it is everyones viewing it was drawn out and in some parts slow but I enjoyed it
B00164KYV4|5.0|Yea this is a nice girlie movie and 3 woman watched it together and we enjoyed it but again it is not everyones movie choice.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but it did take some time to get into. Once I got thru a fair way it turned out to be a great read and I would recommend anyone to keep reading and it will grab you.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|great movie plenty of action but also a good story. We loved it and watched it from start to finish and could not even pause it for a coffee or anything else.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow!  Suzanne Collins has got me so caught up in this story that I cannot stop.  I  find myself completely surrounded by her characters in her world as I read the Hunger Games volumes.  This 2nd part of the trilogy was equally exiting as the 1st.  The 3rd book is already on my Kindle and I can't wait.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|OK, it is a somewhat entertaining movie. Kind of sad the way the story assumes that brutal murdering of other people just comes so naturally to these kids. Maybe the book brought out the sheer horror of the situation. The movie sure doesn't.<br />It seemed as though I went from watching American Idol to Survivor. Once upon a time authors did not have to steal their ideas from television in order to achieve a plot that seemed relevant. The whole fascist theme could come out of any totalitarian regime, past or present.<br />If it serves to wake anyone up to the rapid demise of our freedoms and total disrespect for our inalienable rights as human beings perhaps it is worth the price of a ticket or rental.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another amazing story by Preston & Child. There wasn't a single dull moment in this entire book and of course all the characters we've grown to love so much are in no way shape or form a let down.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Little flaws in story like lots of movies, but it was very entertaining. I heard it was nothing like the book which made a lot of people angry, but if you don't watch it for love of the book, I think it is a good, not great movie.
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|This is just a great movie. Fun style and directing, a memorable story. And it had great music, action, and suspense.
B003XU02QG|3.0|Solid, but forgettable. Just another action movie really. Some things happened, some people fought, I forgot most of it. Blah.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|awesome in every way possible, Harvey is the BOMB!!!! but nothing without MIKE!!!!! Jessica rocks the Office, and Lewis is the best character by far you can hate him and love him tremendous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game it is great very addicting and fun to play my kids are in love with game too
B00GX50BD2|5.0|Great movie. Its only a synopsis, I guess the story is too long to detail in a regular movie time frame. I love the line: &#34;Create a problem and find a solution.&#34; Very buddha !
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game has been really fun for me and I am a big fan of equestria girls, but it is not possible to get Luna without buying.I am sad because it will take me months to get enough gems and bits to finish the game.But, if you don't mind paying, this game could be fun for you.I hope that this review was helpful!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This was a very good dictionary with a lot of details though I did not find much interest in it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This app is ultra addicting and tons of fun. The only problem is that you only get 7 times to fight every hour and a quarter or so.
