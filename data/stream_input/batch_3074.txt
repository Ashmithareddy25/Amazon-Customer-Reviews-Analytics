B007IXWKUK|3.0|It may not be the greatest book ever written; but by the end of the book I feel as if I need to know what is going to happen next! One more book to go!!:)
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie! I've already watched the DVD several times! The songs get stuck in your head and you'll find yourself singing the parts after you've watched the movie !!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|This is the 2nd movie, in the 3rd group, of Star Trek Movies. If you didn't know that, you are young and inexperienced. Very good flick.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I love Mumford and Sons, if you've never heard them, you're not living. If you like Simon and Garfunkel, you'll like this band
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite game. LOVE it so so much. I'm hooked and so is the rest of the family.<br />Great for all to play
B007EC27QM|2.0|Great looking app. Not much to plus about. You can scroll the top row but that's about it. Needs some work.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I had read the book years ago and saw the movie, but re-reading it gave me much pleasure as the first time.
0385737955|5.0|This is a great series of books that really focus on character development. They are very Hunger Gameish, so if you enjoyed those books you will enjoy these. The first book is the best in the series, where as the second and third books stall slightly toward their conclusions.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When I have been caught in a boring waiting room without my kindle, I can just wip out my phone and continue reading.<br />Love it!!!!
B000GWE44U|4.0|Read the book and rented the movie the day I had finished it. The book was better, but the movie is good too
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|fast reading - kept my interest.  would recommend to anyone who wants an easy read and interesting twist in the ending.
B00B9366VO|5.0|OK, I'm a geek for recording studios, but I found this quite interesting. The video is roughly 2/3 about Sound City and the last 1/3 is the use that Dave Grohl put the Neve console to in his own studio. I'm not a Nirvana or Foo Fighters fan (before I saw this I could not tell you who Grohl was) but it was clear that Grohl takes great joy in the collaborative process of creating music. Watching him get in the studio with other musicians and take an idea, work with it, listen to the results and revise, revise, revise until they were happy with it was great. And, by the way, is there anything Grohl can't do? It appears he can work both sides of the recording booth glass with great facility.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This app is quick and handy for the Kindle Fire. I enjoy using it for tuneups in between other tasks I am doing throughout the day. The variety of challenges keeps me coming back for more.<br />I agree with previous positive posts.
1476727651|2.0|I may have been expecting a lot, as I had the Shinning in mind.  Unfortunately, it  is not a good book.  First, the book itself would be better with half as many pages, as half of it is a recollection of  the author's experience with AA.  Second, the story is lame and poorly written.  The shinning was an exceptional psychological experience.  This book is a washed-down vampire story.  Skip it!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|If you haven't read this book since high school, you may find it greatly improved.<br />It is interesting to observe how much has changed since the book was written, and simultaneously, how much has remained the same.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game some what of a challenge made me really think.  Can't wait for more levels so I can keep on playing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is addictive. Easy to play some puzzles more difficult than others which makes it interesting.  Wish I did not have to wait  for additional free lives.<br />TrEe
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|It is amazing that so young a writer could have captured what it is like to be old and reflective of a life lived...not to mention under the terrible psychological circumstances provided in the novel. Few of us have the opportunity afforded Harold Fry and his wife Maureen to re-examine our lives. After reading the novel, we can pause to consider, as Harold and Maureen do intermittently, how they have cut off communication with each other. Tender. moving, and satisfying.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I have never been to France, so I couldn't tell if there were location errors, but I couldn't put it down until I finished the book
B003WQT2YY|2.0|The video had many skips. It felt like I was watching a dirty scratched DVD. I've seen the movie a long time ago and loved it.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I thought it was a good book with an equal combination of funny and serious topics. It wasn't as laugh out loud funny as I had thought it would be, but that's not a bad thing. I recommend this book.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|This is Katy Perry's third and, unfortunately, awfully unimaginative album. I find myself skipping half of the tracks. They're boring, play-it-safe songs with a very rigid musical formula. I enjoy pop music that pushes the boundaries a little...this doesn't. At all.
0393317552|5.0|There are only a few truly comprehensive theories in science. Those that seem to explain any and all scenarios that you can come up with considering a given topic. Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Darwin's Theory of Evolution, Newton's Laws of Thermodynamics, The Theory of Plate Tectonics. All of these theories completely changed the sciences that they address. What previously seemed impossible to explain suddenly made sense. Diamond's book does the same thing for human bio-geography. Not a science you say. maybe not, but why not apply the scientific method any way and see what falls out. Diamond has done just that and in the process made us reconsider so many previous theories. Don't take my word for it, just read it and find out for yourself. This book isn't the end all of the subject matter, it just scratches the surface and allows us all to start thinking about some amazing stuff. Good job Jared. Keep up the good work.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I love this movie. I think Daniel Craig is easily the best James Bond, if not he's second in line to Connery. Of his movies, I think this is by far the best so far. It delves into the past of the James Bond character, in a modern fast paced setting and the villain is truly haunting. Bravo.
B00ERH15WY|4.0|Given the nature of BR, this is obviously an odd choice for them to deliver.  However, knowing that they're also capitalists (and I'm all for that!) I can see several of these songs being used in movies and TV in the coming years which will earn them additional royalties... from public domain music.  My question to those who think that BR made this out of spite:  Do you think they made it to be ironic or to cover songs that will net them a relatively easy profit?<br /><br />I'll get the bad out of the way first.  Why 4 and not 5 stars?  2 reasons:<br />1.  White Christmas in the middle of the set-list disrupts the flow of the album.  I think it's a great Ramones tribute, and this would have been better served as being the ending track, replacing American Jesus (re-mixed, but barely noticeable).<br />2.  The deletion of Silent Night.  While a mainstay in their Christmastime live performances, I was shocked to see it not make the set-list.  Perhaps they thought fans have heard it enough?  It's too bad, because I was hoping to hear a cleaned-up arrangement of the song.<br /><br />The good:<br />Not just song, but the verse selection makes this delivery outstanding.  Many traditional Christmas hymns contain multiple verses dealing with the triumphant entry of Christ to the world.  The story of Christmas is the story of the Bible:  Jesus coming to earth to save people from Satan.  The song, \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" makes it specifically clear that this is a cry for help.  This (and most Christmas hymns) are not feel-good songs about getting egg nog and shopping for gifts at the local mall, but rather, a call to \\"Ransom captive Israel...From depths of Hell Thy people save, And give them victory o'er the grave!\\"<br /><br />These hymns require a righteous anger to be used, and Bad Religion brings that with their trademark harmonies, arrangements and fast power.  This isn't a sloppy punk-rock Christmas album, but rather a polished, uptempo collection of traditional melodies.<br /><br />My commentary:<br />Perhaps the most powerful message of this album is that of a differing perspective.  If you've listened to their discography, the concept of Hell is a rampant theme throughout their music.  The hymns sung here show a different perspective of Hell to BR members and fans alike.  The song, \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman\\" says clearly, \\"Christ, our Saviour Was born on Christmas day To save us all from Satan's power....\\"  On the flip side, Christians will listen differently and pick up something new, and perhaps hear a verse that they haven't heard sung before.<br /><br />Several of these songs are centuries old, and there's a reason why they've stood the test of time.  Excellent song writing and arrangements always sound good, no matter the year.  God's Truth will always prevail, even if it comes from an unlikely source.<br /><br />Thanks to Bad Religion for making this album, and treating the songs with respect.
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|I love the Flower kings , i own all there albums, all the solo stuff too.  all it took was 1 listen and i can say that this is there best since  my personal favorite \\"rain maker\\" how you say can i make such a statement after one listen ? well because I Vinny the old hippy being one of only 2 ACME CERTIFIED SUPER GENIUS ( W.E. COYOTE the other) JUST KNOW THESE THINGS !  All kidding aside this one is really good,I highly recommend it.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This is the same app you can get in other places for other devices.  My only wish is that clicking a link in those e-mails you get all the time would take you to the app instead of the web browser.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|A fun read about quirky but believable characters.  Situation is not unusual....Breakfast at Tiffany's , for example, but the well written story carries one along with it.  I enjoyed this book.
B0002HWQEE|4.0|This is very cute, and my daughter loves it, but the pull string is a solid yellow, not the cute multi color shown. Also, the string is bulging in a couple of spots after only a couple weeks of play. Not sure, what's going on with this, but hopefully it doesn't continue or we may have to return.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I'm a big history buff, and while this movie takes a definite turn from the cliche history type movies hollywood often produces I just couldn't get into it. It's super slow to start, and I just had a hard time taking Lewis as lincoln. For all the awards and raving I just am not a huge fan and won't be re-watching it.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I'd seen the film twice in the theater and was very pleased with the quality of the DVD and extras. Loved the commentaries and behind the scenes footage. Well done Joss!
B00992CF6W|5.0|my nine year old nephew and six year old son are minecraft fanatics and according to them this app has content not available on the xbox version which they enjoy.they cant stop talking about it and playing it.they have become so creative and it really opened the doors of communication in the house and gave them something they could have in common.endless surprises and crafting.
B004GYY714|4.0|I got this app because my wife was going to be on a local radio station, but not one big enough to be in the &#34;heart&#34; group.  I was able to load the app and find the station within a few minutes.
B001USHRCK|5.0|My son just loves this set - its another LEGO set that not only lives up to its expectations, but surprises you with the cute tiny food items that you aren't expecting.  LEGO is the best.
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|this movie was alright it was interesting but it just wasn't scary enough. This movie is pretty much an every once in a while movie but nothing u would want to watch over and over again.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|This is a great game for kids ages 3.5 and up.  Cute and fun and not to hard.  But I did just start using it.
B00EY7LT9Q|2.0|I saw the first and fifth episodes.  Based on that I'd say AOS is true to its comic book origins: superheros without true character traits.  Some are saved, some die, some go to limbo.  And that's about it.  I'd call it harmless but for the propaganda - the agency is the good guys & anything they do is for public protection; trust us we work for the government.  Come to think of it, I wouldn't want kids to see it either.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this game is fast-paced and has great graphics for a hand-held game.  I really enjoy the adventure!  Kudos and thanks for a fantistic adventure!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I've been a ST fan for quite some time.  The series has found ways to continue for a long time.  This &#34;reboot&#34; requires you believe in an alternate time line than the previous 30 years and multiple series have constructed.  It's entertaining, but mostly about the action sequences.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app works decently, and at least hasn't gotten worse like FB for iOS has with every update. On the Kindle, every so often the newsfeed will all of a sudden start scrolling like crazy by itself, but other than that it works as intended. It's now to the point where I wish the app on my iPhone worked as good as this one does.
B00471TLZS|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out..loved it then...still do!  I think it is one of the classic movies that stood the test of time&#62;
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|I picked this rating because my granddaughter and I have a lot of fun picking polish and playing this game
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I started reading the books after I had seen the first movie, this series was impossible to put down! And it made me wish there were more then just 3 books
B007MD2RHC|5.0|If you like to listen to beautiful and inspiring music, this CD will not disappoint.  I listen to it while working out on my ellipitcal.  The songs have a flow to them that help me get through 30 second intervals of really intense exercise.  I don't like to listen to music that has words (songs do have some singing, but they aren't noticeable and are not in English) while working out because it can be distractive.  I close my eyes and go with the flow of the songs.  I also like Gladiator and Braveheart soundtracks.
B004T32SOK|5.0|I can access my Box and Dropbox accounts through my QuickOffice Pro app.  That avenue doesn't work if I want to download onto the local memory.  The Box app allows me full access to Box files and will let me download into the device.  Very handy if you're going to be somewhere without wi-fi access.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Although the Kindle has it's own built-in PDF reader, I like to use this instead. It has a few more features for manipulating the files, and is free!
0061914177|5.0|Gary puts thing is simple terms yet in a very motivating way.<br /><br />By chapter 3 you'll be immersed in the entrepreneur spirit.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|Always love this simple game.  It is easy to play even with younger kids.  Great while waiting on doctor appointment
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works like a charm  Got it for my android and my PC.  Great idea and easy to use.  thank you Kindle
B00G15MWSG|5.0|If you are a fan of Dragon Ball Z series, YOU WILL LOVE THIS INSTALLMENT...don't miss on this. I really liked how the character development of many has taken place. I don't want to give out too much as it will be a spoiler. Do see it for yourself
B004UIOUHC|1.0|The Amazon app store is about the same as the Google marketplace when it comes to K Fire apps.  I was looking for an alternate browser to Silk.  I am perfectly fine with the browser, except that it doesn't consistently load web pages that I need to access.  I eventually found a web site mentioned in the Kindle Help Forum (goodereader) where I could download the APK file and sideload into the KFHD.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|There's two kinds of people in this world: those who love this movie, and those who are wrong. If you're here reading reviews, there's really nothing I can say that will help you. This is one of those few movies where there are just too many good scenes to mention before you just end up retelling the entire movie. Also, that rug really tied the room together.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is just hard enough to be a challenge, but not so hard that you have to pay to win.
B005NFWCSK|4.0|I love X-men and this movie didn't disappoint with its great story line and action-packed scenes. The only thing that bothers me is the use of the GD curse word, it's not necessary: thus the 4 stars instead of 5.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Honestly, I just downloaded this early this Halloween morning, and mainly just cause Amazon was offering 20 free coins for downloading it. I didn't really expect it to work, but lo and behold...IT WORKED! O_O It was easy to figure out the controls. I had no problems downloading it to my Kindle Fire with no problem whatsoever. It does work. I don't know how it works, but it works. My kids were watching when I was using it. I pressed 'record' after pressing 'radar'. I chose 'high sensitivity'. I started pointing it around the room, and I picked up some activity in certain parts of my bedroom. The part that spooked the crap out of me was when I pointed it toward my bedroom window. Showed activity there. Why is that spooky? because there is a creepy tree right outside my window that looks like a man hanging upside down. :( Then, intermittently, the radar would records words I guess it picked up on around my room. Kinda creepy if I do say so myself. O_O Try it, unless you're scared.
1416524800|5.0|Just as informative as his other books but a little different. It is more like an Arctic adventure. There is plenty of education on outer space and how we came to know about it. A really good read.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have a 12C at work - which I rarely use.  This app has all the same functionality in a device I regularly carry with me.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I saw it at the movies and could not resist buying it.  It never ceases to amaze me how young people can act...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved it, I was thinking book #2 was not not going to be as good. I was wrong!! read it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing this on my son's Ipod...and then he went a trip good a month. It was like going to rehab and detoxing...now that this game is available on my kindle...well, one word; relapse. =)
B006R1T40I|5.0|Listeners will not be disappointed, from mellow to hard rocker, she's one of the best in the world!  Happy wife, happy husband ......hmmmm
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The BBC team pulled off an incredible story with beautiful imagery. I really enjoyed all the helicopter fly overs of the animals and crystal blue waters on an HD TV. It's so amazing to see how very green some parts of the earth are away from city life.<br /><br />From what I remember - this series is the original out of all the \\"Planet Earth\\" series videos. If you have other versions of these \\"Planet Earth\\" compilations (Discovery Channel, Disney, etc), they share a lot of the same scenes.<br /><br />If you want a great collection of elegant and powerful animals filmed in their natural habitat - do not miss out on a great Blu-ray to add to your library.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Nate Ryder, and the world wide movement of spiritual awakening that he heads, confront a larger and even more powerful sinister organization, Omnia, in this, the third climactic volume in the Inner Movement series. The fast paced action has also been racheted up a few notches.<br /><br />Excitement and surprises show up around every corner and the twisty plot involves more than one interesting science fiction idea, including questions about the nature of time, reality, free will, and good and evil.<br /><br />But to get the most out of this wild ride, you really need to read the other two books in this series first:  [[ASIN:B00BB3UYS8 Outview (The Inner Movement)]] and [[ASIN:B00DIMXTBO Outin (The Inner Movement)]].
B002M9WW30|5.0|All the movies in one collection. Having a chance to watch them again reminds you of what good films they really are….
B001XVCYH2|3.0|I saw bits and pieces of this for years, then finally watched the whole thing in the trilogy.  It's fine, it doesn't really dot the I's or cross the T's, but it wraps things up.  Everyone would have liked both of the sequels to be a mind blowing as the original, nevertheless, the full trilogy is satisfying as a whole, and this is an important piece of that satisfaction.
006202406X|2.0|spoilers ***<br /><br />This series had good potential. I loved Divergent that I finished it in 8 hours, Insurgent was pretty much okay except for the fighting part, but Allegiant? What happened? I have excitedly anticipated this book for months (I even pre ordered it), just to find out how disappointing this book is. The plot, specifically the climax, was slow and boring. Each idea was repeated a bajillion times, and you couldn't tell who was narrating- Four or Tris? Four or Tris? There was no distinct voice between them. Lastly, Tris death just made this book more terrible than it already was. All along I believed that Tris would never die because she is such an important character; she is one of the pillars of the story. Allegiant was such a bad conclusion.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book. I wished I never even read this. If you finished the first two books, stop there, and end this trilogy with your own imagination.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is an awesome app! It's fast and fun and I love it!!<br /> When I play this it feels like I'm conquering the very quest I have as the beasts lie dead at my feet!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|This is an exciting historical thriller with all the ingredients of a classic James Bond adventure - spies, beautiful women, fast cars, and a dastardly villain. The plot is based on a fascinating idea.  Agent 17F, of the Allied Forces's Naval Intelligence Department is assigned an ironic mission - to SAVE Hitler from being assassinated!<br /><br />Near the end of WWII, Hitler's incompetence and fragile hold on sanity was a major factor that eventually led to Germany's defeat. And there WERE saner minds in Germany who did realize this and plotted to assassinate Hitler and replace him with a more lucid, capable leader.<br /><br />And so it became agent Ian Fleming's bizarre duty to SAVE HITLER! What an intriguing premise for a suspenseful historical thriller!<br /><br />If you enjoy James Bond stories you'll enjoy this entertaining tribute to his creator.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|Love this movie,we took our son who was 5 years old at time of the original release of this film at the Zigfeld theater in NYC at a premire and it's been one of our favorite Pixar films. Now we get to introduce it to our 3 year old granddaughter, whom we purchased this disk for. Oh and she loves it!!!!!
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I know what you're thinking,,,&#34;Wow, giant robots fighting giant monsters....wow.&#34;  This was many shades better than I expected, and I was willing to try it because of the director.  It tells a story, it's awesome giant fight scenes.  I will watch this a couple time.  It pleasantly surprised me.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I've been a trekkie for 30+ years and I've seen them all (multiple times).  This is a great crew with just the right amount of humor.  This movie left me wanting another.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|Excellent plot & acting, as well as special effects.  I miss the STTNG crew & would love to see another movie!
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|You want an app that tells you the temperature, no if's and's or but's.... this is your app.<br /><br />No ads in the middle of the app. And best of all NO WEIRD PERMISSIONS NEEDED...you know, like the ones that want access to your contacts, and they are not related to making phone calls.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|The music just pulls you right in and stays  with  you.  This isn't last week's buy it and forget it.  This one is measured in decades.
B0013FNC38|5.0|bought it as a gift for my wife and we both enjoyed it. sounds great. Jason mraz is most definitely a great entertainer.
1451666179|5.0|I love Allie Brosh's writing. Her unique way of seeing the world, paired with her self-deprecating sense of humor, is a joy to encounter.<br /><br />I was disappointed that some of my favorite stories from Allie's blog weren't included -- particularly stories from her childhood, such as \\"Wolves,\\" \\"The Scariest Story,\\" \\"My Childhood in Pictures,\\" \\"How A Fish Almost Ruined My Childhood,\\" \\"The Year Kenny Loggins Ruined Christmas,\\" \\"Menace,\\" and \\"Allie Starts Her Moon Time.\\"<br /><br />I can only hope that Allie will publish a second book that includes these stories. It's not enough just to read them on the web. They are the kind of stories I want to include on my bookshelf, and read over and over again.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love it. numbers are easy to see and they really thought about the function. I own a small business and use it in my truck in dealing with customers. I have one one my iphone but this one is my fav.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was super good, I could not put it down. The story keeps getting better as you read, you'll have a new level of respect for the Navy Seals, and all 5 branches of the Military after reading this book. A+, these guys put their life on the line so we can enjoy the freedoms we have!<br /><br />Thank you all for your brave service!
B0036BK6MW|4.0|More, much more than a football movie.  It was a movie about power and influence and talent; charity and loyalty; opportunity and emotional healing.  And yes, it was a rags to riches story.  Financial wealth played a key role.  Money made possible many things.  One woman used her power to raise and to benefact. Highly recommend
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|bought it as a gift for my wife and we both enjoyed it. Jason mraz is most definitely a great entertainer.
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|I read the books so quickly and I couldn't get enough. This, however, mixed the first and second books and left out some very integral parts that just made the relationship feel so mundane. This is a supernatural series and the movie super sucked and seemed to last FOREVER!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome show!! Full of suspense, drama, and action. Some new bada**es this season which is cool. Daryl and Michonne are the best!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My 7 &amp; 4 year old sons love this game. It took them awhile to get the hang of it, but once they did, look out! The Halloween upgrade was a nice touch and they are so proud when they get to the Vector battle. The only problem is that it stalls occasionally and I have to restart the Kindle to make it work.
1451666179|5.0|I purchased the paper copy and I was very impressed with the quality of the book.  It's in beautiful color and printed on heavy paper in a smaller format than I expected--it's a pretty hefty book.  The small format actually makes it seem more personal.  It's less \\"share-able\\" when reading, which is a bit of an irony, considering it all started on the web.  Hyperbole and a Half is not the typical slapped-together book based on a blog.  The care and attention given to the physical object reflects the care and attention given to the content.<br /><br />The hefty book matches what can be pretty hefty content.  The new material in the book is hilarious and the chapters on depression should be required reading for anyone treating or suffering from the disease (like Ellen Forney's book about bipolar disorder).  As an avid reader of her blog/webcomic, I waited for years for the book and my high expectations were exceeded.  That isn't a common experience. Then again, Brosh isn't a common talent.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I bought this cable recently. It does not stay in the port on my phone. I have to mess with it continuously and then check on it frequently to get it to actually create a good connection and charge my kindle and phone.<br /><br />I bought a different cable from Radio Shack and it works perfect. I do not believe the quality was good on this product.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is a page turner from page one.  Mr. Card's concept is so different from others in the SiFi genre.  You will catch yourself holding your breath, cheering for Ender and hating many of the characters in this book.  Can't wait to see the movie.  I just hope they follow the storyline as written and don't do a hatchet job on it.  Read this book.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book had so many turns which I loved because it kept it very lively. The ending was crazy and I definitely was not expecting that. I could do without some of the redundancies but the many words of wisdom was worth it. Great read!
B001AW156U|5.0|These real triggers do, in fact, have a slightly textured pad on the surface. That was my question I never had answered. The padding provides increased grip and comfort.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Goonies is definitely a classic.  It is one of those movies you just have to pull out and watch every couple years.  I've seen it at least ten times; with my kids when they were little (they're now all over 30) and just recently by myself and never tire of it. It's funny, a little chaotic, sweet and heartwarming. Great actors. If you've never seen Goonies, no matter what your age is, you owe it to yourself to sit down and watch it. The \\"truffle shuffle\\" always makes me laugh.
1616615362|5.0|If you don't have the Slave 1 you really should make it your next purchase.  This ship is so much fun!  It is quite versatile in its weapons arrangement possibilities.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I like Star Trek. I knew I'd like this movie. They did things with Kahn that I had always wished to see, and Cumberbatch's portrayal was exciting and intense but Montalban had a charisma that can't be repeated. Is the new one better done? Yes, but I wonder what ST2:WOK would have been like with a similar budget. I think the new versions of the main characters act more like teenagers than military officers but are indicative of our present culture. Can't wait for the next one.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|this game is very entertaining. makes you makes you think about solutions for very imaginitive problem . a real time burner .

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Excellent! Keeps you wanting more and more. Each level is fantastic and perfectly strategized. You never know what's coming next.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down! My mom was a gentler tiger mom and a lot of the pressure to do well in school and other activities was self imposed. I am so thankful for practicing all those hours of piano, now I can just enjoy being able to play. I'm 23 now, went to a top university, and have  a good career ahead if me, all because of my upbringing.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|As awesome as the first time around, only more awesomer. The remaster has really brought out some of the cool details hidden or not so prominent in the original .

B0083DJWGO|5.0|Good book, caused me to rethink lots of things. Especially liked the chapters on medicine and its potential for harm.
0307472590|3.0|La premisa de una historia sobre un libro rescatado de un cementerio de libros olvidados me caus&oacute; gran curiosidad y expectativa debido a mi afici&oacute;n por los libros. Me embarqu&eacute; entonces en lo que supuse ser&iacute;a un misterio &#34;literario&#34; en la enigm&aacute;tica Barcelona de principios del siglo XX. Confieso que a pesar de atraparme f&aacute;cilmente me dej&oacute;, despu&eacute;s de muchas vueltas y muchas p&aacute;ginas, cierto sabor a melodrama rebuscado. La prosa de Ru&iacute;z Zaf&oacute;n es sencilla y amena lo cual hace de este libro una lectura r&aacute;pida, pero en mi opini&oacute;n, de poca trascendencia. Sus personajes, todos a cual m&aacute;s frustrados, tienen pocas esperanzas de poder superar la adversidad. Es la historia de primeros amores fracasados que definen a los personajes por el resto de sus vidas, cr&iacute;menes impunes, amistades descarriladas, un asesino psic&oacute;pata, mujeres d&eacute;biles, pobreza, posguerra, desolaci&oacute;n y hasta desfiguraci&oacute;n,entre otras. La trampa del destino que destruye el amor entre Juli&aacute;n y Pen&eacute;lope me decepcion&oacute; y es predecible. Una novela con un poco de todo y mucho de nada, y donde algunos misterios son revelados por carta. Una mezcla de narrativa g&oacute;tica, tragedia griega y telenovela del mediod&iacute;a. Sin embargo, su final de telenovela deja cierta complacencia inevitable. Creo que fuera de algunos apuntes c&oacute;micos del personaje Ferm&iacute;n, lo olvidar&eacute; todo muy pronto, o se lo llevar&aacute; el viento.

B00915G6MG|5.0|I have every episode, so buying this was a no brainer.  Now that Ziva is gone it makes it better to own, I can watch all the episodes that have her.  She's not gone or forgotten like the beginning credits now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Enjoyed this very much.  Had to pay close attention to every clue.  Couldn't wait to uncover the next step.  Really had to think things through.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Definitely exists in a different genre than The Shining, but is somehow a seamless continuation.<br /><br />Loved the characters and vivid imagery of shining.<br /><br />Would recommend giving The Shining a reread before you tackle this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game not only does it make you remember where the clues are that are used, the graphics are in 3D
B001OBT3FC|5.0|Despite the fact that both the conductor and soloist are getting older this recording and performance is fresh and full of power. If you own the best audio equipment and have a room big enough this Bluray disk is a must as it will be an immersive experience!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This maddening and addictive game is super fast on the Kindle Fire. Game play is much smoother than on my other devices. Connecting to Facebook has yet to be an issue. Well worth the wait. Now if there were only limitless lives!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great character development, great ingenuity, great plot transformation, and a hope filled ending of a better future (not a George Orwell book at all) it accepts the bad things and rejoices the good and hopes for the future. A great book
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Minus the commercials, this is the best bubble game in my opinion.  Lots of fun and keeps you interested.  The music isn't bad either.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Not what it was supposed to be and did not give me the songs I wanted...  It took a long time just to find the song and then did not do as wanted.
B000JMKNV0|2.0|Not really my style - too much &#34;psycological thriller&#34;. I prefer somewhat more down-to earth stories - but no doubt a lot of readers would say I haven't understood a thing...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story was solid all the way through. No wonder it became a movie. Great story telling.  Great characters. Good ending.
B00E1LPTIC|5.0|I love this album, it is awesome, Justin Timberlake is awesome, he's an awesome singer and he makes awesome music, he really outdid himself on this album, forever a proud JT fan!
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book was for a teenager and she loved it.  There were a lot of life lessons and heart touching things in it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A beautiful book by a fearless young woman.  She is truly an inspiration to old and young.  A lesson in gratitude, fortitude and courage.
1476727651|3.0|Like many others have stated, The Shining was - and will remain - a classic of the horror/thriller genre.  But beside that, the deeply layered psychological textures of all the characters are what make this tale unforgettable - even 30 years after reading it!<br /><br />That said, DR SLEEP is actually quite appropriately titled in my opinion, as there were many sections of this tale that nearly put me to sleep.  Maybe it is just me, but the repetitive (over and over and over and .... you get the picture)  focus on the Alcoholics Anonymous bits were as tedious as sitting and listening to an alcoholic endlessly repeating him or herself.  Personally, after finishing the book, I don't honestly really feel all that personally or emotionally invested in any of the characters - none have been fully realized, except for Daniel, but whom we already feel close to, and have been waiting decades to hear more from - to feel that yearning we felt at the end of The Shining.  As for the bad guys - except for one scene where a life is taken - that is all we are 'told', that they are the bad guys, so that even Rose, who was given a bit more character color, come off as 2D stereotypes.  The only character who I feel I could see in my mind as completely fleshed out was Conchetta/Momo, the great-grandmother/matriarch of Abra's family.<br /><br />That said, the climax on the tower was brilliant - I was kind of expecting someone else, but not at all unsatisfied or feeling ripped off by who did show up, as was the scene a few pages earlier dealing with 'the steam' (No spoilers here!  If you read the book, you will know of what I speak).  These echoed the brilliance of The Shining.<br /><br />Sadly, however, this one felt phoned in, and that is a huge disappointment.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I love the original Alice in Chains material, and also the new material after Layne's departure.  I think Degredation Trip is BETTER than any of it.  I am so glad I bought this set.  I'm a little disappointed that it took me this long to find it.  On my first listen, it didn't really click with me, but after that, I was hooked.  Once it sinks its teeth into you, it will not let go.  I've had it for over six months now, and still listen every day.  As of right now, this is my favorite album of all time.  I would pick this over any other - just amazing stuff.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Ni disappointmentss here. Have enjyed every episode of rach season.<br />The quality of the discs were very good as well. Will definately order from Amazon again.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I don't fully appreciate sci-fi but this was ok. I won't be reading the rest of the series but am sure some would enjoy it.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Started out beautifully written, enthralling.  Found the middle section to be tasteless, vulgar and unnecessary.  Stopped reading.  Very disappointed that despite the richness of the written word and the extensive research undertaken, the book fell very flat and became disgusting to me.  I would definitely NOT recommend this book to anyone.  In fact, I'm sorry I read as much as I did.
006202406X|1.0|Minor spoilers, but who cares, this book sucked.<br /><br />I've read both Divergent and Insurgent and found them both to be engaging and well written books. I just finished Allegiant and found it to be one of the worst books I've read in years.<br /><br />First, the writing style is extremely immature. Where the first two focused on character development and interesting plot lines, this just had the characters spewing nonsense that didn't seem to fit. Splitting the story between Tris and Four was just a mistake. Both characters sound the same and you never get a sense that you are reading through that character. Seriously, try reading a Tris chapter and replace all the 'hers' with 'hims'. Can you tell the difference?<br /><br />The other characters were all so poorly developed and I didn't care for any of them. Don't even get me started with the plot. They really expect us to believe a society would deteriorate and devolve in that manner? And on top of that, why were they so opposed to them wiping out the memories of those in Chicago? The other option was the citizens killing each other. Was that really where they should have made their stand?<br /><br />And who cares that that one small city of Chicago is deciding to allow mutants (like that better) to live freely. Does that mean the rest of the world will? No. No conclusion. ooh and she killed Tris for no reason. Boooooooo this book
B004QBWU02|4.0|This movie is a classic and changed the way movies were edited.  However, it feels a little slow paced and meandering by today's standards.  Still enjoy watching it though.
1594202273|3.0|This review of safety problems in the United States (and Soviet) nuclear weapons programs, from the beginning to the present, is essential reading. If you think it's not a topic we have to think about after the end of the Cold War, think again.<br /><br />Though I highly recommend Command and Control, I am giving it three stars rather than five for three reasons: (1) Schlosser wastes too much time with excessive details about the lives of the players in his story. Sure, you need some of that (worked as an insurance salesman before becoming a weapons technician, wife had just given birth, that sort of thing) to humanize them, but at a certain point piling on the personal details just amounts to so much clutter. (2) The text is poorly organized, fitful, sometimes close to random. It doesn't say much for Penguin that they didn't impose more editorial discipline. (3) I never like it when an author deliberately leaves out quotation marks for setting off dialog--it seems posed, pretentious, and sometimes forces the reader to re-read in order to separate dialog from narrative. But Schlosser is the first writer I ever encountered who switches randomly between use of quotation marks and leaving them out--in some cases switching between the two modes in the same five or six lines of dialog. Schlosser's choice here is at best inexplicable, at worst bizarre.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book has remained on the best seller list for months and months and I cannot for the life of me figure out why.  I kept thinking it would get better so I continued to read but was VERY disappointed in the ending.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun and entertaining kept me wanting more. I would recommend this game to any mystery buff. Waiting for t h e next game.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about this story was that I disagreed with some of the ending! Delightful and entertaining. Worth reading through a few times.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The ending seemed rushed and even the characters didn't seem written true to what they were in the past books.The whole thing felt like the author had stopped caring about the series and a lazily written ending to just finish it up.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|it was good but you can only play like 5 worlds (which i finnished in like 4 hour) and buy more words which i finnished right away.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The slowest of the three Hunger games books, but it was still an ok read. The ending was not my favorite, but they never are.
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|Great book<br />Incredible story if you like a bit of smut as well as some laughs<br />I found it hard to stop reading
B00005TQKQ|4.0|I could not find this item at local stores, because the technology is so old. I'm trying to play back a bunch of HIgh 8 tapes into my computer, but the old tapes clogged the heads. I needed this head cleaner.  The product arrived very quickly.  I think the price is a bit high, but since it is &#34;obsolete&#34; technology I'm wiling to pay, because I needed this.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I have just completed reading the most wonderful book by a most wonderful author.  The Signature of All Things by Elizabeth Gilbert is truly an amazing story.<br /><br />It is evident on every page that the author painstakingly researched and toiled for many years to write this sweeping, historically sound, epic novel of desire, ambition, and utmost need for knowledge. This novel is definitely in the category of literary fiction that ranks high on the list with such works as  Bronte's Wuthering Heights and Austen's Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Who would have thought that the subject matter of mosses would be so delightfully interesting and spectacularly entertaining?  Apparently, quite a lot of readers (including me) do and are fully embracing this new novel from this amazing author.<br /><br />Gilbert successfully makes the lead character, Alma Whittaker, moss-loving woman of the 19th century into someone the reader cannot help but like - I would even go as far as to say \\"adore\\".<br /><br />From Alma's birth through the years right before her death, the author takes you on a world-wind tour of  the Whittaker estate (White Acre) in Philadelphia across the oceans to Tahiti and finally to Holland - all the while narrating the sights, sounds, smells of animals and people that Alma encounters along the way.<br /><br />Although the beginning of the book is very informative and provides much in regard to Alma's lineage and upbringing, the story becomes more interesting and fully unfolds at the midpoint of the book.  Up to this point, Alma has dedicated her life to moss study and scientific reasoning, but then she encounters Ambrose Pike.  Smitten with this new beau, one thing leads to another and the two wed shortly thereafter.<br /><br />The events that take place after their exchange of vows are at times (psychologically) hard to read, but these events lead the story into the next phases of Alma's life.  The first one being a phase of removing  familiar surroundingsone is accustomed to; then on to removing the \\"baggage\\" of  life and finally to the last phase - one of discovery.<br /><br />I whole-heartedly recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates literary, historical fiction. You will not be disappointed.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|Terrific Tic Tac Toe HD is a great addicting game.  The graphics are great.  This game is very fun to play but it can be addicting.  I would definitely recommend this game.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Love these headphones.  Sound quality is great and they are very light-weight.  Price is exceptional for this quality.  Very glad I listened to the other reviewers and bought these.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read<br />!!!!!  :)<br />It is a good action book!!!!  :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Having read this book years ago, I wanted to re-read it in anticipation of the movie coming out. I'm so glad I did...truly creative and exciting.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Very well written but so much torture and killing it was difficult to finish reading.  Evokes repulsion and questions of how real is this fiction in North Korea?
B005DF2QMC|4.0|Simple enough for a non-techie low budget project.  Had to download the Audacity program.  Must have misunderstood - I thought it was included on a disk, but it worked out ok.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Wow.  This family gets involved in a series of terrible decisions.  I find the pattern of behavior very disturbing.  Nonetheless, the acting, writing and directing make this an addictive series.  It is very satisfying to watch from a story-telling standpoint.  The plot draws me in.  My wife gives it 5 stars and I give it 4.  I really, really like the production of this show but, beating the dead horse, find the subject matter disturbing.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Very good conclusion to divergent trilogy. Although I liked it I was very disappointed to read many of my favourite characters such as tori,uriah,and even tris died I think you could have built more story to these characters. I also thought Evelyn was a character that had a lot of 'story' to her she was a very interesting person to read about. Great job veronica I hope to see you keep writing for young adults. I am very excited for  the release of the movie and the other short stories.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love John Gresham and he has written another fantastic book.His narrative of the way blacks were treated in that era just breaks your heart. To think that hangings were a common practice back then is so heartbreaking. Gresham is the condiment story teller. Loved the book and definitely would give it a five rating.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Just what the Dr ordered!!!  I've been looking for a good calculator for my kindle fire and this is the one!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The story is amazing I love the characters! The story has a lot going on with a lot of loose ends! I pray mr. Martin takes care to wrap them up proper and not just kill them all off to find them an end!!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This movie is like the book in only a few ways. If I hadn't have read the book I would have enjoyed this movie much more. The book was just so good and I realize the movie couldn't tell the same story. Standalone on it's own it's a good movie. Just change the damn title.
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|This is a fun movie!!  I purchased it for my father who has almost more movies than Blockbuster (truely, you have no idea)!!!  It came on time and in great condition.  It runs perfectly and my dad couldn't be happier.  Another movie added to his Movie Library.  The seller was wonderful to work with and I would be happy to do so again in the future.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great series! Never did understand why really good series get cancelled. Most likely has to do with greedy networks and creating the next shiny object. It was great while it lasted.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I read all the books and have just about all the movies in DVD format.  I just thought that this set would just add to the whole Harry Potter experience.  It didn't hurt that we have a Blu-ray player now.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This novel gripped my heart from the first page to the last. It was a beautiful and wonderful read, a story I will never forget. I cherish the characters like family members. Diffenbaugh's writing goes down like creamy soup and warmed my soul. I recommend this novel to every woman I know, and all of you out there looking for your next favorite book.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Best cary grant movie...little bit of comedy...little bit of drama!! No one (even now) can match his comedic timing and charm
006202406X|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book, I pre-ordered it all the way back in May, but it was really not on par with the other two.  Like other reviewers have said, the dual POV was poorly done.  I couldn't tell which character was speaking and about halfway through I decided I didn't care anymore.  The revelation about what the divergent actually are was kind of a let down.  The factions being a form of behavior modification was not explained well and didn't make sense to me.  It was a weak explanation of how the world of factions that existed in the first two books could come to be.  And most of all I don't think killing Tris was necessary or a good idea.  I think the situation in reverse would have been better.  The plan being for Tris to go in and set off the memory serum becuase she had a chance of survival and then at the last minute Caleb stepping in and sacrificing himself.  We already knew Tris would sacrifice herself for others, she did it several times in the previous books.  It also might have shown that the GDs weren't so damaged after all.<br /><br />The book was bad enough and the ending shocking enough that I actually wondered if the author did it on purpose.  A lot of people are saying that they won't go watch the movie now, and I'm wondering if that was the point.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very cool.  My son asked me to order this for him.  We liked all 3 movies, so since we didn't have any of them, this trilogy couldn't have come at a better time.
0679809015|5.0|This item is great, my daughter and I still use it and it is a good quality item. I will defitely buy items like this again.
0393338827|3.0|I enjoy reading Michael Lewis' essays and respect his insight and ability to explain arcane financial market workings. In this case the story should have remained an essay and not been blown up to a full sized book. Admitted, the investors who shorted the CDOs are interesting characters and one wonders with them why nobody understood the packaging of sub-prime mortgages and why the rating agencies considered them investment-grade, but it should not take 270 pages to tell the story in sufficient detail! I found long stretches slow if not boring reading. Look for another book if you want to get a good overview on the financial crisis and are not a banker to appreciate the technical detail that Michael Lewis abundantly provides!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Very entertaining!!  Love the twists and turns. Excellent attention to details in the location of choice. Will definitely read the sequels...
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love the Alien movies, especially the first two.  They are classics.  I really love the book format the discs came in and the viewers guide.
1594489505|4.0|Worth reading if you want to gain an appreciation for what it might have been like living in Afghanistan right before and after the Soviets left. Well developed and relatively easy to read once you get into it.
B0091REZMW|2.0|To play this game on a standard-sized kindle fire requires the best eyesight ever! The graphics and size of room are much too small to fully enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for kids. but also fun for adults.  being free is also great! keeps you on your toes. get it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love this app. Helpful when I'm grocery shopping and on the go. Would download other apps from developer as well.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Have you seen this movie! Super great. Though everyone seems so young now that I've seen Avengers & Thor 2 is coming out next month. Still, a great movie to sit back & watch
B0085FF55W|5.0|you got this range of sound melodic sounds. you miss home with Mom, and fall in love with Hero. they are a great companion
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|A well worth the rent or buy especially if you are an Iron Man Fan.  You get to see that there is a human after all behind the Iron.
B004B8DH98|4.0|This is a quiet, intense movie, with George Clooney in just about every scene.<br />It's a little odd... there's not a lot going on.<br />It reminds me of Syriana or Michael Clayton.<br />I've seen it before, and thought enough of it to watch it again.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This  game is the most addictive game I have ever played !  But it is an awesome game too ! My little cousins love it !  :-)

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I love the &#34;new&#34; Kirk, Bones, Scotty and all the rest. Spock is outstanding as a young Star Fleet officer. All the actors have qualities that match the &#34;old guys&#34;. This movie is fast paced and so much fun. We have watched this four times already.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|too many constant sales pitches to use the clock. annoying.If it is promoted as free then it should actually be free.
B00EL8I8IS|4.0|Brad Pitt likes off beat roles and excels in them.  This another great example.  I recommend it to all Pitt fans.<br />.
1781162646|5.0|I love most of Stephen King's books and this one was a nice, fairly short, easy read.  Not as intense as most of his books, it's still definitely one that grabs and keeps your attention all the way through.  A little bit different than what you normally expect/get from Mr. King but still very good!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone told me that this was adicting and I didn't believe them. I was wrong. But it sure is fun

B004FEFS5E|5.0|Great book with valuable information for photographers of all ages, it's sure to improve and open your mind! Great read!
1451666179|5.0|Played hookey today to read this masterpiece of humor and honesty. If you aren't familiar with the Hyperbole and a Half blog by Allie Brosh, run, do not walk, and start reading it. A creative combination of primitive yet wildly clever cartoon panels and expository text, Hyperbole is one of the best things on the internet. The book, I think, creates a more intense experience visiting with the artist as she moves from one story to the next, each one color coded with different paper. Many of the stories made me laugh out loud. REALLY loud. Especially when she's talking about her pets, simple dog and helper dog. But she also devotes a couple of chapters to her bout with depression as well as her own voyages of self-discovery trying to figure out why her motives for \\"doing the right thing\\" are so selfish. These sections are quite powerful because she is so honest about her experiences and her self analysis. There is a lot of truth in this book, but it is delivered in a self-deprecating voice that is always appealing. I loved this book and hope she puts another one out soon.
B00ECR7L0Y|4.0|Provided you can understand old English, you will enjoy this adaptation of the Shakespeare play. At first, I found the all black-and-white format strange. I thought my disc was defective. But it wasn't, and the black-and-white format adds a special character to the film. The movie was enjoyable and, at times, funny. I found the dialogue much easy to follow than the 1993 version of this movie, even though both versions used American actors. By my troth it is true, my lord! Maybe it was the modern setting that made the old English easier to follow.<br /><br />Some characters were changed from the original play. But these were minor roles. There were some parts left out. But for the most part, the movie is true to the original.<br /><br />However, two roles were miscast. Joss Whedon used far too many actors from his past endeavors -- Firefly, Dollhouse, the Avengers. All the actors did an excellent job, but two should not have been used in the roles they were. Fran Kranz (Topher Brink in Dollhouse) was not a good Claudio. That is not say he did a bad job, but his acting style is more suited to someone who is mischievous. Sean Maher (Simon Tan in Firefly) was a terrible Don John. Again, not because he did a bad job, but because Sean Maher is terrible as a villain. In Firefly and Serenity, he was excellent as someone who cares deeply about people to the point that he neglects himself. That is he style; a villain's style is the exact opposite. I think Joss Whedon desired to use actors he was familiar with too much.<br /><br />Even so, the directing was excellent. Joss Whedon has a way of bringing out nuances that enrich the characters and the story. Unspoken actions, camera placements to enhance a person's emotions, and knowing when to use steady-cams and hand cameras are just such things Joss Whedon knows how to use well. Little things like that really enhanced this movie.<br /><br />For anyone who likes a story with a plot, in fact for anyone who values a plot in a movie over all else, I highly recommend this movie. There are far too few movies today that replace a good plot with a big budget, lots of cursing, sex, and violence. I want a good story, this movie delivered.
B00EM6LRCS|2.0|This one was so slow and dragged and dragged. I even fell asleep at one point.  And that is ridiculous of a thought to anyone who knows how much I love vampire movies.  I don't know what happened with this movie, but it wasn't even close to par with other vampire movies like Interview with a Vampire, Underworld, or even Twilight for a softer style vampire movie.  The only reason I didn't give it one star it because there was some confusion on my end of the storyline. Maybe this was due to the few minutes I feel asleep, but it doesn't matter. It sucked anyway!
B0035JRVR8|5.0|A newsman with typical go-get-em, no-holds-barred style of getting the revealing facts and details meets the object his storyline, an innocent, quite-unworldly princess.  Circumstance puts them together for a whirlwind of discovery for the princess while the newsman becomes enamored with her antics, willpower, and eagerness to have fun in the face of returning to a position of expected decorum.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I can compare this novel to my own attempt....when I was in middle school. Logic is horrible, no research on anything was done(ex. When you hunt you don't aim for the neck) the list goes on.<br /><br />After the first three chapters I began to strongly dislike the main character.<br /><br />Half way through the novel I began to believe this must be one of those books created from a blog or posting site comprised of 100s of authors that write a paragraph each.<br /><br />It was free and I regret wasting time and space on my tablet.<br /><br />The one star is due to after reading this you will have the determination to write your own book that is far better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Despite others negative reviews...I really enjoyed the trilogy. I couldn't put it down!  There is a lot of sex in the books but not at all what I expected. It's more of a love story than anything. People that call it porn have never read it.
0307279189|4.0|An interesting book that is mostly well written.  I enjoyed reading it and the insight into the &#34;hidden tribe&#34;.  Enjoy those chia seeds...
B007A2O3FO|4.0|It was an interesting story with a bit of mystery.  Knowing war time was gloomy, I guess that was a big part of<br />the plot.
B006RA0E5I|5.0|I have to say this is the best mouse I have had so far.  Very responsive and easy to use!  I highly recommend it!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Excellent purchase. I am enjoying all of the classic Fleetwood Mac hits. Just listening to Stevie Nicks is a nostalgic blast from the past.
B00BRH2MN8|3.0|Surprisingly insightful lyrics in some tracks about the circumstances of being a teen. She is strongly aware of her stands in the world, her age, her crowd, her finances. Highlights: Royals, Million Dollar Bills, The Love Club. Others songs can be a little daunting at times, reminds me of a drug haze.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The pacing of the novel is really weird. Sometimes it seems like its going really slow, and that you’re learning a lot about what is going on, but nothing is really happening. Then all of a sudden, things seriously sped up and ended. So the pacing of the novel was incredibly awkward. I thought maybe the book could have been longer, or that the slower parts could be shorter and the action part longer. It seemed sort of weirdly balanced. Once the action started, it was so easy to finish the book, but the build up took a very long time.<br /><br />The Good:<br />That all being said though, I really loved this book. I don’t want to spoil anything because the book just came out a few days ago, and I don’t want to ruin it for anyone. I want to tell everyone what I think without ruining it for those who have not been able to read it yet, or who are catching up on the other books.<br /><br />I loved the direction that Veronica Roth took it in. The end of Insurgent leaves hanging with the idea of an outside world, that needs the Divergent. Which is so different than the city that Tris lives in, where the Divergent are hunted down. But when we finally see the outside world, its so different than what I had ever expected. What we learn and find out is incredible. Confusing, but incredible and it really explains so many plot holes that exist in the previous two books.<br /><br />I really liked the back and forth between Tris and Four. I feel like, its kind of become a habit for authors to do this dual point of view thing, especially for final books. It would normally kind of make me mad because of the repetitiveness but I really liked it. The only thing we’ve gotten of Four in the previous books is Tris’s own vision of him. Getting into his head, seeing his motives, his love for Tris, his fears, his hopes, all of that, really helps to carry the story. They clash all the time, and they both have such different fears and different backgrounds and it motivates their actions in different ways, and its also the way they come together.<br /><br />Some people had an issue with the end, and what happens there, and I’m going to try and say my thing without spoiling anything. I was immensely heartbroken by what happened at the end. It was incredibly unexpected and it ripped me to pieces. I spent a lot of time crying, which clouded up my glasses quite nicely. I think it makes the most sense, and that the way in which the events unfold seem so likely to me. In fact, before they unfolded, I was surprised at the direction that Veronica was taking the characters in. When things changed, and ended the way they did, it just made sense to me. The decisions that were made by the different characters just seemed to fit for each of them, and the ending was a full circle for the story. I think that Veronica took leaps and risks that some authors don’t do but I think it played out nicely for her.<br /><br />I’ve also not cried this hard with a book since I read the epilogue of Clockwork Princess.<br /><br />I don’t want to spoil much, because there is too much in this book to spoil for anyone but I loved it. I didn’t think it was perfect, because the pacing is just so weird, but I thought it was a beautiful, unexpected ending. People die, lives change, and I cried like crazy. Somehow my favorite character (I hope I never told you who that is…) survives but other characters that I love die. I think that there’s so much to learn and to still contemplate about their world and what could and will happen to everything and everyone. Its a beautiful book and I think Veronica leaves us with the same sort of bittersweet ending that JK Rowling leaves us with in Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />If you want a spoiler discussion, you can read it on my blog whatanerdgirlsays.comons in different ways, and its also the way they come together.<br /><br />Some people had an issue with the end, and what happens there, and I’m going to try and say my thing without spoiling anything.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|Not up to the standard of his previous books. No coherent plot, random characters, not sure what he was trying to say. Just a disappointment.
B005HSL626|3.0|didn't like the app, wasn't what I was looking for and deleted it off my phone. Others  may like it, it's just that I didn't
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|The album has tons of energy and life. I like that its mainly uptempo. The slower tracks are reminiscent of Micheal during his early years and there is even I Prince style song. Two artist I truly love. It is a step through time to the future of Monae.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Bought this so the lady in my life could have a &#34;chick flick&#34;. I watched it with her, and enjoyed it very much. I also have the book, so I am hoping this is the movie I am reviewing. Either way great story!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you like Steven King you will love  Dr Sleep! Good pace, well developed characters and a great story. What more could you ask for.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter was a conservationist , her own person, and a wonderful story teller and artist.  I wore  out all of her books when I was a child.  The movie brought back fond memories.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I remember saying &#34;Well, there goes the show&#34;, when they started adding girlfriends. But, happily I was wrong. It's still as smart and funny as it ever was. I will watch the 6th season repeatedly. It's hilarious.
B00669MFA2|5.0|If you're a fan of the books, the conclusion to the Harry Potter series is no surprise.  However, to see it acted and costumed and draped with with beautiful tapestry of special effects, final film in the franchise can only exceed the expectations of the most die-hard fan.  It succeeds not because of the effect work, mind you, but because of the characters, the emotions they portray, and the stories they tell.  Unlike many films today, the Harry Potter series is character driven, a trait it shares in common with the books and thankfully was not sacrificed moving across the media types. I highly recommend the entire series, film and print.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is awesome. I love it and play it all the time. It's so addicting. Would definitely recommend downloading it!
1451666179|5.0|Just got this yesterday and read it all.  Hilarious! Love the blog, love the book! Must read ALL THE THINGS!

B007ZKY7XO|5.0|This album is right up there with their other albums!! The whole CD flows and every track is great!! Very well produced and written!! Jake Shears and gang have done it again! Amazing album!!!
0743270754|5.0|A lot of historical knowledge I was never taught in school.  Will take a while to finish, but worth it!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have just had my alarm clock. Just a couple of days and found it very user  friendly. I would recommend this even if you are new to Kindle fire.
B005XLN97M|5.0|very good product, I really highly recommend it! excellent and quality first! of truth that you can buy with confidence that the quality is guaranteed!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I really enjoyed the music from this album. Through word of mouth, I purchased the CD and, lucky for me, I enjoyed it very much much. I'm going on a trip this weekend and I'll be playing this CD during my drive.
B00BT1XCOU|4.0|ive been a fan of this show since the beginning.  its a show i can watch over and over, will probably miss it more after the final season is thru.  though i really like the earlier seasons more, i still do enjoy watching the latest season and this season was very good with some good stories as well as finally seeing teds future wife.  i hope they would have more &#34;wow&#34; moments like the first robin sparkles, price as right episode, or barney working at the coffee shop, but the story is still solid and cant wait for the final season to be out
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thus far it is so addicting! I love it andbm ready to get backnto it already. I really enjoy the challenge.
B002KJX4IE|3.0|Good acting and a fun cast. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Jeffery Jones.......just a wacky romp for fun. Catherine O'Hara is always hilarious and this film is no exception.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun film, this is it.
B00BWWS81S|4.0|I took a chance on this CD and I liked what I heard. I missed out on her previous release. This one had enough enticing tracks to get me to purchase the album and I'm glad I did.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|alot of people didnt see bronson when it came out, and are only in the past couple years getting to see tom hardy in films, but this movie really shows just how good of an actor he is.  you will only be seeing more of tom hardy ion upcoming movies, but this was one of his real breakthough performances for himself alone.  definitely recommend this film to all of my friends, guys will like it more than girls for the action and violence, but as a whole, the movie is very good and takes a glimpse into the pschy of this character and is very well done by tom hardy
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This was non-stop drama from start to finish.  I couldn't leave the room when the show was on.  Excellent story!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Captain Jack and the whole cast make this thoroughly enjoyable. I was big fan prior to watching any Dr Who episodes.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Another classic Korn album. Several years later and they're still putting out banging music that freakin' rocks! Any Korn fan should have this.
0316228583|5.0|I found The Casual Vacancy extraordinary. It's sort of like a modern day Dickens, in a way, in the sense that it's that good, in its own new modern way. I kept reading it, then glanced at the number of pages I'd read vs. the entire novel, and keep being amazed: \\"I'm only about a fifth the way through??\\" That was because it was so entrancing, and rich and full. Not to sound pedestrian but it's full of truth: about adults, teens, people posh and not, heroin addicts, families above all; about good people and bad people and all the so-human shades of grey in-between.<br /><br />People seem to like using the word \\"genius\\" to desribe any for-the-moment celebrity/whoever. For me, that word = Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc.; Shakespeare, Dickens, etc.; Rembrandt, Siskind, etc. This book, that is so incredibly good, I-can't-put-it-down good; better-than-any-BS/boring-Contemporary-Literary-Fiction -- and written by she who wrote the Harry Potter books who now writes this book, so truly real, and true Literature, innit? I can think of only one word to describe her: genius.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Comcast DTA wasn't cutting it, and after 2 units and multiple reloads.....it wasn't getting any better. The CC dongle set up took about 3-4 tries, but finally found my network and away I went. I can use my Droid to pick Netflix programs, but have a Kindle Fire on the way for a bigger screen to work with........Netflix TV series run episodes automatically, and I can always go back if I drift off.....:)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Sad ending and sad series is over! Time for the movies!!  Amazing trilogy I loved it I wish it didn't end and end the way it did other then that phenomenal trilogy!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Ariana Grande is hot and her music is great to listen to. I really love looking at her and listening to her sing is an added bonus.
B000244FDW|5.0|This original BBC production is slower moving than  the A&E version but more in keeping with Miss Austen's book.  Elizabeth Garvey is more like the Elizabeth Bennet I imagined than Jennifer Ehle.  She had a vulnerability about her instead of the sneer Ehle portrayed.  While it was David Rintoul as Darcy that first captured my heart with his handsome looks, Colin Firth eventually won me over with his warmer interpretation.  Sorry, the dive into the lake was not the highlight for me.  BBC Jane was much prettier and conveyed more attachment to her sister. Casting of the other character was equally better than in the A&E version. I loved the extended conversation between Elizabeth & Aunt Gardiner and Elizabeth's concluding conversation with her father when he questioned her accepting Darcy's proposal. The best telling of the story can still be found in the book.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|The stop working within 5 minutes. I could not get it work again so I uninstall it. I feel they should give better directions and more details on what not to do. I don't think it was clear enough on how to get the camera to work again I tried the directions several times and even tried reinstalling it but to avail it would not work.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|In 2009, original Guns `N' Roses and ex-Velvet Revolver guitar virtuoso Slash (a.k.a. Saul Hudson) pulled a Dave Grohl. See, in a move seemingly inspired by that creator of the band Probot, the stunning six-stringsman branched off to pursue and record with a solo project, this one an eponymous group that would release a debut the following year, in March of 2010. See, \\"Slash\\" (the album) finds Slash playing multiple instruments (including lead and rhythm guitars, acoustic guitars, backing vocals, and bass). And what's more, the guy enlisted an extremely impressive group of guest musicians and vocalists. In fact, every single one of these fourteen songs features a cameo by a pretty big-name. Hence, it is only a rare occasion for Slash to sing lead vocals.<br /><br />The set kicks off with \\"Ghost,\\" a catchy punk-rocker that is laced with a fiery guitar solo and guest vocal wailing from The Cult frontman (Ian Astbury). But this opener, while decent through and through, is immediately overshadowed by \\"Crucify The Dead,\\" a crunchy chugger of a song that finds Ozzy Osbourne taking care of the vocals (and doing an amazing job at it, by the way), and is peppered with more pyrotechnic Slash soloing. And \\"Beautiful Danger\\" is another standout, as it finds an almost Nine Inch Nails-like electronic, pulsing guitar/bass riff throbbing away behind female vocals supplied by the Black Eyed Peas' frontwoman, Fergie. Then, following the hit-single \\"Back From Cali\\" (which finds Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy stepping in behind the mic), the listener is treated to one of the record's most memorable vocal performances in \\"Promise.\\" It is a power ballad that, despite featuring a cameo from Chris Cornell (the dude is heard wailing away throughout the song), ultimately comes across actually sounding more like a Red Hot Chili Peppers b-side rather.<br /><br />But the set's second half is every bit as memorable as its first half. Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale supplies the vocals for the album's insanely catchy lead single, \\"By The Sword\\"; and \\"Gotten\\" is a lovely blues-rock ballad with emphatic singing from Adam Levine (of Maroon 5 fame), of all people. And the next song, \\"Doctor Alibi,\\" is a big-riff rocker that is, thankfully, heavier than most of its surroundings. And I might point out that the tune is catchy as heck, too, but with Lemmy Kilmeister doing a classic Motorhead-sounding vocal impression, that fact should almost be a given. Next up, \\"Watch This\\" is an entirely instrumental cut, thus making it the possible (probable, even) highpoint of the record. But the fact that it boasts hefty, chugging guitar hooks, memorable, air-guitar-able leads, and excellent, epic soloing does not hurt matters, either. And the bass work is also noteworthy, here, as it is played by original Guns `N' Roses four-stringer Duff McKagen. But it is actually the vocals, which come courtesy of Kid Rock, that are actually the most memorable attribute in the next track after that, \\"I Hold On.\\"<br /><br />Moving along, \\"Nothing To Say\\" is another sizeable highlight because it is a surprisingly fiery, heavy, aggressive, and up-tempo metal song featuring Avenged Sevenfold mouthpiece M. Shadows, who croons away in a very catchy manner to a soundtrack of crunching guitar licks and sizzling solos. But so is \\"Starlight,\\" because it takes a page out of the Led Zeppelin playbook in that it plays like an epic duel between the vocalist (who, in this case, is Myles Kennedy -- again) and the guitarist (Slash) to see who can wail more mightily. And then, following \\"Saint Is A Sinner, Too,\\" a gentle, acoustic-plucked ballad with warm and tender clean singing, comes the effort's strong closer, \\"We're All Gonna Die,\\" which features guest vocals that come courtesy of Iggy Pop. Hence, the song is, naturally, an insanely catchy one, and one that is littered with infectious vocal hooks. But the surprising aspect, here, is that the tune is also notable from a musical standpoint, as it is far heavier and more hard-rocking than most.<br /><br />Superiorly-played, unpredictable, and certainly very rewarding, \\"Slash\\" is a raucously hard-rockin' affair that possesses a truckload of standout/recommended tracks, and an even greater number of great riffs and addicting hooks. As such, this reviewer might not go so far as to call it a hard rock fan's dream come true, but it certainly comes very, very close to attaining such a prestigiously high status.ar heavier and more hard-rocking than most.<br /><br />Superiorly-played, unpredictable, and certainly very rewarding, \\"Slash\\" is a raucously hard-rockin' affair that possesses a truckload of standout/recommended tracks, and an even greater number of great riffs and addicting hooks.

B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Directed by James Wan (“Saw” “Insidious”), “The Conjuring” follows the story of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). Some people may remember their names for their involvement with “the Amityville haunting” in Long Island, which became the basis of a 1979 film “The Amityville Horror.”<br /><br />James Wan’s latest film is a clever re-working of the 1970s-style old-fashioned horror genre. “The Conjuring” is about an actual case of the Perron family – husband and wife Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor), who moved into a dilapidated farmhouse in Rhode Island with their five daughters. Believing their house is haunted, they ask the Warrens to investigate.<br /><br />The storyline itself is simple, even familiar. With the atmospheric photography and production design, however, the film manages to be very creepy. What makes the film really work is that scares are delivered in a subtle way, especially in the first half of the film. I never thought handclapping could be this scary.<br /><br />And perhaps most importantly, thanks to the strong acting from the cast we really care about the characters, even when the skeptics in us refuse to believe their story. But what matters here is the story, and that is very scary.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I bought this on a whim, not really expecting much. I was very impressed, the tips are soft and the ring that holds the rubber tip are smooth so there no chance of accidentally scratching the screen. I bought a pack of the cheap ones before and they had rough rings. Overall I would highly recommend this.
B004S5C43E|5.0|Its a real page turner.  It seems well researched and told in masterly detail by a great story teller.....definitely one of his really good books.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|The disc came in great condition, and the sound quality was wonderful. Not a single scratch on it! It runs wonderfully in my car's CD player.

B0000026WD|5.0|For the first time I got thumbs up from my nine year old. He said mom finally you got some sensible music (meaning he likes it as well). For a boy who likes the likes of Justin Bieber music I was proud of myself that he gets to enjoy Michael Jackson finally.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved that the setting was very familiar to me, I could see all the places they went to in the city. The idea of the factions and the the genetically pure people wanting to &#34;fix&#34; the damaged people brought memories of Hitler's hate red of the Jews to mind. In this last book of the series.  I would highly recommend this series to everyone!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wasn't sure I would enjoy the book considering I had already seen the movie but I really liked the book and it answered all my questions about the movie. Can't wait to start the next book.

147676459X|5.0|I have been reading Allie Brosh's blog for sometime, and when I head she had a book coming out, I was excited. And I waited. Quite some time actually. Now I have the book. Hardcover even! Fancy!<br /><br />I read it the first night from cover to cover and it was great. She really tied the blog posts together, and not many books can make me laugh one moment and tear up a few minutes later. It really helps to explain what someone with depression, and their friends and family goes through in a very person way, while still bringing the funny.<br /><br />I enjoyed it very much.
B0089LOG02|5.0|this was a great book.  Very interesting story line and fact be it that there actually was a train in the late 1800 through the early 1900 that did take orphans to the midwest.  The story somehow reminded me of Germany during WW!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My favorite is using the app on my Kindle...the buttons are big.  Its an easy to use app. My kids like it too!
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|its enjoyable I really like it. The stars are very good at portraying characters in a sci fi. Without the excellent acting these type of shows would not be soentertaining. Also excellent writing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I liked how the author intertwined the stories of the young girl who was in the foster system and the older woman who had been on one of the Orphan Trains.  It was hard to put down!

B0097EWK3A|2.0|I had a problem with one thing on the trailer I spy getting stuck on one item. The game would not let me select it. Boo! I had to shut down my device multiple times. Otherwise, loved it.

B00ELOOYZI|4.0|I love this app! Not only have I had a white knuckle good time but I have learned a lot about space flight. Give me my own ship and send me out! The difficulty of this and the reminder that we got to the moon with about the same processing power as my phone makes it a welcome challenge.<br /><br />My one complaint is the awkward menu to switch from ship view to map view. I wish it was a swipe gesture or something simpler since it needs to be done quickly sometimes. It still isn't as bad as steering through a window that is less than a foot wide, so I should be quiet and man up. Like an astronaut!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Love this game but its all about money!  You cant enjoy the game because you run out of lives too often.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is such a beautiful story and the music is wonderful.  I bought this as a replacement for my childrens VCR version for my Grandson.  You will never tire of the story because it is purely instrumental.. no annoying high pitched voices LOL!

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Graphics are pretty but looks like they are geared toward little kids. Music is annoying. Typical match 3 game. Have no idea what all the excitement is. The worse part it to get past certain levels it wants you to keep spending money.If you run out of lives you have to wait a half hour to give you more.Want more moves pay more money.Definately not free.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and challenging......:)  I love how you can go back and 're play the levels YOU didn't do so good on...

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun for kids and adults. Dont like that you cant save where you are if you have to stop playing before making to end of a level.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I really couldn't tell a different with or without. I have nice over ear headphones and perhaps would make a difference in a lower end pair. It did increase volume which I didn't need.<br />I'm no audiophile so perhaps a more trained ear would appreciate this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game for me . I'm always bored after school and I play this . This game is so addicted to me and friends . Very mind blowing also
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Excellent,Excellent,Excellent.  Has to be one of the best novels I have had the pleasure and enjoyment to read.  I look forward to other books by Mr. Baldacci.  I love the technique of short chapters.  Each clearly and succinctly providing further insight to the plot and characters.<br /><br />Thank You Mr. Baldacci,<br />John H. Kuhl
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such a fun game - even my boss is hooked - I don't think I have ever been hooked on a game like this  I am 60 years old and have played it for the first time a month ago
0316174483|5.0|My 8 yr old daughter loved this for her birthday! It is very creative. She was able to write thank you  notes with the cute little thumbprints in this book. Love it!
B00881VLCE|1.0|love the app but it keeps crashing seconds after opening it. it worked great at first. then I bought the paid version. now it crashes. please fix
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun and creative. Silly consept but entertaining. We like the graphics and humor. The vampire is crazy. Thats all for now.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|When I connected it to my ps3 it would say charge complete but when I unplugged it would not turn on also the r1 button was broken
0307719774|5.0|I bought this for a close friend and she uses it everyday.  She absolutely loves it and it's small and is very cleverly designed.  I highly recommend this!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I love allow and her blog. Her description of depression resonates so well and I love her dog stories. The new material was excellent, especially about the goose.
B00ERP55NQ|4.0|This program seems to look like Google Maps, but it is from another company. It defaults to India as its main map every time you turn it on, so you need to always type in your desired location. I have not found a way to make it come up with my own default location when I power down and reboot the Kindle. If you are willing to put up with this inconvenience, it works as well as Google Maps.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I gave this show 5 stars because it keeps you on the edge of your set just wondering what will happen next to the point you cant stop watching it.I finished the entire series in two days it is that good.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Love this movie! I know it didn't do very well in theaters but it's a fun action flick also the soundtrack is excellent
B0031P4FFM|5.0|A terrific series for kids and adults alike. Always great to find a new series to dig into and the Maze Runner series is a book that even kids who don't like to read will enjoy.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|This is probably closer to a 4.5 star flick, but I was a HUGE fan of the original.  Given that logic, Monsters Inc was a 5 for me and I felt like this was not quite on that same level.  It's got the classic Pixar formula (some action, humor, the heartwarming lesson) with the same characters (as well as a nice spattering of new ones) from the original movie set in their college years.  Overall, it works.  It's entertaining from an adult perspective as well as for the kids (mine go from early teen to two).  Fans of Monsters Inc. as well as new fans will appreciate this movie.<br /><br />With respect to the package itself, I like to opt for the Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy option as we generally watch Blu-ray at the house, I can use the DVD in the car system, and then the digital copy on the laptop or tablet.  I went with the iTunes variant, but it was also available through a few other options (amazon, google play, and one more).
B003UYUP58|5.0|this very interesting and well-written book presents the history and biology of cancer in a manner suitable for non-specialists (even though written by a specialist).
B0063M22QO|5.0|The tiles respond to the slightest touch-- you don't have to keep pressing them. I enjoyed the game, I had never played before now.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think that this game has good graphics and some of the best guns I ever had. This is a great game<br />I
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loved the instructions at the beginning!!  Really helped learn how to play it.  I am hoping at some point I can go back and see instructions again, to pick up more pointers.  WARNING--It can become addictive!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Not so easy to set up, but after that works great.<br />No more cables to conect to TV very good interface for netflix via cel phone<br />I miss a support for the PLex Media Server
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love this game its like shooting people. I think lots of people should play. and that's what I think about this game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So many unfinished story lines. I don't like being left hanging. Another exciting read. I read all the available books one right after the other. The best books i have read in a long time. I am already itching for the next book. Much better than the show.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is one of the best written and most moving novels I have read to date. It has caused me to be introspective and commit to being more appreciative of the life I have and to strive to make a difference beyond myself.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was a pulling tale and well crafted characters that stayed in my mind for days (enjoyable, yet annoying as I was finished with reading for the day and forced to pretend to love my job while wondering about the fate of Will Traynor.). Solid story.  Beautifully written.  My first Moyes book, so thank you very much Jojo.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This thing works great and you can stream anything that you can play in the Chrome web browser. For local content, just drag and drop into Chrome, and it will play on your TV! Would be nice if it would store multiple SSIDs for portability though!
B0055S348W|5.0|I have not had any problems printing to my Brother printer.  Prints pics and text quickly though I have not tested in on more than 8 pages at once.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|This movie is really, really good! The direction is the greatest aspect of it, but the acting and the script were also superb.  This and Hot Fuzz are some of favorite comedy films.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a good movie whether you read the book or not.  I liked that they didn't glorify the violence.  Obviously, the book provides more background and character depth but the movie stands on its own and provides enough story to understand what's going on.  I look forward to reading and watching the second in the series.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|I always like Motorhead, there one of the bands that I really like and enjoy listen too. if you like hard rock, with blues sound and fast past notes, you`ll like this one.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|No spoilers here.  Thus is a fun, captivating movie.  The  twists and turns keep you paying attention, the &#34;tricks&#34; are interesting, and the overall story is good enough that you may hope for a sequel.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|This documentary was watched for a theatre class and was very eye-opening about how food is handled before reaching the consumer.  Not for the faint of heart.
B00FJ30OD6|4.0|Update: After the initial squabbling between the new firms calmed down, the show started to get real good again.  Now the last episode on March 23rd. This was a shocking episode losing one the the main characters in this show.  My gosh what a shock.  I read that Mr. Charles(will)actually requested being written out of the show for whatever reasons he has.  So this is how they did it.  The show will greatly miss him, but it might keep the show going with so many more story lines.<br />VERY INTERESTING!!!!<br />The break up episode when Alicia splits with her law firm was very exciting and promised a lot in intrigue in the future.  So why the three stars? The first thing that ruined it for me is when a 30 million dollar account swithced back and forth between the the present law firm and the new one headed up by Cary and Alicia, by slinging mud at each other.  Whoever visited last won the account.  The truth is,the firm wouldn't have dealt with either one with both looking like idiots.<br /><br />The second issue for me is Alicia's character.  She is shown to be an extremely intelligent, mature woman with a real head on her shoulders.  It already appeared that her reconcilliation with her husband was forced and acted out for her benefit.<br />Twice at differently times in the series, the now Governor elect(her husband) came into her house, this time with a party going on at the time, and she willingly had sex with him highlighted by her turning back after they were finished to fetch her panties and pull them up.  Alluring?  Not in this case.  It just wasn't her character.  In another episode in season 3 or 4, Alicia was late for a very important meeting.  In comes the husband who she is separated from, puts her up against the wall, pulls down the underwear and they go to it standing up.  All the while she is moaning and acting like she was enjoying it.<br />I certainly have nothing against sex, but under the circumstances, it was really ridiculous.I'm  not sure whether I'm done with this otherwise well written, well acted show because the story line and characters are getting \\"out there\\".<br /><br />Season 5 started out just great like the others, but what's missing in this big change episode is the believability of what's going on.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book literally changed my view of life. It made me so emotional and I connected so well with the characters. The words in this book are absolutely gorgeous and I highly recommend it to everyone looking for a great novel.
B00BGI076M|3.0|When you take a step back and look at the premise of this series, it's more than a bit insane. Given that, once you drink that Kool-Aid it works. They play it pretty well.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon), ex-FBI, is asked by the bureau to help in murder investigations that seem to be related to Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) a serial killer that Hardy collared years earlier. The investigation points to a large group of acolytes under Carroll's spell. Can Hardy round these people up.<br /><br />On the bad side is the premise. It's difficult to maintain a cult if the chief dude is in prison, even with the tight network these folks have in place. It simply isn't believable. Also, Carroll's plan is so far reaching, and so detailed, it has to fail because you're dealing with human beings, and even the slightest miscalculation can throw things off. I also had a problem with this many people being so bloodthirsty. The body count is way too high.<br /><br />On the good side you have some good characters and some good actors playing them. And the paranoia machine is cranked up because you don't know who is and who isn't in the cult. This leads to some nifty plot turns.<br /><br />It's written well enough and directed well enough. But, when you put it next to series such as \\"The Killing\\" and \\"The Bridge\\" it looks a little silly. Due to a minor injury, I watched all 15 episodes over a three day period. Had I watched it in weekly installments the goofiness might not have been quite so apparent, but as it stands, this shouldn't go to the top of anyone's 'to watch' list.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|this game is fun and easy to figure out. can connect to facebook.  can add friends and get codes. really User friendly.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|This is doing it right!!  release the film of a show , with loads of bonus content so that your blu ray is jammed with goodies to entertain for hours!!<br /><br />I was at first upset to see the list of 14 songs until I opened the bonus features of the Ded Flatbird shows and acoustic set....<br /><br />I think the group sounds great, looks great , and everything from the stage set to the camera work is completely first class. To elaborate, the venue and the staging is terrific to look at, the backgrounds for each song and lighting were obviously planned and well executed. The filming and even more importantly the editing isn't that hyper every beat switch so common on Iron Maiden and other DVDs but actually allows the viewers eyes to focus before switching camera angles and goodness when Viv or Phil are playing a solo they are usually shown!<br /><br /> I know this group prides themselves on their legacy and giving their fans value for money (something I admire Metallica for as well) and I do believe they've done themselves and their fans proud.<br />With the economy tanking and our consumer dollar worth less every day I can recommend this to any Def Leppard fan and I dare say if you aren't but love good hard rock I think you'd be hard pressed to not be after viewing this.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|So far, with my Kindle Fire HD, it only works when the tablet is open and awake.  When I go back and look at the alarm, it says it is set to the time tomorrow.  The repeat is set off.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|THIS was a GREAT read! The author's experiences seemed to be right on the mark. So glad he kept it real and didn't try to &#34;fancy it up&#34; or downplay the significance of the event in his and his familys life. Thanks a bunch for sharing your experience.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a big SK fan, so I always look forward to new books.  This was another good one.  It may not scare you as much as the shining did, but it still deserves a place on the bookshelf!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|one of the best movie of the year, if you are a trek fan, this is a must buy, excellent film.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very fun for all ages especially the younger ones but even older kids will enjoy it so try your very best to create your town
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game, The colors, the music, and the animation. I also really like the different challenges that each level brings. Thank you.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|very interesting, got boring in the middle, just not what it thought it would be like from the previews,  but i did enjoy it.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|This book was so adorable! I am a huge fan of Pusheen and Stormy so I just had to get this book! I was so excited to read it! Not only was the book cute, it was very funny too! I enjoyed reading this book! I hope the author can make another Pusheen book!  (=
0062080237|5.0|friends of mine have been trying to get me to read neil gaimen for years.  i finally decided to give it a go after hearing a story about this on npr and later hearing that hbo was rumored to be transforming this into a series.  this book wont let you down if you like fantasy. but even if you arent a huge fantasy fan, you will probably like it.  the writing is really great and makes for a fast read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! it is a lot of fun and very hard to put down. It is not simple by any means, but it is fun! I start playing and I have to force myself to stop. It works real well on my Kindle Fire first generation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive and finally can play on the kindle fire. Enjoying the bigger screen finding it easier to see my next move.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|The title of the review says it all.  We didn't even flinch at any of the jump scenes. . .
B001KZG99A|5.0|Good Flic, adds to my series.  I hope to see another one come out. I would recommend it to all that like SciFi
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|this game is simple to play and at first it is way to easy, but it gets harder as you go and more challenging.  I enjoy playing it and it is a good way to pass time and not feel to frustrated. The graphics are cute and it plays real well on my Kindle Fire first generation.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I havnt watched the DVD yet . NO time to sit that long right now<br /><br />Bocelli is  a great tenor but I wish he would not sing pop songs in English<br />He sounds much better in Italian when he sings<br />He needs a better person to represent him maybe?  And do his arragememts for him<br />in Italian
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is the funnest. I love searching for all of the clues.<br />It's like going on a scavenger hunt.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Loved it.  The flashbacks kin time are great and keep you interested in how it effects the house. And it's present day owners
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Looks great, follows perfectly with my Facebook page. I can send and receive lives and tickets. No complaints. Just happy the app is here and works!!!

IF YOU DON'T IMPROVE I WILL NOT BUY ONE MORE THING FROM YOU!  SORRY SWEETHEART!  LADY GAGA #1! SO THERE!  SLUT!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is very annoying to be asked if I want to spend 6 cents here, 8 cents there for various add-ons for a game that should be free once the initial fee is paid.  I just want to relax and have fun, not spend more money....those small amounts really add up.  Stop encouraging addictive behavior!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it this game is addicted and my family loves to play it as well. This is the best thing you could of ever done by putting candy crush on kindle, I give this game over 100% because you cannot just play one round.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|was ok but ALLLLLL over the place cant stand artsy movies. love to be transported in movies (really get into it)but doesn't give you 3 minutes til it moves on to something totally different constantly! could have been a BLOCKBUSTER! the story line itself is fabulous!<br />what a shame, of course the actors were great! I understand they wanted to let you see about multiple things in 2 hours but tooooo<br />much bunched into one. or just the way it was filmed.
0761172726|5.0|I order this calendar every year and have even started giving it as a small gift at Christmas for my busy friends and family.<br />It's great and keeps our busy schedules all posted in one place. Everybody gets a color and a square ! Plus the kids love the stickers that they can add for their activities.
0307730700|5.0|'..I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.  And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.'  Thank you Adam Brown and your family for sharing such an inspiring story.  I will never whine about anything in my life ever again.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book was hard  to put down.  Well researched and well paced.  Uses the narrative of on  unfolding accident at a titan II silo in Arkansas as a framework to discuss the history and culture of  th  development of nuclear weapons, and evolving thought on their control and use.  Highlh recommended.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman has done it again. His fantasy abilities are incredible, and even more incredible is how, even though I read each new book with extremely high expectations, he somehow continually surpasses them. No spoilers, but I will say that the story itself is truly unique, creatively drawing on themes but making them his own, for characters who easily draw you into their world.<br /><br />I for one can't wait to revisit The Ocean at the End of the Lane.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|This is a fun movie.  The premise is out there and the story is poor.  But if you take it for what it is, escapist entertainment and not art, then you can really enjoy this movie.  Great special effects and cool locations make for a fun MOVIE.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the concept but it gets 3 stars for the following reasons: It took nearly 2 months to arrive and I know it was a new (and much-hyped) product when I ordered but still, I expected better from a company the size of Google. I can't fault Amazon because they kept me informed every step of the way. Secondly, although it works well with Google sites like youtube and with the Netflix app, I would be more impressed if it worked with everything. By that I mean the Chromecast is locked into the Google Chrome browser so if it can't be watched in a browser window then it doesn't work. That may not be a problem for most people but if you have digital copies of movies that you want to watch then it just won't work.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I'm still learning all the features, but so far I really like what I see. I'm very hard to wake up but this is working. So far so good. I love the variety of sounds. I can switch them around so I don't get used to one sound and start ignoring it after a few days.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|What a terrific movie.  Hollywood apparently can make great movies, they just don't seem to want to on balance.  More like this one please.
B00881VLCE|4.0|If you enjoy puzzles this one is great. It allows you to chose how many pieces to use, etc. It has a few simple features that only take a little while to figure out. I got it for my new Kindle adn glad I did. I do about 1 puzzle per night.
140053271X|5.0|In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple. No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!
B001FB55LW|5.0|What a fun movie to watch!<br /><br />Carl (Jim Carrey) went from a lonely grumpy guy, to an exciting adventure that included everything from a job promotion to a new love interest.<br /><br />I love, love, love this movie. Its so funny watching him reluctantly say yes to things and all the mischief he gets into as a result.<br /><br />Lighthearted movie to watch for a few laughs.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This movie is a throwback to a time when movies told stories about people and their lives.  It's a 'small' story; a coming of age story and an observation of human behavior, but it's polished like a jewel.  Women will love it and men will get points for seeing a movie their women love while quietly enjoying it as well ;-)
1476747016|5.0|I would recommend this book to cat lovers as well as fans of pusheen! It includes the webcomics as posted on pusheen.com It's great for a giggle here and there although you don't need to buy it in order to enjoy. It does make a great fun gift though for all lovers of cats :)
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Zombie dice is a simple concept.  Eat brains, and don't get shot.<br /><br />There's a push your luck component as you can only sustain 3 gun shots per turn.  If you get to 3, then you lose your brains.<br /><br />The whole game takes no more than 15 minutes to play, and it's extremely portable.<br /><br />I've learned that even a single brain or two can make the difference in winning the game.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|A couple of things that stood out:<br /><br />Several times throughout watching the movie, I caught myself admiring the continous ambient music. The background music and gorgeous scenes blend together and perfectly enhance the dystopian / dream like feel of the movie. I also really enjoyed watching a movie without the blood and gore we usually see in SF movies these days. The only thing that did not convince me was the idea that Jack's clones were used as a ground attack force. Made little sense. The machine with the drone technology and anti-gravitational devices may need Jack to keep everything in place, but to conquer the planet? Extra points for mentioning the Roman story of Horatio!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|love it such an awesome show very surprised at the Carol turn of personality Daryl Dixon is my favorite on the show
B002ZG994U|4.0|This was a pretty good movie lots of action decent story. Obviously its a remake of the old TV show so there are going to be some cheesy lines and over the top explosions but its worth the watch in my humble opinion.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read. Great sequel. Can't wait for the next book. (Maybe an \\"It\\" sequel or prequel?) Thank you Mr King.
0811870413|5.0|Chad Robertson followed the guild of Daniel Wing (Chad Robertson is actually the baker photographed on the cover of Bread Builders). This is for taking your bread to the next level, after Jim Lahey and Peter Reinhardt.<br /><br />His bakery in San Francisco is fantastic, beautiful breads and pastries, with a line out the door of its unmarked building.<br /><br />I would think it'd be hard to be so passionate about Tartine if you haven't eaten there, but the experience is life changing, which makes Robertson a great resource to follow.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Any book of Donna Tartt's is like a miracle of reading.  She is the closest thing to reading a Dickens sort of novel today with its density of characters and storyline, mysteries and details of the most minute and miracles of writing.  To read one of her books is to experience a travel that's like no other. Reading &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; is like that.  It's her best effort thus far, I think.  It's simply the most amazing.  And, that doesn't mean I don't think you should read her other two books!<br /><br />I found myself jumping up several times in glee and forcing my husband just to listen to small descriptions of the otherwise mundane in this novel.  She writes so beautifully that the union suit of a miner hanging on a bathroom shower curtain becomes iconic and gorgeous!  It actually is so real, it lives and breathes!!  Amazing stuff...so you can imagine how the rest of her story comes to life.  The repair and care of antique furniture becomes so precious and such an act of love, it reaches your soul.<br /><br />Tartt's characters are to love, hate, to sympathize with, to disparage, to want to reach out for.  They are pitiful, disgusting, harmful, harmless and worthy of your most tender feelings.  She runs the gamut.  You become fully engaged...it's impossible not to.  They are so alive.<br /><br />This is a story about relationships of all kinds: parenting, friendship, love.  There's fear and selfishness and other emotions from basic relationships.  It's a story of redemption and finding ones place in the world.  It's an exploration of the world from many sides of life.<br /><br />I will admit there is so much to take in in this novel that I couldn't just sit down and read it fast like some books.  I had to take it in parcels.  I wanted to savor the words and the journey of its characters, particularly the primary one, Theo.  I've always felt that way about Tartt's books.  They are the kind you don't want to finish quickly because when you do, they'll be all gone!  I hate to turn the last page.<br /><br />I would welcome you on this journey of a special read.  It's unusual.  It's one that will charm you and touch your heart.  It will cause you to stop and smile, laugh, cry out in surprise, feel hurt and even offended for the characters.  I'd be very surprised if you don't love it as much as I have.<br /><br />Donna Tartt is a genius author of our times.  Not to read her is like not reading Joyce Carol Oates.e!

B0089EHWQE|4.0|great read and heard it was going to be made into a movie... I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out!
B005SZADQS|2.0|The show started out very tempting, but I found myself raising an eyebrow as twists and new characters began to appear at an alarming rate.  At first, I expected this to be the sign of a brilliant show, and that all these twists would come together in an equally brilliant culmination.  However, it quickly became apparent that the writers had simply run out of ideas, and were beginning to guide the show more like a soap opera.<br /><br />As another reviewer points out, the references to Columbine are tasteless.  Not to mention they are a prime example of the horrible writing; in one scene, the school killer describes asking a girl \\"Do you believe in God?\\" before he kills her...yet later, we actually get to SEE the killer kill that girl, and he never asks the question.<br /><br />I watched this show hoping to find something to replace my Breaking Bad fix, and to bide my time between new episodes of The Walking Dead.  But after this first season, I am done.  On that note, the last couple episodes are HORRIBLE.  The story telling gets almost cartoonish, with awkward failed attempts at comedy, and a pretty clear ripoff of Beetlejuice (although I should have guessed, given the obvious attempt with the Winona Ryder-esque daughter).<br /><br />If you enjoy mindless entertainment and don't care about plot holes galore, then this show might be for you.  If you actually have a life and enjoy something meaningful and intelligent when you do take the time to sit down and watch television, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

B003WUYP56|5.0|Lee Smolin's \\"The Trouble with Physics\\" concludes my troika of books on the state of modern physics written from the \\"non-goshwow!\\" side.<br /><br />I started out with Alexander Unzicker's [[ASIN:1137278234 Bankrupting Physics: How Today's Top Scientists are Gambling Away Their Credibility]] which is a broadside diatribe against what Unzicker views as a way of phyisics that puts more emphasis on computing power and beautiful theories than predictions and experiments.  I then turned to [[ASIN:1605984728 Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth]]by Jim Baggott which was a more moderate look at the probmem of physics with particular emphasis on the problems of quantum physics.  Baggott's book is particularly noteworthy for its basic explanation of how physics is actually practiced and how that practice is dysfunctional.<br /><br />Both Baggott and Unzicker are well-known science writers. Unzicker is a physicist.  Both are well-acquainted with the lack of progress in physics for the last 30 years as the lion's share of money and resources has been sunk into \\"string theory,\\" a theory that has not made an predictions and has not been verified by any experiments.<br /><br />Lee Smolin is a well-known physicist and so is even more knowledgeable about the \\"inside game\\" of physics. Smolin agrees with and confirms the diagnosis provided by Baggott and Unzicker; physics has not generated any progress for the last thirty years and physicists seem to be drawn into an activity that appears more like the apocryphal hobby of the Scholastics to argue about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin than it looks like a science that makes predictions and performs experiments.<br /><br />The eminence grise that runs through these books seems to be Thomas Kuhn's \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\\"  Unzicker does a great job of pointing out the anomalies that suggest that the standard narrative is breaking down. Smolin likewise believes that a paradigm shift is occurring, which means that physics needs more free-thinking, independent prophets and fewer drones who attach themselves to large research projects in order to make the numerous contacts needed for a university appointment. However, for all his talk of free-thinking prophets, Smolin's answer to the crisis in physics seems fairly tame - quantum gravity - compared to Unzicker who is willing to be open to a revision of our understanding of the laws of gravity, if necessary.<br /><br />All three books are terrific for their insider's look at how science is actually done, with its Kuhnian panoply of human foibles and academic politics. When all is said and done, the treatment of some modern physicists may not involve the open threat of torture, but the viciousness of academic politics has not gotten any nicer since Galileo's day.<br /><br />Some of Smolin's insights may seem \\"over the top\\" but to anyone who has watched a physicist like Lawrence Krauss pump up himself by contemptuously asserting that his opponent can't do math, those insights are illuminating. For example:<br /><br />>>>Perhaps it's to be expected that prejudice is fierce in this field. How many leading theoretical physicists were once insecure, small, pimply boys who got their revenge besting the jocks (who got the girls) in the one place they could-- math class? I was one of these, at least until I figured out what the jocks knew-- that it is all about confidence. But I still recall feeling smug about my abilities in algebra, and I can report that, at least for me, the identification of math skills with maleness runs very deep.&lt;&lt;&lt; Smolin, Lee (2007-09-04). The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next (Kindle Locations 5482-5486). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />Not exactly, news-making but it does point to the Kuhnian view that scientists are humans, something that people raised on Star Trek's scientism need to be reminded of.<br /><br />Another point that I found interesting was how important the history of science is to physicists.  Smolin seems to know the issues and sides of the historical debates over physics in a way that reminded me of how great philosophers recount the history of philosophy as a the product of a dialogue over time.  This observation was interesting in the way that it reveals that Kuhn's view of science is the reality and the view offered by science popularizers of one idea sweeping the field through sweet reason is wrong:<br /><br />>>>This general recalcitrance is partly a result of the move from revolutionary science to normal science in the 1940s. As in a political revolution, the rebellion had to be suppressed if the revolution was to consolidate its gains. In the early years, there had been several competing views and ideologies about the interpretation of quantum theory. By the 1940s, one had triumphed. In deference to the leadership of Niels Bohr, it was called the Copenhagen interpretation. Bohr and his followers had a stake in cutting off debate, and I would not be surprised to learn that they used the levers of academic politics to do so; given their involvement in the invention of nuclear weapons, they were certainly well placed to succeed. But even those who didn't care about ideology and wanted only to get on with doing normal science had a motive for stifling debate on the subject. Quantum theory was, on the experimental and practical side, a great success, and those forging ahead with it did not want to be bothered by the nagging doubts of those who continued to worry that there were deep problems with how the theory was formulated and interpreted. It was time to move on.&lt;&lt;&lt; Smolin, Lee (2007-09-04). The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next (Kindle Locations 5293-5301). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />Smolin also offers this caution against the unmitigated scientism that seems to expect that scientists give up their theories without a struggle:<br /><br />>>>Philosophers and historians of science, among them Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend, and Thomas Kuhn, have argued that one experimental anomaly is rarely enough to kill a theory. If a theory is believed deeply enough, by a large enough group of experts, they will go to ever more extreme measures to save it. This is not always bad for science, and occasionally it can be very good. Sometimes the theory's defenders succeed, and when they do, great and unexpected discoveries can be made. But sometimes they fail, and then lots of time and energy is wasted as theorists dig themselves deeper and deeper into a hole. The story of string theory in the last few years is one that Lakatos or Feyerabend would have understood well, for it is the story of a large group of experts doing what they can to save a cherished theory in the face of data that seem to contradict it.&lt;&lt;&lt; Smolin, Lee (2007-09-04).

Kindle Edition.<br /><br />As a whole, Smolin's book is engaging. His foray into science is often-times impenetrable for this layman.  I got the sense of him being a partisan in an intra-physics dispute (although he claims to have had a foot in all camps.) His discription of the history of philosophy and his acknowledgement of the fundamental philsophical orientation of science is excellent. His enthusiams for science is obvious.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I read this for a book club I am in.  I didn't love it but I did read it and found it somewhat interesting especially the cruelty of the orphanages.

B006ELF6AI|5.0|this season was good, exciting, and fun to watch. I would recommend this series for a good pass time for the family.

B0047E9TRA|5.0|Really good movie. A true love story gone really bad! Nothing beats rage and vengeance  combined with mastered mind power
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|For the price, I am somewhat satisfied. However, since the main reason I bought this was for Netflix streaming, it is disappointing that ads soon as a program starts to stream from Netflix the TV screen goes noticeably darker. This is with a Samsung plasma TV. I presume the problem is with Chromecast, but maybe not.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush Saga is challenging but frustrating at the same time. It's fun to play, but annoying when you keep getting asked to spend money to continue. Enjoy the game at your pace and keep adding up the points to continue.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Warning!  This review will contain spoilers!  I was really looking forward to this book coming out.  And while I am not happy that Roth killed off the main character, I am fine with it.  It's not the reason I didn't like the book.  I've read enough George R. R. Martin to be okay with characters I like being killed.  And frankly, the writing of this book was bad enough that by the time I got to the end and Tris dies, I just really didn't care anymore.  My problem with this book is two-fold. First, I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, and it didn't.  It dragged and dragged with potential plot points that didn't go anywhere and events that made little to no sense in the world Roth created.  Second, while it could have been very interesting to see inside Tobias's head, it was not done well and like a lot of others I kept having to look to see who was the POV character for the chapters I was reading.  Tris and Tobias sounded exactly alike.  It was confusing and irritating.  If Roth had fully fleshed out the voice of Tobias, it had the potential to be riveting, but as is, it was mediocre at best. I felt like the first two books of the series were paced well and held my attention.  But this one just never seemed to go anywhere.  The new characters seemed wooden and the established characters were not any better and it all just seemed contrived.  They did things, like Evelyn's turnaround, Tobias going along with Nita with little to no reason to believe or trust her, Tobias having as much faith in his mother as he did that didn't make sense, were not explained and were not authentic.  I can see where if Roth had taken some time to fully develop the characters and fleshed out some of the plot points this probably could have been two books.  Two good books.  I also think it says a lot when an author feels the need come out and explain why the book is like it is and try to defend it.  I almost feel like Roth killed Tris to take attention off the failures of the book as a whole.  As is, I'm kind of sorry I even read the series and will be unlikely to read anything by Roth in the future.  I was even looking forward to the movie, but now I don't want to see it because I know the last one will probably be as bad as the book.e.

B000KIPT30|4.0|I think this is a solidly built headphone amp. For the price it is a bargain. It does definitely add in noise and I don't Luke that the ONLY option for input is a 1/4&#34; TRS cable. Other than that, no real complaints. It is a great value for the money.
B00002SWEM|5.0|You know, one thing that is missing from movies today is character development / interesting characters.  This movie has some very interesting people, with fantastic stories to tell and some fantastic music too.<br /><br />Very well done.
B00190OHD6|1.0|It sucked!  I cryed through most of it and then sobbed for a good long time after.  Not a good movie to watch if you've lost someone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is hard to walk away from. So much fun. Started out as just a mind release and hes turned into sn addiction.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I love this movie! Every single thing about it! This Blu-ray transfer is absolutely gorgeous! The audio quality is amazing. Every musical number is loud and crisp.<br /><br />This movie has a great story and is fun to watch for kids or adults. Also it is a mash of two holidays so its perfect to watch anytime of year but especially around Halloween and Christmas!
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Interesting and fun. It is a good way to pass the time. The monsters are cute and the game is simple but addicting.
B006R6ZP6U|2.0|watched about half and stopped.  such great actors and it was lame.  I don't know if that was the point but that is what I saw.  I may watch it again to see how it ends, but defiantly not paying for it.  watch it on TV or something
B00007KWHG|5.0|I went to the play and there CDs were selling $25.  What  deal and love the music.  Brings back the good ol' days.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|I bought this case for my Kindle fire (!st Gen) and it was great. It was well built. Strong and sturdy. The colors were vibrant and I really liked the way it looks.<br /><br />Since purchasing this on amazon I have recommended family members to buy cases from timbuk2 as well and they have all been greatly pleased. I liked the envelope shape and I really wish all cases could be in this form.<br /><br />I dropped my kindle twice with this case on and it came out perfectly intact with not a thing wrong. Definitely better than some cases I have put expensive electronics in.<br /><br />Great Great Great!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I wanted a calculator tool that was basic but didn't have all that other stuff I didn't need, like a scientific calculator, etc.  The calculator is large, easy to read and is a really good tool.  I give it a double thumbs up for meeting my needs!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am very happy to be able to play on my Kindle. The graphics are great, and the game works well and is a lot of fun. My one complaint is that I have to spend $ or somehow convince my friends to help me unlock levels so I can continue.
B00FX8FQ76|4.0|The entire album is actually pretty good. The only song I would remove is the Rap song. It does not fit and is actually quite horrible. I struggled reading the reviews as to whether to buy it or not. I ended up biting the bullet and have enjoyed it for several days. There are several good songs and a couple of great songs. I feel she has extended the audience with Prism as it shows some maturing in both her voice and skills.
B004DMIIO6|4.0|Goemon is special in its own way. It is very action oriented with heavy use of CGI.<br /><br />The CGI sometimes distracts from what is happening and the story isn't the best by far but this movie is fun and exciting. Not a llet down.<br /><br />I would recommend this to action fans and also people who like foreign films seeing how this is a Japanese movie.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|This is a fairly simplistic analysis of anthropological differences throughout history and cultural revolutions.  I'm still reading it, but as a reference is in-depth and very useful.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|finally a sequel that's as good as the original! me and my husband both enjoy this movie and he's watched it 3 times already
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this app was different and enjoyable, but too easy. it is also only about 12 levels, so it took me about an hour to complete. I would love to find a harder longer version of this app.
B004Y6CV1M|5.0|SBTRKT (pronounced Subtract) is an incredible band. They make incredible music and this CD is just amazing. I have the Vinyl LP and a free digital copy that Amazon provided for me using their Auto-Rip program.<br /><br />The songs are an eclectic mix yet they go so well together as a while album. I wish I could see SBTRKT live because I hear they put on an amazing show. This album has a few different Vocalist such as the lead singer from Little Dragon and Sampha. Each adding something specials to each song.<br /><br />I listen to this on my way to work and while working out. I couldn't recommend this more!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The writing isn't particularly special - though it does an awesome job of presenting realistic cases that portray issues related to technology. The acting isn't particularly gripping - though I can't help but find myself rooting for my favorite characters. It's little more than a well executed soap opera. I guess sometimes, that's all you need.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was great. I agree with the people that say let the book sink in and happily ever after ending is not what always happens in real life. This book had a bit of reality in it and that's ok. I wouldn't change the ending. Great book all in all :-)
145162445X|5.0|Expand your mind and learn something that is really quite simple to understand once you break down the walls of conventional thought. Mr. (or Dr., I forget) Krauss does explain current theories in a way that most shall understand.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I Loved the Divergent Series. Well let me correct that sentence I loved the Divergent Series until I read this final book. The first two were smart, funny, and action filled. This third one was absolute rubbish. When I was done I threw my physical copy away. It was literally trash to me now. I had such high hopes for this book based off the excellent beginning and ever better sequel.<br /><br />The characters in this book continued to make stupid decisions again and again, over and over causing many characters to be shot. Tris and Four are definitely smarter in the first two. Maybe getting beat up so much made them lose some brain cells.<br /><br />I would recommend that instead of reading this book you would just make up your own ending that makes you happy.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Not for the easy stomach, but excellent acting all the way around. This movie even has a small amount of &#34;who-done-it&#34; twists and turns at the end, even though we know everyone's role throughout the movie.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Beatiful movie  ,and funny is a big leccion for all , i love it  is a beatiful love  and compasion!!
B000V86OKG|5.0|How I miss the good old days of Dexter. With the DVD set I can at least relive the better days of the show. Season 4 is still my favorite but the lead up to that season is still amazing.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Limited amount of downloads with apple products. Bought a movie on Google Play and can't watch it with Chromecast as it is not compatible. But Netflix and HuluPlus work great.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie, if you have the ability to suspend your belief system and get into a fantasy world of wizards, orks, elves, and dwarves.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is so amazing. It is a fun little app that I use every day. It has alarms, weather, time, and many more. I would be surprised if you don't get this app, you would be like the only person not to get it. I recommend you get this app NOW.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This show takes all your favorite (and not so favorite) story book and fairytale character and puts them in the real world while also showing them in flashbacks in fairytale land. It combines fairytales with action, suspense, and comedy. A must watch show for any fan of fairy tale or story book characters or any one who is wanting to visit a new and amazing story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I have waited for this app for my kindle fire for so long. I was envious of everyone that had it ! It works perfectly on the Kindle Fire ..no<br />glitches or problems, just lots of fun.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Great read , an important segment of GOT series with many plot twists. Enjoyed it very much.looking forward to the next book.
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|This CD I originally received it from my sister and I played it to death.<br />Some of the lyrics in these songs one can relate to in their own lives.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|Not the best season of Dexter, but not the worst anymore either. Season 4 is still my favorite but this season is a must watch to get the full impact of season 4 and to experience Dexter at its best.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Now with our &#34;Affordable Care Act&#34; in place; we'll all know that it is not cheap.  You will pay - just like the rest of those countries with socialized medicine reported in &#34;Sicko&#34;.  The &#34;tax&#34; - high premiums will be a shock to many here in the USA.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant is the third and final book of the Divergent trilogy written by Veronica Roth. (However, additional novellas will be published throughout 2013 and 2014.) It is a story of explosive truths, plot twists and turns, and an intense ending that every reader has their own thoughts about, ranging from bittersweet to outright hatred. You will have to read it yourself and find your own closure in this intelligent, young adult, dystopian story.<br /><br />“Sometimes, all it takes to save people from a terrible fate is one person willing to do something about it.”<br /><br />My favorite things about this book: Allegiant stayed consistent with the characters’ value systems. The beliefs the factions have instilled in each character shines through their actions in this story. However, the factions themselves take a backburner in this book. “I don’t belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent... I belong to the people I love, and they belong to me- they, and the love and loyalty I give them, form my identity far more than any word or group ever could. – Tris” The author did not compromise any of the characters’ integrity, but complimented it with themes of truth, forgiveness, love, sacrifice, and bravery. After being “inside the walls” for the first two books, the reader gets outside the factions and learns what “divergent” is and what it means for the characters. This added some new and interesting content to this final installment, although the telling of the information was at times slow. The epilogue was a nice touch given the shocking ending.<br /><br />My least favorite things about this book: I found it difficult to fully invest myself in a large portion of this book. Initially, I thought it was because I was reading while traveling and my reading settings were not ideal. However, reflecting back I realize that Allegiant was like reading a whole new book outside of the Divergent series. Yes, Tris, Tobias, and all of the remaining characters from Insurgent (book #2) were in it but the story is in a different setting, there are new characters added, and the story features a whole new reality. Oh, and it’s dual narration! After finishing the book, I realized how important the dual narration was at the end but it was slightly confusing throughout the beginning and middle of the book. First, I would forget whose perspective I was reading throughout chapters and I had to flip back a few pages to remind myself. Although each chapter begins with the name of the narrator, it wasn’t always easy to tell who the narrator was based on the content and thoughts. Second, I was confused by being in Tobias’ head because he’s not as strong as he appears on the outside, he’s more damaged that I thought and I wasn’t prepared for that. “I don’t know how it would feel, to hate your own history and to crave love from the people who gave that history to you at the same time. How have I never seen the schism inside his heart? How have I never realized before that for all the strong, kind parts of him, there are also hurting, broken parts?” – Tris (about Tobias)<br /><br />My favorite quotes:<br />“‘A lot of the younger people think you’re downright heroic.’ ‘Oh, good,’ I say, a sour taste in my mouth. ‘Heroism is what I was focused on. Not, you know, trying not to die.’” – Tris<br /><br />“So much space. I wonder what it’s like in the places beyond ours; I wonder how people live there. I look out the window again, taking slow, deep breaths into a body to tense to move. And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents’ God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel. So small as to be negligible. It’s strange, but there’s something in that thought that makes me feel almost…free.” – Tris<br /><br />“I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that’s true of beginnings, but it’s not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don’t just stay with him by default as if there’s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.” – Tris<br /><br />“To me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing-the pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by yourself. Caleb’s betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it, all I’ve wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I am not sure I’m capable of shouldering it all myself-not sure that I am strong enough, or good enough.” – Tris<br /><br />“‘Yeah, sometimes life really sucks,” she says. “But you know what I’m holding on for?’ I raise my eyebrows. She raises hers, too, mimicking me. ‘The moments that don’t suck,’ she says. ‘The trick is to notice them when they come around.’…Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can’t escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other.” – Trisle fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that’s true of beginnings, but it’s not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don’t just stay with him by default as if there’s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.” – Tris<br /><br />“To me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing-the pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by yourself. Caleb’s betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it, all I’ve wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I am not sure I’m capable of shouldering it all myself-not sure that I am strong enough, or good enough.” – Tris<br /><br />“‘Yeah, sometimes life really sucks,” she says. “But you know what I’m holding on for?’ I raise my eyebrows. She raises hers, too, mimicking me. ‘The moments that don’t suck,’ she says. ‘The trick is to notice them when they come around.’…Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can’t escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other.” – Tris
B005PK56TA|4.0|What a creepy and twisted show. Now I understand what all the fuss is about. Can't wait to see the last coupl of episodes. Then I have to watch season 2.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Great film about an unforgettable period in America.  So many low information people still believe Oswald killed JFK.  Just what LBJ wanted them to believe. Costner is at his best here.....well worth watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great concept. Many facebook based games are not capable when not connected to a wireless network. Candy Crush lets the user play with saved progress at any time. Great for road trips or boredom. (Wi-Fi needed for in game purchases if so desired. Not recommended.)
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I used to always read non-fiction; with the occasional fiction book mixed in here and there. This books was so good it has sent me on a journey to find more like it.  And while I have read a dozen or so books since, this book is so good, I haven't been able to replicate the pleasure I had reading this book.<br /><br />Definitely worth the read; everyone I have recommended to has thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Every song is great.  We all need a little Sara Bareilles to brighten our day and display the lighter side of life.  Thanks for the great price.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|It is a different record from Elton.Nothing compare with his records on 70' and 80'.But I think that Elton still makes good music.Easy to listen album with soft melodies.\\"Home again\\" is a great cut and a beautiful piano performing.Great song.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This item can interest anyone from young to old.  For the older buyers it would be similar to opening your childhood.
B00F880BWG|5.0|So much is building up from this episode.<br />Another cliff-hanger in a series of cliff-hangers.There are a few things no one expected and a few things everyone expected. It's the unpredictability of the former which keeps me hooked on this show. Having read all the books leading up to the release of this new season, it is slightly different but still throws in cues from the comic, just enough to give a hat tip to the comics and keep everything in perspective.<br /><br />Enjoy!!! Watch it!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game you get to breed new dragons and also make friends with your neighbors. This disband amazing game you should get it if you love dragons.
0920668372|5.0|This is my favorite book to get new Mothers.  It was a good deal, arrived on time and in good condition.  What more could you ask.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. Well worth the .99 cents. You can make youre own disease and have it grow and mutate as you want. You can become an incredibly infectious disease that ststrs killing towards the end or become a reiculously mutated virus. so much game play to complete and had DLC. Truely awesome.
B00873GRU4|4.0|When first started this book had just hoped I would like it enough to read, I then proceeded to read most of it very quickly but slowed down near the end (pushed boundaries coming to the end of what could accept reading as quickly as I was but up until then was fantastic and did have a good ending).<br /><br />While a few of things in the story are a quite unbelievable this is easy to ignore for the sake of a good story and can easily relate to some of the characters and others can definitely believe they would be like that.<br /><br />The main and scarey thing, however, is how beleivable the nightmare situation these people are in (of which the majority are unaware of in the story) could arise and the awful lengths some go to to ensure others are kept from the truth.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the next book in the series, am captivated to see where it goes and already wishing there were more than 3 books in the series as can see will be a short time till read them all.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It came fast, and this charger is small, which i like.  plugs right in, can charge two devices at once, even tablets.  charges fast too with its higher amperage.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is my new (not so new) favorite movie.  The packaging was a little different, but I would order again, good deal.
B004I744AS|5.0|My husband and I use this app to build our vocabulary and to keep our minds Sharpe. We focus on two or three new words each day and use the words repeatedly during the day. We even quiz each other on the previous days' words. Great for couples and singles :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Twisty, bendy, with great revelations and lessons in love, life, and integrity. Will be looking for more by this author.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is by far the best movie this year!! I'm not a fan of 3D but the 3D in this movie is amazing!!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|What an insightful masterpiece!! while I already know I am an introvert, this book told me why I am one in the first place and I can surely say that this book has taken me to the next level. I understand myself better than ever before and I hope with the insights gained I could put them to good use :-)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works just like it says.<br />It would be nice if you could play movies or video from your phone or iPad,
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is an excellent app.  The concept is simple, but executing it can be challenging on the higher levels.  Many, many levels as well as several different sized puzzles ( 5x5, 6x6, 7x7.)  The graphics are very good, too.  I love it, and it's somewhat addictive.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I found myself skipping paragraphs to get on with it!  Some books I just can't put down and I have to buy the next book in the series the second I finish it. This one didn't quite grab me like that but if was a different story and I enjoyed reading it to the very end!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A RARE FAMILY FUN FILM FOR ALL AGES.  I didn't see this when it was in theaters, but it looked like a lot of fun.  It was so good and so funny.  I laughed so hard I had to take a break before I could continue.  And nobody will be embarrassed by this charming film.  Hope you will consider checking it out.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|I was a hardcore Pearl Jam from Ten through No Code.  After that I kept up with their new releases but fell off from being a 'super fan' of their new music.<br /><br />This album though totally takes me back. It's not as good as any of their four albums but damn the sound and Eddie's voice just transport me back.  The more I listen the more I love. Saw them at the Barclay's center a few weeks ago and it was one of the best shows ever.<br /><br />So yeah, if you've ever liked Pearl Jam at any point of your life, get this album
B00E38KGF4|2.0|After scanning this app does a Querying Server, for whatever reason. And it does not complete the process on my Onda 10&quot; MIDI tablet<br />.  No idea what it is trying to do or why. One thing you can say for it, it's persistent.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun and relaxing to play when you need a few minutes of escape. Enjoy playing and love the graphics and colorful boards.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|I would give this 5 stars, except I have had a couple times when it would loose contact with the camera, so the camera was dead.  At first I thought the batteries where dead and replaced them, with the same results.  I removed and reattached it to the camera and it worked.  Not sure why, but it's happened twice now, after I haven't used the camera for a week or so.  Otherwise, it's great.  I love having the shutter release on the lower body, so if I'm shooting vertically, the button is right there.
1451666179|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from HAAH as a book, but it works -- almost better than online. This is great storytelling in a deceptively simple presentation (the book is beautifully designed, though -- really satisfying). I'll be giving this as a gift this season.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very good read. Experience life as a slave in the 1800s. If u have ever traveled south and seen plantations this read brings them to life.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|It's essentially their \\"Sandinista!\\" or \\"Remain in Light\\". An album that moves you both literally and figuratively. James Murphy did a good job with the production. I actually prefer the second disc than the first.
B008742O32|5.0|Airdroid allows you to access your Android smartphone (without a USB cable) via your home network so that you can add/remove files, install/uninstall apps, and perform maintenance. Install app on phone & use browser on PC to link to phone. Simple & Easy!
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I really, really did not like this book. The premise has potential because the topics of privacy and social networking are relevant and interesting and a great story could have been done on it. But the author chose to create very boring, simplistic, 1 dimensional characters and as a result an uninspiring story. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. The end was totally anti-climactic and expected.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is worth the money because it is awsome and easy to play thank custom ink lol you should really get this game
0307743659|5.0|This classic stands the test of time.  The story is one that stayed with me long after I had finished reading the book!
0399159347|1.0|Who are all those peaple giving this book such great reviews? I had read What Alice forgot..and thought it was a cute story, and so i thought this would follow suit. NOT !! I found this book boring,repetitive,drawn out, and did i say boriing ?? the women were all annoying, the men were wimps and the story was pretty awful. People....go read a Diane Chamberlain book instead.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|My husband and I have enjoyed this series. It is great all the movies and TV programs we can watch on Prime!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game has been loads of fun. Makes waiting in line almost tolerable. The different levels will keep you interested and wanting more.
1936891026|5.0|This book is such a wonder weapon to have in my arsenal to battle self doubt and fear. Knowing the enemy within helps to dissolve the &#34;monsters&#34; lurking about to stand in the way of my dreams and goals.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Every zombie movie it's different, but this one it really caugh me by surprise well presented, a great horror for us zombie fans movies.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Love the whole samurai and zombie idea of the game.. What is really great you earn your points in the game for the upgrades .. Love it down load it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best game I have ever had you need to get the game so get it remember<br />Best game ever
1400034779|5.0|So enjoyed this book. This is our church book club selection for Oct. Loved how clever she was at solving her cases. We look forward to a meet & greet with the author in Nov.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|Ido love this fallow up, very good Mr. Nicolas Cage and Mr. Idris Elba are so fantastic. Beside Mr. Elba give a one hell of performance in evry movie he's super.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had to re-read The Shining before reading this one, just to refresh my memory, and I have to say both it and Doctor Sleep were really good. Stephen King is back in this story, in my opinion. For me, there have been things missing in his works in recent years. However this one gripped me from the beginning, and held through to a great ending. Kudos to the man, he did an awesome job again!
B007SGM084|5.0|Was fantastic. I'm in love with this book. Makes you fall in love with the characters:) One of my favorite books.
1439153663|5.0|A book club selection. Engaging story of the intertwined lives of the people in the &#34;big house&#34; and the slaves in the kitchen house. A disturbing look at slavery and oppression.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see the Candy Crush app for the Kindle Fire. I also found it when I decided to check for new apps. The graphics are great. Thank you!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|\\"We are Allegiant, and we are many, yet we are no one...\\"<br /><br />I am awarding this book 4 stars.  I fluctuated between 3 and 4 but ultimately settled on 4 because there are just so many things I DID like about it.  I actually lost sleep last night on how to write this review without any spoilers and what to say about this book.  It is told in dual POV's which I liked.  Knowing both Tobias and Tris's inner most thoughts added so much depth for me.<br /><br />Everything starts out pretty much were Insurgent left off.  Tris, Tobias and some of the others are given an opportunity to leave the city, to go outside its walls.  Her ultimate dream is to find a place where she and Tobias can be happy together.  To have a peaceful life.  But that is not what happens.  What they do find is the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.  What is this place?  Is this a place they could call home?<br /><br />So many truths are unveiled at the Bureau, as are so many lies and deceptions.  Who can they really trust?  They find out that through genetic testing, people are categorized either genetically pure (GP's) or genetically damaged (GD's.)  And once again they are faced with the divisions, this time of the two classes.  And, of the fight for power, the power to control the cities and people within them.<br /><br />At times during this book I felt my head might explode with all the truths and deceptions being unveiled.  There were times I felt I was pushing myself through the book.  But, there were other times when I loved the book.  The love between Tris and Tobias was so strong.  The maturity of Tris is astounding for her young age.  She caries the weight of the world on her shoulders.  She is a true heroine.  Tobias, though, had a lot of bad moments during this book.  He made quite a few bad decisions.  And, I had forgotten how what I would call lyrical Veronica Roth's words can be.  The way she describes things, the way her words flow.<br /><br />Of course, there is the ending that everyone is talking about that is so shocking.  I really liked the Epilogue.  It gave me closure.  It really wraps everything up, lets us know what became of everyone.  So, in closing, there were things I did and didn't care for in Allegiant.  But ultimately, I am glad I read it, to have an ending to the story.  It might take me a few days to calm down and absorb everything but I am still glad I read it.one is talking about that is so shocking.  I really liked the Epilogue.  It gave me closure.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Amazing tool! Easy to use! So many versions to choose from, there's a version everyone can understand! A must have for all Christians!
B00C7607BC|4.0|This is like a flashback to my childhood a few years ago. Every happy and amazing childhood memory is back. The only complaint I have about this product is the infamous error in the part of your world scene. Though it does not detract from the move as a whole it is fairly disappointing to see one of my favorite scenes have an error.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Awesome and fun game. Just with it was little more to do. More animals to hunt and ability to actually walk and try not to spook animals
B008200LHW|5.0|I went on a trip, and having an awful experience with cellphone navigation, I knew I had to get a dedicated GPS unit. I contemplated about the all in one units like Garmin or Magellan, but I wanted a bigger screen. I use MS Streets and Trips with this on my small laptop, and it was fantastic. This thing finds GPS signal rather quickly, and since all my amps were on the hard drive, I had fast and accurate navigation. Cord is long enough, and the magnetic mount is wonderful and strong.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Rated.5<br />Like how two messed up people with many differences can find each other. Wow! Great love story. Thoroughly enjoyed
B00594XOZU|1.0|Had app forever and always worked but now I logged out and was going to log back on but it keeps on saying try again later. Need to fix. This is the only way i can contact anyone. So please fix soon.
B00433TO52|1.0|Downloaded this, but could not get any annotations to appear using the Kindle app on the iPad, so I returned it. Too bad.
B0054JELS4|5.0|This order arrived in timely fashion and all the dvd's were in excellent shape and though I haven't watched them all yet, what I have watched have played perfectly! I am a big fan of NCIS and in watching through the seasons have even found a couple of episodes I hadn't seen before...always a treat!
1475143389|5.0|The info on this book is really simple to understand but has the potential to change your entire health and fitness life. I've followed the program quite closely (except almost doubling the number of calories I need because I'm naturally a hardgainer), and I'm definitely pleased with the results. Most other books will only give you what to do, but Mike really goes into the &#34;why&#34; and that helps me understand the information so much better and provides me with the motivation to follow through.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is well made. Easy To play. But only lf you have friends who will play with you. They need to fix that part so you can add any friend from players who play
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A book to restore your belief in the goodness of the world we live on and the unboundless of the soul.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|A Wealth of info. Can't wait to get started on a system. So meany decisions to make and parts to find.
0062082841|2.0|This one is my mistake. I thought this book was about a cabinet of curiosity, which I'm interested in (in the historical sense). I thought Guillermo Del Toro was a 17th century collector who had large cabinets of curiosity and that this book was about them. Little did I know he's a modern day director of horror films like Hell Boy. I should have Googled him before I considered ordering this but the cover and the subject of Cabinets of Curiosity was too much for me. I leapt before I looked. Anyway, if you're a big fan of his films this book might be of interest to you. Otherwise forget it.
1419705849|3.0|This was an overall good book. It was funny and it kept me entertained for about 5 or 6 minutes before I finished it
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wanted to hate this book because I realize its poorly written.  But then all my girlfriends said they had read it so I bought it to see what all the hype was about.  It is poorly written. Despite that, its a fun read.  IF you take it for what it is -- cheap erotica.  A little better than Harlequin Romance.  Yes there are repeats on phrases but seriously... how many ways can you say orgasm?  As a serious reader and lover of literature I wanted to hate it but I'd read it again.  Just take it for what it was meant to be -- a slightly upscale trashy novel -- its not fine literature.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|long book. tired of drug stories.and was depressing reading. Still a great musician.Long live The Who. The great band. RIP Keith and,John.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I was disappointed to find that actual historical data on Jesus himself is in very short supply.  That said, the data on era and the religion and politics of the time was an interesting framework that explain several things misinterpreted by translators and theologians.  The fact appears to be Jesus himself was one of several &#34;messiahs&#34; in Israel at the time and he just didn't leave much personal historical record.  Intriguing that &#34;zealot&#34; meant something slightly different to Jews of the time than it means in common parlance now.  A confluence of events led to Paul's probably erroneous interpretations to become supreme in Christian thinking.  An interesting book for those not too doctrinaire in their beliefs.
031623480X|5.0|David Perlmutter writes informatively, in an easy to understand  way. There is scientific back up for all that he writes and for anyone not sure about the next step into a wheat,carb,sugar free way of life, this will be the turning point. Personally I am enjoying the very low carb and high 'good' fat diet and most of my family too. The book is now on my kitchen shelf with my other recipe books, referring to it as needed ~ highly recommend for everyone?Thank you David Perlmutter for all your research and for showing us he truth!!
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|This movie is deep. I was very surprised that it got low reviews.  It's like the critics were more interested in destroying the people who made the movie instead of being honest.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Duo Gamer cover all my expectations. It's excellent product for a excellent price. I want to see more games compatibles too.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|A good read, but no Game of Thrones or Circle of Time, which got me onto Brian Sanderson in the first place. That said, there were significant numbers of places where I was enthralled and had difficulty putting the book down. In places, I got lost in the descriptions of battle gymnastics by the Mistborn. I also am not one for romantic kinds of issues, but the relationship between the Mistborn, Vin and King Eland, was much better than Terry Goodkind's sometimes obsessive sounding descriptions of Richard Cypher and Kahlan, and the boring political discourse in the Wizard' First Rule series.  I have purchased the next volume and it seems to read better, so far, than this one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it is the best antivirus ever for any computer including mac, hope to buy some others, thank you and keep up the good work
B0071XO8RA|5.0|so it starts off slow and maybe somewhat shallow like \\"I can see where this is going\\" but it unfolds beautifully into something much deeper. Give it a few chapters.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Our children should read this book in school and have discus how  important education is and the right to go to school
B000FCKBCU|3.0|Interesting plot,  a quick read,  not as quirky as &#34;I've Got Your Number,&#34; but an enjoyable novel on a lazy day. &#34;I've Got Your Number&#34; is my favorite of all the books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is really fun considering its a &quot;parody&quot; of another game. I find it extremely addicting. It's fun for hole family (of minions that is).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging, and at times frustrating, but that is what makes a good mind challenge. I would definitely recommend this app to my friends
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I love the app it is so fun!!!! I recommend this game for people who love vampires and challenges. love it
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love it! I use it to put children to sleep and we all hear it at night. It is very calming and stays on throughout the night. I highly recommend it.
1250038820|3.0|While I also find the blog better in its joyful spontaneity and lack of editing, this still is a treasure of a book which anyone would enjoy regardless of where they live.<br /><br />However, what I find unforgivable is that the text is set in ALL CAPS -- ALL OF IT.  Blocks of type set in all caps are difficult to read, cause eye strain, and the use of which is considered shouting.  So, instead of cozying up with this delightful book, I find I can take only a few minutes of being \\"shouted at\\" before I have to put it down.  Obviously design over function won out.  If other books are to follow, I encourage the editors to take this into consideration.  I mean really, it's basic Layout 101.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this is a good game if u know stuff its also a great time waster.  I hihlt reccomend it.hdhdhdhdheh end he'd he'd Bsd shah ebebe e e eve eve
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It would be better if we could exchange easier. I had fun playing but Facebook needs to make points and or coins and prizes more interchangeable between games.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love using it to do math problems I'm too lazy to do in my head. One weak point though, please make it turn sideways.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movies! Just keep swimming! So excited to finally have a copy that I don't have to physically carry around that I can watch almost anywhere! :)
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|It doesn't get much more fun than SimpleRockets.  This game lets you build rockets and blast of from &#34;Smearth&#34; and other planets like &#34;Smercury&#34; and other bodies like the &#34;Smoon&#34;.<br /><br />You blast off, and push yourself into orbit.  From there, you can push yourself out of orbit and into the orbit of another body.  If you want, you can even make a &#34;lander&#34; module that allows you to land on the surface of the planets.  It's a ton of fun.  Build your rocket bigger, and more efficient, or make it just what you need.  You can customize it a bunch of different ways with bigger or smaller fuel tanks, boosters, parachutes, etc.<br /><br />Going through the tutorial is a must.  I would have never figured it out otherwise.<br /><br />After you get the hang of it, there are different missions, some of which have you competing with other players for times, distances, speeds, etc.  There is also &#34;sandbox&#34; mode where you can do whatever you want.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy this game again (even though I picked it up as the free app of the day).  If you are into space, rockets, or just physics games, this game is excellent.  You will love it.
B002RXS1OK|5.0|i have watched this movie so many times and really love it, it is very old school and well acted. frank langella does a great job in this movie and you should watch it. not to gory, the kids can see it.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I bought this when we were babysitting my niece - Cute movie - kept her occupied an featured a strong female lead.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Why would you kill your lead character even if they are doing something bravery. Plus I didn't like how it was back and forth between Tris and Tobias. Fine until last hundred page. I wish I had not brought it.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Best Show on TV in Years, Maybe ever. If you are a fan, you already know this...so yeah, the dvd's came in a timely manner, and I am happy, happy, happy.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|I had never watched the series from the beginning - so I bought this knowing that I would love it. Its sex and the city so if you know the series you know what you'll get, but if you don't - you are in for a treat. Strong women - lovely shots of NYC and fabulous fashion, what more could a girl want?
B0016LTNL4|4.0|Liked it!  Good family comedy had some very funny moments.  It's British humor, but not weird humor, just good humor.
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Some of the songs remind me of old rock music, which is a good thing, and then you hear Eddie V vioce and bam Pearl Jam..
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Very good movie, keep us close to the television set, will recomend to friends, good rental price, very good actors
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game that you cannot stop playing. So a review with a word limit isn't that just special. Peace
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun game that can catch you playing for much longer than you planned.  It is a good way to take a break.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Love it love it love it it's a Great movie about living and Love it's based on a true story it's very very good movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so absorbing that time flies.  I have recommended it to family and friends.  I have run down my battery more then three times on my kindle.  It is great.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />The book is pretty good! Very emotionally powerful and full of betrayal, action, romance, and, of course, NO LOVE TRIANGLE! :D Be aware that once you get to where you are 80% through the book, you must only read it when you're alone, because you're gonna cry like you did during the first two! Overall, it's a well-composed book that divulges you in the confusion and action of Tris and Tobias's world, with the point of view switching between the two. At first, it will seem annoying, yes, but it's crucial for the rest of the book! Anyways, just finished, and I loved it, and I'm so sad that the series is over, but at least the Divergent movie comes out in 2014!<br /><br />Erbie's Reviews, October 2013
B007RP4D5Y|3.0|I bought this cd without listening to any of it.  After a week of listening, i find it a little to jazzy for my taste. The long instrumental riffs go a little to far for me.<br />Maybe it will grow on me in time.  I will come back and let you guys know.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Not great.<br />Could have done much more with this movie. Entertaining though so I won't give it one star. ...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Captivating plot! The only issue I've had is keeping track of all the characters and their intersecting stories. Otherwise it's been a great read.
B007L5LD9O|3.0|My sister recommended this movie as wholesome and fun. I don't know about the fun but I did enjoy the time era and that it was clean with no offensive language, which is rare these days.
0741470314|5.0|This book about Michael Jackson is written verry good.Dr. Moriarty took the time to write this book,and searced for the right people who knewed Michael Jackson.I am sure Dr Moriarty is a big fan to.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Micheal Weatherly rocks.  I really enjoy watching NCIS. There really is a reason why it has gone on for 10 seasons
B00FX8FQ76|4.0|I was already enjoying her debut song \\"roar\\". So, listening to the rest of the album was a good one as well. She has catchy lyrics mixed with cool beats.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|8 seasons, 8 years of Dexter going down and killing in Miami for his sanity, for his passion, for his sport.<br /><br />8 years of watching distinct madmen wanting to kill and Dexter ending up getting the last laugh.<br /><br />This last laugh was not sufficient as this season was probably the worst since Jimmy Smiths in Season 3. This season was highly dissapointing, I don't get how you do a Series for more than 5 years and you end up tarnishing its legacy with this season. The plot was bad, the acting was so-so, the episodes led to nowhere and it got tiresome quickly.<br /><br />I expected this Series Finale to be grand and was completely caught off guard by its stupid notion and of its dumb conclusion and hypothesis. This season felt like it needed more and to end on a high note but sadly, it wasn't and it was not up too par as a great Season.
1616550414|5.0|If you are a fan of the Legend of Zelda series this book is a must have. It covers everything about everything in the game in a easy to understand way. If you were ever curious about how the whole Zelda universe tied together this book is a must have.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun, it's easy and relaxing!  It's a great way to forget about the day and relax while playing it even though it's challenging at times!
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|Really? 5 stars for this movie? Come on!<br /><br />Jamie Foxx as president who can shoot, throwdown and do a lot more like if he was in &#34;Jarhead&#34; is completely stupid and Channing Tatum as a action star is for me, not believable at all. Very poor script, the effects were good but...yet again, another White House themed movie invasion is getting kinda stale.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is a great dongle with a lot of potential behind it. I got it for my mother to use in her [[ASIN:B0096YOQRY VIZIO E320i-A0 32-inch 720p 60Hz LED Smart HDTV]] because it would not hang onto a WiFi connection. I also dug out an old Samsung Galaxy S for her to use with it.<br />Setup is extremely easy. You plug it into an HDMI port of your TV, and plug the USB cable into a USB port (Most modern TVs have a USB port that can supply power). Then you give it the password to your WiFi and download the app for your phone (or Chrome extension for you computer) and let it do the work for you.<br />When it's setup it's also pretty easy to use. Compatible apps on your phone like Netflix and YouTube will have a button at the top to tell it to send the information to the Chromecast and you just let it do it's thing again. One of the best parts is that since the Chromecast gets the info from the cloud, it is able to keep a steady connection and you can just set your phone aside and not worry about it (until you want to pause or rewind, of course) and it won't use any extra battery at all from your device.<br />My one major gripe with the Chromecast is that it has SO MUCH potential behind it, but Google is limiting it (maybe to keep streaming partners happy). You can only stream Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, Google Play Movies, and you can stream what you seen in your Chrome Browser on your computer over your home network to the Chromecast, but it did not work well at all for me, though I do have a lot of walls in my house that could mess with my connection (the picture is really bad quality and I probably got about 10 FPS on it). Developer have found ways to stream pretty much anything to the Chromecast from your device, but Google has been quick to patch them (automatic updates in the background). Also, Google has said they are working on an HBO GO app which is great news.<br />Also, you may notice this thing get pretty hot after use, but don't worry because pretty much the entire inside of it is made up of two aluminum heatsinks that are designed to pull heat away from the components inside so the outside gets very hot, but that means it's working!<br /><br />TL;DR: This is an AWESOME product for this price. It is easy to setup and use, but it is doesn't quite live up to the potential it has by having a fairly limited amount of streaming apps, and squashing outside developers workarounds to get other things streaming on it. But I very highly recommend this device to someone wanting a good, cheap way to get some streaming onto your TV, especially if it's not a smart TV.uch the entire inside of it is made up of two aluminum heatsinks that are designed to pull heat away from the components inside so the outside gets very hot, but that means it's working!<br /><br />TL;DR: This is an AWESOME product for this price.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is more than it seems.  Very scary and slick.  Reminds me of some SuperNatural episode.  Try it!  Spooky!  Get this game.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I found it funny and entertaining.  It met my expectations very well.  Two thumbs up.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addictive, fun and easy game to play. Best bingo game out there.  I look forward to playing every day!

B003U4UPHG|5.0|Season 2 continues to build on season 1. You start to learn about the secrets of the island along with losing some characters  but being introduced to new characters.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep follows grown-up Danny Torrence as he continues to deal with the nightmares of his childhood.  Everything about this novel was fantastic. King once again does a phenomenal job of pulling you into the story, and you get reacquainted with the horrors of the sleeping-but-not-dead monsters of the overlook hotel. I couldn't put it down.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I simply forgot how great and inspiring this story is. I hadn't read it in many years, and now I'm pulled like Buck into my own primordial world. A toast to the memory of Jack London.
B007YQ8D5W|5.0|No, really. I don't get the negative reviews. Other people's bad reviews got me nervous, but I'm glad I didn't allow other people's thoughts to influence my objectivity here.<br /><br />This album reminds me of a REALLY super charged Scorpions or something. Excellent compositions and instrumentation. Well produced. Solid hooks, solid songs. Mature sound. I've been listening to Sonata Arctica since I was 15 years old, now I'm almost 30 and still happy to follow them. I'm actually happy that this band didn't decide to just rewrite 8th Commandment over and over again for the last decade. I like when a band can give me different things to listen to throughout the years; makes me excited to see which direction the music will take in the coming years. Things have to evolve, change, experiment and grow, or it gets stale. I'm not 15 years old anymore, glad Sonata Arctica isn't either.
1451666179|5.0|First-time reviewer.  Couple weeks back, I got laid off from what I thought was a steady job.  Got this in the mail two days ago.<br />This book is the first thing since then that's made me laugh at something other than myself.<br />Allie Brosh is a genius.

B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I've only tried this app for a short time. Having trouble getting a scope or upgrading my weapon. Could just be me. Have to try using it more to figure it out.<br />Decent game otherwise.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|Timeless piece about sin and redemption with stunning visuals.  De Niro as a warrior monk is both believable and powerful, a must see.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I was not sure what to expect when I heard that there was gonna be a new Arcade Fire album. They to this point haven't been able to top Funeral with their other two albums. I heard the title track on the radio and I was blown away by the spacey and sensual groove of the track. I picked up the album and I was astounded by the craziness of all the sounds that they get to explore. They are much more electronic and experimental on this track, in some ways harkening The Flaming Lips. This album is a must listen of 2013.
B004NBZG06|5.0|Heyer is unmatchable. This is just a sparkling book, full of humour and warmth. Read it if you're sad and it will help to lift your sadness and make you forget your troubles. Who could be sad while reading about kindly and unmacho Freddy?
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Awesome movie!  My kids never it.  Classic flick. I forgot how scary the ending was. Even if saw when it first came out, see it again!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Just one of the very best TV shows.  It never disappoints.  I've watched all the seasons available, and really enjoy how each character has grown and changed.  Really well written and acted.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I have a middle schooler and we read this book together. I hope every middle school and high school library has at least one copy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game and love the way the scenery changes all the time. It is challenging and me and my daughter love playing this. Espscially the halloween scenes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun and challenging enough. Kept me interested.  Was interesting learning where everything was and how to use it.  Need more floors. Could be addicting.
B005K17RU0|5.0|For me I have found that apps are faster and more convenient than having to open up a browser and all of that hassle. So this AccuWeather App is just the ticket. It opens up quickly with beautiful radar maps and also it has plenty of weather information. This is the most complete weather app that I have found.<br /><br />This weather app, I recommend to you for these wonderful features that make this app stand head and shoulders above the other weather apps:<br />1) Now weather<br />2) Hourly (the best way to know when the rain or storm will arrive)<br />3) Maps with radar (SUPERB GRAPHICS)!<br />4) Videos that have used weather information for upcoming weather.<br />5) News<br /><br />What I like the best is that it has a share feature where I can email the weather info to others.<br /><br />Highly recommend this app as I believe that you will love it.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I generally enjoyed the book.  It was fun seeing some of the characters from A Time To Kill.  I'm not wild about the ending, though.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent writing, acting and directing.  Wish we saw more of this on our shows here in the states. Seems like we are satisfied with dancing with the stars or the Kardashins, Yuk!.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|How unfortunate it might have been to have discarded this incredible story without giving it 50 pages of chance.  Harry Potter for adults. Rich in metaphor, brilliant in simile, exquisite in allegory.  Patrick Rothfuss is without doubt one of the most descriptive and imaginative writers of our age.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Always a great show to watch.  I don't think I will ever stop watching this show because it is one of the best on tv.

0440237688|3.0|I should start by saying that I did not read this book by choice;  it was a school assignment.  I was told to expect something as powerful as 1984,  but I  did not find this book to be anything close to that level.<br /><br /> I cannot give a proper review of it without spoilers,  so I don't  want to go too  in-depth with plot and  summary. Part  of my extensive project involved getting others to read it.  I enlisted the help of twenty others.  No one in this group liked it.  However,  it did inspire some very  thought-provoking questions and I was able to build a very nice project.<br /><br /> It is a children's book.  I might be tempted to think that was the reason it was unpopular,  but my project involved examining the reaction of different demographics to the book,  so children were involved.  It is not a good read, according to my experience and my research.  It does make you think.  So,  when you are considering buying it,  think of your reasons for reading. Escapism?  Find something else.  School paper?  This is the book for you.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What a horrible end to this series.  Is a  so excite  when I saw this book on my kindle.  I had pre ordered it because  I loved this series.  But this was  th  most anticlimactic book I have ever read.  What a waste of a good series

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this first taste of Neil Gaiman, whom I'd never read before. Reviews of his work are so promising and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing that was lost in translation was the main character being served a plate of \\"spotted dick\\" with custard... British people, what are you eating across the pond and can I have some
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|These Lego Minecraft kits are great to play around with and connect to other Minecraft kits. I have ordered all three kits and love each one. If you know a Minecraft and Lego fan, this is a great gift! This one is my personal favorite.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was sent so many requests to play this game, and just ignored them. Finally I started to play it a little each day, and now I play it almost every day. It is very relaxing for me. I just have to time myself, because it can have you forgetting the hours and minutes you spend playing it!!!
0451419243|5.0|Follett writes pageturners and this book doesn't disappoint. It was also nice to catch up with all the characters again. Looking forward to Book 3.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I didn't like the way the chapters were written in the view of one of the characters. I didn't like the way it ended.
006202406X|2.0|I loved the first 2 books. I could read them over and over.  But now that I have read the last book, I will probably never read them again.  Not only did the last book not make much sense, it had an awful ending.  I wouldn't mind the fact that the plot didn't make sense, but with the bad ending, it was horrible. :( dissapointing.
B001CZJKS0|3.0|I had thought that it would include Halloween 2 & 3 since it was advertised as a complete set. Now i will just have to purchase those separately from another retailer.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|This adapter does what it advertises, brings your firewire devices through the Thunderbolt port.  Being new to the Apple world, I was hoping to use it for 'more' than being able to 'view' files, etc., stored on external drives; however, copying or pasting anything back to the drive is not possible with the NTFS formatted drive, even through the use of the parallels desktop ap.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was the saddest yet most exciting book I have ever read. It's so sad I have been crying for about 10mins. I highly recommend this book.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|This cd was awesome. Her music is great. No issues with cd delivery or packaging. I played it continuously since I've received it.
B00D48BSBA|1.0|Forsyth writing by the numbers. It would interesting as non fiction. As fiction there is zero character development , zero emotion and absolutely no suspense or surprise .
B0052GACNM|5.0|This cd is awesome. I love Tony Bennett and so this was not a let down. I have Duet I and was not disappointed about this one.
1451638450|5.0|I bought this for him and he bought me a copy too. We both loved it and I've passed one of the copies on to other fans.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I enjoyed this book (and the other books in the series) and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre and doesn't mind if the book isn't ground-breaking. The series is basically a rip-off the Game of Thrones books with some Lord of the Rings elements and a scattering of other common fantasy themes, which I didn't really mind. It's fast paced and interesting enough. The writing isn't superb and could have been helped a lot by a good editor. For instance, the main character, Thor. &#34;felt like, for the first time, he truly belonged &#34; about 6 different times, and it would be easy to nitpick scores of story incongruities. The characters often don't behave in an appropriate or believable manner, particularly in their lack of a proper response to the crazy, otherworldly things Thor does. However, despite all of this, I found myself enjoying these books quite a bit (enough to read the entire series), and while it isn't the greatest series ever written, it is thoroughly entertaining and I am glad to have read it. If you're bored, give it a try. You'll probably be pleasantly surprised.
B00CPLGFM4|3.0|AMD lags behind intel in single threaded performance, so if you're going to go AMD, its best to at least have a bunch of cores. I'd recommend either getting an older A8 or an intel i3 if you need something cheap. Running Windows 8 with just firefox open, I'm hitting 100% on both cores very frequently. This causes some lag and its kinda annoying. Its not the worst thing in the world, but I don't think the amount of money you'd save getting this processor is worth it. I still gave it 3 stars because its at least what it claims to be. However, don't be fooled by AMD calling their APU graphics HD 8000. The graphics are comparable to an integrated HD 6000 series GPU. This isn't terrible, but the naming is very misleading. Its okay for gaming on low-medium settings. If you want to upgrade to a nicer graphics card eventually, keep in mind that the slow processor will bottle neck anything too nice.<br /><br />EDIT: So the first processor I received was faulty and that was giving me issues. The turbo boost and power save features didn't work properly, so it was clocked at 1.75 most of the time, and didn't ramp up quick enough. It also failed Prime95 after a few minutes, so either the processor or the mother board was unstable. Amazon replaced both and were pretty great about it. Other companies don't touch them in customer service. After a few months with this processor, I'm still underwhelmed but it is much better than it was. For surfing the web or a budget HTPC, this processor is probably a good buy. It streams video well, and can handle a decent amount but you're gonna have some lag if you do any serious computing. Still, its about half the price of the A8, so its worth thinking about. The graphics are decent, and would likely be better if I had faster RAM. To the comment that said if I had faster RAM the processor would work better, that's not exactly true. The GPU part will work better, but the CPU part wont be that effected. I plan on upgrading it ASAP.
B008GJV8BW|5.0|Great story about organized crime and how twisted and tangled the players are. Well worth seeing and the ending is .....!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I loved it and had it all thru high school. It was great, and fun!!! Good modernish film!!!  okay then
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|As a Star Trek fan it wasn't great. It follows the first time line set up in the last movie. It was well done. It's just no Wrath of Khan.

B00B4804KS|4.0|3d stunning, brings out effects ,love it..Jumps right out at you..3D makes it a more enjoyable viewing .The old 3d I couldn't see much depth but the new 3d I am in it from beginning to the end loving every minute,..
B000GOWNPU|1.0|I selected this movie based on the cover but I only watched a few mins of the beginning. It did not hold my interest.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVE IT! I got  Sun dragons and Kairos and loads of dragons. But most of all I love the graphics. Super good. I recommend for ages 5-95!
B004WESFZW|5.0|This movie is a cute romantic comedy that keeps the viewer wondering if there will be a happy ending all the way through.  It has more action than most 'chick flicks' and really makes you think.  Its amazing the number of ties between the movie and basic theories of education.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|It's so good when you don't have a computer and its sadly the only Microsoft app that works for Kindle
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Now I don't have to wait to check this at home I can do it anywhere as long as I am getting a signal. Love it!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game is fun and keeps me coming back to see if I get something cool<br />And it is awesome
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great book with lots of history. It is hard to think about what some children went thru to just have a family to care for them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i liked this game it's kinda challenging and kinda isn't so yea but i think you should get this game.This was made by a 10 year old Elizabeth Okerns
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great games. Fun for hour's and hour's.  Would recommend to anybody<br />Level 10 in first few days. Yahoo. Would be a little better with more sound.
1465414444|5.0|I didn't discover Warcraft until the MMORPG (which I've played for years now), so a lot of the lore and history of the characters has been hard for me to follow.  This book does a great job of touching on most of the major characters and events in the game's history and the artwork is wonderful.<br /><br />This is definitely a book for those who truly love the games, so if you do, you won't be disappointed!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I love it, but I had a problem with it.  I just got done writing a WHOLE book on it.  I was deleting some really old documents, and I accidentally deleted my book.  And poof it was gone.  You can't retrieve it, you can't go into your history and get it.  A WHOLE book gone like that.  Other than that unfortunate mishap the app is great and you should get it.  Just don't write books on it.  Do that on pen and paper or on a lap top.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|JJ Abrams seems to be really good at starting things with fresh ideas and then losing control quickly.  Alias, Lost... it seems like he either moves on to other projects too soon (Star Wars anyone?) or just runs out of ideas.<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is a good movie if you ignore that it's a Star Trek movie.  Even with the reboot of the timeline (of which the original of the main villain in this movie would not have been part of), things in this movie make no sense.  I cut the first movie a lot of slack and enjoyed it for what it was.  This one I can't be as generous.<br /><br />Too many ridiculous plot points that make no sense.  Why would you gather all of the top officials of Starfleet into one room... with windows all around on an upper floor of an apparently unprotected airspace?  Futuristic flying car chase at the end of the movie?  Sure, why not?  Kirk should be kicked out of Starfleet but keeps getting promoted for gross incompetence?  We've got that too.<br /><br />I'm not a Trekkie/Trekker by any stretch of the imagination.  I liked the original series, watched most of some of the other series, and a little bit of the others.  But there was a heart and spirit to Star Trek that JJ Abrams has stripped away (even ignoring Roddenberry's socialist leanings)  He makes blockbusters... I get that.  But at least make it smart.<br /><br />An okay movie.
0307878937|2.0|Some people loved this book;  I found it too depressing for too long;  humor was needed to be weaved in to make the book for readable (listenable).
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|A lot of people were turned off by the second Iron Man movie, rightfully so.  Too much studio involvement, a silly villain, Mickey Rourke at his most over-the-top... all valid criticisms.<br /><br />This movie grounds it all again and starts fresh.  A seriously distraught Tony Stark has withdrawn from the world following his experiences in the Avengers movie, but of course the world won't leave him alone.  With an okay villain but lots of great action, this movie really shines.  For fans of the Mandarin from the comicbooks, yes you might not like what's done to the character in this movie.  But it makes sense in the bigger picture of the story and we get a very entertaining and weird performance from Ben Kingsley out of it.<br /><br />As critics have mentioned, though, the best part of the movie is when Tony doesn't have his armor on.  Then we get to see RDJr shine as the smarta$$ he does so well.  Tony Stark is much more interesting than Iron Man, and this movie allows him to take center stage.<br /><br />The ending is probably a little too &#34;Hollywood&#34; for my tastes, but it's fun, and I smiled for quite a while after the movie.  Very enjoyable!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't say enough about this game! I play it for hours on end. I get mad and have fun .It gets very challenging at times I will be stuck on same level for days but still love it.
B00FEN000S|4.0|Don't expect high art.  This is a fan-boy movie made by a fan-boy director.  Most of the action takes place at night or underwater, so it's darker than I'd like, but I'm guessing that was a design decision to cover up any problems with the CGI.<br /><br />This is a really fun movie.  Acting is solid enough, story is functional, and we finally get to see a big-budget giant robot movie that looks cool :-)<br /><br />Ron Perlman steals the show as usual, so keep an eye out for him.<br /><br />Sit back, get some popcorn, and enjoy it for what it is!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I loved the TV series, so decided to read the book. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />I was swept up into a different world, and loved all the characters, good and evil!
B0064W652A|5.0|Too many people seem to forget that Batman is a detective in the truest sense of the word.  This story really takes him back to his roots with some great supervillain appearances to spice it up but not overshadow the driving plot.  It probably helps if you're familiar with Batman's rogue's gallery, but anyone can enjoy the book for what it is.<br /><br />The artwork is solid and works with the storyline perfectly.  On a 10&#34; tablet, the images pop off the page, the colors are great, and reading it is a pleasure.<br /><br />I would consider this a must-own for avid Batman fans!
B00DURHYWC|4.0|Very pleased with this album but if this is your first foray into the world of Pink Martini, I'd recommend \\"Tomato\\" before this album.<br /><br />Really wonder sometimes why and how they pick some of their guest artists for example, I don't think Meow, Meow has a very good voice (I do like the song) and I just can't tollerate Je Ne T'aime Plus. I do like Wainwright's songs and of course, Ari Shapiro.  I'm also pleased with Storm's addition as an official member of the band; her sultry vocals are always welcome.  Timothy Nishimoto's song really rocks and I am tickled that Robert Taylor has finally recorded another PM song!  His voice is made for blusey jazz.  I actually wish the two of them recorded more songs singing lead with PM.<br /><br />Anyway, while some songs aren't quite as good as others, this is a must have album and I believe you will enjoy it.
B009CG96QM|4.0|I'm not a Tarantino fan-boy.  I think his movies lack heart and feeling.  Technically he's brilliant, but he's too in love with himself and his dialog to make something I enjoy.  Most of his movies seem too calculated, like he lives in his head and can't get past paying tribute to his influences.<br /><br />But &#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34; is not a typical Tarantino movie.  Many of the bad reviews are because of this fact.  If you think he's a flawless genius, you probably won't like this movie.<br /><br />But if you like great movies with depth and don't mind some flashes of the typical Tarantino movie, you will probably love this movie.  Even my wife, who hates Quentin with a passion, liked this movie.<br /><br />The cast is great.  Everyone fills their roles nicely, and of course it's impossible to over-praise Christoph Waltz' performance in this.  The opening of the movie in the farm house is one of the most chilling, nerve-wracking one ever put on film, and it's all because he can play evil in the guise of gentility so perfectly it makes your skin crawl.  And when he does lose that control later in the movie, you can truly see the true animal within.<br /><br />Don't be scared off my Tarantino's name if you don't like him or his movies... give this a chance.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|This is a unique zombie film so I gave it two stars, but it's not very good. It's not The Walking Dead.
B00DNNQNW0|5.0|She seems to have developed her music, but no matter what she does her albums are worth the purchase. I have everything she has done so far.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|You read this book and suddenly realize why so many businesses fail. After reading this book, you look at every business you patronize in a new light and sometimes you can even see where some of the problems are.
B00FAXLCWW|3.0|I've listened to this, thought it was kind of plain.  Nothing really unique or interesting to it. Really a bit disappointed with it.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|Live versions of many of his early studio recordings. If you are a fan of his early work, this is a must have album.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He does it again!  If you are a Stephen King fan, this book does not disappoint!  Danny, all grown up is just how I imagined he would be.  Who could be completely &#34;normal&#34; after the summer he had in that hotel? I ripped through this book, couldn't put it down.  Well done for this constant reader!
006202406X|1.0|I've loved divergent from the first time I picked it up. It was my favorite a Series. But now. I will NEVER be able to re read these books again and that breaks my heart. What Veronica Roth did to Tris pissed me off so bad. Caleb needs to die, not tris, what the crap was heroic about that? She's ruined her career. I will NEVER EVER read another book of hers again.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVENT READ ALLEGIANT!!! STOP! DO NOT READ ALLEGIANT! It will RUIN it for you! Just trust me! I came up with a better ending!<br /><br />Caleb sacrifices himself before Tris gets shot.<br />Caleb dies (like how it should have been) and tris and Tobias are together. They get married and have two children, Natalie and Uriah. They grow old together.<br /><br />NOBODY DIES see? That's how it SHOULD have ended. Not this sick and twisted way that it did. She's a terrible author and I will never EVER read another book of hers again
B000ID37KO|2.0|A lot of analysis of relationships and potential relationships... Relationships with mothers....Not enough Birds!  And every time the Birds come, the principals are suddenly struck with a need to go outside!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing the game. It's addictive but tons of fun.  So glad Amazon added this app. From old to young everyone enjoy playing candy crush.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The cast is very good from top to bottom.  The writers are great.<br />The guest actors are very well cast also.
0812550706|5.0|My high school freshman needed to read this book before the start of the school year.  He said he enjoyed reading it and is looking forward to the movie when it comes out next year.
B00377V6J2|5.0|For me, as a blues player,Albert King was always &#34;dad'.How many times I saw him during the sixties,he molded,styled, and inspired me to play better.A giant,an original man of true humility,and a string bender like no other.<br />Then there's Stevie………he took us by storm, and left us too soon.<br />They left us &#34;InSession&#34;,artistically,and actually.Dad and the torch passing moments on this record are amazing.Father and son, inspiring each other to reach deeper, to play the blues.<br />The dialogue between the two between takes,makes for intimacy,the playing is pure,up,positive.<br /><br />And, a DVD, to boot.See the men at work and play.<br />This is a must have,must listen to, gem.<br /><br />Chris Ehrlich
0446310786|5.0|I read this book as a teenager and I was pleased to know my son needed to read it as well.  Great book.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|This 2 disc set, is culled from 4 nights, the band played at one of the greatest acoustical venues in the world, The Royal Albert Hall.<br />Personally, the first time I attended at this magical place, was 1964, and yes, the acoustics were superb.<br />So, as to Cream,one of the earliest modern power trios we have, frankly they never sounded this good in the sixties.This is prime time, 3 journeymen,sober and at the peak of their awesome powers.This is what the Brits did to the blues, and why there is now, a white audience for it.Buddy Guy said of Eric Clapton,&#34;If it weren't for him,and his contemporaries,we'd still be playing to only black folks&#34;.<br />Starting with their re-worked version of Skip James's &#34;Im So Glad',through Willie Dixon's &#34;Spoonfull&#34;,Clapton lighting up &#34;Stormy Monday&#34;,An up tempo &#34;Rollin&#34; and Tumblin&#34;,Flanger propelled &#34;Badge&#34;, it just keeps coming.<br />This compiled set is no accident-for a 3 piece to work out carrying these tunes live, is masterclass stuff.<br />Play it loud………………enjoy-we may never have the chance to see them again.<br />Chris Ehrlich
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's addictive and so much fun. Just wish I could stop losing all my lives every level past the 12th one.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I think the first season captures the real essence of where the series was going.  Andy Whitfield unfortunately passed away during the filming of the prequel season -I personally liked his portrayal of Spartacus the best but regardless, great show!
B008JFUS28|5.0|I'd rate this movie 8.5-9 stars out of 10.<br /><br />Basic Plot - The 9 realms are getting ready to align which will allow heroes and villains to hop from realm to realm and it's up to Thor and company to prevent Malkeith the Dark Elf of olden times from taking (back) over the realms.<br /><br />I saw Thor this past weekend and it didn't disappoint. The battle scenes were original and they made great use of the environments. The movie had just the right amount of humor tossed in via both comical lines \\"Can I have my shoe back?\\") & comic character special powers (Loki's abilities allow for some funny scenes).<br /><br />The movie goers in the theater with me were laughing at the funny parts and oohing and ahhing during the battle sequences so you know the movie was hitting the right notes.<br /><br />As always with Marvel movies, there is a sneak peak clip in the credits so make sure you stay for that. Hopefully we will get to see those characters in an upcoming movie as I'm wondering when Thanos will make his appearance in a movie after his sneak peak debut.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I love this series, I own all three seasons and this, the &#34;prequel&#34; season. Excellent stuff but there's a ton of blood, gore and nudity so fyi...
1623360277|5.0|I thought I was eating a healthy vegetarian diet.  I see that it wasn't as good as it could be - and now I eat more and am more full and satisfied after meals.  There are even delicious dessert recipes so if I feel like something sweet, it isn't completely off limits.  The best thing is I've been losing about 1- 1.5 lbs a week and feel full and happy!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their health and diet!
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|So Carcass are cashing in on the revival and reunion thing going on in metal right now (I mean, Dark Angel just reunited!) -but this is not a phone it in album. This is Carcass a bit more mature and still in control. Is their early work, no. But it's a great step in the direction they need to go.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very fun.. I would recommend it to anyone. Have fun and go shoot some animals... just like the real life huntne...
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|An excellent book! I thought I'd find it a little too narrative but Christoph Fischer is a natural storyteller, telling the reader of a German family surviving through the war and beyond. This author should be in every bookshop! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, irrespective of any favourite genre.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a pretty cool game. Very addicting at times. Would recommend. Its kinda like bewel, but with candy. I  like how each level challenges you.
0399255370|5.0|Bought this for our 3 year-old but it's become a family favorite. The 10 year-old thinks it's funny and secretly enjoys it, especially the beaked crayon. The yellow crayon text could be easier to read, but overall the writing and imagery is brilliant, definitely an instant classic for many ages.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This happens to be my favourite novel by Jane Austen. It is wonderfully executed and her wit is sharp and pointed as she introduces the various characters and as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Anne Elliot the second daughter of foolish, spendthrift Sir Walter Elliot, was persuaded seven years earlier to renounce her engagement to penniless Frederick Wentworth, an aspiring naval officer. Now, Wentworth has returned from the war, extremely rich and as his sister and her husband Admiral Croft are about to rent the Elliot estate their paths will be once more cross. Can the mistake of seven years be reversed or has she lost him forever?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a TOTALLY ADDICTIVE and totally;<br /> Super FUN time people!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED this app and game for the FUN factor as well as the social media interaction factors!!!<br />I personally have a hard time putting this game down!  You also have the challenge of beating your friend's scores on Facebook!<br />Another excellent feature to test your mad gaming skills against! LOL<br /> NOW remember I'm in the Grannies age group (younger) and having a absolute ball people!<br />So hurry on in to the Amazon App Store and download a ton of FUN!!!!!  ; )  =- O.  ; )
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|You must get these game it is fun and I love playing it on hard mode but easy is too easy<br />Ghost out
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a book where I never stopped smiling & I'm glad to say this ONE is the first to do so! I was enthralled by it the moment I stepped through the door to the bookstore and couldn't put the book down until I was finished with it.....and, honestly, I didn't want it to end but just keep on going through the lives of all the interesting characters that Robin Sloan introduced us to! (If you haven't read \\"Alex Penumbra 1969\\" yet, do so Immediately!!)  I look forward to Sloan' s next project, whatever it is.....though, hopefully, it will be a continuation of the fantastic characters he delighted us with in and around the bookstore, Google, the dark streets of San Francisco, the Reading Room in New York City, and the denizens working on a project for ILM! Bring them on.....<br />I WANT MORE!!
B004VFN72S|5.0|Great Movie from beginning to end.i didn't know Harry Connick Jr. Could play such a Crazy, Demented Sociopath. Great Thriller!!
1476727651|2.0|I don't know if Stephen King has changed or I have but the last two books I tried to read are so boring.  I used to always read his stuff but I'm not wasting any more money on his books.
076115728X|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful book to spark creativity and role model problem solving & flexibility. We have given this out as our go to gift for children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can you escape is a fun game to play. it works well on the kindle fire. I have not come across any glitches at all.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Always enjoy Stephen King's books - short story - to the point.  Won't be disappointed per usual.  Keep em comin!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have mobility Free Cell, Spider, and Solitaire and wish there were more of the same caliber available!  Haven't found a Mobility solitaire game I don't love yet!
0307949486|5.0|better read than I expected, movie has nothing on the book, def a read I would recommend, shipped quick, thanks
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's free....haven't had any issues with it....it's fun....it's challenging....makes me wanna scream sometimes, but then I beat the level, and am very rewarded.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I watched the first episode because I was forced to. Turns out, I like it very much. The characters are interesting and the way it is filmed is engaging. So yes, I am going to watch the second season as well.
B00EVCD9HY|4.0|No great musical departures here. A solid and enjoyable evolution of her sound. Recommended to fans; if you didn't like her other work, you likely won't enjoy this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great vacation read!  Lots of twists and turns, but I was a little disappointed in the ending.
B004TI5N38|5.0|A good read.  I am fast learning to appreciate this author.  He keeps my attention, and wanting to read on.
B000FVE3A2|4.0|Good value at  $150 - 160.  Large watch.  Solid feel apart from bezel which was loose and made noises when pushed on lightly when I received it (fixed with dental floss - now feels quite solid).  NH35A movement is reliable, hackable.  Nice looking timepiece.
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|This year has been great for new music. So far I've discovered my 3 new favorite artists/bands: Lorde, Rubyrough and Chvrches. My favorite song on The Bones of What You Believe\\" was \\"Lies\\" - one of the first songs that the band released. I feel like their songwriting has grown to be more mechanical or less inspired as they progressed. Maybe that's because their success has grown so quickly that they didn't have as much time for inspiration. But they were so good to start with that that doesn't stop me from loving this album, despite a bit of decay on the originality factor. Sweet vocals, clean 80's inspired soundscapes and great production. Each song has its own catchy-factor and personality to fall in love with. Thanks Chvrches, for restoring my faith in the future of music!<br /><br />Looking for more inspired music releases this year? I suggest:<br />Pop perfection:<br />Lorde's radio-friendly single, Royals: [[ASIN:B00FAEQ22G Royals]]<br />Lorde's slow-burn album (learn to love it): [[ASIN:B00FAEPX9Y Pure Heroine]]<br /><br />Sinfully good synthpop:<br />Rubyrough's romantic, otherworldly pop: [[ASIN:B00C1YTPX6 Siren]]<br />Rubyrough's version of wild and crazy pop: [[ASIN:B00DD1ST92 Devil]]<br />Rubyrough's tribute to love and loss: [[ASIN:B00FYI5SJ6 Phantom]]
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|good album but I like the previous one more but still a good album altogether and so worth buying it.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|I've been discovering all sorts of great bands this year: Chvrches, Rubyrough, and now Lorde. She is definitely a talented girl - her song \\"Royals\\" is what caught my ear. Loved the songwriting and attitude on that, so I bought the album. It was a bit of a letdown. Not because it's not good, but because you have to hear it several times before you start to like it. I fell in love with the single the first time I heard it, but I had to \\"learn to love\\" the rest. I ended up being glad that I bought the whole thing because now I love it, but I'm not sure that others would feel the same way. So if you tend to be picky, maybe the single is the best bet for you. But if you want to support a talented new artist, I would buy it all and take the time to learn to love the rest.<br /><br />If you like innovative pop music with female vocals, I would suggest:<br />My favorite Chvrches single: [[ASIN:B00EJ2WFFS Lies]]<br />Chvrches new album: [[ASIN:B00F5PS5P2 The Bones of What You Believe (Special Edition) [Explicit]]]<br />Rubyrough's romantic synthpop ep: [[ASIN:B00C1YTPX6 Siren]]<br />Rubyrough's version of wild and crazy pop:[[ASIN:B00DD1ST92 Devil]]<br />Rubyrough's tribute to love and loss: [[ASIN:B00FYI5SJ6 Phantom]]
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I would recommend this book.  It's an eye-opener, and a deeply moving story.<br />Characters are believable, interesting, and lovable (for the most part!)
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Good product for the little Doc Who in the house.Just needed to Glue pin end on , Little kid understand.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had never heard of the orphan trains, yet there are people living within 30 miles of me who have family who arrived on them.<br />I loved this book - makes me grateful for my fairly normal childhood.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|Susan Boyle has honed her craft to perfection. She started with a fantastic, unique voice, and now she has complete mastery of it in all ranges, in transitions, and in shading a song to a specific style or mood. The backup and orchestration are not only beautiful, but imaginative. (Love the bagpipes in Little Drummer Boy.)<br />This is also an interesting collection of songs, between the sacred and the secular, and several I had not heard before. All tracks are worth being singles.<br />The duet with Elvis is well done and tasteful. The duet with Johnny Mathis is beautiful with a terrific blending of their voices-great duet partners.<br />Overall, this is a Christmas season album, but it is worth listening to anytime of year. It should be a staple for years to come.<br />Susan Boyle is now the professional singer she wanted to be, and is now right up there with the great singers of our time-not the screamers, not the lip-synchers,but the true singers of melody, style and feeling. Each song is sung a little differently, and each seems perfect in itself.<br />Treat yourself.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|another action movie that is a visual feast but leaves you wanting slightly more. loved the visual style of the movie
B008J05EL8|1.0|This app is useless, I mean literally &quot;USELESS.&quot; After I bought it, downloaded it and installed it, I tried to open it. It never opened at all.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|where can i start. to much gangster rap for movie based in the 20's just couldn't get in to and had to turn it off after less then an hour
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Sycamore Row was a good read but it had no action, no suspense, no love...I understand Seth had a rough childhood with a mean and hateful father but why did he grow up and be the same way and then on his death bed he made it right for Lettie and her family...What about his own kids...Who will make it right for them...They were raised by a man who showed no love or compassion and leaves them completely broke and alone with no good memories...The kids grew up and by rights deserve something from a father who didn't love them...He should of made it right by them too...He could of left them a letter, left them a few grand but no...He is feeling guilty over something his father did...I can understand how that would scar a kid but still...I don't understand how he could be so hateful to his own children...My kids are my life and no matter what kind of parents I had, I'd be better parent to my children...I didn't like Seth or his kids. Hershel and Ramona grew up to be adults who doesn't know the meaning of love and devotion but it's not their fault it is their father's fault, thankfully Judge Atlee agreed with me and they will get something if not their fathers love then some compensation...<br /><br />I'm a nobody who loves to read so my review is just that...mine...<br /><br />I did enjoy this book but it's still missing something, maybe it's the action or suspense, no one got killed or mugged or threatened with a beating...lol...To me it needed some kind of action...It's just not like the 1st few books by J.G. The Pelican Brief, The Jury etc...they were awesome books...But! I will keep reading J.G. in hopes he finds his way back to writing...I'm rooting for you! lol...
B007W8S2MG|5.0|considered one of the best games of all time and for the first time available in a handheld. vita wins again
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I like this game so far. Nothing to complain about. Maybe the stuff you have to pay pay for. Love the game.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|action was great in this movie and special effects were beautiful but then when it was over you realize that you have no idea what just happened
B0034E4JA6|5.0|Four Tet has been putting together some unusual and haunting melodies for some time, but willing to experiment with new sounds and work past the thumping bass notes that make much of this genre repetitive and derivative.  This works great as a casual listen or in the office; wouldn't listen during a work out or play time.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|The crisis of human character is beautifully exposed through this future fiction novel. I've read this so many times over the years and every time I read it I'm inspired to be more the person I want to be and less influenced by what's happening around me. Every person that has borrowed this book from me has loved it - young or old and any demographic. I'll always have a hard copy but l like to keep an e-version too. The whole trilogy is fantastic. Enders Game is my favourite.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie... Got my shipment before I thought I would get it and it was everything I could ask for and more!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This ap is very easy to use and I can quickly to find what I am looking for. I like the info it has available.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Great product nothing more to say... Love the movie... Love ion man 1 not 2 and love 3 the most!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is so stupid that it goes back into the funny zone again. It's a different kind of movie and some will probably not like it. Unlike many movies these days, the whole family can watch this one. With a budget of around $400,000 it managed to make $40,000,000. They did something right.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|love this movie Thanks We stop every time it comes on t v so we thought we should have it
B00CATSONE|4.0|This was a great introduction to the power of imagination. Tesla is used as an example of how genius may be more accessible than we think.
B00340ESIS|5.0|This book was everything I was looking for. Blake Snyder's personable and witty style made the journey through every step of the scriptwriting process fun and entertaining. As much as I learned - in-depth and detailed - I looked forward to getting back to the book because it was such a pleasure to read. More than any other book I've read, this one went down to the fine grain in how-to. I can't believe I stumbled upon it just by looking up a passing reference in an email. I can't rate this book highly enough.
B001AUEMFS|2.0|I bought it because of the tempo and my dislike for it. I mashed it up with the sound of a chimp screaming from the Lucasfilm sound libraries during a DJ set for about 16 measures. It was a lot of fun.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I think is wife and boyfriend need to be together and stop with that. I loved that the two were final going to be together until the car kill like everyone in the office. which puts him on the run and gone from the show. How will next season turn out????? I love that it keeps you sitting on the edge of the seat and glued to the tv.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I enjoyed the movie overall, though Leonardo DiCaprio's delivery was sometimes just annoying, and everything was so stylized that at times it was storybook-wonderful, and at times it was just ridiculous.
B009RX85N0|4.0|I like the fact that there is no bad language in this show. However, I could almost know everything that was going to happen for example almost all the main characterizes are related like family. I did enjoy watching it and could hardly want to get back to watching the show. I know the evil queen should be bad but I love her outfits..... great...looks great clothing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app! Soo happy it is on kindle fire now! Would recommend this app to all my friends/family...yay!! :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is one of my very favorite authors. I have read almost all of his books, and this one did not disappoint! The journey through books one and two of the Trilogy is exciting, informative, and not to be missed. I cannot wait for book three!
B00CBRADU2|5.0|It's a little slow getting started but well worth the wait. It is a movie you can sit down and watch over again.  It seems like there is always something new to see.
B005HSL626|4.0|Ok so THIS GAME IS AWSOME! 1 thing it sat there on my kindle while I played other games then I looked for  THEY DELETED IT OFF MY KINDLE!!!!.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Pretty cool game. Grabs ur attention and keeps you wanting to pay. Gave it 4 stars  because it's fun and cool.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So beautifully written it hurts, I don't think I could have gone without reading it. Thank you for this book, John Green.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I finally added this game. I have a love/hate relationship with it. Don't get sucked in to buying the extras, they really won't help. Frustrating when you run out of lives.<br />For the Kindle you will need the rapid charger, this uses battery power like crazy!<br />Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So I got this game not stopping playing it  I am never deleting it  love you mean it oh Jesus loves the world get a Bible app and look up John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not parish but have eternal life  Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no one goes thru the father except thru me
B0063GORYU|4.0|For a simple game it keeps me busy. It's pure mindless entertainment. I like it and I didn't buy it. Thank you Amazon.
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|Funeral was raw, bombastic and epic. Propelled with punk rock energy. This album is a very different and much lesser effort. The 'epic' quality remains, though. But this time it's achieved with electronica and slick production. The band I love can't be heard. So Reflektor is a 'funeral' of a different kind: the end of the unique rock AF had created full-blown. Reflektor, on the other hand, is full-blown pomposity.
B00EZPCYQ4|4.0|I received the package open. The box it arrived in was never sealed, the vinyl was literally just stuck in it and sent out. I was rather upset at that. I immediately checked the vinyl to make sure it wasn't damaged and it survived the trip intact. I was slightly disappointed at the actual packaging for the vinyl. Unlike the other casings that AFI has had, this box is unsealed printed cardstock-like paper. Other than that I'm happy with it. The discs play beautifully.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Reading this at night in bed while my husband is asleep and trying not to laugh out loud is so painful!<br />He had the same experience when it was his turn.<br />Mr. Sedaris is so funny!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Tartt's captivating and compelling story weaves destiny, choice and beauty into an enjoyable tapestry. It is the modern day Great Expectations.
B00C2C637I|4.0|I read this book many years ago and loved it at that time.  Since October was upon us and the story takes place during this time, I thought it would be a good to re-read this book by one of my favorite authors.  I still enjoyed it, but not as much, since it read like a Shakespearian tale.  Perhaps my taste in reading has changed, so I did not enjoy thistype of writing as I did in the past, yet I feel it is still worth reading.  Ray Bradbury was and always will be one of my favorite authors.  Space Grace.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I could not stop thinking about Plato and his allegory of the cave. Well done first story. Always looking for enjoyable new authors.
B00E8JZILA|2.0|same for this game ill need a label please.Ok this game not up to the hipeKInd regards-Joel Slepoff<br />Im Not in amores with this game.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|A very welcome addition to already extensive Dead Library.  After watching part of the DVD, it is apparent there was a very &#34;electric&#34; quality to the water provided, judging from the behavior of some of the attendees. I always get a laugh out of the &#34;which show is greatest&#34; discussions. It is a DEAD SHOW, not a DaVInci.  If this show makes you relax and forget about what ever stress you are experiencing, then Jerry and the Boys were successful.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|A very enjoyable busy game. Not too challenging, but the graphics are clean and the action addictive. I find myself coming back often.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|... he and Allan would have had a lot to talk about. Wonderful commentary on history and the human race. You'll laugh and you'll cringe, often at the same time. A very enjoyable read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought it the day it was released. I was hoping it would be a replacement for a miracast adapter (i thought it had the same functions). To my amusement, the product is very limited function wise. You cant mirror what your doing with your android phone nor tablet (I own the nexus 4 phone and the nexus 7 tablet). I gave it to my parents and they love watching netflix on their tv.
0312330537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It transports you to another world. What a life, filled with adventure and transformation! However, both of the men that I sent it to as a present just absolutely loved it. They both thought it was one of the greatest reads of their lives. So, if you are looking for a book for the men on your gift list, and they long for a true life adventure, then this book will be deeply satisfying to them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be available on my kindle.  I am so glad it finally is here .
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I wish it was more challenging. All you have to do is touch the screen to create an action ; whether you know what to do or not.  But I like  the concept; it keeps you thinking.
0767827902|1.0|I saw this movie years ago when it was first released in theaters.  Watched it again the other night on cable.  It still stinks.  Even though I am much older now and have experienced much more of life since I first saw it, my opinion of this dull, slow, stale film has not changed one bit.  Most of the acting is subpar, the script is atrocious, and the storyline is inconsistent.  A total dud.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Surprisingly very fun and addicting. I almost skipped over it because I thought it was just another silly kids game.
B0065GC0PG|4.0|I was so scared of this book. The blurb doesn't sound like anything I might like but the hype surrounding it is huge. And it had to be hyped for a reason, right? So I went for it, and I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />This is an enthralling, futuristic retelling of Cinderella with story about a girl part human, part machine. The synopsis really doesn't make the book justice because the \\"Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal\\" isn't really her choice but a choice that is made for her. And \\"she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world's future....\\" is more about what's to come in the second book. However, this is a truly fantastic book and I loved it.<br /><br />Cinder's a great character. She's so real and it's so easy to sympathize with her. And then the sympathy turns to blatant cheering. You go girl! She is tossed between a world of lies and the truth about who she really is and she has to deal with that among everything that's going on in her life. She devastated when the \\"good\\" sister catches the plague but she's the got-get-it kinda of girl and does whatever she can to save her. Despite her upbringing and harsh and unfair treatment by her family she's got strong a strong of right and wrong and does what she feels is right whatever anyone else may think.<br /><br />The secondary characters is so cute and sweet, well, the ones intended to be, and I love Iko. The android with a faulty personality chip who's working on her sarcasm. Peony is a breeze of fresh air too.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this a four star rating and not a whooping five star is because I felt the time frame is a little bit screwed. The book as it is is awesome but not quite finished. The's not enough \\"big\\" things going on in the book and in the end that actually gets resolved for me to be completely satisfied but it does make for one heck of a second book.<br /><br />I feel like I'm going to be a bit mainstream here but I truly recommend Cinderwith all my heart. If you, like me, is scared of the hype. Don't be, it is that good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy this game and feel it's addictive. I play it on my transportation ride to work and at lunchtime..
B003VS0CWO|5.0|This film has become a Halloween tradition for my family and is watched every year. The entire cast is great in this film but Tim Curry steals the show as Dr. Frank-N-Furter. If you have not seen this movie give it a chance and you may be thoroughly entertained.
B000FCJZ4K|5.0|A great insight into the world of a super connector. So many tips and lessons on how to be a connector.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The top handle has broken,  well, unraveled at the stich point. I don't carry a lot of weight in it either,  which is what surprised me. My main back pack hauls around 50 lbs, but this pack is lucky if it sees 15! This should not have happened only a month after receiving it, especially when I baby the heck out of it! I mean really!  It's got my dslr and lenses in it! I don't want to damage them,  so I'm super careful with this bag, and the handle goes out?!? Disappointed.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Loved it! If you're creative at all here is a definite perspective to consider. If you're open you could get a lot from it.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|I'm old enough that I heard the album as a 'current' recording just a few years after its debut.  To me, what is amazing is how after a few decades, it still sounds revolutionary and vibrant.  Also, every so often I find that I discover a new-to-me musical nuance that brings a smile to my face.  I'll never forget the first few times I heard this recording after my drum teacher loaned it to me back in 1972 or 73.  I remember being shocked -- in a good way -- at what I'd heard.  Well, even all these years later, it still can do bring revelations to my ears.<br /><br />I have several versions of this record, including some vinyl pressings from the early 1970's, a very high-quality Japanese pressing, and a few versions on CD and digital media.  To me, this vinyl pressing and the Japanese pressing (from the early 1980s, it cost me about $25 back then) are the best sounding ones.
0316227706|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my mom, and she loved it ! Of course I got her some nicer things also, which she appreciated, but this gift definitely held her attention. The photos are absolutely beautiful and the dogs featured all are characters in their own right; the photographer did an excellent job capturing each unique personality. Great coffee table book- would love to blow an image up and frame it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Enjoyed the season very much. Would recommend to my friends. The characters all complement each other. Good twists to the cases.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well written.  Moral dilemma.  Make s you question what you might do if this were your family and a like situation.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Like the first two seasons, the stories are original and keep you guessing. My husband and I try to solve the crimes before the end. Very enjoyable. Love the slap-stick between the characters. Very humorous!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've not had any issues at all and the set up and use has been easy. I like that you can build a play list of songs just for your alarms.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|This collection of poems is a recommendation for romantic nights or just plain wanting something to start up some foreplay before you get it in. The author is tremendously skilled as his craft and has what is known as descriptive prowess. You will feel tempted. Many of the poems are picturesque. In one piece, the author's great ability to storytell shines through. Another notable thing about this collection of poetry is the intensity of the poetry. If you are both a poetry and erotica enthusiast, this is the title to get. If you don't have this yet, stop hesitating and GET IT ASAP!
0743243153|4.0|Great Books - I really learned many things- this book helped transformed my life.  I enjoyed this book very much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing end to an amazing series. Twists and unexpected turns, relationships changed in ways I didn't  expect. Sad to see the series end but a great ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive! Fun! Challenging! Top notch! One of the best games to play. Love it! Five stars without a doubt. Graphics wonderful.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Cute little vampire physics game. Game play is fun, not to hard, can be addictive if you have that 'gotta collect them all' personality regarding level stars or in this case little skulls.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting! This is a good way to pass time when your bored, and I love all of the minions!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's awesome because it's minecraft and i have version 0.7.6 i recomend buying it it's awesome like i said. :)
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I hate the ending.  It seems too Titanic.  I'm one of those people who like happy endings, unrealistic as they may be.  But that is why I read, to escape, not to be depressed!
B00B6EJ28U|4.0|Arrived as promised Item was great, Vinyl was in perfect condition Album cover had the usual wear tear & fading. EXCEPT seller or distribution warehouse had placed a barcode sticker directly onto the back of album. IT COULD NOT BE REMOVED. Suggestion to seller/the warehouse: Either use barcode labels that are better quality (so permanent sticky residue and paper isn't left when removing) or  invest in a shrink wrapper and then place your barcodes over a plastic wrapper, that way you don't destroy the album cover itself. I'm sure this is probably an ongoing issue with anything paper or cardboard backed that these labels are placed on... sad that the cover was ruined because of it. Basically I would have rated as 5 stars if the barcode placed on the item wouldn't have devalued the item.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I too remember dan. What a surprise!  On several nights I read well until morning especially as the story unfolded as I expected.  On a side note, life is often imitated. On a recent road trip, I stopped in a Texas rest area and was confronted with a camper a
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan and I was not disappointed! I loved The Shining and was happy the story continued.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|For a light and fluffy romance novel, this one really fell short for me.  The writing was a little awkward (IMO), and the story just wasn't there.  I found the two main characters a little unbelievable, the supporting characters to be really annoying, and the storyline a little weird.  Waking up married after a night in Vegas, sure, but to stay married and have the guy try to convince the woman (who's a romantic sap) that they'll follow the rules of a marriage (fidelity, support, etc.) without the love and romance?  I don't know - support one another, socializing together, fidelity are all things important to a marriage.  The main guy, Connor, just wanted someone at his beck and call and who he could fornicate with whenever he chose.  At least that's how I read it - I guess I was just confused.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|It was very fun and that is what I want from a movie.  Special affects were great, reminded me of the old Godzilla movies or what the newest Godzilla could have been.
1444710338|5.0|It was a great buy for me and I did enjoy the read as well as the fast customer service.  The shipment came before I even had a chance to wonder where it was.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it, it's been the best game I've played so far!!  If you haven't tryed it now is the time, because everyone is playing it.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Service was wonderful and so is the movie, I have always loved Cary Grant and this one makes me laugh out load.  I would buy from this person again.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I reviewed this book by giving a 5 stars . This was a great sequel .I would recommend this book to any one . This book Had me at the edge of my seat but the book Had its moments that will make you really think about it and than it had its moment where you're going be like awww . The best part is the ending more emotion ,heartbreak s and love .
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The higher the level you are the more difficult play becomes. The graphics are pretty cool too. Money, or lack thereof has not been a problem so far. Level 7 currently.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is a wonderful surprise. My wife recommended it to me and once I started reading I couldn't put it down. I advise anyone who enjoys reading to jump into this. If we could give more than five stars this book deserves them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story line , the setting , the history... just the whole epic feel of it is great! The personalities of the charectors  just make it easy to slip into the plot and go with it.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I love this album, I have not been a korn fan since issues, I kinda just fell off with korn. I got into a bunch of new music and kinda forgot about these dudes. This album helped me re-discover korn again. It's not korn from 94,97, not even 05 etc., but it's good! Great Hard rock! Give this album a chance! The dvd is amazing too! I still miss David in the band, but Ray is a good dude too. PICK this up now!!!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My  book club read this book. Most of us enjoyed it, but also had various complaints. But overall, a well-written, interesting read.

B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting I learned about a period in the time of country that I didn't know about.  I thought it was well written and the stories about the characters held my interest.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app love it more than this other app that I bought which cost money and this one was free<br />I highly recommend this app

0316044938|5.0|One word. Phenomenal. I could not put this book for a second, the suspenseful moments made me have the chills every time I turned the page. This novel should be read by every single person in our whole entire world, that is just how much I loved it and admired Alice Sebold's enticing writing. After reading this novel, I have such a new perspective on life and feel so attached and connected to the main character and narrator Susie Salmon. This heart wrenching yet compelling novel describes the life of a 14 year old girl in Pennsylvania who was murdered by her neighbor Mr. Harvey. Throughout the novel she discovers herself and connects with her family and friends in a way she never felt when she was alive. Readers will find themselves drawn in to the emotional and deep traits of Susie Salmon to the point where they will feel themselves and her as one. I would absolutely rate this book five stars because of its ongoing suspense and the significant symbols that it holds within the words of each and every sentence that makes me anticipate more and more of Alice Sebold's thought-provoking sentences. I must admit at first I was unsure if I wanted to read it or not because I saw the movie and I attempted to steer away from the murder but I learned that there is much more to this novel then just Susie Salmon dying. I would recommend this novel to many teenagers and adults as well. I admired the usage of profound morals that caught my attention that made me think of the deeper meaning behind the words. This engaging novel was both entertaining and captivating that depicts the balance between Earth and heaven and the connections that humans are capable of revealing. I also noticed how this novel relates to our recent subject of a coming-of-age story and the development that the narrator experiences throughout the novel that many readers will become familiar with. It is a moving roller coaster ride with such powerful characters and the glorious wonders of the ever so unknown heaven.<br /><br />By: Olivia R.

B009WUBERW|1.0|Bad dialogue, bad plot, bad acting, holes in the story line, ... one of the worst movies I've seen. Not worth a dime.
1885167776|3.0|This was an average, but quick read.  It did help me to ask myself the question though.  Not a waste of money or time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A lot of reaearch info about the historical Jesus and his times. &#34;The story of the zealous Galilean peasant and Jewish nationalist, who donned the mantle of messiah and launched a foolhardy rebellion against the corrupt Temple priesthood and the vicious Roman occupation, comes to an abrupt end...at the first moment one of his followers dares suggest he is God.&#34;<br />The author discusses the many implausibilities in the New Testament and the reasons they were made. The politics of the people of that time and their cruelty, lying, adjustment of facts to suit, etc., as discussed by the author rings with similarities of present day politics, and the lunatics on the far right and far left. The author is a former Muslin who converted to Christianity. I don't know why he doesn't just give up on religion altogether as ridiculous.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|great famIly movie for halloween perfect for all ages not scarey for younger children but fun for halloween good for boys too
1451666179|5.0|This book is awesome. I've been a huge fan of her blog for a long time, and this book is awesome! It's hilarious, honest, and so great. The illustrations are great, print quality is great, and its everything I hoped it would be!! Super happy :)
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Good simulation fun with good physics, plenty of replayability, similar to Kerbal space mission but in 2 dimensions, though touchscreen makes control easier.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I love the first 2 books in this s err use but I was completely disappointed in this book. I will not be able to reread any of these books now!  If you<br /> Are a fan of th  books n  you haven't read it I won't then at least you have the memory of the amazing first 2. Sorry to disappoint you but I wish someone would have told me.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Mr. Martin has thoroughly captured my heart again. Without giving much away, he has also captured the reader's obsessive need to purchase the next book by leaving a desperate plea of, \\"what happens next?!\\" on our lips!
0375842209|3.0|Dark and occasionally morbid, this portrayal of a child's life through Death's perspective is a very troubling aspect of children's literature today.
B0002I831S|5.0|I think we all know what the original Star Trek TV Series is and what it is about. I find these old episodes cheesy and delightful. For myself they bring back the nostalgia of a time long gone and of me and my dad watching reruns together. He was so excited when I got this for him for Christmas and makes it easier for him to share his love of the series with his grandchildren.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|If you've seen it, you know why it gets at least 4 stars. :) It's a good show with great acting and quality costumes and scenery.
1451666179|5.0|She manages to express an astounding amount of emotion on the faces of awesome/creepy stick figures and adorably demented animals. Some of the book has already been posted on her website, but there is new content, too. And it is nice to read the comics in a book.
1451666179|5.0|One would assume that sliced bread set a precedent for things that are sublime beyond imagination. This book should be the precedent; instead of saying \\"____ is the best thing since sliced bread,\\" people should be saying, \\"____ is the best thing since Hyperbole and a Half!\\" But I contradict myself, for how could anything be as good as this book? I guess the only appropriate way to fill in that blank would be \\"Allie Brosh's second book is the best thing since Hyperbole and a Half!\\" (There'd better be another book.)<br />Tl;dr: by the transitive property, anyone who doesn't like this book also doesn't like sliced bread. So I guess that's pretty much it. (Also, people who don't like sliced bread are probably not real human beings.) Buy this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|STOLE MY HEART!!<br /><br />“Is it possible for two abuse survivors to have a functional romantic relationship?” I guess that’s what has captured me! I am interested in Gideon and Eva. Sequels usually have A LOT to live up to – but this story is SO MUCH BETTER than the first book. I just could NOT put it down. The intensity of Gideon and Eva’s romance is so hot and filled with so much drama – it’s difficult to walk away from them. Finally, we are provided a deeper explanation into both characters’ backgrounds and why their love is so intense. I did not feel this story was as aligned to the Fifty Shades series like so many claimed the first book was. This series turned a major corner with this installment and the entire story heads in a different direction than how I predicted. Gideon and Eva have an addictive relationship – and now I’m addicted to their story!! The characters drive me simply crazy, but I think their relationship is incredibly unique. Ms. Day has given us a very sexy love story with a little bit of a mystery. Can I say it again?? I love Carey – please, Ms. Day, please MORE!!! The end of this story is PHENOMINAL and quite frankly – blew my mind! Get it. Read it. And then read it again. Holy Cow – OUTSTANDING!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|What a great series.  I'm a huge fan.  Good writing, good character development, and the suspense is really gripping.  I highly recommend the series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What's not to like? Best show ever and nice that it's available so quickly here. I don't have cable, so this is a blessing.

B0052REUW0|3.0|This was an interesting read.  He makes a compelling argument.  That said, he uses a lot of little slogans to make his points, which is a little tiring.
B0053TMP24|5.0|When I read the first book I was a little skeptic about a follow up series to the Percy Jackson series with new characters, but I was wrong... In the this book Percy returned and the storyline with him was great and I also love those new Roman half-bloods (Frank and Percy) which created an even better series storyline the first. I have nothing bad to say about this book and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure humor, drama and fantasy!
B009GEEMLY|3.0|There isn't a lot of depth here, but the movie is OK if you are just looking for some entertainment.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Ever wonder what happened to the boy from The Shining after the end? Here is the answer to that question. Follow along through his adult life and childhood flashbacks with supernatural heroics and miserable self destructive lows. Didn't want to put it down until the end.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|I found the first half of the book very informative. The second half was less so, but still had good points to make

B008EOVHXI|5.0|I was introduced to Valentina Lisitsa through YouTube.  Fell in love with her command and her control of the keyboard.  This recording is fantastic.  The selection of music is great.  Het ability to achieve color and the deepest expression is one of Valentina's gifts.  I know everyone will enjoy this album.

0385350864|1.0|There should have been a book between this and the last Bridget Jones.  This was a shocker!  Mark died?!?!?!  she's in her 50s/?!?!??!  With little kids?!??!?!??  She had a kid at age 47?!?!?!?!  Why did they wait so long to have kids?????  New flash for Fielding:  No way is Renee Zellweger filming this one!!!  Plus Bridget still sounds like a 30-something singleton - daffy and ditzy.  What's up??????  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this book!!  Thank God I got it at the library and didn't have to pay for it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, I bought it because I will buy any book Stephen King writes but it is different from anything he has written before.  If you like Stephen King books read this one, it is just as beautifully written.  If you like books with a bit of a love story (I don't so don't worry it isn't over done) you will love this book.  If you love a well written story that keeps you needing to read until the next page over and over again, this is the book for you.  I haven't told you anything about the story on purpose because even though I finished it a couple weeks ago I can't get the characters out of my mind.  They become your friends and family, you care about them and what happens to them.  This is the type of book you not only don't want to put down, you don't want it to end.  Only one other book has effected me like this one and I read that one 42 years ago.  If I haven't convinced you to read this book yet I am really sorry because I know this is a great book and you should read it, I hope you do.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is awesome! Jillian uses a 3-2-1 approach with strength, cardio and abs  this DVD has 3 sets of workouts, levels 1,2 and 3. 1 is for beginners but will give someone who works out fairly regularly a run for their money. This is a tough workout- but it's quick! This is a DVD everyone has time for, as it only takes 20 minutes and the only equipment needed is a mat (for us hard-floor folk) and some hand weights. It offers modified versions of exercises in each level too.<br />Jillian provides the motivation we've come to expect while focusing on good form. If you follow a good diet and do this DVD like you should, you WILL see results!<br />Cons:<br />I wish I could fast forward through the very beginning talk. It's not that big of a deal, but if she ever decided to re-release it, that should be addressed =p
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Easy to read. For young to adults readers. Not as graphic or gruesome as I was first expecting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The visual and sound effects looks so real. My children love the game. Keeps them completely busy. Creating the different minions is very cute
B001LOPYHI|5.0|One of my all time favorite Sci Fi movies.  IMO, some of the best came out of the 70s, and this is easily top 5.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Sort of a quiet horror film, this succeeds where many horror films fail.  There is a really good story line!  Just everyday people with everyday problems that happen to end up in a really creepy situation.  For me, this is a very satisfying film. You know something is off kilter but it takes awhile and a step by step creepy build-up to reach the spooky climax.  I wish more horror film directors,producers and screenwriters would take a lesson from this well done, engaging horror film.  You don't need slasher moves or frantic action to put together a good horror story.  If you are a horror film buff, don't miss this one.  It's not in your face horror, but definitely time well spent!
0385523394|4.0|It took a lot of courage for Piper to write this book.  I was compelled to read it after watching the Netflix series.  The series is way more edgy than the book.  The real Piper had a lot less conflict and made fewer mistakes than her Netflix heroine.  However, the book has accomplished her goal - I feel moved to help the women in prison for minor offenses and to push for change in the War on Drugs and its consequences.
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|All books from Gary Renard are a must - read for me and this one does not disappoint. Arten and Pursah are back!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game to play.  And  very addicting .  I originally downloaded because a friend needed extra lives and help.  But then I got addicted. Well gotta run and play some more.  :)
0385474547|4.0|\\"Things Fall Apart\\" by Chiuna Achebe was a very good book.  I enjoyed the native approach.  I am not done with the book yet, but it has a very interesting plot.  I like reading about the traditions in the book, and it has taken an unexpected turn.  I can't wait until I have finished the book, because I am sure I will read it again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|let us play the game. once we pay 99 cent carry those lives on and on. its rip off to call it free
B00FWPWNKS|1.0|This game has locked up twice on me. Had to delete game an downloaded game again to have it lock up again.
B00FN811SY|5.0|It is easy to navigate through with ease.  Love it.  Will recommend to my friends and neighbors.  Love it love it love it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a fascinating man who lived an extra ordinary life.  Mr. Isaacson obviously spent many hours researching this book and presented it to us in compelling manner.
1449305172|5.0|Fantastic book that gives you a very practical proven methodology to better encompass your business assumptions, spot what your potential customers want and build the right product in the most efficient and cost effective manner. It is exhilarating, empowering and significantly increases your odds of success. A must.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|And he did not so in Split Second. Baldacci's style is always consistent and you are assured of a great read with this one.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|What makes watching movies like this via Amazon is that you select the movie from home and watch the heck out of it for 24 hours. I watched this movie using captions because it is hard to hear what the characters are saying. Its those catchy dialogues that if missed, will lose you for the entire movie.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|Robert McNamara open our eyes to the evil of war. Great perspective of a dark era in American history. Watch it.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I am glad I saw this movie via Amazon. The plot was great and the movie took you on a ride of what actually happened.  Nothing as it seemed. I will leave it at that.
B00EZ50SGW|5.0|Between the original excorsist and the first insidious its difficult to choose my opinion of the scariest movie ever made. Insisious chapter 2 was just as scary if not scarier than the original. Patrick Wilson is truly starting to become a horror movie icon thanks to insidious and the conjuring. Im looking forward to insisious becoming a trilogy!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Big Bang Theory.  I'm still catching up with previous years and probably saw much of the sixth season on TV, but  even episodes previously seen are fun to watch again.  You catch lines and expressions you missed the first time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A great book about Nazi Germany given from the German side, narrated by death. This book will keep you reading.
B00C8RG2NC|5.0|This movie may have started out slow, but it was so well played out that you could feel the pain of the dog's loss for his master.  I would recommend to my friends and will allow my child to watch.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|What an ending!!  All the threads of the pattern were woven into the tapestry.  Most I anticipated or at least did not surprise me.  There was one complete and delightful surprise and I will not spoil it for you. I did have to be careful when I decided to read.  My heart would start pounding and my hands would start to tremble.  That has never happened before.  Could not read it at night or I had trouble going to sleep.  The most I could read was about a chapter at a time.  Once I started the book I would dream about endings while I slept until I finished.  Amazing!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game, no technical issues ever. I do not buy coins but enjoy nonetheless. Great when waiting in line or at doctors office.
B00F9040HU|2.0|I've been waiting for the full version of this game on Android quite a while and its still not available but they say 'soon'.  I had played the one hour demo at Big Fish Games/Playrix (Developers) on my PC and it's super!<br /><br />This 'free' Android game has zip (nothing) compared to the PC game.  I have played other full and free demo Android games developed by Playrix on Amazon (Around the World in 80 Days, Call of Atlantis) and the Android demo had enough to get to know how the game is played, enough info to know if you want the game or not. This Android game, Atlantis Quest seems to play only the first board, which gives little to nothing about all that is available to play.  Hopefully the Atlantis Quest will come at a good price like Around the World in 80 days-great deal here at Amazon for $.99 cents!) (but not $5 that they request for the Fishdom games).<br /><br />Hopefully the full version of the android game Atlantis Quest is as great as they created of the Call of Atlantis and Around the World in 80 days from the PC game.  But I don't think this demo of Atlantis Quest is worth anything! Try on PC from here at Amazon ( [[ASIN:B001L5TIBK Playrix 517 Atlantis Quest Download]] )or search for it on this site if link does not work.  Amazon has a one hour trial. (As well as other game sites that sell this game, Big Fish Games and Playrix).
B004LQJPEG|4.0|make fantastic movies . Action that makes you jump out of your seat and wanting more! The French Connection 2 is not worth your dime...stick with the classic, you will not be disappointed!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Many films get the Mature rating, but this one lives up to it. Hyperviolent, it also explores the consequences of that violence, however briefly. It's also a pinnacle of female representation in action movies. Both the sidekick and villain happen to be female. Neither mysteriously lose their clothes or their wits around the gruff male lead. The effects are gorgeous for the budget. You can shut down your brain and watch the one-liners and explosions, but if you don't you'll won't be losing IQ.
0810970686|2.0|I am upset because some pages were folded and were writ on<br />I'm upset because despite the fact that the seller said that the book is new, but the sheets of book were wrinkled  and scribbled in pencil.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is an awesome game! It's just like in real life, but doing it all on a video game.This is a really fun game!!!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It is a wonderful series.  Enjoyed it so much.  Watching the series currently on show time  worth your time well done
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|I pre-ordered this book for the very first time as I could not wait to meet Jake Brigance again. From the first page I was riveted and devoured it in a day. I'm just sorry that I finished it so quickly and have no idea how long it will be before Grisham publishes another book.<br /><br />The plot was intriguing from the outset and while it was clear there was something behind the ominous message in the written will, the genius unveiling of each character kept me riveted to learn the real truth behind the will. John Grisham is one of my favorite all-time authors and his novels never fail to entertain and keep me enthralled. This may be considered one of his best in my view and it was not easy to follow up on a story like A Time To Kill. Jake Brigance is as endearing as ever, a character so realistically portrayed with flaws, fears and a touch of heroism.<br /><br />My favorite characters have to be Lucien and Harry. Grisham is a master at creating fallible characters that are loveable, charming and endearing. They are caricatures of alcoholic burn outs but so brilliantly minded, genuine and kind-hearted that it serves the protagonist to have these clowns on his side.<br /><br />I just hope Grisham will take us to Clanton Mississippi again in a third novel. His portrayal of the deep south is so tangible and real I can feel the humidity, smell the barbeque and the lingering taint of racial divide. My request is for Mr Grisham to show us a deeper side of Clara as her character in both novels so far have been rather shallow. She would make for a compelling character rival to Lucien, Harry or Jake for that matter.<br /><br />If there is talk about a movie, I really hope Matthew McConaughey will sign up as his face and southern twang is forever associated with Jake Brigance in my mind.
1451626096|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of Tudor History, and consider myself pretty knowledgeable about such things. I really wanted to enjoy this book, but from the very beginning it was clear to me that this may as well have been written by someone from the Richard III society. They want everyone to believe that Richard III was this great guy, w/o a hunchback, and everything bad we think about him is all because of Tudor Propaganda. News flash: They found Richard's skeleton, and GASP... he actually DID have a hunchback!! Ha. Anyways, Richard III in real life was not a great guy. He was known to be an efficient hitman, basically. Whenever the Yorks wanted someone out of the way, they called in Richard and he did the deed. Or saw that it got done.<br />Richard killed his 2 nephews, the princes in the tower. To say that Henry did makes absolutely NO sense. The princes were LONG since dead by the time Henry VII took the throne. This book is ridiculous in the lengths it will go to in order to make the Tudors the \\"bad guys\\" in this story. Making it like it was a happy love affair between Elisabeth and Richard... um, he was her uncle. YUCK! And he was, um, Married. Plus, he was HOW Much older than her? Oh and did I mention, he was her UNCLE??! Gross city. Seriously. Elisabeth didn't have feelings for Richard. It was considered that he might marry her, but dynastic marriages were made all the time back then, and she would have married him simply because it was her duty to do so. Not because she was madly in love with him.<br />Henry VII wasn't a warm, cuddly guy, and not a lot of people liked him by the end of his reign. But to say he was a murderer, a rapist, that is completely wrong. Henry VIII, that's a different subject indeed, and this book doesn't delve too deeply into that. Despite his faults, I love Henry VIII and I think he was a great king. I digress. If you don't know anything about Tudor history, don't read this book. It will taint your mind with LIES.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was an awesome read! Kind of scary how life can be controlled by the little details, good and bad!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|garbage book, not worth the paper it is written on, no story line, mind numbing dull, give me a refund please
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like this app. It gives me hours of fun. It has lots of different animals and you can progress fairly easy.
B009LDD54K|5.0|smooth transaction and the product was as described. Would deal with again. Smooth transaction and just as expected it was all well done
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game and have wanted it on my kindle for months.  So annoying having to be forced to side load it.  I am happy to support Amazon and love my Kindle Fire but so many apps are so slow to come.  But, thank you for finally bringing this game to us!
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|I caught this on Netflix this week as I was trying to find something I hadn't seen before.  Unfortunately, it's pretty much by-the-numbers as far as these type of movies go.  Aaron Eckhart is pretty good in the lead role, the girl that plays his daughter is good too.  Other than that...  Olga Kurylenko's character could've been played by any B-List actress and the role would not have suffered.  The \\"bad guys\\" really aren't that menacing or compelling, and really are just cookie cutter bad guys with cookie cutter motivations.  It's short, only about 90 minutes, and has a quick pace so it does hold your interest well enough.  My biggest problem is at the end, when you think back to all the people involved and all the things they did, it's hard to imagine those people making some of the decisions and mistakes they made.<br /><br />All in all, it's a movie you won't really regret watching, but you won't be calling your friends to talk about it either.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to every man and women. It's definitely going to be one of my favourites!## I can't hardly wait to read the next in line.  I have nothing to dislike about this book or the author!  I'm addicted to Cassandra' s writing style!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best. I love it. Cool. Best game ever. It good for $6.99 because you can do inethin.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a great movie. Glad I purchased it. Def a tear jerker. But in all, this movie was well worth more than the 5 bucks I paid for it. And it's based on a true story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game,  It takes alot of concentration, but that is what I like. Just wish it had a few more lives.  I am totally hooked on this game.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I have been wanting to see a really good horror movie that does not depend on blood and guts to elicit fear but has a good story line that is creepy but believable.  THIS IS IT!!!!!!  Good story, good acting, good effects, good pace.<br />We remember seeing the Warrens on talk shows when we were kids!!! Wow!!!
B009ZM74F8|4.0|The story we have all seen and heard a thousand times.  Good guy working for bad government.<br /><br />Christian Bale is lifeless at the beginning but begins to develop feelings, overall pretty cool movie.
B00005N6KG|1.0|The connecting wires are poor quality, breaks too quickly and makes headphone useless<br /><br />And the funny thing is I bought these for $9.99 back in April, now $49.99 - hahaha, really what a joke
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun. Free to download and play. I have had it one week and absolutely love it. Everything looks good when you play.  The sound isn't annoying. And it gives notifications on my kindle. Great app.
B00EU98VVC|5.0|love these guys. the music is headbangin and the singer is different. hes not screaming but its kind of like hes talking but it fits. love this album and plan on getting more from them
B00867HDTA|4.0|Repetitive.  But it keeps the kids busy and me occupied when waiting around.  I would download again if I needed a time killer.
B00CXL6XP0|3.0|I loved these guys before and during operation mindcrime. but after that its like something happened and they mellowed out big time. I still like to listen to them but apparently nothing from these guys will ever beat operation mindcrime
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Great information that will help me tremendously when I am ready to start writing my book.  Thank you Amazon for this great piece of information.
B00FWPWNKS|3.0|It's a great game, but it needs more boards to play. I liked playing this game. I love playing match 3 games. This game needs more boards to play to enjoy more of it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|you can do a lot of thinks with this app it really fun and cool when you get it will be dumb but just deep using it and you will learn how to us it and it will be way cooler
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Every night I had the hardest time putting it down. So much better than the movie, but then again most books are. I love how it went more into detail months parents background. It really gave you a feel for the fathers sternness and the mother lack of voices opinion. This book moved me plain and simple.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I had heard so many great things about this app, and how it was so useful. It's not always useful but sometimes it is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush help me relax. I just love it.<br />You go candy crush you are the bang.<br />Thank you for making this game.
B008IJTFYW|2.0|Looking for some MUCH needed sleep, I tried this free app. I loved that you could mix sounds and create exactly what you think might be best for you. So I set it up and put it on my night stand and off to sleep I went...quicker than any other night! YAY! But then, after maybe an hour or so of running...IT QUIT!!! Is now prompting me to upgrade to the $2.99 version!!! Why wasn't it made clear that the FREE version was only a sample and NOT a working app!??? grrrrrr
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This movie had me screaming and hiding, gave me nightmares, freaked me out. I am a zombie-freak and this one pushed it over the top in a good way. Am also reading the book and am anxious to see how they correlate.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|works well for travel and convinent for hotel web browse . lights up well in the dark. and very User friendly
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Ok, so it's got murder, attempted murder and some mildly explicit sex. But basically it is about three women getting in touch with  their feelings. The women do not even interact that much with one another. The men are basically card board figures. Not much there.<br /><br />Strangely the only person that sees a shrink, is the most macho guy in the book.<br /><br />The book's climax and the epilog, that others seemed to find fulfilling left me cold.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It really makes you think of how you live your life. Sometimes you got to live it for other people to enjoy their very own lives.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I played this game on a road trip in an RV for 6 days. I'd say we averaged three or four hours of playing time per day. It kept three to five  entertained and laughing at our own cleverness the entire time.<br /><br />This is a game of strategy and requires a bit of thinking. We added to the fun by letting the winner of three rounds create a new rule. Great fun!
0443069522|5.0|I chose 5 stars  because it met my expectations, i bought the book and simply i got it no complications at all.<br /><br />Thank you amazon.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This is a hella funny movie.  The &#34;thunder song&#34; literally had me laughing so hard that I thought I was going to pass out because I could not breathe.  I backed up and watched that scene like 10 times.  The very end was almost that funny too.  Plus it has Mila Kunis in it, so...  yeah, you get to look at her for a couple of hours and that is pretty awesome.  It pretty much like watching Family Guy and has a lot of FG references in it too.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I enjoy the realistic element the game brings to life... and death  I would recommend this app to Barack Obama but I don't know the guy :-b
B001992NUQ|5.0|I would tell you about it, but the first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club.  I have said too much already.<br /><br />This Blue Ray edition has the best. menu. ever.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great movie...action packed and captures your attention throughout the entire movie. Can't wait to see if they make a part two.
B0097K21YW|5.0|I got this as the Free app of the day, It was well worth the download. It is an addicting game that is very fun to play. I would even pay the 0.00$ for it!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|After I passed 60 I decided that I should exercise my brain as much or more than my body. I work a lot of puzzles and logic games and this game has it all. It takes speed, memory management, and old fashioned reasoning to work the exercises. They can be intense since some are very difficult. Don't give up in frustration. It is not like a game that you start and finish. It is a process that makes your brain cells work faster and harder than usual. Visit the game a few minutes a day to help keep dementia away.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I really like this series. My wife and I have read all of them. They are very good reads and have a lot of entertaining parts in each book. We both love this author and this series. I would give this book a read!
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|Once upon a time DT was a progressive force in music. New and interesting ideas, impressive musicianship and memorable songs that made you feel something. Not so much anymore....<br /><br />This release has nothing new to offer fans who have been with them since the beginning.  And even the good parts here do not make this a worthwhile purchase.  Instead, this CD includes many of DT's previous, and now very familiar musical themes, styles, and signature riffs repackaged into new songs that fade from memory very quickly. The songs simply do not rise to the greatness of former material. Nothing here grabbed me and said, man these guys are really onto something here.  And while there are short snippets of cool riffs and parts throughout, which is typical of DT, there is nothing cohesive and consistently memorable enough that registers as a great song.<br /><br />Astoundingly, the recording / audio is disappointing too, as others have pointed out.  The drums are a HUGE disappointment.  How could they sound so drowned out and inconsequential to the mix on so much of this release?  The drums are BURIED and dead sounding in much of the material.  I thing Mangini is a terrific drummer, but I think he overplays on some of the material.  More hits, faster, why??  Because I can.<br /><br />And Myung....does he still play bass for this band? There are a few places where you can hear him but for the most part this is the exception.<br /><br />With Jordan, why on earth did you insert that orchestral \\"diversion\\" into Illumination Theory at about 9 minutes in?  That part has NOTHING to do with the song and is SO out of place -- it clearly does not belong.  And the ELP-like keyboard sound in the solo to Along for the Ride is really NOT so cool.<br /><br />If I was a musical consultant to the band, I would say that you (DT) are throwing everything on the wall to see what will stick, reusing former ideas too much, and playing it safe.  You are placing too much of the focus on your technical abilities as a band and as individual players to achieve anything meaningful.  Your ballads are sappy and a bit cringe-worthy, and some lyrics are hokey -- you should hire an editor, or get somebody to review and comment on them, someone you can trust to be upfront with you. And audio quality needs to be improved.<br /><br />Someone who has never heard this band before will recognize the undeniable technical abilities of these guys.  Long-time fans like me wished and hoped for more.....
006202406X|2.0|Disappointing ending to an otherwise great story - it's like the author totally lost interest but had to finish the series anyway.......ugh.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books. It is truly inspirational in his account of how he dealt with being interred in a Nazi prison. Truly, life is pretty much what we decide to make of it--even in dire circumstances.

1440503257|4.0|The recipes are interesting enough if you are a Harry Potter fan. However if you are in an Asian country, (I'm from Singapore) the ingredients may be a little difficult to find. Most recipes are not that easy especially for amateurs who just started cooking. But all in all, it is an interesting find and I'm dying to try all the recipes in the book!

B0042TV4IW|4.0|I've just recently started enjoying my Amazon Prime membership by watching a few TV shows. The first I watched was Downton Abbey. When I finished it, I started Lark Rise to Candleford, as it was recommended by a friend. It's refreshingly different. The characters begin to feel like family. I'm on to Season 2 now and will hate to see it come to an end.
B00G32OER4|2.0|Every move made by the characters and every scare tactic utilized was predictable. So much so that it lost all its creepy vibe. From spooky closets and basements to terrible creature design, it follows the low-budget paranormal movie typecast to a T.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Some things are worth the wait! Stephen King stands & delivers on this sequel to the classic &#34; The Shinning&#34; (& I mean the book NOT the movie) I read the other reviews prior to reading it & was surprised by the number of negative ones. Especially those complaining about some of the dark subject matter....seriously? It's SKville....if u want sunshine & light you might not want to stop here....but if you want a good scare....this is the place for you!!
0143124838|1.0|Wow! What a mess and a huge mistake by me (and Alexa).<br />I expected so much more and was left with a feeling that Alexa Chung and her friends need a huge reality check.<br /><br />I usually love books like this and was expecting something along the lines of 'Rookie Yearbook One' by Tavi Gevinson or 'The Goddess Guide' by Gisele Scanlon - one of my all time favourite books.<br /><br />I'm 19 and when I heard Alexa was writing a book I thought that's my Christmas list sorted but unfortunately no. If it were even a tiny bit more like The Goddess Guide with drawings and photographs and personal stories I'd have given it another star but unfortunately I've found nothing to date as cool for art, photography and super smart writing.<br /><br />Also I don't like the &#34;It&#34; title. What does &#34;It&#34; mean?<br /><br />It seems that &#34;It&#34; is devoid of any reality....<br /><br />John Crace's 'Digested Read' in The Guardian, reviewed 'It' and summed up exactly how I feel here after 1 hour of frustrated reading...<br /><br />There's nothing to &#34;It&#34;<br /><br />I still love Alexa on TV but I'm afraid from now on I'll give her books a miss.<br /><br />Unfortunately on this occasion she comes across as sycophantic and rather uncool. There's very little to champion here : ( and it's also too expensive.<br /><br />I hate being so negative but &#34;It&#34; is a huge disappointment. : (
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it is a good game but its the kind that gets boring after awhile. try it. for awhile at least
B000025XKM|5.0|The price was right and the quality was good.When you think about it,what else do you really need?<br /><br />  So there you have it.....
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie with all honesty! But after seeing it. Let's say it just doesn't measure up to what they were going for. The story was kind of lame and boring in my opinion. I would have to agree with the other reviewer and say it was some self righteous promotion of RZA and an idea he had that went bad once he got all these great actors together. None of which who know a thing about real martial arts besides maybe Lucy Lui. The movie probably would have been okay without RZA. His acting was so bad that it weighed the movie down in my opinion. He wasn't believable at all. And his chemistry with the other actors was nonexistent. You can tell he was only there because he is somewhat successful as a music producer and has a little pull in Hollywood right now. Even his fight scenes during the end are weak and provide no adrenaline for the movies climax. He wasnt even convincing as a blacksmith! Stick to the street hood cop roles like he played in American Gangster. Leave the emotional acting to the professionals. I'm not hating on RZA. I'm just telling it like it is. His talent lays behind his music! Not in front of the camera. The fight scenes are the only thing that kind of save the movie. That's why it got two stars instead of one! Maybe next time!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Do all sorts of things in the game to cause you to spend money buying coins to keep going.  Bad
B00361R2VU|1.0|I could watch about 20 seconds at a time, then can't load retry. Seriously, don't offer to rent stuff if you can't even deliver it. Did the same person who designed the Obamacare web site help you with this streaming system?
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Predictably, reaction to this movie will be at either end of the spectrum. I am at the ecstatic end of that spectrum.<br />If I could make movies, I would use this one above all as my model.<br />What can be more profound than if you could reunite with your siblings, parents and even yourself when you are old but they and you are at the age they were when you were all just growing up in a Texas small town in the 50s?<br />This is the highly moving and symbolic scene with which the movie cathartically closes.<br />The magnificent cinematography, wonderful music and expressive facial expressions of the actors over which the camera lingers and captures in a way that the whole story is told nonverbally in almost every frame.<br />I love the camera angles.  The langurous pace of the movie, which jumps back in forth in time manages to fill out the characters and add psychological depth a more traditional script would not have.<br />Central to the movie is the troubled relationship spawned by the father's too authoritian manner towards the older son, and to a lesser extent towards his wonderful wife and other sons.<br />But he comes to grip with it in a way that expresses his remorse.<br />This is in the category of Remembrance of Things Past.<br />Our memories in many ways are the most alive components in our experiences in life, and constantly stimulate an inner struggle whose aim is to achieve resolution amidst the banality of our outer lives.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Brilliant introspective thinker and writer who spirals down through life breaking and ruining everything, herself and those around her, after witnessing her mother's suffering thought the most difficult journey, the journey of a painful death. To try to make sense of the enormous loss and void, she puts herself through what also seems like a life or death journey of her own and learns, all on her own, life's most important lessons.
B006QKKMBA|5.0|This is the fifth installment of the Final Destination Films. Good moments, and entertaining as the first four were. Will there be a sixth sewual coming? Only time will tell. Great for the price & excellent quality!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a story of three separate lives which through separate incidences, intersect.  The descriptive writing is excellent and the characters all real to you as the story unfolds.  I will follow this author again.
B000066I6N|4.0|While I have to say that I really enjoy this release (especially Robert's incredible version of The Youngbloods \\"Darkness, Darkness\\"), and definitely acknowledge Mr. Plant as one of the 3 greatest vocalists in rock history, I personally would much prefer Dylan doing Zeppelin songs to Plant doing Dylan songs.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This set has it all and then some.  All of the Alien films on Bluray and every single extra that they could pack into it.
0399226907|5.0|As a child I loved this book and now I get to read it to my daughter.  I purchase the board book so she can handle it herself and I don't have to worry about her ruining it.  Well worth it.
B00ALGW286|4.0|Marina's story really touched me, taking me into her world and showing me aspects of history that I never really thought about.  Being a teenager is already hard enough for the young girl. But having to deal with the political environment of 90s Soviet Union is almost too much.  She is preparing for what should be a very bright future, but finds complications and twists at every turn.<br /><br />I felt so many different emotions while reading this book.  I was frustrated, sad, frightened, as well as hopeful and sometimes even uplifted.  I could hardly put it down, needing to turn the page and find out what happened next to the young people who are the central focus of this story.
B00F1CRRIU|4.0|The album is stunning in its grandeur and lushness.
B00D5CENXA|4.0|While this story had a few good twists, it was a little on the predictable side.  That being said, the characters are engaging, the story eerily realistic, and the ending exactly what we all wanted.  The story of an abused wife being set free from her abused husband and being able to build her life again with the man who has loved her since childhood is very sweet.  The added elements of animal heroism is what makes this a little bit different and keeps the somewhat predictable ending from being boring.  Another strong story from a great author!

B0091REZMW|4.0|Yep! I cannot give you a great feel for the game. It is fun now, but I am in the early stages. However,the constant nagging, while politely phrased, is driving me nuts and breaks up the game flow. Obviously this works as I am sitting here typing a review to get them to leave me alone.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Why I chose this book is because I like to learn more about stuff and know more information about the word. I loved I mean loved this book.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved this series!!! The third book will not disappoint you as far as the story and writing. I read many horrible reviews and this book will not make everyone happy but so disappointed in how many readers &#34;hate&#34; the book because of the ending. Hello people: same person writing, everyone stayed true to character, same great writing etc etc so the writer is writing her series not yours! I was not happy at the end either, but then again I was, because it was a story, taught lessons actually many lessons, entire series flowed and still left hope in the end and love. Thank you Mrs Roth I will be rereading over the years. You left lots to think about after reading. From just a normal everyday reader

B00003CXPD|5.0|This is a film a family can enjoy.  My 20-something son watched it, and enjoyed it, too.  Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy who prefers dancing over boxing.  His rough coal miner father doesn't understand or approve.  Dancing is one of the few joys in Bill's life as his mother is dead and the family is poor.  Set in the mid-1980's during the coal miner's strike in England, Billy's father is struggling to survive.<br /><br />Billy's dance teacher, however, suggests to Billy's father that he open his eyes to who Billy is and the talent he has.  Whether the father will do so, and what this means for Billy is why we keep watching the film.  And, of course, to see Billy dance.  This is a touching but affirming film and sure to delight those who believe in the power of dance.

1416955070|1.0|The book was a waste of time and money. The characters were shallow at best and the book had an unnatural tenancy to make the characters explain what's happening instead of letting the story explain.
0300169787|5.0|beautiful book with a stunning cover - quotes give the sense that maybe mcqueen wasn't our greatest intellectual mind, but my god those clothes :D<br /><br />made a great gift for someone who i wished i could take back in time to go see this at the met - it's not quite the same experience, but the line's a lot shorter
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What was Roth thinking!?! This trilogy had so much potential! She blew it. I had to drag myself through this one. Book 1 was great, book 2 was pretty good, book 3 bombed. I'm so disappointed! Bad, bad way to end this series. Ugh.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|This is a very sweet story of falling in love with your best friend. I liked it and it was a sweet coming of age story.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|My husband and I long for the days when the songs on albums were meant to be heard together and in a certain order like on this one. This is definitely one of our favorite Beatles albums of all time.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Really good film, exactly what I hoped for.  Really inspired me to hit the guitar.  Tells the back story of these three great artists as well.  Not your everyday documentary.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Probably the best of the Star Trek series. I know the special effects are campy, but keep in mind that they had a very small budget to work with. Considering that, the people who put this series together did a remarkable job of giving it a futuristic feel. Sometimes there is a poetic beauty to simplicity.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thanks for your time and its a very good application. Keep doing this important tools for the people who wants to be entertaining.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Top-notch cinematography.  Sublime acting by the entire cast.  Captivating music. This is simply a beautiful movie. Matthew Macfadyen is perfect as Darcy.
B000001GAM|5.0|I have recently entered a Bruckner mania. And being a little obsessive, I did a fair amount of research to try to figure out which recording were the better ones.<br /><br />From what I had read, this recording of the 9th is exceptional. I have not listened to many other versions, but would have found this to be VERY good.<br /><br />Below, i will copy some comments that I made on my review of the 8th which will give you an idea of my general reaction to Giulini as compared to other conductors of Brucken. Although these were written for the 8th, they also apply to the 9th<br /><br /> I have bought several versions of the 8th because I decided to try to see what sorts of differences I could pick out. I have never done this before. It turns out that there are many sorts of differences that  you can begin to see after listening to all of these different performances<br />.<br />Behind the scenes are the recording engineers who make lots of technical choices to try to best capture the sounds of the orchestra. Some recording engineers seem to concentrate on getting the whole picture of the entire orchestra. Individual players can be heard, but are a little distant.  In this recording you can hear not only the orchestra as a whole, but also the individual instruments that have a particular moment.  When these moments happen, you can clearly hear a person who is playing this particular moment. They capture the vibrancy of the individual performances.<br />And not every orchestra is interchangeable on every different composer and symphony. Different orchestras have different strengths on different composers, etc. For Bruckner, the Vienna and Berlin orchestras have done these so often that they are the acknowledged elite. With other orchestras doing a credible but slightly lesser work. The recording has strong performances from the Vienna PO<br /><br />And finally is the conductor. I was not familiar with Giulini until recently, but I really like his approach. I think that he has spent a lot of his professional career conducting orchestras for opera performances.  By it’s nature, an opera is more lyrical. After all you have all these people singing with passion. And the orchestra that accompanies that performance has to fit in to that sort of style. As the orchestra opens an opera, it has to pave the way for the dramatics to come.  After all an opera orchestra does not want to overwhelm the singers, right?<br /><br />Giulini is not so pyrotechnic as Karajan, whose performance has a sort of “Raiders of the lost ark” thrill ride sort of character in my opinion. Not to criticize Karajan. It is just a different approach that some prefer. My non-professional opinion is that Giulini brings his operatic sensibilities to his conducting…. At least for Bruckner.  It is a difference that I like, but you have to see if it is what you like.<br /><br />There are still good dynamics, but not so enormous as Karajan.  I think Giulini takes more care with the phrasing and articulation of the parts of the music that are not so climactic. Whereas for some other conductors, these quieter parts are just sort of preparing the way for the spectacular parts to come. If you are looking for an extraordinary wall of sound…. I guess Karajan is what you want. I prefer the slightly more intimate approach of Giulini<br /><br />I also like Giulini’s tempos. After listening to many different recordings of the same symphony, you start to become aware of so many choices that the conductor has mad that are different than another conductor has made with the same score, and the same orchestra in many cases. Bruckner, and particularly the 8th, is a work where there is a fairly wide range of different tempos presented by different conductors. And even between the different movements. So, for example Celibedache is famous for his almost lethargic tempos.  But he takes the allegro 2nd movement fairly quickly. So each movement with each conductor has a unique sort ofapproach.  As I said, I really like Giulini’s over all pacing for the entire symphony. I also like Gunter Wand at Lubeck Cathedral<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are looking to really live with the 8th for a while, I like this recording.  But if you are looking to be blown away by the intensity, then you might prefer Karajan
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the most frustrating game I love to play.  I held out as long as I could now I'm thoroughly hooked.  Waiting for lives is the worst; no waiting for help to move up a level is horrid.  Need my Candy Crush fix daily.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very good and very real! Couldn't keep my eyes off it! It was so engrossing and has funny parts too.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun game. I have played for awhile now and haven't spent a cent. Take yor time and enjoy the game. Its not to hard and not to easy.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is a great movie with lots of action and special effects. Still am amazed at the great job of recreating the look of the original actors from this TV and movie series except for Kahn , who is way better looking in this new movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Watched the first 2 season with friends and got hooked.  when we found that seacon 3 was not available...  on netflix... we shoppedhere.  within a few minutes the girls night out  was back in business.  Good service.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh my word this is the best game ever . I wanted it and asked my mom and she said yes. So ever since I've been in love with it. Also it has good graphics and it is a good game that gets your nerves going:) . LOVE THE GAME SO MUCH!!!!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Inspiring! Loved the blue ray quality! It was nice watching all the rocky movies one after another in high Def. GREAT FILMS
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|I needed some longer books to read when my son was born, especially for those late-night feedings. This is a great book that has romance, humor and whit and is easy to follow, unlike some from this time period. After reading it I got another Austen book, which wasn't nearly as good. This one keeps you interested because it keeps moving. It reads almost like a play with constant dialogue.
B00000IQV7|5.0|The movie is great from beginning to end with the typically funny Robin Williams at his best.  Even the poignant and passionate moments are played so perfectly by Williams.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|I saw that Todd Latorre joined Queensryche after a weird messy break-up with Geoff Tate.  Tate has his own Q'ryche and then there's this version, the Todd Latorre fronted Queensryche.  All that mess aside, the Latorre version of Queensryche kicks ass!  It has a great older feel to it but the songs are new and fresh.  The band sound rejuvenated and cleaner than they have on albums in years.  For fans of the band, stick with the Latorre front version as the Tate version has taken the train to crazy town.  For actual Queensryche music this is the album to hear, good stuff all around.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Such a great family movie to show monsters in a different light.  One of my 4 year olds was afraid to watch at first because it had monsters in it, but then I explained how monsters are afraid of kids and she immediately changed her mind.  Monsters, Inc. and pizza...great family fun night!
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I love the first Die Hard movie.  It's the gold standard for suspense action films to this day and I find it hard to say that one has done a better job.  Bruce Willis broke out in that movie and became the surly bald guy we know and love today.  Each Die hard movie after the first was good or interested in its own way but never as good as the original.  Now, Die Hard 5 was interesting.  The action was pretty great.  The dialog and story were so-so.  It honestly felt like a &#34;well I'm under contract so let's get this over with&#34; was how the movie was approached, filmed, and released.<br /><br />All that being said, some I enjoy a good mindless movie from time to time.  Let's pretend this isn't a Die Hard movie and it's definitely a fun action romp with no point and some cool...well...action.  Other than that it's very very far from the Die Hard root and only makes me want to go back and watch the original.  If you're a fan of the series this installment is a see it/don't see it, doesn't matter situation.  If you're curious you won't have wasted your time, but be sure to have a good snack handy and some Candy Crush like addicting games available for when you get bored.  Also, I'm mad that he doesn't drive a car into a helicopter...
B0086DBE62|3.0|My husband and I liked this movie, however, our 4 year old girl thought all the darkness and evil step mother were too much for her.  She found it to be too scary and couldn't finish it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great story - well written - WONDERFUL BOOK!  I would recommend this book to anyone.  This is my new favorite book.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I was completely addicted to this game when it first came out.  I had to take some time off from it as it takes a lot of time to finish a round.  Still a wonderfully fun game!
B00C7607BC|5.0|I liked and highly recommend it for all kids and disney fans.  The movie is one of disney's best film to see.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I like the format - it's a series of short stories. Very good for reading when traveling, since there's plenty of spots to stop if meal service comes through, the plane is about to leave, etc.
1594202273|4.0|I purchased the book after hearing the author on the Daily Show.  His discussion of the book brought back memories of my four years in the Air Force stationed at a SAC base near Riverside California as an air policeman (security force and base police).  I had the good fortune to guard B47's on the flight line, guard the igloos housing the nuclear weapons, and guard the rapid response force which had to be in their aircraft within 15 minutes of an alarm sounding. Strategic Air Command at that time was considered the elite command, mostly because of the reputation of Curtis LeMay who made SAC an efficient fighting force. The book acurately describes the culture of SAC and the daily operations of the nuclear bombing force. We had the broken arrow alerts, the security tests where outside teams from SAC HQ in Omaha would attempt to infiltrate our base. We hated them since it meant the base was put on full alert and all leaves cancelled. SAC was all spit and polish compared to the other air force installations. If you saw the movie Strategic Air Command you pretty much got a good picture of life on a SAC base. But if Command & Control were just about that, it would be pretty boring reading. The suspense in this book  is the descriptions of all of the near nuclear accidents that took place from just after World War II right up to present day. The drama surrounding the major nuclear incident at Dasmascu Arkansas was interwoven around a well documented technical description of the challenges facing the engineers who had to make the devices fail safe when needed but would work in the event we actually did have to go to war. The Damascus incident was especially well researched and made for some taut reading. The other near miss incidents some of which I remember were also well written. It truly is a miracle we did not have a thermonuclear weapon go off accidentally. We had one incident at March AFB where a B 47 crashed on approach to the base and we never found out if it had nuclear weapons on board, but it was pretty horrible to be involved with. Schlosser does a great job driving home  just how dangerous these bombs are to handle and how much time is taken to try and make them safe but at the same time, it is impossible to make them 100% safe under all conditions. And yes, Dr. Strangelove while it may have been a satire was a realistic portrait of how a deranged general could take our country to war.  The book wraps up at the end with the warning that India and Pakistan are two nuclear powers that don't have the same track record as the U.S. in preventing industrial accidents and thus the liklihood of a nuclear event with those two countries is much higher than in the U.S. or Russsia. We can be thankful that we had leaders such as Eisenhower and Kennedy who successfully guided the country through the worst of the cold war era and managed to keep the Russians at bay while not allowing themselves to be bullied by our own military. The book is pretty heavy reading and will not be everyone's cup of tea but if you want the best account of our role in nuclear safety over the last 60 plus years, this is the book to buy.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I just finished watching The Hunger Games about a half an hour ago, so it is still fresh in my mind. It truly was, in my view anyway, a truly amazing film filled with beauty, tragedy, adventure, and hope all combined to create a masterpiece. And despite clearly being influenced by, among others, today's trashy reality tv, the film itself is not trashy or lowbrow at all, which in today's entertainment world, is a breath of fresh air. It stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, both from District 12 in the post-apocalyptic dystopian society of Panem, located in futuristic North America. Every year in Panem, there is a slaughterfest in the form of a televised event called The Hunger Games which takes the form of two \\"tributes\\" from all 12 districts, which unlike the Capitol of Panem, are very poor and exploited. These tributes must then face off against each other against other tributes in a battle to the death during the annual Hunger Games, where there can be only one victor remaining alive out of the original 24. Katniss is a tough girl, having to live her entire life amongst squalor and poverty and because of this, she volunteers as tribute in place of her younger sister Primrose, who as it is made clear in the beginning scenes, is far less strong than her older sister. The first half of the film focuses on the tributes preparing for the hunger games and showing off their talents to the judges in hopes of winning their favor. And it is essentially this aspect of the film that prevents it from getting 5 stars from me, it takes too long to focus on the actual combat scenes, and was quite boring, but luckily, once the actual combat begins, the film really takes off and because very exciting and thrilling, as well as brutal and sad. I'll be the first to admit that some of the death scenes, for a PG-13 film, were quite disturbing and sad, especially considering that these are children getting killed, children who have grown up in poverty and never gotten the opportunity to see how wonderful and joyful life can be. And yet despite this, they still manage to have compassion and love for one another, especially the lovely, adorable girl Rue, who saves Katniss's life at one point. Of course, there are other kids who are much more bloodthirsty and violent, showing the other, darker side of humanity prevalent in us all. And it's not at all surprising that they're like this, considering the dystopian society that's all they've ever known. All in all, The Hunger Games is an amazing film that was spawned from what I understand to be a truly addicting novel written by Susan Collins. I'll definitely look forward to more films in this series.poverty and never gotten the opportunity to see how wonderful and joyful life can be.

1451666179|3.0|I really really wanted to love this book because I absolutely LOVE her blog.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to see that at least 1/2 of the stories from the book are also from the blog (and thus, I had already read them).  I'll keep the book because I want to support this artist, but I probably wouldn't have bought the book new if I knew how much of the material I had already read.

B006T3RM08|1.0|The pieces fit together very snugly, and it takes away from the entire feel of the trackpad.  I often sit in my chair at my desk with my feet up, and I wanted something I could sit on my lap to type and use the trackpad.  Well, don't get this if that's what you want.  In fact, pass on it all-together.

B00AFPTSI0|5.0|A good book on the give and take in business and life.  The author is a professor and speaker, and is worth the time if you have a chance.  He has some good videos on youtube as well.

1594134634|5.0|Mitch Albom, a Detroit Free Press sports writer, broke into the best seller world with his poignant non-fiction story, TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE, about his visits with a former professor who was dying of Lou Gehrig’s disease.  His later book, HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, begins with an unusual request from an 82 year old rabbi of his youth to write and deliver his eulogy.<br /><br />The book alternates from his train trips to visit this wise, eccentric and witty rabbi in New Jersey to seemingly disparate chapters on Henry, a black, former drug dealer in Brooklyn who Albom met in Detroit.<br /><br />How Albom interwove the lives of these two real-life characters into a journey of his own faith and inspiration is truly a work of literary genius.  As I read it I alternated from laughing out loud to moments of a lump in the throat to tears.  I highly recommend this book.

This is one of Quinn's cutest stories (if not the cutest), and if you love it as much as I do may i recommend The Bevelstoke series Miranda Cheever and What happens in London are heart melting stories from this author.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|Four CDs and a DVD holding a retrospective of The Band at its pinnacle.  Although there is quite of bit of redundancy, each live version is a bit different -- slower, more energetic, stronger vocals -- than the last.  The Weight, The Shape I'm In, Stage Fright, Don't Do It, Cripple Creek, Get Up Jake, are all here, and all with more than one stellar performance.  The quality of the sound board recordings is excellent.  And, Bob Dylan also appears at the top of his form.  The only disappointment is the DVD, which is primarily a slide show of stills with studio versions of the best of The Band.  Nonetheless, for the fan or the rock and roll historian, this is a must have.  I'm surely going to miss Levon Helm.  But I'll have this box set to sooth my melancholy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hooked on Candy Crush! So glad it was finally on my Kindle Fire! I even wrote to Amazon to make it available and ta da! Here it is!
030758836X|5.0|this book will take you on a journey you can not imagine............<br />the life a sociopath .............and those who love them..................scary!!!!
006202406X|2.0|I have had great expereiences with Amazon previously, so I was excited to pre-order this book....I received it about a week after it came out....I pre-ordered hoping to get the book when it came out and was dissappointed that I could have bought it in the store that day and had it a week earlier than I ended up getting it...<br /><br />Book itself is great! Very good read!
0375704027|1.0|I've never read a book that I was so frustrated and angry at. Murakami is a beautiful writer but this book is like the Japanese \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" but worse. I picked up \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland...\\" A few years ago and was absolutely in love with it. I has such high expectations for this book because the other was so beautiful and tender. However, Norwegian Wood is just too much! Everyone in this book is god-damned tortured: A bunch of privileged (upper)-middle class tortured 20 something's with the exception of the 40 something tortured Reiko who plays The Beatles and like two Bach songs about every ten pages!!! I see where an emotionally naive high school girl would enjoy this book with its intense repressed emotions. The line in the synopsis \\"Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable\\" is drawn out for almost 300 pages when it was obvious she should have been euthanized in chapter 2. All of the characters are painfully melodramatic simply wallowing in their sorrows for 300 pages- there isn't so much a plot rather than a prolonged biography of a bunch of tortured souls. Not to mention, this book is filled with \\"moody book\\" clich&eacute;s such as rain, snow, referring to vaginas as \\"her warmth\\" in sex scenes, soft acoustic guitars, drunken tell-alls, and the ennui of being a tortured loner who shrugs the world off.<br /><br />I hate to give a Murakami book such a low rating, but either this book or this translation is just infuriating.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app for cleaning up my kindle. My kindle would tell me it's almost full even though I have almost nothing on it. This app cleaned it by almost a third first time I cleaned it. Well worth it for free.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|This documentary is full of historic background into the musical legends that recorded there - hit after hit.  Many groups and soloists launched their careers in this southern recording goldmine, located far from the bright lights of NY and LA.  Very insightful presentation, full of interviews, stories and behind the scenes commentary  - more than enough to digest and appreciate.
0792844882|5.0|When this movie came out there was critical acclaim to the tune of &#34;horrible&#34; &#34;disgusting&#34; ''poorly acted'' and on and on and on.  I saw this movie years ago and really liked it but now that Elizabeth Berkley is on Dancing With The Stars I decided to check it out again (remembering all the bad press).  If that movie was done now no-one would say a word but because there is a lot of boobies - naked boobies - and various other parts of the body today it would seem tame by our standards in film-land.<br />Elizabeth is a gal who comes to Vegas to fulfill a dream-to become a dancer. The storyline is ok,- not great but not that bad at all. It's a movie worth seeing (especially for all those men salivating all the T+A). It's a simple story and a lot of music and dancing; actually you could call it a extravaganza.  This film cost a lot of money with beautiful sets, beautiful girls and terrific dance numbers. Check it out.....I think you'll like it--especially you guys!!!  (Now I'm going to go put my head in the sand....awwwww!)<br />PS: Elizabeth has actually gotten prettier and more beautiful with time!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This book has the greatest potential that I have Velare and a book of this type it's very well done easy reading and I pray that understand will meet all of the region as they pursue these long that they might be successful it's my hope and desire that it will bring for a much more awareness of life to everyone that reads it well what shall I say to these things if God before he's more than the world against happy reading
B008602KQI|5.0|Did not think I would like the movie but I did.  Can't wait to see the next one out soon
B0049J2BSM|4.0|Monsters University is a look at the relationship between Mike and Sulley during their days at Monsters University -- when they weren't necessarily the best of friends in this sort of prequel to Monsters INC.<br /><br />I thought the original Monsters INC movie was one of the better animations movies going, with a good funny story that made me as an adult laugh.  So I looked forward to seeing the sequel (ahem) prequel I mean.  And although it may not be overall as strong as the original, maybe treading into territory we have seen before, Monsters University does a good job at bringing some laughs and a decent story with a good message for the kids.<br /><br /> There are some great lines and shameless but expertly timed sight gags.  The movie does a great job at telling what it truly means to be honest, honorable, loyal and fair.<br /><br />Although it has a predictable tale, it is a good movie to watch with your kids that has a good message on top of it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game except for those illness inducing and completely unnecessary whirling things. Please make them stop. Otherwise lots of fun to play.
B004E2XAHK|5.0|I love this CD and this band!  It is nice to be able to get something that is usually not available around here!
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I had not heard of this artist prior to seeing his album on Amazon. This is one of the best jazz CD's I've heard in a very long time.  Mr. Porter's voice is mesmerizing and his band is on point.
B008602KQI|4.0|do you still remember 'Running Man' ?<br />4 Stars for Jennifer's acting.  It was better to be a little  less cruel.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I can't stop playing this! But I read  some other reviews saying that it couldn't download on kindle well I have a kindle and it worked perfectly well a kindle fire HD so I guess I doesn't work on others but just saying it comes with only 6levels so if you want to keep playing buy the rest levels.=) one question I bought the rest of the levels but at the bottom it still says if I want to buy more but when I go on the shop thing it says I bought it all already what do I do?
B00005B36H|1.0|the cd was in dreadul condition and now it skips so i don't even listen to it any more plus there was no artwok
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must admit to being exceptionally resistant to sitting down and reading this book. Maybe I'm a little contrarian, but I admit to avoiding it not least because of the extreme hype surrounding the movie release. Second, I generally HATE first person novels as they tend to hit me as a little self important and you only really get to know one character. I am seriously considering the revision of that opinion for The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Collins sets the scene and establishes the main character of Katniss quickly, yet expertly in the very first chapter. The book then zips along at a break-neck pace, repleat with action and blood yet still manages to engage your emotions to simultaneously love, loathe, and pity these characters. Then, underlining all the brutality playing out in the arena among starving children for your own entertainment - not unlike the Capitol Elite - you cannot help but shudder as dark musings of how this distopian future could quite plausibly lay ahead for us somewhere play through your brain in the background of the tale.<br /><br />A masterful story and undeniable classic!
1451695195|5.0|This book is for everyone....non-believers, believers, those on the fence....you won't be able to put it down. I am giving this to everyone for Christmas this year.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great but frustrating when you are stuck on a level ....<br />Check it out you will be just as addicted as the rest of us
006202406X|1.0|I hope that Veronica Roth enjoyed her popularity while it lasted. After reading this book I wish i had never read the first two. I was so excited about the movie coming out but I will no longer be going to see that. And I will never read another book by this author. I hope she looks for another career.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I like this movie so much that I cannot resist watching it if I am channel surfing and catch it by accident although I own it on DVD. So well done the actors are great the story so full of love and history. magnificent
B005PK56TA|5.0|I loved that as Prime Member I could see it all instantly! I Cant wait to watch the next season!
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexanders book is right on and his final conclusion: That we are all One Consciousness and not really individuals is inescapable.<br /><br />Jesus said \\"Whatsoever you do to the least of your brethren you do to me\\" What did this mean? That he's standing around with a clip board keeping track of what we're doing to each other? He obviously understood that he was God Consciousness and was trying to tell us that we are too. There is no individualized consciousness being created by a brain. We are all the same consciousness looking out of every set of eyes both human and otherwise. So anything we do both good and bad we are literally doing to ourselves. Look into the eyes of your youngest relative and understand that what is looking back is YOU! This is why the NDE experiencer feels everything they've done to others in the life review because there are no others! The illusion of being an individual is just breaking down in the process of awakening. The truth is at the level of pure consciousness - I am you, you are me we are one. Just what is being explained in this book.<br /><br />Below is my analysis of the fallacies of \\"Brain Worship\\"<br /><br />Religion of Brain Worship Vs. Science as to an Explanation of Consciousness<br /><br />The Religion of Brain Worship<br /><br />The tenants of the religion summarized.<br /><br />Though no individual brain cell has ever been measured to be conscious, think, feel, intend or Love Brain Worshipers take it as a matter of faith that a conglomeration of such cells produces all of the above thereby creating the individual and \\"mind\\".<br /><br />Though no empirical measurement of consciousness has ever been done Brain worshipers take it as a matter of faith that the brain is generating consciousness.<br /><br />Brain worshipers believe the brain can take electrical vibrations and translate them into subjective seeing and hearing.<br /><br />The high priests of Brain Worship keep secret mathematical transforms that relate electrical activity or PET activity in the brain to consciousness.<br /><br />The Brain Worshipers have faith that an unconscious and mechanistic universe created consciousness.<br /><br />The Brain Worshipers believe that billions of individual brains produce billions of individualized consciousness in millions of species.<br /><br />The high priests of Brain Worship understand secret parameters that would allow each<br />consciousness to be recognized as being individualized.<br /><br />The high priests of Brain Worship can explain how each individualized consciousness came to occur at a specific co-ordinate in space time. In other words though there were billions of other body pairs producing babies before I was born they can explain why my consciousness is paired with my body vs a body that showed up previously or after my birth date.<br /><br />The governing premise of Brain Worship is order comes out of randomness. The high priests can explain why I'm randomly created here and cannot randomly be created \\"exist\\" somewhere else simultaneously.<br /><br />The high priests can explain why we can only exist once throughout the entire infinity of time. Why the forces that create us suddenly stop working after we die.<br /><br />Though it's obvious we can only know what is in the Mind the priests assure us there actually is a physical universe out there.<br /><br />The high priests of Brain Worship can look at a bunch of cells in my brain and verify that the tune to \\"Lets Go Fly a Kite\\" is embedded there. Without asking me of course.<br /><br />The high priests of Brain Worship say that because stimulating the brain can produce \\"hallucinations\\" that that proves the brain is doing it all. Though consciousness has to exist in order to perceive these hallucinations in the first place.<br /><br />Brain worshipers believe that since millions of verifiable perceptions have occurred while persons have claimed to be out of body that an invisible brain pops out of the head and doesthe perceiving during these events.<br /><br />Brain worshipers believe even though metabolic processes are shutting down during trauma the brain still manages to produce a higher level of consciousness then ever occurs during healthy operation.<br /><br />Brain worshipers believe even though metabolic processes are shutting down during trauma the brain produces rapturous feelings of unconditional Love. Something that never happens in a healthy brain.<br /><br />Brain worshipers have secret knowledge that explains why during an NDE everyone feels connected to everyone and everything else.<br /><br />Brain worshipers always claim to be critical thinkers and have science on their side even though they have no mathematics, or empirical data to support their claims. They claim to use Occam's razor as to simplest explanations yet everything they say is convoluted and can't explain observable phenomenon.<br /><br />Brain Worship is a religion based on faith alone!<br /><br />Science<br /><br />Experiments in Quantum physics have proved that consciousness is necessary to collapse the wave function at both the Quantum and macro levels.<br /><br />There is no such thing as time.<br /><br />We can only know about what is in Consciousness and not any actual Universe - out there. The body and brain are within Consciousness.<br /><br />Consciousness is a field effect, the Zero Point field, not a point source effect.<br /><br />Since consciousness is a field effect the One consciousness expresses in all forms.<br /><br />Despite appearances of separation and isolation each life form has the same consciousness.<br /><br />The questions of specific birth at a specific time is irrelevant since the same consciousness shows up in all cases.<br /><br />The question of billions of individualized consciousness being generated is irrelevant since all consciousness is one and the same.<br /><br />Consciousness is what sees or hears not the brain.<br /><br />Any type of perception including \\"hallucinations\\", visions, or dreams are realities in other dimensions that consciousness is tuning into.<br /><br />During NDE consciousness disengages from the illusion of brain allowing more perfect perception.<br /><br />During NDE the illusion of separation is gone and consciousness knows itself as being everywhere, everything, and everywhen.<br /><br />Since only consciousness can know anything then consciousness must know everything.<br /><br />Since consciousness is the basis of all form it must be eternal.<br /><br />That which knows everything and is eternal is known as God.<br /><br />Since we are consciousness we are eternal and one with God.<br /><br />Since unconditional Love is what consciousness experiences during NDE then we are unconditional Love.<br /><br />Occam's razor
B000B8QG4A|4.0|I purchased it for my 2 and a half year old daughter, the story is ok, but I guess she prefers princesses and Dora :)
B000NMZFKK|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and it is always fantastic. Bravo for scenery, writing, acting. Love the horses too.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Wow! When I saw &quot;simple&quot; in the title, I was expecting a game that would capture my attention for a very short time. Wrong! This may be &quot;simple&quot; compared to NASA doing this with slide rules in the 60's and 70's but it is far from simple for your average player. What is simple is the layout and gameplay. Building rockets is quite simple. Setting up the stages of your rocket is simple. Controlling your power output and direction of travel is simple. SPACE FLIGHT IS NOT SIMPLE! But it is FUN. The tutorials are great and very insightful. I have so far managed to orbit Smearth, land my capsule back on Smearth and orbit the Smoon. All of that took many failed designs and failed attempts with good designs. I have not as of yet successfully returned a capsule from the Smoon (chute failed on re-entry to Smearth). After I do, I will attempt to land on the Smoon. One botched mission that sends you out of the Smearth's gravitational pull without fuel will give you an awesome sense of the immensity of the Solar System. Kudos!!!
1446301583|5.0|What a GREAT BOOK! I love her Studio and all the projects in this book! I just LOVE Tone Finnanger!!!! Her books are mesmerizing!!! I give this book 5 Stars!!! 0:D
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game has a few quirks where the puzzles are mechanically off.  The makers did a much better job in their 2012 jungle game.<br /><br />Overall, it's a meh game and, because o f some of the odd quirks, expect to hit up a walkthrough to get yourself through some of the clumsier puzzles.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I LOVE this movie, and I'm a grown up without children.  Don't let the main character being a villain fool you.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to watch it over and over again.
B007N5YJWK|5.0|Wonderful remaster of the original film and if you like Hitch you will love this.  The quality is all there, plus sub titled and really a great gift for those Hitch fans on your list.
0446581356|5.0|Love this book ... great for amateurs or pro's. Al the basics and the very much loved and needed brush descriptions.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|I was always a fan, but my wife was a super fan.  She loves this set, and I don't think they left any thing out.  It is a great purchase.  If you like Joni you will love this.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|An other Pendergast novel to take your mind away from the every day life, work....always entertaining.  It got me hooked from the first pages!
B00BX8PG5M|2.0|Sorry to report that everything went a bit slow.  I was really expecting more from this cast, but did not get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush has finally made its way to Kindle..I am totally addicted to this game, and now I can have my books and candy crush all in the same place. =)
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Well it was worth the wait.  Shane did come back in blu ray and wow!!  This is one of my all time favorites and I think could be one of the best western's ever made.  I know that is saying alot, but there is not another western out there like this one. The cast is just perfect and I like this movie even more every time I see it.
0812550706|5.0|This book holds the position of \\"My Favorite\\". I first read it when I was 9 or 10, and was blown away. I have since read it so many times that I don't even need to finish the sentences, I know word-for-word exactly what they will say.<br /><br />This book perfectly tells the tale of Ender Wiggin, a young child, at the start of the story, who has been bred to be, and is, \\"humanity's last hope\\". Despite this, however, the book does not dwell on the impending peril, but instead focuses on Ender's experiences and growth as a person. Personally, I found/find it impossible not to love the kid, and to both relate to and respect him. I found all of the characters believable and sympathetic.<br /><br />The introductions to each chapter are an excellent literary tool, and work perfectly in this book. Additionally, the further characterization of Peter and Valentine (Ender's siblings) adds so much to the book and the world Card creates. Every time I read this book, I have a different favorite part and a different favorite character. Depending on my mood, there is always someone for me to relate to and empathize with.<br /><br />In later years, I have learned more about he author (which, in this case, is not a good thing), but it is really a testament to how amazing this book is and how successfully he wrote these characters that Card's own actions and reputation have not marred this book for me. Whatever I think of his personal beliefs and politics, he wrote an amazing book, and one that I think everyone should read (probably best around ages 9 - 14 for the first reading, I have been told that it is not *as* good/life-changing if you read it as an adult).
B00CQ8U5ZE|4.0|I really love this movie, but am disappointed that once again they did not sub title.  I have audio issues and have trouble hearing the dialog.  I waited along time for this to be released in blu ray and I think they could have done a better job.  The picture was a bit grainy and I do not think that should be the case.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This was a gift for a family member who has not gotten back to me on it. He loves old war stories.
B001JP5JRY|5.0|This book is  legend... wait for it... dary!<br /> This book is like a bromistvah for guys all around the world to to become one with the bros
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|love it, so handy being on my kindle<br />when traveling<br /><br />it is something I would reccomend for anyone with a kindle
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It will be interesting to see if HBO will keep the series going all the way through this book. There is a long way to go from the last season episode to here. Can't wait for next book though.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't want to have to purchase anything. I like to play the game but it runs out of time. My other games have unlimited playing and you don't have to buy anything else.
B005HSL626|5.0|My opinion Is that I think it's fun and just awesome I also think that it deserves a five star rating
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There are obvious reasons why anybody should love having one of these babies, but it does have it's downsides.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Works with pretty much any phone or tablet<br />Portable-ish<br />Video seems to be fast and without lag<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs to be plugged into the wall (or USB?) for power, so it's not as portable as they would have you think...<br />Limited number of apps, but growing<br />Seems to be slow to react (play, pause), possibly from lack of computing power<br /><br />Overall, good value, and does what it is supposed to
B0090SI4LU|4.0|Like other book to movie adaptations, you're either going to like this movie or you're not. I personally liked the film. The actors played their parts well. Of course, being a movie, you're going to find that a great deal of what makes the book great is not in the film. If is was, the movie would be four hours long. Don't over think this one. It's a good movie. I definitely recommend it.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|Me and my husband love this show and when we got it, it was new and sealed!! Great price for a great deal!!
B008220BLG|5.0|I love this movie. I am not a zombie movie fan at all but this film is not your typical zombie movie. Who ever heard of a zombie love story? The movie is funny and all around entertaining. The actors play their parts well. I think I've watched it a good twenty times or more now. It will put a smile on your face. Don't over think it. Just watch it.
B0041YICOM|4.0|This is an interesting and spell binding book to read... make sure you have someone to hold on to when you read this one.
0425264351|5.0|This is the first and the best of all of them. Everything in the rest of the books really came from this one.  If you haven't read it yet it's a must.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game!  it is very addictive and not just for kids but for anyone young at heart.  keeps your brain on its toes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it up to level 100.  After that it became very difficult for me, but I'm still trying.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is the best document editing app on the app store. Don't pay attention to the other reviews saying that you need a font package. It isn't required, so download this app now and discover what your missing!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have not read a book so fast in many years, just wonderful and of course the new Kindle helped!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game for all ages I love playing with my boyfriends son to see who gets the highest score.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is about one girl's journey to her life's end. Terminal Cancer. The book isn't really about one girl, Hazel. It's really about all of the people who's lives she's touched and who've touched hers.<br />I'm not going to go into a lot stuff about this, John Green' s, book because on Amazon there are over 5,000 reviews written for this story.<br />Just my views. I loved this book. I cried, I laughed, I cried, I cried, I got angry, laughed and then cried some more. Enough of that. Just about everyone has been exposed to the reality of cancer in one way or another. Personally or through close friends or family. I think Hazel did as good a job as she could dealing with her own realities of her upcoming death. Almost all of her closest friends were cancer patients too. What a way to have to live your very short life. I think Hazel' s little life was better though for having loved Augustus.<br />I highly recommend this book for YOUNG ADULTS AND OLD ADULTS TOO!
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Love P!nk! Love her music, her performances, her spirit. Just saw her in concert - an incredible show and wonderful experience.
0765350386|5.0|I went into this book knowing that it was a trilogy.  I didn't mind that characters and other events weren't described to the fullest extent.  I had a feeling that there was plenty of time for that along the way.  After having read the others, I believe I was right.  Much was learned about the main characters and some of the ancillary ones as well.
1476729085|5.0|I picked up this book quite spontaneously and read it in one day.  It was abolutely hilarious, quirky, uplifting and a wonderful way to pass the time.  I'm not ususally an LOL type but this book had me guffawing and wiping away tears at the same time.  It's been a long time since I completed a book that made me feel. . . plain old happy.  Don Tillman, lecherous Gene and the whole cast of characters did just that.
B00APKIN1I|3.0|Same music as on the Sound City Docu. Big deal. I would have expected more. But...I guess not.&#60;G&#62; It's adequate
B00CX7TOTQ|3.0|I was very disappointed with this movie. The plot was weak and the script was weaker. De Niro looked like he was performing reluctantly and Travolta also seemed stiff and uncomfortable. The upper hand momentum of the plot moved back and forth like a rusty gate swinging in the breeze without any real surprises. The film was missing any real intrigue. The ending was predictable. I had to really force myself not to turn the movie off and watch something else. Both De Niro and Travolta deserve better than this. Let's hope they can both find another movie worthy of their talent with better script writers and producers because it would be a sad epilogue to two brilliant careers otherwise.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a very good book. It was well written and had a great story line. It always kept you on your toes. I didn't really have any dislikes besides that it dragged on a little. I would recommend this book to young adults.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is a masterful writer.  I read at least one novel per week.  This one gets my rare &#34;must read&#34; rating.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|You have to keep paying to play more levels.<br />I think if you buy a game you should get the whole game!
B00F9040HU|4.0|Nice, fast, can't put it down! It is easy to play  and easy to get addicted to playing Atlantis Quest game.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|Good vampire flick. Not scary, as the name suggests it is told from the perspective of a vampire. Great performances from all the actor's within. Best part... No sparkles.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Lots of potty mouth talk that isn't necessary.  Interesting story line even though it is far=fetched.  The train wreck scene is very loud and long.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Love the movie in the first place but i was very happy with the condition it came as when i purchased it, the headliner said it was a used copy. Thank you for taking good care of it.
0736092269|5.0|I am a workout enthusiast suffering from a mild shoulder injury. I am also enrolled in a graduate anatomy and physiology course. I bought this book both as a means of showing me proper form so I can avoid further injury, and also as a supplement to my anatomy textbook.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautifully rendered. They are clear, articulate, and well defined. The captions that coincide with the illustrations are thorough and insightful. I learned a great deal about rotator cuff injuries and some new exercises to perform so I can avoid future injury and also rebuild muscle surrounding my injury.<br /><br />I keep this book out on my bookshelf and constantly use it as a study reference. It is fun to read, thorough, and educational. I will be buying other books by Frederic Delavier.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It kept me guessing all through the book, and the ending was pretty incredible!  I think that anyone would enjoy it.
0763660531|5.0|Very imaginative story. The imagery and story are wonderful, very simple and delightful. There are elements here from a lot of different stories and artists. My kids loved it.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game is so stupid. The idea is stupid and the controls are a joke. I am glad that I didn't pay for this game. Horrible.
B000OLX4SU|4.0|I found this really entertaining...Helena Bonham-Carter looks really great in this too :-)<br /><br />Great cast, good period-type costumes.<br /><br />Perfect for fans of the story.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It's a Great book!  Couldn't put it down!  Loved that it keeps you wondering and grabs you right from the beginning!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read about one Stephen King book per year, and somehow in between I always forget just how great a writer he is. This book is vintage King: scary in that in-your-head way of his that you can't get out of your head. He understands people, so the characters are great, but his imagination is just incredible, so the whole plot is insane, yet perfectly consistent and believable.

B008OHV5QO|5.0|Most of the other reviews here - of which there are plenty- seem to agree that this is a special film and one that no Neil Young fan would want to be without.<br /><br />In a nutshell I agree wholeheartedly and all I can add is to highly recomend to anyone wavering over this to jump right in and grab a copy.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I'm sure that when this device works it's great but as an IT professional, programmer, animator, and web developer who works for a fortune 100, I found no solution to make this device work. Nor would the support site point me in any direction for assistance. [...] At $35 it wasn't a huge loss but Google bet on pricing that card at $35 because it knew it wouldn't work in most situations. Instead it tells you to call your wireless router company instead. That's pretty bad service from a company that primes itself for being at the forefront of service and technology. Very disappointing. You get what you pay for.
