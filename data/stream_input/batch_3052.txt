B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This man is a genius.  Each of his books blows my mind a little more. Highly recommend buying any of Mr. Gladwell's books.
0385351399|1.0|Dear Mr. Eggs,    I am going pose something to you today which has not yet been done, but should have. Based on the pathetic title and scope of the Heartbreaking Genius blockbuster, I assume you are a frail man, emotionally and imaginatively, as I am yet to meet anyone 100% through puberty who finds any of your work interesting or worthwhile. For God's sake, what is McSweeney's anyway? Is this some reference to a Tim Burton character left on the animated film that could have been thriving in Spencer's Gifts or Hot Topic via t-shirt by now? As far as I'm concerned your two great accomplishments in life have been mentioning Shoah and Rising Up in your foreword to Infinite Jest - and yet why has Shoah been re-released, dutifully, by Criterion, while Rising Up has merely been reprinted abridged in some bogus edition, while all of this time you've been apparently working on equally bogus books.    I read The Circle on a combination of quadruple espressos, gin, and a single bite of naan/curry. I finished your little book in an hour and realized, again, the way you insist on mastering the capricious act of taking a dead concept (Its death in best case scenario brought on by prior archival finality in specific epic work(s) and re-writing it in the weakest voice possible.    For instance, Danielle Steel could have written A Heartbreaking Work, and just renamed it My Sorrows in San Francisco, and it would pass off unnoticed. Tao Lin could have written What Is The What and renamed it something equally idiotic, like, That is They Then, or, This Was Not That. A high school senior from some unknown town in Omaha could have submitted The Circle to McSweeney's and it would have been laughed out of the room. You are saying nothing new in terms of Western Society being doomed by technology. If you said a single thing no one already knew, your novel would have been great. Instead, you are merely fictionalizing the current merge of neofascist politics and hypersaturating technology. Ifwe want information and the past, present, future, we can read the works of journalists currently being killed and exiled and insulted by corrupt elites and pigheaded journalists submitting to The Lie in order to get another paycheck at the extent of destroying, leaving behind what it means to be an informer, a man of words, influence, honesty, in strict defiance of reality television, social networking, sites like Twitter which are designed to break thoughts in narcissistic limited futile shouts into the void conditioning the world at large that the upper echelon's rubber soul is the synthetic dogmatic concept of breaking the mind down into non-thought. Destroy critical thought is the ideology. Intelligence has been smashed into 'Speaking Out.' Is Speaking Out writing a book like yours? No. No one is getting anything new now, and a lot of teenagers look up to you the way they once did bands like Slipknot and Korn - mild messages from millionaires which last not too long.    I'm pretty surprised Dave Wallace was actually friends with people like you and Johnathan Frozen. The huge difference is that his books actually matter, whereas nothing you or Fronkzen write goes beyond, or shows reader things he hasn't seen before, or articulates emotions long lost in confusion and subconscious which it is the writer of literature and poetry to put together, through logical puzzles and ontological restructuring - Not, on the other hand, 'Ha! I bet Oprah's going to LOVE this! I bet my fourteen-year old sister is SO into the new Eggers book!'    Come on Dave. Write like an adult. Your so-called literature is nothing more than reincarnated albeit overly-sentimental concept of the pop-punk band. The Circle is like MXPX releasing a dystopian concept album no one could possibly give a s***about unless they were trying to recapture the time/money/brain cells spent on the book.    Consider this an open challenge. I dare you to write something intelligent next time. Write something mind-blowing or just don't bother.    This book reads like George Orwell and Aldous Huxley on a tandem bicycle on Zoloft running away from Neil Postman, drugged out, flaccid, forgettable. You should have spent the time it took to write this working out a way to reissue WTV's magnum opus, instead of mentioning it on occasion for anyone with like fifteen thousand dollars to spend on books, when yours aren't worth much more than fifteen minutes.    Sincerely    Mr. Healey.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am a slow reader, but this book had me up half the night turning pages. Great read, full of action . Did not want to put it down!
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|There is nothing that brings back cherished holiday memories and even creates new ones like classic Christmas songs. The Classic Christmas Album series gathers a career's worth of those precious holiday memories from the legendary Barbra Streistand. The original album was released in 1967 and You don't as well as I necessarily look for unusual interpretations of your Christmas music; you just want those old favorites sung well, and for the most part, that's what you got from Streisand. She leads off with \\"Jingle Bells?\\" In her own wonderful Barbra trademark humor while performing at a fast drive pace way and it even makes you laugh at how silly it is. Streisand gave her singing just enough personality without getting in the way of the familiar songs. They were trying to make a timeless classic, and that's what they achieved. This really reminds me of Christmas and you'll love it to.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great reading, a real page turner and good to learn the truth about what is really going on. Lots of material for discussion.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I waited so long for the ending to this trilogy that when it arrived I read the first half one night. I want to start off by saying that Veronica Roth is a wonderful writer.  I felt every emotion the characters felt. I loved the fact that. Roth allowed them to have feelings and thoughts way beyond their teenage years. Roth forces the reader to understand that, despite their young age, the world is so different and these kids have had to grow up fast. As an adult I appreciate this and can relate to it. I love the love between Tris and Tobias...its perfect first love chemistry and emotion. But its also real enough for readers of any age to relate to.<br /><br />Now my critique ...SPOILERS AHEAD!<br />I think the main plot (besides the love) lost its credibility and edge with the addition of so many sub plot conspiracies.  I get that once the group left the city they had to encounter conflict...but to find another war (gd vs gp)  within a war...just made me lose interest. I didn't care for Nita and did not see the point to her character. And David...I felt like I didn't know enough about him to understand the obsession behind his motives.  If he loved Tris mother so much that should have been the focus of his life mission to destroy Tris..or to save her.<br /> Caleb...he would have never accepted to sacrifice his life. I just didn't believe it. Same with Evelyn. She  hadn't been a mother in years, didn't think twice about her son during the war but all of a sudden she'll quit the life of endless power and ambition after ONE conversation?  I don't buy it. Same with Marcus.<br /><br />And of course Tris ' death. I understand why she had to die but the way she died was ridiculous.  After all those life threatening ordeals she went through,  2 random shots by a guy in a wheelchair kill her? And the fact that it was all in vain ...besides her friends, nobody else seemed to care?  And her last words for. Tobias...just the whole thing seem rushed. She deserved better...all her sacrifice,pain and loss should have been rewarded. She deserved a happy ending.  If not happy, than she should have given her life for Tobias or Cristina. That would have made everything come together.<br />Overall, the series is brilliant and I loved ever minute of it. I just do not agree with some of the choices Roth made for her characters....she lost what made each one sk strong or weak..that one trait that described them. And of course, I'll say it again, Tris deserved a better end.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The walking dead is the best show ever made. It is filled with action packed thrills and zombies. This really would be the life if we had a zombie outbreak
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I have a pounding headache from staying up two very late nights after my work days reading this book.  I \\"squandered it\\" really . . of course I should have taken my time but I couldn't.<br /><br />Fabulous -  I will re-read (very rare) - incredible talent from Donna Tartt.  I haven't read any reviews, I pre-ordered as I am always wanting Good Fiction and this is it.<br /><br />I want to know all of these people better.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's a good romantic read with very little plot aside from sex. Personally I didn't think the sex scenes were nearly as &#34;hot and bothering&#34; as a lot of people said.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Great movie. I was surprised, I didnt have high hopes for this movie but I really enjoyed it cant wait to see part 2.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|This was a great movie. You can't help but fall in love with the characters! Full of fun, laughs and the bloopers are great too!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a story of love.  A story of triumph.  I cannot fathom my thoughts on this book into constellations but I have some simple advice. R-E-A-D I-T
B00FX8EY60|4.0|Roar, Legendary Lovers, Unconditionally, By The Grace of God, and It Takes Two are the tracks I enjoy the most, with the first two tracks being really fantastic tracks. The rest of the album, however, is hit or miss. There aren't really any bad songs, but there's a lot of what feels like filler. Forgettable songs. They're entertaining enough to keep you listening the first few times, but I feel like I'll probably take them off my MP3 player after some time and focus more on the better songs. I feel like the album was released prematurely. There are good songs on this album, but there should have been more hits. However, I realize Katy was going through a rough period in her life while writing this album, so I'm willing to be slightly forgiving, but I don't expect there to be many hits on the radio from this album like the other two had. I'd say maybe two or three at most.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|i love playing candy crush. but the kindle needs to get on the . same page with king.com. i just finished level 420. i have played 85% on an actual computer because the kindle is so slow to update that it almost not worth it to have for the kindle
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good gameplay, and decent graphics. Wait times on builds is not outrageous and you don't have to spend real cash unless you want to. All in all this is a sweet game for war strategists everywhere.
B000TERDJS|5.0|This album is the first I always recommend to people who haven't heard of Brian Eno.  This set of 4 ambient pieces is great to listen to anywhere, anytime.  It will definitely relax you in any surrounding.  This here should be played in busy places just so people can chill out. His work with the synths and all is phenomenal.  One of Eno's best works in my opinion.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|Awesome record. Wish there were more obscure songs. I have some stuff that I thought would be on it. But The remastered record is  really good.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like it but I hate that you have to pay for going to the next level or facebook, if it wasn't like this then I would of given a 5
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I looked at this series many times over the last 5 months, always opting to go with another book that looked more likely and without such an odd title.  Glad to say I was wrong about this series.  Engaging, novel, well-written and satisfying.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Absolutely awesome. If you were a fan, this is a must have. Season 1 includes the 3 pilot movies along with the first season episodes. Picture is very good, better than I thought it would be for a mid-70's TV series. The sound is good, though it is not full surround, it was mastered in DD 2.0. If your receiver has the ability to convert to surround, it does sound good, but it sounds OK in just plain stereo also. Picture is in original 1.33:1 ratio, so there are sidebars but it goes top to bottom fully. I had given up on this making it to DVD several years ago, and didn't notice when it came out. Glad I stumbled across it.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|This was one of those books that absorbs you and all in our Book Club agreed. The twist at the end was completely unforeseen! A great read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|As with so many other movies attempting to cover too much ground, having to leave out crucial episodes and splice in unauthorized, (get it? un - author - ized) material to even out the flow of action, no matter how well done the cinematic event, the original provides so much richness, so much more insight to the character and even philosophy behind the plot(s).  So, please enrich your enjoyment of the movie --- read the book(s), and then, (ignoring the discrepancies --- they have to be there!), enjoy the movie that much more.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've been looking for a way to learn another language without paying a huge amount of money. This is everything I was looking for.
0891419195|5.0|Very interesting, informative. It brings you right to the battlefield in vivid detail. One has even more respect for those heroes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's addictive. Love it! Running out of retrys is frustrating.  Purchasing additional turns is an option I will not utilize.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|What a great album! Musically, it's very cohesive. I think all the tracks are perfect. Dark Horse is the track that sounds more out of place. Tracks 1-8 are just fun pop songs. 9-13 are very introspective; I think Ghost is one of the better tracks. Overall, I would definitely give it an A leaning toward an A+ if you are grading the album for its pop appeal!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I bought my Kindle Fire in July assuming I would be able to play candy crush but I was very sadly surprised that it was unavailable. I just saw today that it is finally available!!!  Yay!!  Now if Amazon would put Matching with Friends in the Appstore I would be a very happy customer In<br />deed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book...I really enjoyed learning more about Christian and his family. Thank you for the awesome look into who he really is.
B0049MPHH6|5.0|Every day should begin with a little Sedaris, I swear.<br />There is nothing in this book that could even begin to disappoint.<br />I have loved every minute of it (and I've been sitting in hospitals for much of my reading time, so that's saying something)<br />It's possible there could be tears once all Sedaris is exhausted.<br />\\"When you are engulfed in flames\\" is  truly transportative, compelling, hilarious.  A gem.<br />Hyperbole aside, I unabashedly recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />I've read reviews from some people who only gave this publication one star.<br />So while I say I'd recommend this to everyone, I'd probably exclude people with no sense of humour or appreciation for absurdities.<br />Those folk might find it all a bit confusing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I can't wait to read the others. The movie was good too. I can't wait for  the movie chatting fire to come out.
0007435185|1.0|This was listed as a &#34;graphic Novel&#34; it was not. This was just a way to charge extra for a book, shame on you Amazon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so amazing I can't even put into word how beautiful this story was! I would read it over and over again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun everyone should have this game.it is a mixture of  temple run and subway surfers.if you are now getting this game enjoy have fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved all 3 books.Took me a while to finally read them , but glad I did. Loved the characters of Christian and Ana. Beautiful love story. EL James I would certainly look forward to reading a 4th one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy. Now I can see the game on a larger screen. AMAZON ROCKS. I am 62 yrs old and love the game. Recommend it to all of the Ancient People of my age.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It's a good ending to this trilogy but it's redundant.  I got tired of hearing how perfect Christian was in everything he does
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Samsara takes you places that you would never know about. The cinematography is exceptional. It made us think about the true meaning of Samsara, &#34;circle of life&#34;.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I like playing this game, but there are some issues that need to be fixed. At times, if you touch tiles in the upper left quadrant of the screen, they don't become selected. I have to exit the app or touch the Hint icon to get the app to work again. I can't seem to find a way to turn the music off so I have to turn the volume down on my device.  On one of the layouts, the tiles act as if they exist on a different layer so you have to play tiles that sit under the affected layer. I paid for the game so I have a lot more layouts than the free game. All in all, the game is fun like most other Mah Jong games.  I wish there was an option to change the tile set.
8186336141|5.0|A very insightful book FULL of incredibly detailed information. The absolute guide book for all those starting a career teaching yoga like myself or those students whom are fascinated in learning more about yoga. Highly recommend the book!!
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Reading this book was like being in Australia - so descriptive about the sections of this vast country.  I recommend this author's book to those who enjoy non fiction books.  I have read many of his books, enjoy his humorous descriptions.  Bill Bryson is on my list of favorite authors, and I always search for new releases because I feel confident of a good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season One- incredible<br />Season Two- reaching a little<br />Season Three- back in form<br /><br />One of the most emotional episodes features the birth of Lord Grantham's first grandchild.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|intertwined storylines with each superhero.  the hulk is so awesome in this.  all the actors did a great job with each character.<br /><br />pretty cool graphics.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I was only able to play for the first half hour, before they ask you to buy the game. I'm hooked so I'm definitely going to purchase this game. You won't be sorry if you are into these types of game. Definitely a five star.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Great book!! Wonderful and funny characters that you instantly care for. A great coming off age book that will make you remember with fondness your own college years.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A story about a young girl with cancer doesn't sound like much of a beach read. Yet the writer gave her such humor and insight, that it was possible to see her story in the most positive light. Loved her, all the people around her, and her adventures.
1401944752|5.0|The complete course changed my life. ThetaHealing is the most amazing thing that could happen to me! After knowing all this information, I cn manifest anything I want.... ANYTHING!

B00C2VIA52|4.0|If you are looking for a fun rpg card game you should play this. I thought that this game was a lot of fun.
1490550623|5.0|This book really hit close to home for me. I completely know how it feels to stand up for what's right and get knocked down by authority. I'm really happy I ran into this book because it's speaking my kind of story. It seems these days no one fights for what's right, they're scared or afraid of doing the right thing. Hope the author is an attorney who isn't like that. Impressed with the vivid descriptions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun even if you don't spend a lot of money. Just be patient and enjoy the operent conditioning inherent in the system. seriously though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Intentionally or not, Collins draws out a gripping tale that uses an existent plan for humanity, called Agenda21/Sustainable Development. The Capitol is the elites who like this plan and everyone else in the &#34;districts&#34; are subjected to Orwell's future of humanity....a boot stomping on a human face forever. Creativity, self determination and initiative are totally destroyed. Misery is the standard fare, and tyranny is complete. However, it all ends up coming down to the consent of the governed, so there is hope. A good read at teenage level, but much deeper than it appears on its face.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|nice music, cant die or have to start over,just glide along, very relaxing, but a bit short, got through it too quickly
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like the game. There are a few I don't agree with. The banana values between baby and mom ratio wise is too great. Ratios should be. Reevalute the steps up.
0783240236|5.0|My favorite hitchcock film. Lots of extras very interesting and amusing. This may now be one of my favorite movies of all time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is really fun and a great game you should definately get it!! it is good for all ages it
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|You know unlike many people at the time I never disliked The Fragile. For me even though there were many track son that album that were very un-NIN like....for the most part Trent kept the tracks separate....with steady NIN songs stuck between intrumental piano compositions....<br /><br />On this album for the most part he has COMPLETLEY abandoned the classis NIN sound....some on here praise him for taking risks and being sure to sound different....that might be ok on side projects and EP's or the like....but when it is yoour signature flagship...to me you have an obligation to the fans that pay you for the music to at the very least stay true to your roots. It seems like Trent has fallen victim to the current trend of mainstream DJ created crapola....<br /><br />NO monster guitar riffs...no booming bass lines....just electronica like clicks and sequencers and DJ spinning BS....sorry but that is NOT NIN.<br /><br />I did not even have a problem with him labeling Ghosts I-!V as a NIN project as he kept his vocals off of that album...but this is NOT NIN.<br /><br />The only tracks worthy of a listen, tracks 1, 2 and 5. The rest is not all that great and tracks 7 and 8 are the most pussified I have EVER heard NIN sound. The only people that will dig that crap are the moronic break dancing kids on the current toyota commercial!<br /><br />If you are a hard core NIN fan and did not care for the Fragile....you better leave this one alone!
B00000IQV7|5.0|This movie was the perfect vehicle for Robin Williams, as he portrays a zany, albeit, caring person. The movie & Williams' performance in the movie, truly touched my heart. Not only does it have heart, but lots of humor and a touching bit of sadness.<br />All in all, it's a wonderful & I would definitely recommend it for all ages.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I have not been able to use this game for three months now. I contacted the maker and was told to wait for an update. I have been through four updates and the game still does not work. I have no faith in this maker.
6305428352|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is a movie that has it all - heart, humor, love, fun & excellent acting from all of the cast. Richard Dreyfuss is so very believable in his portrayal of a band teacher, a job that he took only as a short gig in his musical career. Over time, he realized that this job was his calling & in that position, he touched many lives.<br />This movie is definitely a must for any movie buff's collection. Great for all ages, too!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It might be more fun if the lives you purchase lasted longer. As it is lives run out in about 5 minutes and then you get to wait for 20 before you can play charge free again.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|M. Preston and is Partner  do have a vivid imagination and write good books, but I beleive sometime they push  a bit to far. Pendergast is not a human he is a supernatural superman and sometime is does bother me. But still a good book, while the precedent was deceiving
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I loved this book. Whenever there was a rebel attack everything got more interesting. There were some points where times got boring but, after a few pages it would get good again. Now I know for a fact that in the selection the game was really on.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app. I can sort out my notes for school along with errands and bills I have to keep up with. I would. love to be able to bullet my notes and also change the font size of some words rather than the whole document.  highlighting would also be another cool.feature as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got exactly what I expected:<br /><br />- Cheap solution for viewing youtube and netflix on my TV.<br />- Easy to install and handle.<br />- HDMI!<br /><br />Great value in a small device.
B00355L2TU|4.0|this is a good solid workout.  the 3 levels let's you continue to mix it up even after the first 30 days. some of Jillian's comments are annoying (especially when you hear them over and over and over...). but after a while you may know the routines well enough to switch to the music only version.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Good read like the others.  But was very disappointed with how she wrapped up some of the characters stories. Hated the ending!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have to tell you I was very skeptic buying these headphones.  I Googled \\"Rate Top 10 Headphones\\" and the Sony MDR7506 was rated #1 in 3 different rating sites.  Out of all the top 10, it is far cheaper priced than any of the rest INCLUDING my Bose Quiet Comfort II headphones that are $299.  All Bose equipment has the same price no matter where you buy it.  Just because it says Bose on it does not mean it is the best.  My ear cups fell apart after a few years of barely using them and I needed to buy another headphone set as Bose will not sell parts.  They make you buy completely new equipment.  The only thing you can buy is aftermarket junk that does not fit properly.<br />I am glad I took the time to look online.  These Sony Headphones are dynamic in sound and without a doubt, several classes up in quality over Bose and all the rest in the survey that were ALL at least $200 more.  Save the money if you are considering Bose or Beats or any other brand.  For $77 you can get these Sony's and they will blow you away with perfect crisp sound.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I just a true shame this band is not recognizance for the amazing talent they are. The Music (Brian, Scott, Mark *Myles*) and voice from Myles is just plain engulfing. Whether it's old songs or new ones they really just have a way to suck you in and take you for a ride. There hasn't been many group that really... hmm how to explain... Hit the nerve on a note or lyric that makes you get hooked to a song.. Myles's voice and delivery is F'ing amazing... I do anything via Facebook or word of mouth to spread them... Again its a shame they never have caught on for what they have shown to me what they are..
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|It was OK, but not great.  I was alittle disappoint in the movie wasn't what i was inpecting.I  won't watch it again,
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To say that I like Fifty Shades of Grey would be an understatement! I LOVED it! I couldn't put it down! I read the entire trilogy in less than a week. It was bittersweet to read it so fast because I loved it and I couldn't put it down but I didn't want it to be over!
B00BCX2F66|5.0|The case is very functional and protective<br />Very happy with the purchase i would reccommend it to other costumers and it also looks good to
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. Period. It is one of my favorite trilogies that I have ever read. I cannot wait for the movie!
B00DURHYWC|3.0|This is the first Pink Martini album I've ever regretted buying.  Love all the songs with China Forbes singing, but the rest I pretty much skip past.  The male vocals just don't work for me..sorry.  If I wanted a Rufus Wainwright cd, I would have bought a Rufus Wainwright CD...ditto the other 'guest artists'.  At least we can be thankful that Storm Large isn't singing about her 8-Mile Wide Vajayjay this time around...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just silly and fun to play! The Minions facial expressions and reactions are hilarious!!! Always makes me laugh even when I lose :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Less time between lives would be more than welcome I am playing on my phone and finally my kindel fire.and I still run out of lives help me with this....
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This was a fast paced zombie thriller. I would have liked more detail, even if the movie was longer. The only thing I didn't like was that there were a few scenes that were identical to The Walking Dead, on Sundays at 9PM, on AMC. I am hooked on that series. That is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. Otherwise it was a great zombie thriller. Not a gory movie. Would recommend for 13 plus.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this a lot but it doesent seem to give me my lives from friends to soon.<br />otherwise i love<br />the size of theboard. very easy to see
B00BNWWUDY|5.0|I found this movie excellent. A lot of twists and turns. Good actors. A shocker of a medical thriller. Would Definitely recommend to most except children.
B0000687L5|4.0|Very good movie, entertaining and a good story line also. The music is also very good in this movie. Good acting.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I chose 2 stars because it was boring for the most part and had a HORRIBLY disappointing ending! I loved the first two books and have been waiting for this book for well over a year! I agree with most of the other reviews that this book was the last one I will be reading from this author. She took a great story with tremendous potential going into the third and final book and killed it.... literally.<br /><br />Anyone who has read this series in it's entirety won't be going to see the movies. A) it's a huge waste of time and B) a huge waste of money.<br /><br />Disgusted with this book. SMH
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Great read! If you like super hero books and you are a Sanderson fan then I would definitely recommend this book. Keep in mind that the target audience is young adults so don't expect it to be something that it's not.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Again I think it was me with the problem with getting into my e-mail so I really can't say anything about this I put it on and took it right off so I'm not goin tobe very helpful.Thanks God Bless
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy it FINALLY came to my kindle fire. Having fun running out of lives I played so much You got me again Mr King
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is a metaphor extended through generations---in the doublespeak of Animal Farm. Totalitarianism crushes the life out of millions while assuring them of their good fortune. One man alone sees the ironic truth that total sacrifice can lead to freedom...coming from a beginning point in which he has less than nothing to the Point of lacking nothing.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|it didnt work at all. it wasn't compatible to most of my things plus it kept freezing my stuff even when i didnt have it open so i had to delete it.
B00BX8PG4S|2.0|I bought this DVD on the basis of previous reviews and whilst I did 'somewhat' enjoy watching it, I felt that it was by no means the \\"absolute thriller\\" and \\"awesome cold war\\" movie that such reports portrayed. David Dushovny's first appearance was simply embarassing (due mainly to his appalling attempt to speak with a Russian accent)and his acting was very VERY wooden - HOWEVER - to his credit his acting slowly grew on you and towards the end he did finally portray a reasonably good (SPOILER......) evil man - not his best work that I've seen (2.5/10)<br /><br />The fact that all the Russian's were portayed by American actors, who constantly spoke with American idioms (ie saying the word \\"crewmate\\" instead of \\"comrade\\" which is a Russian verb at its purest) detracted from this movie and indicated the glaring inadequacies liberally sprinkled throught this film. This film could have been an excellent 5 star movie indeed; it portrayed a little known cold war atomic (not nucular) 'missadventure' that could have nastly blown out to cause WW3 - on an atomic scale (parden the pun). With such an interesting topic to create a film around its a pity that not enough was done to develop more authentic aspects to carry the film just that much further in the enjoyment factor. Ed Harris (8/10)- well I can't remember a bad film he has ever done and in PHANTOM he quite literally carries the whole move on his shoulders (if Ed was missing I shudder to think of how bad this film would have actually been).<br /><br />PHANTOM is a somewhat enjoyable film; the actors make it worthwhile watching and its one easily watched, but so much the better if you know/understand the context of the time(s) and socio-political background when this 'incident' occured as it helps to brush over the short-comings of the film. I have bought it to add to my collection; however, it will be a film that I'll only ever watch again if I have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE to watch at the time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This information is completely in line with all I have learned about the spiritual world. Dr. Alexander's report is much more than just another heart warming NDE book. This is a no-nonsense, not religious-biased revelation that is for all people who are ready to learn more about our spiritual universe and the unconditional love that powers all creation.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I like this game but I think the game should have trading in this game. Can you please add that.
006202406X|5.0|This is an amazing story, and that's what it should be acknowledged for. Just because it didn't end the way most people wanted it to makes it an awful book? No. This is a beautiful ending; though painful. Most of the reviewers are angry and haven't calmed yet to think over it. I'm still upset of course, you're supposed to be upset. But I think undermining this book because it doesn't have the typical YA cliche of an ending most were expecting is infantile.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Reminded me of MIB. It was good but not good enough for me to buy the blu-ray and watch again
B006WAIUEK|5.0|It's what you'd expect from Welsh, in that you'll be surprised, amused, revolted, and identifying with some seriously flawed characters, all the while getting a history lesson.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game!!! glad I can now play it on my kindle as well as my phone!!! now I can play twice as much
B00DMEQP46|5.0|I highly recommend this! MGMT seems to improve with each album. This album has such a sixties Floyd feel to it.
0060012234|5.0|Really good book. A must have for teens in there library. When I first read it at the school library I knew I was going to be buying it
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I don't usually like hunting games but this one made me happy since the great animation. And all the other great stuff
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Makes you think quick and respond in a manner that keeps you interested and motivated to continue. Is a great tool during down time.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|great read.  I know it is targeted for young adults but I'm an old adult and I loved it.  Would recommend
B00DU77QP2|5.0|I enjoy these type of books and found it a very good read.  Cannot wait to read the rest of the series.
B001UG4VWQ|1.0|I didn't notice that I couldn't play it in United States, and it cost more to ship it back than I paid for it.  Maybe someday when I go to Europe I can play it or give it to someone who lives there.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like this one a lot. The graphics are wonderful on my kindle fire and it really adds to the gameplay.<br />Pros:<br />  -Improved graphics<br />  -More In-depth (curves and such)<br />  -A lot of ability options<br /><br />Cons:<br />  -Sometimes when a gem is available while running it becomes hard to guess when to jump (that might just be me). It seems to be a depth perception kinda thing.<br /><br />That's my only gripe. Fix that offer get me some glasses and it'll get 5 stars. Jk! :) very fun, very addictive!
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|The old Hangover crew was following the ten steps AAA rehab. There is hardly any alcohol drinking in this movie, no party - except for Chow - and no hangover. Not funny!
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|I liked the overall plot, takes todays social media issues to an extreme level.<br /><br />However the actual writing was tough to stay with. The character development was odd...one minute Mae is this way, next minute she is second guessing herself and losing her mind.<br /><br />I have a tough time putting down a book, even if I am not really enjoying it. Same with movies, I watch a bad movie all the way through, optimistically thinking it will get better. The Circle really did not for me. The ending was just strange. It didn't feel like the book ended, but next page were the Author's Thank You notes...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well, it's hard to not have strong emotions when you read a story about the horrendous times of Hitler. At first I had to get used to way the story was being told, but after you realize the perspective from which it's being told, it all makes perfect sense. I'm looking forward to the movie release and will be interested to know if this beautiful, creative story can be told in the same way.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Can't wait for the musical.  Wonderful, storytelling songs that are rich in British shipbuilding culture.  Sting paints pictures with these songs.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This film really gets you thinking about our common humanity in a world where we normally pass by strangers each day without a care in the world. This is very dark, however, with few light moments. Prepare to cry.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|A very simple, smooth game. No freezes, no problems as yet. I love the worldwide high scores. Also enjoying the many diversified game offerings! This is definitely my .favorite mahjong game in my Apps so far, so thanks so very much for your wonderful efforts!
B0058SNI94|4.0|I can't decide if they are a fit or not.  Very snug at the top.  I may have to trade them in for a bigger size.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I found book one an engaging action yarn. Book two was ok, but one could see where the story was heading. Book three was starting to look like a good wrap up for the trilogy, but seemed to turn into a teen romantic novel. This is the first book I have purchased by this author; won't be back.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|THIS PROCESSOR, MADE MY DAY, LOVE IT, FAST PC, I HAVE THE OPTION TO EXPAND IT,. VERY SURPRISED  WITH THE SPEED OF THE PROCESSER
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Excellent movie. A little different from the book but still very good. I would definitely recommend to others. I enjoyed it very much.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Oh dear. This was a difficult book for me. I did not like the main character Victoria, or her foster mother, Elizabeth. The story is well written and drew me in at first and I found it fascinating and difficult to put down because I wanted to find out what was going on. Then it became difficult to read because I realized what was going on. Victoria, who had spent her entire life in the foster care system after being abandoned as an infant had her last chance to be adopted at age 10 by a woman named Elizabeth. The story is told in flashbacks from Victoria's adult life beginning at age 18 back to her childhood then her year spent with Elizabeth. While I understood Victoria's childhood decisions, I was appalled by some of her actions that she took as an adult. The book is wonderfully written and I understand why many people like it, but at the same time, it was also very difficult. I enjoyed seeing the different meanings of flowers and thought that was an interesting thing to include.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|True to Eggers form, The Circle manages to be both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. It's not without its problems (typos, in specific, really glared midway through the book), but The Circle manages to be an entertaining and thought-provoking read about what might be our biggest asset going into the mid 2000s: maintaining privacy. If you're like me and finished this cover to cover in a few days, you'll be happy to know that the premise will stick with you long after you've closed the final chapter.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow makes you think, and it's fun! The visual effects are so cool to look at. Toddlers to senior citizens can play.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|The only readon I gave one star us because you can't give it zero stars.  I've already deleted the app
B001DF68MA|5.0|I love this product it exceeded my expectation, was super easy to install, the quality is very high and its very sturdy, my daughter love sitting in it the padding is very comfortable for her, I highly recommend it, I also prefer the position its placed on the bicycle in my opinion its better than having her sit at the back end of the bike.
B00E00RB5I|4.0|Solid new album with a legacy sound. This is well worth the purchase! Definitely in my queue of feel-good tunes!
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|I downloaded Notepad pro ++ and started a grocery list.  I was very happy with it at first.<br /><br />Then it started changing the spelling of words I put in, especially brand names.  How do I change the settings so I can turn off automatic spelling or whatever it's called???<br /><br /> If I can't type in what I want and get what I typed in, it's not that valuable to me.
0470570954|5.0|If you need to get caught up on modern biochemistry then this is the book to start before foraging through the modern journals. The only complaint as others have pointed out, is that the last 3 chapters are not included and have to be downloaded from the publisher's website, but that is no biggie . You probably won't reference those chapters too much anyway unless you are interested in a specific topic in them but they are shallow compared to the rest of the text.<br /><br />Just start with this book if you are already familiar with biochemistry and need more information. This is a great reference text for a lab or anyone.<br /><br />IF you are new to the whole topic and your teacher is not recommending this book then buy a simpler text like Lehninger's biochemistry which is a decent introduction.  This book is way better but it is far more awful to read cover to cover and then be tested over. You really also need the study guide or problem book with this book if you have to use it for a class.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Vintage King at its best, that little boy from &#34;The Shining&#34; turned out just fine!  Like many of King's works before, this one would make a great movie if he can keep Hollywood from messing it up!
0395389496|5.0|Thank you for the prompt shipment and delivery of this beautiful book.  I have always loved Polar Express and this was the perfect gift for a friend.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I agree with many others who love this series.  I could not put the first two books down.  For this book, the plot was slow to develop.  I liked the idea of where the story was going.  I do not think she stayed true to the characters in the end.  Maybe the ending most of us wanted seemed to easy and perfect.  I'm okay with a less than perfect outcome if it was exciting and plausible.  I don't think even Peter was true to his character in the end.  Just bizarre.
B004LUS390|5.0|the interface had so many options that it can be a little overwhelming at first if you want not used to these kind of applications but take the time to learn it and you will find a program that is practically limitless
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book is far deeper than just a zombie war.  It is really about human nature, the way governments and business work, and we can both turn against each other, and rally to each other, in times of crisis.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was inspiring and encouraging. I started embracing my curls 100% about halfway through this book. It is an easy read and so helpful. This book provides knowledge and tips that you can/will really use. I encourage you to buy for yourself or a friend that has curly hair!! Enjoy
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Always been a big Don Quiote(sp) fan and this book knocks down several myths and shows that anyone is capable of achieving their goals and making a difference.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Waited for this book to release and was disappointed! Loved the characters and lessons learned about life, character and the true meaning of unconditional love. However, I'm not a fan of Nicholas Sparks's style endings... A sad way to finish Tris's story.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|A young girl with such insight, sadness, hope and a love of people, even those like the Taliban , who from my perspective, are demons.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|this is a permanent fixture.  simple and easy to mount.  it would be nice if it uses the screw type tightening system in the short double socket.
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|The author does a great job giving you the foundation and Advanced skills of Affirmations. There is no doubt this will help those new to the topic or everyday users. It is nicely divided into chapters that can be used as reference for the future. Good Stuff.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun it's crazy.  Even my kiddos can enjoy.  It is addictive.  I just wish I could more coins for free to use for the other minions.. down load this game it's worth out
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS GAME,but my husband's upset because e he's being ignored,ha ha!!!<br />I have to force myself to put it down!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable met all expectations and I really enjoy the extra length that the cable provides over my original cable.
B00BOU3U2A|5.0|This is Jethro Tull's best album, and one of the albums that defined a generation. Put on a pair of headphones, crank up the volume, and sit back and flow with the music.
B004H51706|5.0|My 6 year old son got this as a present and he LOVES his new Land Rover.  Like most Bruder Toys, which are made in Germany, this Land Rover is very well build.  So many parts come apart, like the doors, back seats, extra tire, etc.  Bruder made it look exactly like the real one.  It is very refreshing to still find toys that are NOT made in China that last for a long time even after hits, falls, etc.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The Kindle copy of Candy Crush Saga is so much nicer than the computer one.  It is so nice and big and you can find the matches because the are clearer and more colorful.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Beautifully done and very addicting. Very good physics and easy to pickup and play. I do recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games.
6305428352|5.0|A well acted story on significance---why are we here and what difference does it make!<br />What we think we want to be and what we become has much to do with how we tackle our inner life, life commitments and talents. As a great philosopher has said: &#34;we live life forward, we understand life backwards.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Need more than 5 lives at a time, especially since it takes so long to get more lives.<br />Sometimes when a new game is supposed to start, we receive an Error message and that causes the game to be lost - very frustrating
B005544TRQ|5.0|The character development is awesome.It glorifies the business of law a bit, but it is built for entertainment. The strategies that go into the plot development are very heavy.  I appreciate the attention to detail on character development as well.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Where do I begin, it was horrible. Don't waste your time or money. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because Roth definitely wrapped it up in the end. Although I hated the ending, the beginning and middle put me to sleep. I can't believe that they would publish that book, even my teenage son thinks it was \\"blah\\". Total waste of a few hours of my life I can never get back. I really liked the Born Trilogy by Tara Brown, she even gives an alternate ending option.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved every bit of it. Strayed managed to keep my interest all throughout the book, and to wait anxiously as to what would happen in the end. I tend to read the last chapter of a book before I finish it (awful habit), but this time I waited until it was time to do so!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Exelent movie<br />One of the best this year due to the special effects, i dont rate movies exep this one!
B005PZ857K|5.0|I love all the actors & actress in the show. I watch every season. If I could I would own all the seasons on DVD.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Love this album, keep listening to it, and watching the documentary, and rediscovering new things. It comes in a paper case, if that's a concern. It's not very sturdy, but a lot of bands have been doing this lately. So many musicians performed on this album, it really is an amazing musical journey.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this was...  it did not have the normal idiotic pandering to the masses that the normal sci-fi's do. Which is why it probably got a lot of bad reviews by Sheople. If you want a good solid movie that actually follows a story line and the science stays in the bounds of believable, then watch this. You are in for a treat. Might even bring out a tear or two by the end...
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|This is not a typical movie telling a story, but the images are beautiful and much is left to your imagination.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game looks a lot like from the movies reminds me of both of them as a matter of fact I downloaded Despicable Me 2 and it was AWESOME.!!! EVIL MINIONS RULE BABY!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Myself and All of my kids enjoy this game. Ranging from all ages. The hardest part is getting them to take turns. I hope they come out with more levels!
068485743X|5.0|The book came highly recommended by James Rollins, New York Times best selling author, at a recent gathering of aspiring writers. Most books on writing tend to be very general, and fall short in terms of concrete advice. This one did not. Packed full of  insights, probably the best book I've read about the art and craft of writing. If you're serious about improving your work, check it out.<br /><br />-Daniel, California Writer's Club, Sacramento.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A beautiful story of relationships- family, cultural, in both a personal & work environment. A young woman is hired by the well to do mother of a quadrapaelegic to care for her son. It is interesting to watch her growth & maturity develop as her relationship with her &#34;patient&#34; developed. It is truly a story of sadness, pain, love, happiness & understanding.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you loved the Shining or even if you didn't, this book is about Danny....REDRUM....  He's all grown up now but the &#34;fun&#34; doesn't stop.  This is a book that you'll have a difficult time putting down.

B000LX00RY|5.0|Great Perf ALL AROUND a great foray into the World of FASHION AND RELATIONSHIPS, Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway are Queens of Talent!
0451450523|5.0|Where do I start on how beautiful this book  is? I can not put any words to the poetry of Peter Beagles writing, other than perhaps: wonderful. I first saw the movie as a child, since then it sparked in me a love of unicorns, magic, and wonder in the possible world around us that has not faded in 20 years. I re-read this book when I feel the world is dulled because it illuminates the possible magic that people just no longer see, when I was a child in the redwoods my father used to tell me its where some of the last unicorns live, and still somewhere in my heart I feel for Molly, it would be the last unicorn that would show herself to me, but even when I am old and gray I'll be waiting. If you had been waiting to see a unicorn, as long as I have...<br /><br />&#34;I can feel this body DYING all around me!&#34; a line that scared me when I was young, but it sparked a good conversation about how we live short lives, to be brave, to adventure. I may make lots of references to my childhood and this book but I tell you: read this to your kids. Some of my best memories of my dad are of the stories and talks we had about them, and the best was this story.<br /><br />This book created some of my best dreams and after reading it I always feel a sense of renewed vigor, the story may not end perfectly but it adds a touch of realism to a magical world. It is more a story of hope, adventure, and bravery than many modern &#34;fairy tales&#34; that will make your sons into magicians and knights and your daughters into dreamers that hold the innocence of still believing in unicorns, hardened with bravery and love of adventure.<br /><br />Read this, you will love it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's kind of a cool game, much like Piyo Blocks (which I think I like better). Here's what bothers me:<br /><br />- instructions are unclear (no explanation of why a level was not passed to improve your chances the next time)<br />- seems to allow you to play only a limited number of times before you have to pay to continue (or wait 20 minutes or so)<br />- slow loading game screens, and annoying character pops up at the beginning to tell you what to do, AGAIN<br /><br />For a free game, it's pretty good, but it won't be a favorite of mine.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is amazing. By far the best book I've ever read. So much wisdom knowledge and insight. This has helped my personal growth and help save and better some relationships not only with my man but with family and friends. I would love a session with Gary he is Amazing...
1908538090|5.0|Judging by the other reviews here, Amazon has almost zero readers able to overcome their century or so of brainwashing about Hitler and Jews. The fact is we are in something like a Reformation, targeted against Jews as the earlier Reformation was targeted against Catholics. Who will win, how long it will take, and what the costs in body counts and destruction will be, cannot be predicted. The book is well worth reading, though volume II is of most interest to the few people wanting to establish a new political party. Volume I has a lot on Austria and Hungary, not Germany, which was something like a multicultural state. It also has Hitler's World War I experiences, and expresses his regret or puzzlement over the survivors, many of whom rather than die dodged the fighting. Most of his comments show a grasp of true Jewish 'ethics'. It is of course pre-WW2 and pre-'Holocaust'. (I have a much longer review on big-liesdotorg, too long for here).<br /><br />Americans are probably more sophisticated about Hitler and Churchill than Britons, many of whom still have no idea about either of these.  Let's hope so, anyway.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved this book. The set up of this book took me back at first never read anything broken into character chapters but it worked. Sad to see it end.
006202406X|5.0|**SPOILER ALERT**  I have loved this series from day one and truly anticipated Allegiant. After reading some of the reviews I was reluctant in continuing reading any more of the book. I was sad to find out the ending and Hoped that by some far distant miracle it wasn't true.  But after abruptly finding out what happened I almost got closer to all the characters and loved them even more with every sentence I read. It was almost like knowing you didn't have much time with someone so you made the best of the time you knew you did have. I enjoyed every moment from that point on. I finished the book and felt satisfied with the ending. Although not the ideal but real. Selfishness is Bravery and Tris showed that to the core. Loved it. And those of you who don't like the ending.... It's all about your perspective. Death is a part of life and although painful for others... Death brings perspective to life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I talked a lot of scrap about this game but then I couldn't put it down! It is what seems like endless fun and addicting puzzll
B0089LOG02|5.0|great story about a subject i knew nothing about.....orphan trains that ran in the late 1800's-early 1900's from the east coast to the midwest. amazing tale of how kids during that era grew up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you or your child love temple run and despicable me, this game is for you. It is action packed and full of awesome and funny animations you will not find anywhere else. It will keep you or your kids entertained for hours
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|GREAT game.  Match 3 - or 4 or 5 - with clear, manageable levels.  No waiting for lives or special Quests. You can play until you choose to quit.  This game plays well on my Kindle Fire HD.  I purchased the two previous versions of this app and was excited to see a new game.  This game stands alone. No begging friends on FB.  No limited lives. Good graphics.  Well worth the 99&cent; to me.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I had been playing littlest pet shop and I saw a commercial for this game and I knew I would love it. I got it that day and it has been the best game on my kindle ever since. There is one slight problem though, all of the ponies that I really want to get cost hearts by being on social networks or you have to win them in balloon pop. I can't complete the Cutie Mark crusaders because Scootaloo costs hearts and that is a real bummer. It is an awesome game and everyone should play it.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This was a fun movie, love Dave.  Way to go man.  Watch this is you have any passion for music.
0761174192|5.0|We bought the 2014 calendar because we love the 2013 calendar.  The daily photo are delightful and cute. I plan to buy several for Christmas gifts.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works good for kindle. I like the blue numbers. It works as long as your kindle is in sleep mode and sound is turned up. I really like it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I wanted to brush up on my French and Spanish.  I didn't realize how much I'[d forgotten.  This free course is<br />just what I need and I'm enjoying it and learning.  I've seen other expensive courses, but having this on my tablet<br />and I-phone I find myself using it while waiting at the dentist's or when I have just a few minutes.  Also when I have<br />plenty of time and want to really concentrate on my own pronunciations and verb endings, etc.  This is the best &#34;bargain&#34; on the language apps.  Love it.
B00B52F278|5.0|What can be said about this show.  We loved the show and sad to see it go, but hope the writers come up with something having to do with his son.  Also in the book I'm reading Killing Jesus it talks about Caesar and Spartacus.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The story is interesting and it make you want to pursue your reading!  I like the comparasion done about a specific and real event in the world and the fiction of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one very addicting game. Fun, challenging and fun.  I would rate it higher of possible.  Though it makes me angry my 5 yo is better at it than me. Great job.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Had the ending made sense, it is likely I could have forgiven what I consider to be an illogical and hole-filled plot that bordered on comical at points in how different it was from the first book, Divergent. I did not enjoy the second book, Insurgent as much as I enjoyed Divergent, but still eagerly anticipated the closing book to this series. I now question whether I will read any of these books ever again. I cannot ever see myself revisiting Allegiant, but hey, they already have my money from the physical book purchase and again for a kindle version purchase, so I suppose that doesn't matter to Roth or her publisher.<br /><br />The only conclusion I can come to on the end of this book is that the writer and her publishers were trying to shock us as readers. Will, mission accomplished. I was shocked. And dismayed. I feel Roth broke the cardinal rule in YA. I won't get into that as it would spoil the end of the story, but the ending of the book felt like a cop out in almost every way imaginable. This should serve as a cautionary tale for other YA writers shock value to get attention for a day will probably hurt the book in the long run. I don't think I will ever read anything Roth writes again. I just can't trust her to be fair to the characters. They are her characters and she can do what she wants with them, but it is my money, and she will not be seeing any more from me. I won't be seeing the movie either, because, what's the point? I hope it was worth it.<br /><br />I just feel so let down and sorry for these characters. They deserved better than their fate. The writing was confused and it was difficult at points to determine whether it was Tris or Four's voice in a chapter. The sounded so similar to me at points. While I appreciated the more adult nature of their relationship in working through arguments and the like, I never found myself moved by their arguments and or the resolutions to those arguments. It seems that every problem had a very simplistic solution and that seemed to be because Roth tried to cram too much plot into too small a space, so the resolutions seems too easy and hollow.<br /><br />It is just too bad. I so rarely write reviews, but I am so terribly disappointed by the ending of this book, I can't help but share my experience with others.  I am very sorry to have to write this review. I had such high hopes this story would have a satisfying ending.ion and that seemed to be because Roth tried to cram too much plot into too small a space, so the resolutions seems too easy and hollow.<br /><br />It is just too bad.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Because reading is so completely subjective. So much of what I love, others hate.<br /><br />I checked the average rating for this book before starting it - and I wish I hadn't. I inadvertently read a huge spoiler and wondered if the story was ruined for me.<br /><br />It wasn't.<br /><br />I felt the story stayed true to the first two books in the series, it was a good (although sad) conclusion. We got all of our answers, and resolution.<br /><br />Was the &#34;good people are really bad people&#34; story line a bit tired? Yes, it was (to me). But that doesn't make the book (or series) bad in any way. It kept my interest, kept me emotionally invested and entertained me. Those are three very important qualities that I need in a book.<br /><br />Do recommend.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My kids love this dvd...It was hard to find in the stores, but easy to find on Amazon Good for the price and a good addition to a dvd collection.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I can see why there are so many bad reviews, because often it is hard to give honest judgement when clouded by emotions. It is a painful book to read, but marvelous storytelling. A great, strong, heartwrenching ending.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I had to get this dvd when I saw a color version of this movie on tv. The color version is just fantastic, and the movie a classic and a must for Christmas time. One of my favorite Christmas movies. This come with both the black and white, color version and a music cd from the 1940s full of Christmas music. Just a great package!
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|If you want to see The Great Gatsby,your choice should be the original,with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford. Sure,the new Gatsby,played by Leonardo D'Caprio is a very good performance but it is Mia Farrow,in the original film,whose performance is Oscar worthy! I'm not knocking Cary Mulligan,as she does an adequate job but it was Mia's Daisy that stoled the entire movie! Mia was able to capture the subtle nuances of a very spoiled woman,and yet a woman pure of heart. This is tough to do and,in my opinion Mia wins hands down.
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|I think this game is  a addictive game witch is why i gave it a one star but let me just say the amout of times this game has crashed on me is teribble. It also runs poorly on my kindle fire HD and it us very laggy but all of my other app run perfect so i do not recommend this app
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought the alternating chapters was a great way to develop both points of view.  The story was full of surprises and the characters were developed with stealth and style.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is really awesome and I love the graghics they are pretty coolif their was a billion stars to rate I would!!!!
B000I186FW|3.0|I guess if you are NOT looking for a five star blow away movie, this will work. Kind of slow in parts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I understand why kids spend so much time playing video games.<br />My boys now describe me as a gamer. LOL
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Match-three game lovers will enjoy this game. It has all the elements that make a match-three game fun plus a few other elements to make it unique. Each level gets a little more difficult. The player has to make additional matches nearby to free up the locked tiles. Each round earns bricks which then build up houses for fairies (or maybe the comical creatures are elves.) The game gives you options for difficulty so that a player who prefers an simpler game can choose the easy level while a more experience player can select a more difficult level. The graphics are pleasant. As usual Big Fish delivers an excellent game.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Its nice as an idea, but you can often lose it as its not leashed to your hand... I think hand bracelets are better
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love this game.my grandchildren are also able to play. It is that simple, but still challenging for adults.just wished you had more puzzles.
B000000OQF|3.0|I love rock n' roll and metal. As a matter of fact I've been a fan of hard rock and metal since around the time this album came...or actually a sometime before this album came out. Now...I'm sure many will shoot me down for this but even when I was 13... oh, so many years ago I thought this album was just ok. Sure it had great songs like Welcome to the Jungle and Sweet Child O' mine but other songs ..to me at least seemed just ok when compared to other songs that existed at that time. If you're tired of the crap that is being played on the radio this is not a bad album to check out. If anyting, if you're new to hard rock/metal you may actually love this album but then again...like I said there have been , in my opinion, other hard rock/ metal albums with less filler songs.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|Great take on Greek mythology. Great action scenes, but the movie's pacing does kinda slow down in the middle. The final fight scene with the gods and titans was one of the best fight scenes i have ever seen in 3D.
B007THA4FI|4.0|the darker sides of Muggles, w redemption at a steep price, told w nuance in a complex structure. worth reading!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Now when i first heard about Tom Cruise playing as the iconic Jack Reacher i was very surprised because i have read some of the books ( This movie is based on Lee Child's Novels ) and the character Jack Reacher was put in our minds as a very big tall 6'5 retired mp. Tom Cruise did not fit that persona so i was very skeptical to see him take on this role. To my amazement Tom did a very good job and the movie was excellent in my eyes.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I believe that this book is so interesting and is one of those book  I just can't put down. Great job once again rick
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was a great experience and can't wait to read the next enders game, and my favorite part was when he found out he was killing real nuggets.
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|been waiting forever for this album and was worth the wait. Every song sounds so much different from the next. it's a trip. But it shows the maturity and general versatility of Davey and the boys. Well done AFI. Bravo!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enjoyed the entertwining of stories and how they all led to a little village and an individual who left a letter connecting all the dots!  Amazing story of soul searching, truth, understanding and love.  What a great writer!  Can't wait for Mr. Hosseini's next book!  Thank you for exposing me to a different world, not always to good place, but certainly a world of truth and that love is every where.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It won't take you long to get through this book, but may take you a little while to get into it.<br />Took me about 40pages before the book had my attention, but after that, it was done in a day.<br />Great book for a couple of purposes.<br />You want a book to read at the same time as someone else to discuss after. Personal book club is something my girlfriend and I do.  We take turns picking a book to read and then discuss once finished.  One of those neat relationship ideas that maybe someone else will find helpful. :)<br />You want a book that you can finish on a weekend getaway, couple of days off, etc...<br />Interesting and fantastical concepts, but I do not want to get into the plot, because that was part of the enjoyment for me, not knowing what to expect.<br />Cheers,<br />BSR
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Many \\"review colleagues\\" have already described the content of the book. I have nothing to add there.<br /><br />This is one of the best Grisham books I have ever read, and I have read them all. Good to see that Mr Grisham after all the years and all these books is still able to write such an enthralling stuff. I am looking forward to the next book.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I agree with many of the reviews here. Tris and Tobias felt like the same person, and I would often forget from which point of view I was reading. The story was also surprisingly boring. I couldn't put the other two books down, but I closed this book after a few chapters and didn't bother returning until the next day. I felt I had to finish it, but didn't want to and shouldn't have. I was constantly annoyed with the behavior of Tris and Tobias, as well as their frequent fighting. When did Tobias become so whiny and insecure? I preferred seeing him through Tris's eyes only. I have no problem with a dramatic and poignant death of the main character. This, however, did not achieve a climatic death. It felt like Ms. Roth's personal rebellion against expectations of a writer of a popular series. I also found the plot to be similar to the Maze Runner, but far less surprising or well done. When the science experiment was revealed, my heart sank, and she started to lose me even more. I also felt that Evelyn's character gave in too quickly and easily. It was so unrealistic compared to her previous behavior that I expected a plot twist instead of a peace treaty. Okay, so now Chicago is a happier place, but what about the rest of the country? Is the memory recalibration in this one area supposed to cause a change in the belief system of the entire country? Also, unless I missed it, did we ever find out what happened to Myra? As far as Tobias not being Divergent, why did Marcus and Evelyn both believe he was before the Choosing Ceremony? His father taught him how to choose Abnegation so that no one would know, and his mother believed his divergence would keep him better protected from his father. Were there serums used on kids that they knew he was immune too? If not, what made them believe he was divergent when it turns out he could only resist the multitude of serums used in this book? Finally, Uriah's death, seemed drawn out and less sad as a result. I thought he was still around because maybe the memory serum released would reverse his coma or something else would allow him to wake up. It seemed like a failed plot point.<br />I wish I had only read the first two books and let my imagination finish the series for me. Such potential squandered.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is a can't put down kind of book. I was so in to the book that I didn't want to do see or talk to anyone for that matter. So, if you haven't read these 3 novel you need too. Thank You.
B00ELU7A4E|1.0|I did not realize it was just her single which I think was very over priced for what I got  I did not see that it was a single
0316228583|1.0|This was a huge disappointment. I only finished it because 1) my mother told me to finish what I started, and 2) a friend said it got better after the middle and had a good ending.<br /><br />It was boring, boring, boring. I didn't care about any of the characters, except the two teen girls who were both outcasts. (And I have a soft spot for outcasts.) Indeed something happened in the middle, but it wasn't that interesting. The ending was fairly ridiculous.<br /><br />Maybe Rowling wanted to say that life in small town England is trite and dull. If so, she accomplished her goal in spades. I felt like I was watching an monotonous reality show full of shallow people and petty interests. She never settled on a protagonist and I think that's the problem. You were supposed to follow all these characters with the same level of interest. Even after 400 pages there a couple names so incidental I didn't even recall when they reappeared. When the last few pages tossed them all up in the air I didn't care where any of them landed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole fifty shades series is very well written. There is actually a plot and thrilling story line in addition to all the kinky sex scenes.  I had tried and tried to not succumb to reading this book- boy am I glad I read it.  My husband is also happy! Worth the hype!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|couldn't love these three young men and their beautiful voices.  Can't wait to spend the Christmas season enjoying this new album.
B0012EJVTY|5.0|Best of the best!!!!!  You can't go wrong!!!<br />I've loved it since it first cam out a double record set and I love it now I don't know how many copies I've had of this album set.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works just as well as the original that came with my Kindle.  Needed a second to keep at work.  I definitely would recommend as a replacement or extra one.<br />.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This is simply the most amazing film I've seen in a long time. Between the acting and the visuals, it really feels like you're right there alongside the characters experiencing this. I admit this movie is better in 3D. Hopefully you have a surround system and a large screen 3D capable TV to watch it on disc.<br /><br />Visuals: I couldn't imagine how they made it look so real, so I read up on it after I saw it. The space scenes were a cleverly done combination of CGI and properly lit faces. They had to come up with a whole new lighting system to sync them up. The indoor zero-g scenes required actor supporting automotive robots, plus perfectly choreography and acting to work. Totally amazing and believable. Bullock works long hours and showed expert acting skills to pull this off.<br /><br />Reality: It turns out only a few details were not true to life. The initial disaster is something that's never YET happened in space, but could - The Kessler Effect. (Don't look it up before seeing the film.) By eschewing the typical movie explosions, they made the movie both factual and more believable. The trailers for the movie did feature sounds; they needed them to sell. But once you're in the theater, the actors rely on expressions, voice, movement, and breathing rates to indicate emotion. The music is not intrusive and was a big contributing factor to atmosphere.  It's impossible to describe the sense of terror and panic these things convey. Items outside the shuttle and space stations break up silently but no less frighteningly.  One article on line really summed this up for me, It said that most space films give a \\"romantic\\" view of space; this move imparts the actuality of the \\"awesome and terrifying\\" nature of it instead.<br /><br />Acting: As I said above - superb. Sandra Bullock spent 10 hour days alone inside a cramped set to clomplete the film. She could only communicate by headset. her dedication shows. George Clooney is also at his very best, his easy manner even in an emergency a true portrayal of a long time professional trained to keep his head in any situation. (Bullock's character had only trained 6 months for her first space expedition.)<br /><br />Sound: Stunning. Subtle. Composer Steven Price manages to make a perfect score that enhanses the emotion and action without being obtrusive. That's a hard feat to pull off in space, where nothing ahs sound. Portions were done to match the tempo of an actor's heartbeat. No percussion is used. There's an ominous, lonely feel. Soundtrack: shows no scenes, gives nothing away - google \\"Gravity (2013) Official Soundtrack (Composer - Steven Price) (480P)\\"<br /><br />Buy it. I plan to. You'll love it.in an emergency a true portrayal of a long time professional trained to keep his head in any situation.

B008RZF1OU|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. The tracks on this song are quite exquisite... For instance, Sacrimony and My Confession are amazing. Having Elize Ryd, Alissa White-Gluz, and Eklipse on these tracks were quite refreshing. The whole album is on point and quite the listen.<br /><br />The artwork on this case are quite amazing. I like the fact that they went the extra mile to put artwork on the sleeves for each LP. I was very impressed with this addition as most LPs do not get this type of treatment.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this album if you are a fan of symphonic metal and have followed Kamelot through the years. Even though Khan is no longer in the group, you should not stray away from this album.

B00C5R8364|4.0|Spoiler alert...<br />I really liked the book especially the end when they are free falling.  Through his description, I felt like I was falling to earth.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book was  ok but it didn't fit the expectation that I had dreamed about night after night for this book. I believe that the beginning was boring and the ending shredded my soul. DON'T BUY THE BOOK, RENT IT FROM THE LIBRARY .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|finished the story of Danny Torrance.....LOVED it...always wondered what had happened to little Danny Torrance after The Shining.....explains it ALL!!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Been years since I played Backgammon. My daughter told me about it being a free app on Amazon so I downloaded it. It is fun to play.
B003QP2TW8|1.0|I was excited when my Blu-ray disc arrived. However, I was VERY disappointed because the disc had playback problems. The disc appeared to be playing at an &#34;odd&#34; speed&#34; slow motion at times then it would go into fast forward to catch up. I thought it was my player but when I switched to another Blu-ray disc (different movie), the playback problem was not evident. Then I put the Persuasion disc back in to play but the playback problem reappeared. Totally useless disc. I should have heeded the reviews by others that also had reported problems.
0061433063|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas present for my little sister. I have always loved Terry Pratchett, the Discworld series is a wonderful world to read about. The Tiffany Aching books are young adult books of the series. I really couldn't think of a better set to get a kid who's just starting to love reading!

B00BGI08GG|5.0|Like I said, It is the best show on TV right now. I had recorded most of the episodes on DVR to burn to disc but deleted them when I found out the 1st season was coming out on Blu-Ray. Blu-ray quality & no commercials. This Arrow is far darker & more intense than the character in Smallville. Excellent storylines I compliment the producers & writers on their use of the other DC characters. Waiting for the 2nd season to come out
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|If you just care about the movie, you'll be fine. The issue is that some of the special features are split out between different disks. I like special features, but my wife doesn't. THe movie's there and it's enjoyable.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was such a great read!  I laughed, I cried...it was a very heart warming book.  You can really relate with the characters.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Super fun and ADDICTING, since its addictive....it can also be expensive. Waiting for energy is these biggest downfall with this game.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I had really appreciated Gone Girl even though I considered it in the genre of magical realism which is not a favorite of mine.  But the characters in Dark Places are beyond the pail.  I'm sorry to say I doubt I'll be reading Gillian Flynn again.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was boring, repetitive and without giving any spoilers, the characters who died in this last installment were arbitrary and felt like they only occurred to draw some shock factor from the reader. It's not that I was necessarily looking for a happy ending, but this was just a waste of staying up late to finish.  It also felt a little preachy in places, like the author was trying really hard to teach life lessons  or &#34;words to live by&#34; to the reader.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Need a sequel. Couldn't put it down! Love this book! Her writing draws you and keeps you goin from page to page!
B00FG1Q5J8|3.0|Started out great but after playing a while could no longer access ship building???? Get it fixed and I will rate 5 stars.
B004UJ6YNO|4.0|I would recommend jessie j to anyone...she has quite the vocal talent...as you listen to the variety she displays. I enjoyed it very much.
1454704225|5.0|This book has a lot of interesting shapes that give you some ideas to start decorating cards, notebooks, diaries, etc. You can also see very different styles since there are 18 different artists drawing. Helps you develop your own style.
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|It was funny and entertaining. Not the best of the three but better than the second one. Pretty ridiculous movie
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A little disappointed with the ending, I wish it had ended on a happier note, but still enjoyed reading this series.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game in the \\"match 3\\" style but its annoying that you run out of \\"lives\\" and have to wait x number of minutes before you can begin playing again.  Kind of odd that if you run out of moves you are offered the option of purchasing more for .99 to finish the level.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Brilliant follow up to the previous book, in fact they should be read back-to-back.<br />So gripping, impossible to put down. Stieg Larsson was a legend.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|The storyline was good. The ending was not one I wanted to see happen but with that I believe it really makes the book that much more special. Not everything is a happy ending!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Wish I could find a western horse game but the graphics s make up for it being English very well done
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This would make a sensational movie.<br />It was so much fun to read this book.<br />The story was so fascinating . I never guessed the real story!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great story with a real twist and turn plot. It did not end the way I thought it was going to end<br />but I thought the author ended it in a good way.
0529064847|5.0|I was concerned about the small print<br />and seeing through the pages per a previous rating.<br />No problem and I love reading this edition. The verse<br />explanation is a plus. The cover is paper, so we will<br />see how long it will last. The price was perfect.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have always heard my friends playing this game and the whole time I'm thinking that it is no different than all of the other games that are similar to it. But one day in chorus class during free time a friend of mine named Katie, was listening to music while letting another friend of mine named April play Candy Crush. They asked if I wanted to play and the whole time I'm thinking &quot;Sure, it's just a regular old problem solving game and I have nothing to do so, why not?&quot;. I'll admit that it was kind of entertaining the first time I played it so I decided to download the app on my Kindle, just to see how long it will keep me entertained. The moment I have gotten to level 13 and still playing on it and waiting for my lives to come back was when I have realized that I'm not just entertained by it. I'm addicted. Once you play it there's no going back. You'll get consumed in what levels this game has. It's not just some game addiction. This is the kind of addiction that will make stoners and pot-heads stop smoking completely just to be sober to play this. And to know that it is an addictive game is when I, the person who normally ignores the &quot;rate this&quot; box that pops up from time to time, to comment on the game with this long of a description means that it is awesome. The struggle is not real, but it<br />is the addiction that is real.
B00E9P959O|5.0|In general, I don't like remixes, HOWEVER, this is the best remix I've ever heard. I've always liked this the best of their last several albums, but the new mix takes it to a higher level.  It's great to hear the delineation of each instrument and the distinct quality of the vocals, instead of just a wall of sound as in the original mix.  This makes this my favorite Rush Album since Permanent Waves.  They need to do this to Clockwork Angels, and especially to Snakes & Arrows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. The only problem is that it's addictive!! The minions are adorable and so is everything else. Highly recommended!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Makes having this very simple. It should be included in the purchase of the legend. I am writing now to have enough to satify the idiot who  controls the text limit.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Well-plotted and excellent actors, great cinematography. If you've any interest in the Cold War watch it. This is as good as anything made from any of Le Carre's books.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Some very good movies and TV shows. Of course I couldn’t find every movie and TV show I wanted to see. Anyone I talk to about TV I tell them I like Netflix.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As expected, definitely gets you to challenge common perceptions and thinking.<br />I do wish the ending was less abrupt, but I loved and devoured the book!

I feel specific mention needs to go to the episode &#34;Holiday&#34;, which involves body-switching and has some great acting from the main cast, especially Christopher Judge, who gets to loosen up considerably. This season definitely made me want to know more!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I've watched three seasons and I can't wait for the next one. I love the characters and the story and the twists.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It was good bu the casting of chrome browser from laptop was horrible. It is good otherwise for people who do not have roku,google tv, apple tv, ps3, xbox or any other device to connect to their tv.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have owned an Apple TV (3rd Generation), my parents own a Roku. I purchased the Chromecast because I was curious and it ended up replacing my Apple TV. Any device can be a remote, the future possibilities for in-app casting are endless, the picture quality is fantastic (especially using the Hulu Plus app for Android), it does NOT overheat (or even get very hot) if you use the extension cable to angle it away from your TV. There were no wireless traffic problems to my surprise. I don't see my network slowing down or our internet, which is fairly slow at 12mbps. If you have slow internet, you can cast in 480p SD. This thing is feature packed and really pretty incredible for only $35!

B003UBTX6S|4.0|** spoiler alert ** If you have not read book one, please do not read on...<br /><br />Background: Lena has made it past her sixteenth birthday, but at what costs? Uncle Macon is gone. She isn't sure she wants to be with Ethan. She is still unclaimed and her next choice could mean life or death for the light or dark Casters of her family. Ethan is just trying to keep Lena sane and help her on her journey, but she doesn't know what she wants. Beautiful Darkness, is a continuation of Lena and Ethan's journey into the history of the Caster world and all the things it holds that could destroy the both of them.<br /><br />Review: Beautiful Darkness almost seemed like the same story as Beautiful Creatures to me. There was a lot of the same angst and fear from Lena and Ethan's overwhelming sense of duty to her. That is not to say that I did not enjoy the book, but it did take me much linger to get through than book one.<br /><br />Ethan's character finds out a lot of things about himself and his mother and their relationship to the Caster world that change him and his vision of the future. While Lena is going through the same torment she was in book one; wanting to be rid of her burden, choosing light or dark, but this time her family's lives hang in the balance.<br /><br />The first half of the book was a little slow, just the blow-back from Lena's birthday and her angst and anger toward all the people around her. One you get to the 70% mark everything moves quickly, you learn about new threats to Lena and Ethan and the Casters and things really pick up. Looking forward to see where it heads next.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I'm a seasoned entrepreneur that stumbled into the Lean Start-up Concept a couple years ago.  After years of many wasteful biz tactics - starting and running business ventures by old school methods &#34;build it and they will come&#34;, I stumbled into this simple concept (Lean Start-up) that I only wish I had learned in college many light years ago.  This concept, in a nutshell, helps an entrepreneur quickly discover if their idea can become a biz that customers want, while minimizing waste. Unfortunately, my introduction to Lean Start-up was via material that discussed it in theory using biz examples that were not similar to my ventures.  Then the best thing happened to my Lean Start-up education - I found Ash's book &#34;Running Lean&#34; and his associated material (blogs, tools, etc).  A light bulb tripped on and has burned bright ever since. My exposure to his practical (hands on) material has allowed me to employ the Lean concepts to my ventures. This book should be called &#34;Running Lean for Dummies&#34; because Ash presents the concept in a way that elementary kids could apply to their lemonade stand ventures.  Thanks Ash!

B009PLO2RW|4.0|What a truly lovely film about food and the politics of a woman cooking for the President of France. It is told in flashback from the Antartica, where the woman who cooked for the President is now cooking for a group of scientists<br /><br />Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch, was a family cook and restaurant-owner, who in the late 1980s was asked by President François Mitterrand to be his personal cook at the Elys&eacute;e Palace. Dani&egrave;le's name for this film is Hortense, and she is played by the lovely Catherine Frot.  Hortense is met by fierce resistance from the all dominated male main kitchen, they are rude and sexist to her. She refuses to eat meals with them, and chooses the menus and foods she wants to prepare. She has a pastry assistant assigned to her, and they bond over the food they prepare. The President wants traditional regional cuisine he remembers from his youth.<br /><br />We see Hortense discussing food and cookbooks with the President while dignitaries wait to meet with him. Hortense learns from Pres. Mitterrand to read the cookbook and recipes out loud, and she does this for the rest of her life. Everything goes along very well for a year or more until the President has health problems that require no fat, no sauces, few spices and in reality good plain food. At the same time Hortense develops a stress fracture of her hip which requires rest. She resigns and life moves on.<br /><br />We find her again cooking for the scientists on Antartica for a year. The money is good and she wants to start a truffle farm in New Zealand. The scientists love her cooking and love her. She is a force to be reckoned with. We end up loving her, too. A strong, lovely woman who knows good food and how to cook it.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 10-25-13

B0068AWQQ2|5.0|I didn't even recognize David Tenant in this remake of the 1981 film by the same name.  Tenant was the 2nd Dr. in Dr. Who.<br />The language was unnecessary, but oh well, that was the only flaw.  Great job on the remake, was true to the original story but different enough to make it interesting.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I rarely take the time to write reviews. For one thing, I'm a literary agent and an author myself, and something about that fact makes me feel entirely inadequate to the task of reviewing books--as if whatever I manage to come up with will fall flat. So I'll say straight up: I'm no great book reviewer, nor am I given to posting reviews. So why this one? Because ME BEFORE YOU was one of the most affecting and hauntingly beautiful books I've read in a long time.  So much so, that I did something I can't recall ever doing: I turned around and read the book a second and then a third time.  It's a book that inspired me to live more fully, and to refuse to buy into my own excuses about any particular dreams or goals of mine.  But on the most basic level, I simply fell in love with the characters and their unexpected romance.<br /><br />A book that will stay with you long, long after you finish it, I can't sing the praises of ME BEFORE YOU more enthusiastically. I wish there were short stories that gave us insights into Will's thoughts (as Victoria Roth provided a look into Four's thoughts in Divergent). But I also know that I must fill in those speculations on my own.<br /><br />Not an easy or simple read, it's one of the more satisfying emotional journeys I've taken as a reader in quite some time.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I liked this book very much and had difficulty putting it down to get other things done.  Little  has been written about this bit of child welfare history and it hurts the soul to know that children, as God's dependent creatures needing care and love, were treated with  little thought given to their feelings.  Kline did a good job of including a look into the foster care program as it is today leading me to believe there must be a better way.

B003XDXMLU|5.0|I live on an island, and I HATE sandals. These things are awesome for... anything. lol Pools, beach (just remember to put sunscreen on your feet, or they will look really &#34;cute&#34; with dots all over. lol), or simple errand.<br /><br />I accidentally left my sneakers when we trekked up a tropical MOUNTAIN (bit slippery) and with these things, not ONE single slip; while other people... not so lucky.<br />Were better than a lot of sneakers for that!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Don't slip in usually &#34;slippery&#34; surfaces.<br />They look cute; don't look as giant as regular crocs. =S<br />The sling-back and edges did not rub&irritate my skin (which is extremely common for me).<br />Mine did not shrink, even though spent time in the sun.<br />They're breezy and comfortable.<br />They have NEVER broken.<br />And it's just so easy to put 'em on and go.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I ordered them in white. They looked great! But, without thinking, I used them to mow the lawn and work around the house the weekend, and they changed to a yellowish (of course). But now I just use those for house work. :)<br /><br />Good luck!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Well, this IDEA is certainly good. And if you really love Netflix or YouTube, it's fun, I guess.<br /><br />However what else? Don't leave the device in your monitor: it will become extremely hot. It will also f*** up your Wi-fi connection. I thought it would make a clearer connection between my computer and television, like AppleTV, but no, it is not comparable. It also just drops out.<br /><br />&#62;shrug&#60;
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Liane Moriarty is one of my favorite authors- I just like her style. This book starts off from the perspective of several different people. These people all come together eventually. The book gets really good once the main character reads her husband's letter- which was not what I thought it would be at all! I love how this book is a little bit mystery, family issues, relationship troubles yet very real. I have already reccommended this book to several friends.

B00170GXQ2|5.0|One of the greatest films of all time. I love the scene where Jonathan Harker wanders into a room in the castle and gets seduced by Dracula's concubines.
006202406X|5.0|*NOT ACTUALLY SPOILERY*<br /><br />I understand.  Yes, the ending is hard to cope with.  Did I want it to end like that? No of course not. But it did and it changed everything.  I think the ending was ultimately important for allllll the characters (Tris, Tobias, Christina, and Caleb mainly).  I think that I will need therapy sessions after this book.  I literally cannot deal with my emotions but whatever...<br /><br />I agree with others about Tris and Tobias's POVs being indiscernible.  I was confused many times when I thought it was Tris but it was actually Tobias.<br /><br />I also was underwhelmed by what was actually outside the fence.  I kinda predicted that and kept waiting for something big to happen.  The whole explaining the difference between GP's and GD's had me confused a lot.<br /><br />The main thing that put me off was that in Divergent I felt like I had to hold my breath the entire book because something was happening literally every time I turned the page.  I couldn't put it down.  Whereas, I only felt that was about Allegiant towards the last 100-ish pages.  Like I said before, underwhelmed...<br /><br />Anyways, I thought the character development was super amazing and I love Tris and will always love her as one of my favorite YA heroines.  I think Veronica Roth has given us character that will last for a long time to come.  I am happy that I had the opportunity to join Tris on such an amazing journey with her.  Thank you, Veronica Roth.  SO MUCH.

0385344228|3.0|This whole book is based on one question.  Is Jacob guilty?<br />  Jacob's father is an active practicing DA, when his son is<br />accursed of murder.  Andy, the father is an interesting character,<br /> and he is presented well.  Laurie, the mother, is painted clearly.<br />But, Jacob is a teenager, and true to life he is hard to understand.<br />This book is primarily about Jacob's guilt or innocence.  I won't even<br />hint at the ending---I call it a brave ending.  You will have to read this<br /> book to know what I mean .  I gave 3 stars because the book did<br /> not totally hold my interest.  I became restless in the middle.<br /> A few things about the presentation of this plot worried me.  I got<br /> weary of Laurie analyzing everything.  But all in all this is<br /> a book worth reading, especially if you like the court house<br />scene, and lawyer talk.
0486424545|5.0|\\"Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.\\"<br /><br />Prose and passion are both connected in this novel written in 1910 by E. M. Forster.  \\"Only connect\\" is the refrain in this book.  If you enjoy reading novels written in earlier decades because they allow a kind of time travel, this novel takes you back to England at the turn of the 20th century.  It shows you what life in London and its environs was like for several classes and cultures in the first decade of the 1900's.<br /><br />What is the message which E.M. Forster is trying to convey in the admonishment: \\"only connect\\"?  He portrays the materialistic, practical, and successful Wilcox family (which is the prose) in comparison to the artistic and idealistic Schlegel family (which is the passion).  Apparently Forster believes that when the prose and passion marry, both are exalted for it.  And he illustrates how that happens in this book, and the effect on the characters involved.<br /><br />In this novel, the Wilcox and Schlegel family unite in a marriage and a series of events.  The Wilcoxes gain some humility and sensitivity, and the Schlegel family gains gumption and strength.  The Schlegels also connect with Leonard Bass, who is from the lower economic class and works for Henry Wilcox, and try to improve his opportunites.  That effort goes horribly wrong.<br /><br />You sense that E.M. Forster hopes this novel will inspire folks of all classes to connect and benefit from each other's strengths, despite the difficulty in doing so.

B00FOWX6NM|5.0|When you receive the SPIGEN case, it comes with items packaged within it. A free screen protector and two free design graphics.  The most important insert within the package is the paper insert that clearly tells you to remove the plastic from the rear and the front so that the clarity of the case back will appear.  So many poor ratings all because of lack of reading.  The product is absolutely just as pristine as the displayed image and I give it two thumbs up. The iphone 5s gold looks amazing in it.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is like Mary Poppins for creepy children.  Or like an orphanage for superheroes but their powers aren't always useful.  They are just peculiar, which I thought was a good name for them.<br /><br />The beginning starts out very eerie.  I jumped a few times at loud noises when I was reading this at night.  Why did my husband have to have a cold while I was reading this?  GOSH.  Every sneeze from him gave me a heart attack.  The story kind of amped up how creepy the photos were.  I've seen photos with glowing eyes before, but the story somehow made them a little more freaky.<br /><br />There's a haunted house and other horror elements, but then the story suddenly takes a turn into familiar paranormal territory and it wasn't that scary to me anymore (except for that photo towards the end with staples in it. That one freaks me out).  I ended up liking the kids even though they are a little bizarre.<br /><br />I could tell the author, Ransom Riggs, got a collection of strange vintage photographs and imagined a story that would explain what was happening in all the photographs and somehow weave them all together.  It gave the story a slight contrived feeling, but mostly I felt like it was a really creative idea.  The plot slowed down a few times, but overall it had a nice leisurely pace to it.  I mean, it's a horror story and taking things slow adds to the atmosphere but sometimes it felt like nothing was happening and I wanted to move on.<br /><br />Overall,  it was a good story told in a creative way with vintage photographs that starts out mildly scary but mellows out as it goes along.

B007NZQU72|2.0|\\"While most of our attention here is on the habitually introverted, extraverts will probably find it useful, too.\\" Man, oh man, I wish I would have known this prior to purchasing.<br /><br />A part of me feels wrong for rating this book, because it was not written for me. But I think it's important to let those picking up THSP for the same reasons I did, know that there is a strongggg focus on the introverted HSP.<br /><br />If I was to numerically assign THSP a percentage, then I would say about 30% of the content applied to me as extroverted HSP. Of the 273 pages, there is only one eight-line paragraph devoted specially to \\"The Extraverted HSP\\". Had I known it was written for those inhibited, withdrawn, socially fearful HSPs, I don't think I would have bought it.<br /><br />I liked the first chapter. I highlighted several portions I found to be incredibly accurate.<br /><br />\\"HSPs can be instantly aware, whether they wish to be or not, of the mood, the friendships and enmities, the freshness or staleness of the air, the personality of the one who arranged the flowers.\\"<br /><br />\\"We reflect more on everything. And we sort things into finer distinctions. Like those machines that grade fruit by size - we sort into ten sizes while others sort into two or three.\\"<br /><br />Both of these insights I was already aware of, but found comfort in the confirmation. I found resonation in Dr. Aron pinpointing the HSP's highly conscientious, highly self-aware demeanor. From there on, however, I felt excluded much of the time; it was a slow fade into gradual and total disconnect.<br /><br />Dr. Aron goes into great detail in the second and third chapter, explaining \\"arousal,\\" a word she uses as a synonym for \\"stimulation,\\" and the affect it has on an HSP. I found some of this useful and insightful, as I can be bothered by too much noise, bright lights, uncomfortable clothing, etc..., but the majority of the content is devoted to helping \\"shy\\" persons overcome the egregious label that has shaped so much of their personality. At the middleish portion of this book - which goes on for about 75 pages - these are the Chapters Titles you can expect to find: Appreciating the Introverted Style, Carl Jung on the Introverted Style, Making Friends, Learning More Social Skill, Best Social Advice for HSPs, Do you know the latest on overcoming social discomfort? ... For me, this is where there was a HUGE disconnect. I am not shy. I am outgoing, social, and enjoy meeting new people. Contradictorily, this book contains several strategies on how to help HSPs learn to be the three characteristics I just mentioned. I found myself flipping through the pages, fairly disheartened, trying to find something I could relate to.<br /><br />What I was hoping for was a closer look at the more emotional side of living as a Highly Sensitive Person. I wanted the emphasis not to be on personality types, but on how the universal HSP absorbs life, seen through our very distinct, sensitive eyes. I did not want to be told I am special. I think by now, most of us anyway, have come to accept and understand that our sensitivity IS a strength, but one that often times appears as a weakness because our response every time is an emotional one. I wanted to read deeper about the HSP's evolution. I wanted to read about the HSP's heart and soul, and how everyday experiences and conversations and relationships affect The Sensitive Person's innermost being. Mainly, I wanted to spoken with - not at. For me, this book reads like a Spiritual Guru's research manual. Yes, there are real-life situations documented, but even those felt sterile and distant at times.el that has shaped so much of their personality.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I had been eagerly awaiting the release of Allegiant, counting down the days like a child waits for Christmas. I considered taking off work to read the book all day (thank God, I didn't). I finished it in three days.<br />I honestly have never been more disappointed in a book, ever. The first two were so good! They were interesting, they were inspiring, and they didn't leave you feeling like you've had the stomach flu for a week and your parents are getting a divorce.<br />Not so with Allegiant.<br />From the very beginning, this book was going nowhere. It is boring, lackluster, and the ideas are borrowed. Mazerunner series, anyone? (and I thought I hated the ending of that series - it was better than this one)<br />Four was a strong character in books one and two, a protector. In this book, he was turned into a weak-willed pansy of a man. He is only supposed to have four fears, right? I could list at least 10, just from reading his own thoughts!<br />Killing off our only beloved character was absolutely not necessary, and I feel like throwing up.<br />Veronica, how could you?

0762445262|3.0|The clue for me should have been the words \\"Mini Kit\\". This is a review based on the fact that I did not read the item details properly and was expecting something just a tad larger - especially when I saw the book in the image next to it. This is one of those small novelties like you find in book shops and gift shops where there is a turning display of little boxes with themes like \\"Mini Zen Garden\\" and tiny joke books. I was expecting a small, maybe 5 or 4 inch light, not the Product Dimensions: 1.9 x 3 x 3.3 inches (And that's the box the light is in!)<br /><br />I would not purchase it had I read it properly - $9 for this is not worth it at all. I will keep it only because it was my own stupid error.

0345522478|1.0|One has to wonder how such a book as this gets published; even more so how it manages to collect so many five-star reviews. I don't have time to outline all the bad points so blatantly evident in Hounded, so I'll hone in on the most unfortunate: i.e., the writing itself. Most people are aware of the old axiom: show, don't tell. The author of this book may be the only person who missed that one. Perhaps he was busy stroking his ancient druidic crystal of power in Creative Writing 101 rather than listening to the instructor. In any case, although I do not personally adhere to the aforementioned stricture with the religious zeal of some, there are times when it proves its point. This book is one.<br />The first several paragraphs of Hounded are dedicated not to plot or action or any kind of dramatic scene but to simply explaining every fantastic aspect of the narrator cum protagonist's existence in one monumental data-dump. We learn in this first 1000 words all of the interesting details that are supposed to make him an intriguing character. Only problem is: they don't. They make him an artificially contrived cliche.<br />But apparently, this rather shallow device works for the majority of people who read this book. (Scratches his head.) I wonder how they would have felt if the book had been written well instead. In other words, if instead of simply data-dumping every detail of the protag up front, the author had presented us with an apparently normal-looking, -acting person, who is revealed through some compelling action to be a 2100-year-old Druid. If this approach had been taken, I may have been able to stomach the rest of the irritating qualities of this novel. As it is, I have wasted my money. Don't waste yours.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A very good Grisham. Basically a variation on Time to Kill with the same noble protagonist - someone like Grisham himself if he did not turn a writer.<br /><br />Lots if clichés and stereotypes here but also lot of stuff Americans should never forget. For some the Civil war is still raging and was never actually lost by the South.<br /><br />Young Southerners should read the book never to succumb to the temptation of the Ku Klux Klan or organizations like that.<br /><br />Except for Jake, the white lawyers are rather repulsive but, at the end, quite effective.<br /><br />I was afraid the Jake will achieve an empty victory as in one or more of books authored by Grisham. Not quite and the wise old judge brings a peaceful conclusion to the court drama.<br /><br />Highly recommended to readers with the sense of dark chapters of American history. People who consider Civil War of the 19th century a defense of the rights of states should never read this book, of course.<br /><br />Almost five stars but there is bit of tedium that could have been made shorter. Too many pages, the story could have been told in some 300 rather than over 400 of them.<br /><br />Just a little update. This book is now No 1 New York Times bestseller and deservedly so. Just wanted the people who do not read NYT book section to know

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This seems to be the game people love to hate. I play Candy Crush through Facebook on my Windows 8 HP laptop, on my most awesome Samsung (smarter and much better than any iphone or ianything) Galaxy 4 phone, and now on my Kindle Fire. First of all, the color of the candy is very different on each device, which isn't a big deal. The most important thing here is that the King game developers have done a great job with making Candy Crush very compatable with the Kindle Fire OS, as well as operating systems on many other devices. So happy to be able to play Candy Crush on my Kindle Fire.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I decided to read the first two books prior to starting Allegiant.  I am very glad I did.  Allegiant lines up perfectly with the first two.  The ending is very sad...I cried.  For an author to make me feel that strongly about something is a gift.  I don't mind the sad ending.  What happened is gritty and real.  Life is hard and we make choices on how we deal with it.  Kudos to the author for not conforming to some sappy love ending with both people suddenly whole and life is rosy perfect.  I like the reality presented in the ending even though it was horribly sad.<br /><br />The reason for four stars:  We lose Four's voice here.  In the first two books he is a magnetic personality; strong, protective, intelligent.  When we switch to Tobias we find the deep scarring and he comes across almost pathetic in his indecision at times.  That was inconsistent with the Four/Tobias from the first two novels.  I agree with other reviewers that his voice/Tris's voice sound so similar in this book that switching from one to the other gets confusing.  Four/Tobias's voice would have been better if the Four of the first two books could have carried through.  I understand he is hurt and struggling...but this book made him seem weak.  I kept getting impatient with his character and want the boy back who fights for himself and those he cares for.<br /><br />Best advice...read the first two books and then read Allegiant.  You will see a well written story from beginning to end.  Loved it.

This year for my daughters 10th birthday We played this movie on our outdoor theatre screen.. 20 minutes in,the movie stopped when we checked the disc it had a huge deep scratch across it! My daughter has played the movie so much she damaged it. I quickly ran to best buy but no luck they don't carry in there store any longer! I ordered from them (movie took a week to get)and the next day I ordered a blue ray from amazon and received the next day! Of course amazon would have it and cheaper! The night of the party we played a different movie and all worked out! I rescheduled hocus pocus for another night,invited the same kids and you could hear a pin drop during the movie! 10 and 12 year olds!! The movie was a hit and ALL the moms are buying this movie for there collection! Best movie ever you won't be disappointed!!

B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|This app is a complete waste. Not because it is redundant and there are so many better notepad apps available - for free - but because it has no menu, no way to direct the app to save a file where you choose and no way to find the note files that you create other than through its own directory page. All it does is autosave to some location when you back button twice to exit the app.  On that directory page you can delete the \\"notes\\" or open them to read or edit. You can give each note a title. I had expected a notepad that was simple but at least similar to a notepad app on a PC that creates .TXT extension files and saves them to a specified location that can then be taken and used elsewhere. What you get is not even a memopad app. I have searched through my Android with a file manager for the location of the test file that I created. It is not to be found anywhere. So whatever note that you create with this app is just stuck in this app - somewhere. I cannot believe that they have the guts to charge for this - or that Amazon would insult its users by even offering this app. I am so happy that when I \\"purchased\\" this app it was the FAOTD. It is being deleted from my Android - it is not worth even the small amount of memory that it takes up. Perhaps the developer who says \\"More Features Coming!\\" will actually make this app save to a specified location in .txt format. At least then the app would have some small value. Don't waste your time and especially don't waste your money - even for a dollar.

006202406X|3.0|Epic fail was my first thought when I finished this. I was enjoying myself immensely until a certain event. I understand making the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good and that in real life people die. But forgive me if after waiting a year for this book if I'm a little disappointed. Now the alternating POV makes perfect sense. I'd rather one of them accidentally get memory serum over this. Or even it was Four I could accept it painful as it may be. But goodness Tris? I want to give this one star but it was well written. I know I won't be reading it again but I applaud Veronica's efforts. Though not quite an epic fail, for a finale not what I'd hope for. I'm giving it 3 stars because 90% of this book was gold.<br /><br />Addendum: Ok I finally read the complete ending. I'm still upset but I'm ok. Still not gonna re-read it but I understand now that she was true to her roots and made her parents proud. Hey it's a dystopian novel so we can't expect so perfect ending.  Tris always though she was selfish but know we know she's not. It's not the ending any if us wanted but it is very in character and very Tris. As one reviewer said remember this was always a story about Tris who she wanted to be and what she believed in.
006202406X|2.0|One choice can--and will-- change everything. In the conclusion of the Divergent series, the place that Tris, Tobias, and the rest of their people have called home for decades is now keeping them prisoner, locked away from the outside world that the Divergent are apparently supposed to save. Kept from the truth for so long, Tris and her friends are determined to discover what is really out there, and what their purpose is. But the truth is bigger than they realize, and they must decide what they are going to do with the dangerous and life changing information given to them. With pain, loss, heartbreak, and sacrifice clogging their past and present, who will they trust and what truth will they believe to help them journey into their future?<br /><br />Allegiant possesses many positive qualities that are very similar to the previous two books: tension between people groups that have differing views of how their city should operate, relationship issues and improvements between Tris and Tobias, and personnel journeys that each character goes through just to name a few. The growth of the characters are wonderful, and Roth does a great job of not making \\"perfect\\" characters, but ones that have flaws and issues and must discover what they are and how to work through them.<br /><br />Although this book has these good aspects, there are many problems with the story. Roth changes the focus of the story, redirecting it to a place beyond the ruined city of the factions. She incorporates an entirely new plot that not only causes the book to turn away from the city that is supposed to be the main focus, but also seriously complicates the plot with a government that also has some big issues. By adding another broken government, it completely takes away the goal of the entire book series, and that is to heal the city.<br /><br />By including another government, this also adds to another problem this book has and that is all the unanswered questions: who rules the government? What shape is the country in? Why is Tris the only Divergent to ever have been tested and have three factions? Does her brother Caleb ever get why it was wrong to help the woman who tried to kill his sister, or is he still completely oblivious?<br /><br />Probably the biggest issue with Allegiant is the ending. Allegiant does something that the other books do not do, and that is have both Tris and Tobias' point of views. The inclusion of Tobias is great at first, but by the end the true reason of its presence is realized, and it is not what readers are expecting. The general response for the ending is going to be split among the readers; part of the readers will become extremely angry over what happens, and the other part will be happy that Roth ended differently than other mainstream books and praise its uniqueness. The last part of the book is going to be controversial among fans, and since the movie company for the series, Red Wagon Entertainment, is already slotted to film Insurgent, the second book in the series, it will be interesting to see how it will play out.<br /><br />Though parts of the book were entertaining, attention grabbing, and thought provoking, the crowded and complicated plot, the unanswered questions, and the questionable ending, causes Allegiant to fall short of a climatic finale to the series.<br /><br />For more reviews check out my blog: [...]
B00E59ZROG|5.0|What sheer, beautiful, divinely-sparked joy to have Karl B&ouml;hm's magnificent, classic Beethoven performances back in my collection again after far-too long an absence--all together in this handsomely packaged 6-disc box set from 2013.<br /><br />Not that these recordings have ever been out of the catalog for very long (if at all) since their initial release in the early 1970s (the symphonies were recorded between 1970 and 1971); the integral 8-LP box set was available for many years under several different cover designs (including the ubiquitous introductory come-on from the International Preview Society (BMG Music Service) in its early days), as well as individual albums on LP, cassette, and CD. I've owned a number of them in addition to that much-treasured box set; an early full-price 2-LP coupling of the superb Eighth and Ninth, a cassette of the Sixth, and a rather disappointing late-eighties or early nineties-era CD-re-issue of the Ninth. Much better was the delightful 1996 pairing of the Sixth with Schubert's Fifth symphony--still one of my very favorite CDs out of more than 1,000. The complete symphonic cycle was again re-issued in the early 1990s as part of the DG Doubles series. The Ninth has knocked about on various mid-price issues for more than thirty years now. It's a pretty safe bet that most long-time collectors will have at least a few of these--in one iteration or another--already.<br /><br />Why then plop down $30 for yet another re-issue of B&ouml;hm's Beethoven? Aside from the quality and convenience of this new packaging (individual discs in printed cardboard sleeves housed within a sturdy, laminated cardboard clamshell box with no excess \\"shake\\" room), improved sound is a major plus. Many of the earliest analog-to-digital transfers were less than adequate, certainly lacking the warmth and immediacy of vinyl without much gain in depth, detail, or fidelity. While DG was often ahead of the industry's technological curve, it too had its share of disappointing releases in the first years of the CD boom, when it was all some companies could do to keep up with the frenetic, ever-growing demand for more. (The muddy-sounding re-issue of B&ouml;hm's brilliant Ninth mentioned above is a case in point.) Then too, some engineers didn't quite know what to make of the new digital technology. As such, one was often subjected to shrill, shrieking trebles, raucous, loud, rock-n-roll-like basses, and murky, nebulous mid-levels that were virtually unlistenable. Sound levels were often set to extremes, sometimes barely turned up beyond a whisper, other times, deafeningly wide open (early BIS CDs even came with a warning label on the jewel case).<br /><br />Although there is no reference to re-mastering in the documentation accompanying this present album--no dates or mention of processing other than 2013 as the year of compilation--my ears remark a greater clarity in the overall sound picture of these transfers, blessedly devoid of tape hiss without the concomitant loss of detail at either end of the spectrum; the trebles less harsh, the basses less rambunctious. The sweet sound of the Vienna Philharmonic woodwind section has never been more pleasantly apparent. The strings shimmer, and the sometimes rather mellow-sounding brass shines through with admirable grace and nobility. This effectively takes the bad taste of so many earlier ill-conceived re-issues from my perpetually skeptically-discriminating palate.<br /><br />Of course, the best and most important reason to own this set is for these splendid benchmark performances--the last of the great \\"old-school classical\\" interpretations, and definitely  among the finest of their most-celebrated near-contemporaries (the cycles by Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra (Sony) and Karajan  with the Berlin Philharmonic (DG)). Where Szell could seem obsessively rigid in his quest for technical precision, and Karajan almost flippant in his prettified, breezy, surface-skimming approach, B&ouml;hm emphasized drama without sacrificing lyricism or buoyancy. These lucid, well-paced performances strike a commodious balance between dramatic heft and textural clarity. Beethoven's compositional technique often reminds me of one of those clear-glass clock cases, in which all the workings are plainly (and intentionally) visible solely for the sake of aesthetic delectation, and B&ouml;hm takes expert advabtage of this artfully built-in transparency. (Listen, for example, to the scherzo movements of the Second and Third symphonies, or to the wonderfully lithe first movements of the Fourth and Eighth.)<br /><br />While it wouldn't be exactly right to refer to B&ouml;hm as \\"self-effacing\\"--one is always aware of a strong hand at the helm--there is no conductorly self-indulgence here, no idiosyncratic excess. This is not the temperamental heaven-storming of Toscanini trying to channel Beethoven's tortured soul anew; nor Klemperer at war with his own demons (or, as in the case of his Ninth, with his own orchestra); nor is it Karajan or Carlos Kleiber (as much as I admire the latter's splendid Fifth and Seventh (DG Originals)) striking off in some radically new \\"modern\\" interpretive direction, largely involving playing the music faster than anyone before them.<br /><br />This set features what may be the finest versions of Beethoven's Fourth and Eighth ever recorded; a glorious, top-flight \\"Eroica\\", a Ninth that comes as close to \\"perfection\\" as any one is ever likely to hear (including one of the most exquisitely synergistic vocal quartets ever assembled for the work), a brilliant \\"Pastoral\\" for the ages, and, overall, some of the most consistently satisfying readings of these iconic, eternally quintessential works made in modern times.<br /><br />Enthusiastically, passionately recommended!ch, B&ouml;hm emphasized drama without sacrificing lyricism or buoyancy.

I am persuaded.  I love the stuff I eat, and will do so for the remainder of my life.<br />Dr. Macdougall has a gift for those who have the drive to discipline themselves in what they eat.  After a while it is second nature, and effortless.<br /><br />You  owe it to yourself to at least try it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is an excellent take of the computer version in which in later updates will be an almost comparison. ignore any bad comments about this game<br /><br />because it is amazing

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I am not normally a fan of superhero movies but this movie won me over. It has really good action scenes and amazing one-liners. I'd recommend this movie for any super hero fan or anyone just staying the night in and wanting to watch a good movie.
B000005RQT|4.0|All my life friends have told me to check out Deep Purple.  I heard them on the radio and stuff.  I just never really checked them out.  I'll say this about &#34;In Rock.&#34;  If you dig the roots of heavy metal you should enjoy this record.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book holds your interest.  It is a quick read.  I found it enjoyable although wordy at times.  I give four stars.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|It's Iron Maiden.  C'mon people, get with the program.  This band is one of the greatest heavy metal bands ever.  You need this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I play it on my Kindle Fire HD and love the graphics! Some of the levels are a bit much to get through, but it's still one of my FAVORITE  games. I like that my Facebook friends who play can send me lives, so it helps getting through the harder levels. Hours of fun and very addictive!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER!! Oops, said that in all caps. This app is extremely useful and it should cost money, it's so good. I recommend this app and every other app by this developer! Again, very useful and very organizing!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like this clock. I've used it a few times and its easy to use, the numbers are nice as and big.  I'm glad I downloaded it.
0375703764|5.0|This was one of a few books I had started reading out of pleasure and it did not disappoint. From beginning to end, the stories, the convoluted text, reference upon reference, tedious and unnecessary  footnotes, the characters, all connect forming this roller coaster of a book. It will be a ride that you wish never ended and upon completion, demand to be strapped back in for another experience of utter nirvana. Great read highly recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really cool game but keeps crashing. Great puzzle game and cool graphics. Cool old machines and mechanisms. Great thinking game to.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|added to kindle... nice . just need to be able to use extra moves on kindle and it would be perfect
B00BD99JMW|1.0|That's all I can keep saying to myself over and over again. I can not believe that ending. Seriously, WTF?!<br /><br />Where was the character development?  The characters all felt one dimensional.<br /><br />The plot was plodded along where it should've been fast and flew through important twists and developments instead of slowing down and expanding on them.<br /><br />So many unanswered questions and plot holes.<br /><br />The ending felt contrived.<br /><br />Book 1 - great<br />Book 2 - okay<br />Book 3 - where can I get a refund or some memory serum?
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant is the third and final book in the Divergent trilogy.<br /><br />Allegiant wrapped up the story nicely, but wasn't satisfying for other reasons.<br /><br />The book is incredibly repetitive. It is incredibly repetitive. A lot. In practically every chapter we are treated to the two main characters, Tris and Tobias kissing, with fingers gripping hems, and pulling of hips together. Every single chapter they kiss, touch hems, pull together. Again and again. I began trying to skim over the obligatory kissing and hem holding in each chapter.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias may be the same character, because they sound exactly the same, no matter which perspective the chapter has been written from. This bothered me, and I would have to scroll back to the first page of the chapter to remind myself who was speaking and thinking. Not just once either... a lot of times.<br /><br />The ending didn't bother me at all. I won't spoil it here, but come one... it's a book. And, it's whatever Veronica Roth wanted to write.<br /><br />Allegiant is the end of a nice trilogy. I wish I had more emotion for the story than this.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book was even better than the first! Definitely a nonstop page turner! Can't wait to dive into book three!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Received very quickly. So far so good and would recommend  -just remember not to be too rough with it as its a toy and sometimes the parts come loose but do go back together.
B007SGM084|4.0|This book was great, my only proablem is that the sex scenes are so close together. But other than that it was great.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I gave the show four stars, because it has a Star wars and Star trek cast of aliens, and the time travel concept to save humans is interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game play it at work to kill time keeps you busy and would tell other about it yup
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Only up to episode 2 so I can't give a definitive rating. But so far it's interesting with the twists and turns.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|First of all, I must begin by warning that my review has SPOILERS in it. Secondly, I have never bothered to write a review on a book before, but I felt compelled to write one for this book. I have been looking forward to this book for such a long time, and I must say, I was very disappointed with the way that Veronica Roth chose to end it. I have recommended this series to a number of people, but after reading the last book, I have told my friends not to bother reading the series. The ending is an absolutely awful way to end the story! I am not a teen reader either, in fact, I am the same age as Roth, which is one reason why I have admired her work (it's hard enough to go to college without writing a trilogy on the side!). I do understand that Roth chose to turn Tris into a selfless heroine, but I do not think she had to kill her off in order to do this. The fact that Tris took Caleb's place and was willing to face death for a selfless reason for the first time shows that she underwent an important change in character. She loved her brother enough, even though he betrayed her, to take his place and face death. She took the step, that doesn't mean that she actually has to die! What I find the most cruel about this decision is that Tris survives the impossible to survive death serum and we have the hope that she will survive death yet again, and then she ends up getting shot and killed instead. Really? Tris, the girl who has escaped death numerous times throughout this series, and does the impossible to survive the death serum gets killed by a bullet. She has the willpower to live and is able to talk herself out of just about any situation, and the man who loved her mother kills her. That is not believable based on the pattern we have already seen with Tris. I was deeply disappointed that Roth decided to make Tris die because it was not consistent with the story. And what about the end of the conflict in Chicago? Tobias just talks to Evelyn the tyrant and she decidesto give up everything she has worked for for many years and give up the fight. It would have been more believable for Tris to survive a bullet to the head than for Evelyn to reconcile so easily with Tobias and surrender her throne. These holes in the plot were hard to overlook. I hate to say it, but Roth should not be surprised if people do not continue reading her books because she has broken the trust of her readers. Not only that, unless the movie producers take the liberty to change the ending of the third book in the third movie, people will not want to see the movies. Roth should have taken into consideration who her audience is. I must say that I am going to have to pretend that the book ended differently than it did because it is so disappointing to think Tris and Tobias did not get their happy ending, especially considering that Roth could have still gotten her message across without Tris actually dying.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this so that I'd be able to watch Netflix on the living room television. Currently I use a Roku 2 XS in the bedroom and I found myself wanting to purchase another for the living room. Rather than coughing up another ~$60 - $80 for a 3rd generation Roku, I elected to try out the Chromecast - at $35, I thought surely I couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />It's easy enough to set up, no complaints there. The problem is that it's a pain in the ass to use. To use it with your computer, you actually have to go to Netflix, sign in, choose whatever you want to view, play it, then switch it over to the Chromecast. Episode ended? You have to get back on your computer (or phone), go back to the episode page, choose the next episode, click play, and change the stream over to Netflix AGAIN. Every time. I had no idea it was going to be so cumbersome to use.<br /><br />To use it on your phone, you have to first download the Chromecast app and pair the device. Then you have to download the Netflix app (if not already installed), and set it up for your Netflix account. Luckily, it is much less cumbersome in the app: you simply switch the video to the Chromecast in the Netflix app, browse until you find something to watch, and hit play. Episode done? Browse to the next one. If it weren't for the app, this thing would be sent back immediately.<br /><br />\\"But you can do more than just watch Netflix on it!\\"<br />No, not really. At least, not right now. You can cast youtube videos if you want, I guess. I watched a few and realized that it's a huge pain in the ass. It's much faster to just watch youtube in your browser; you have to wait for the Chromecast to access the video with its built in app and then load said video. You then have to wait a bit before the video buffers to better quality so it doesn't look horrendous. Also on that note, most of the videos are pretty terrible quality, which is only exacerbated by my 52\\" living room tv. Suffice it to say, I don't project using the youtube functionality ever again.<br /><br />\\"But you can stream music to it!\\"<br />That is a factual statement, yes. Why would you stream music over a television, though? Stereo, headphones, and computer speakers all exist...<br /><br />\\"Well, you can also cast Chrome browser tabs to it.\\"<br />If I was in a business environment and giving presentations, sure. But I'm sitting at home on my couch. Plus, I've been having some speed issues with Chrome lately and for some reason it continues to freeze in Blackboard connect when checking answers in online homework...resulting in any entered data being lost. But back on topic, any non-youtube video is going to be jumpy. I routinely watch NHL games in NHL Gamecenter Live on my laptop in full HD. Trying to stream these to the tv results in very jumpy video with no audio transferred. I wish there was an NHL Gamecenter app that worked like the youtube plugin, I'd get a ton more use out of this device.<br /><br />As it stands, I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because, well, it's just okay. I'm still deciding whether or not I want to return it and just spend the $15 more to get a basic Roku that will play netflix and stream gamecenter games.<br /><br />Update (11/7/2013): I've decided to keep it, and I'm adding a star. The Pandora app was just released (although I don't use it) and hopefully the sdk will be out soon so that more can come. What this device does, it does very well. There have been a few instances where I've played youtube tutorial videos on my television so I could do something on my laptop at the same time, so that's moderately useful. Hopefully soon full screen non-youtube videos can be broadcasted rather than having to just broadcast the whole tab with the video windowed, but that could be a flash thing.
1476727651|3.0|Not so much. The Shining is a masterpiece. Its sequel suffers from what I call Joe Hill Syndrome: way too much gore and hideous cruelty. Yes, some of that adolescent wet-dream horror is okay, even necessary for the plot, but Steve goes way overboard. A gentleman his age should know better.<br />Compare this novel with 11/22/63, another masterpiece. See what I mean?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Brushes continued his spell-binding tales. Government incompetence at all levels is clearly displayed with numerous examples. Pace of the writing is spell-binding.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I only watched this because my niece recommended it and we have similar tastes.  I was easily sucked in and watched the entire first season in a couple of days.  It is definitely not for the very young, those who are easily impressionable or those who are easily grossed out or offended.  There is a lot of violence and blood and some male nudity (from behind). Personally, I didn’t find it very scary - I didn’t spook once, but it is creepy and there are times when some might be startled enough to jump.  I watched because I was fascinated by the complexity of the relationships and the layers of deceit, love and cruelty. My niece is studying to be a psychiatrist and having watched this series, now I know why she’s such a huge fan.  I have to say I’m a fan too.
B00AEBBA0Y|4.0|Not exactly a work of art, nor it did really stay close to the book. However, amusing and lighthearted. It was fun and if you have a little cash to spare why not get it? Otherwise buy the book its better...
006202406X|1.0|This book was absolutely terrible. I know a lot of people are unhappy about the ending but that isn't just it. The book is slow. Everything I loved from the previous books are lacking in this one and it is about 40 pages too long. I ended up skimming the very end because it was ridiculous. It just drones on and on. I loved this serious. I read the first two books in two days. I was very excited about the final book. I understand that final books tend to be a little disappointing no matter how they turn out (considering a final book means a favorite series is ending) but this one is the worst. I wasn't exceptionally happy with the way Hunger Games ended but it didn't ruin the entire series the way this one did. I will never be able to reread these books because the last book is so bad. I am extremely disappointed in this book and honestly if I could go back I wouldn't waste my time on the series at all. I will no longer recommend this series to people. I believe anyone who claims they enjoyed this book is lying to themselves and everyone around them.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|A glimpse into the good old days in New York.  Good acting, good story, and good morals.  No one jumped into bed with anyone. Both the good and bad side of people was shown.  The good side prevailed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is sweet!  What are you waiting for? Download now and you won't be sorry.  Better than other games and dragons.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is addictive and fun. Spend hours getting sucked into it. Love being able to play on my kindle at night vs my phone. I hope we get other great king games on kindle soon.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Good action sequences.  Bad language kept to a minimum.  New twist to an overworked theme.  Not for the really young.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an amazing book I loved it. Will definitely watch the movie when it comes out! I will read again!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Vert bloody movie. Slave hero wins girl at end. A lot lot of blood and N word used in the film. Not for children. A way to look at the slave trade in America.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It is very bright just like a flashlight.  Have used it many times to fine light switches in barns. It is better than my old one.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|Nothing overwhelming revealing in Mr. Emerick's observations but it is  good personal insight into the personality of the Beatles.  Very good description of how revolutionary the music engineering was and how the Beatles relied on professionals to get the sound they wanted.  It is fun to read about the little intricacies in the recordings and then listening for them in the songs.  Mr. Emerick's descriptions of some of the engineering was a little over my head, but I appreciate his attempt to keep it in laymen's terms..  Will certainly read it again in the future.  This is a keeper!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game play is smooth, works great on the kindle. Happy that it was made available for kindle. The levels are more than challenging when you reach the 100+ levels. Some levels it is luck of the draw to finish them without buying the extra helpers. Only wish is that when you are sent extra lives they were stored up. 5 lives and that's it until the timer gives you more or your friends spread out when they send you lives. That's the only bummer I find to the game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Coming from king gamer and awesome guy  it's fantabulous 1 Fla was at lvl 22 and it totally restarted my game that s it so great game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is fun and keeps you angry when you can not get to the next level.  But I enjoy the game and so do my grandchildren.  Fun game for the hole family.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really fun game but I wish they would have made it longer the first time. Mystery games are awesome !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I chose this rating for candy crush because It made me extremely happy to see it was available for the Kindle. So excited and so delighted that it is finally there for me to play while I am not busy when I am at break at work. Thank you Amazon for getting it capability ready for the kindle :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Without a doubt, Veronica Roth's best work so far. Better than Divergent and Insurgent combined, Allegiant takes the reader on an emotional roller coster with after-shocks that won't seem to end.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved going through this game.  My granddaughters have repeatedly gone through the whole game.  It is a great game.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I really have fun playing but can also get frustrated.  I do like the second game better because of the choice of easy, medium, and hard.  I hope to get better some day
098478280X|2.0|This would have been a great book except for one major flaw which I found stressfully annoying.<br /><br />The author rarely provides a full Java solution for any of her problems. Moreover, much of her partial solutions are either wrong or confusing. Why can't the author just provide a full java code? To save paper?<br /><br />In my opinion, the author's problem is that she assumes we understand what she is presupposing when she provides her code examples, but much of her assumption is wrong.<br /><br />For example, the author incorporates methods and data types in her code which she never bothers to specify. Although much of the missing code can be deduced, much of it needlessly adds to the befuddlement of the reader.<br /><br />As others also have noted, some of the author's code examples are simply wrong. Computers don't lie and they spit much of her code example as erroneous (meaning they do not provide the output the code had meant to create).<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Has EXCELLENT set of coding problems that has become the bread and butter of coding interviews.<br />2)Excellent if you are already strongly familiar with much of the concepts and only need a refresher.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)Code examples are maddeningly missing many critical methods and data types. The author simpy assumes we would know them without writing them down. This was very annoying to me.<br />2)Many code examples are wrong. It could be something simple as writing the variables in wrong order when calling a method etc. Those little, errors, of course, makes all the difference in the code.
072325804X|5.0|the book is in good condition, except for few dent in the cover. I presume that the dents were from delievering via air mail. Other than that I am enjoying the book.
0744014956|4.0|I would like to see a bit more description of some of the things in the game... but over all it is a decent guide.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So  happy to have Candy Crush on my kindle! I was very disappointed when i was not able to download it when i bought the kindle. Yayayayayyayayyaay!
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The graphics on this game are fantastic and the game is terrific.  Fire Maple has fantastic games.  I love both this game and The Lost City.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I cannot believe the ending to this series, or that I wasted my time reading the first two books and waiting months for the third one to come out. I'm all for the unexpected and know that not everything can wrapped up with ribbons and bows but come on! Roth really dropped the ball with this one. As previously mentioned, the POV changing was confusing and there was no real difference between Tris' POV and Four's POV, it was like reading the same person throughout the entire book. The ending was not an ending, it was a sudden halt, a freight train that slams to a still and never begins forward motion again, it seemed a lazy way to end the book by having her taken out by a character we barely learned anything about it was poorly constructed and poorly executed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very happy I can play Candy Crush on my Kindle. Was having to only play when at my computer, which was only twice a day. Now I am playing more and love it . Thanks for adding it to your apps.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have always loved John Grisham's books. I can remember when I was introduced to his writing when I read A Time To Kill. I read ALL of the time - I inhale books. I have been disappointed in the last few Grisham books. In fact, I was quite irritated to read his baseball ones. I felt he had abandoned his best writing : lawyer, courtrooms, small Southern towns. Well, I just finished Sycamore Row. Oh, my! It's a wonderful book. I loved how I could not guess how the ending would be. I will have to say Grisham is back 100%. This book will shoot to the number one spot on the best sellers list!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Excellent Game would recomend to all. Levels are good but can be anoying at times still good fun though - Excellent
B0079J26XO|2.0|These first attempts by EMI to belatedly improve the sound of many of their great recordings by giving them the considerable advantages of DSD and SACD processing, have sadly laid an EGG -  and it sure isn't golden! If EMI can't do better than this it's a shame, and hardly worth the effort.<br /><br />Now I have found the sound does vary, depending on SACD players. But even with my reference players, the Sony XA5400ES or the Oppo BDP-105, they are no great shakes and hardly worth the extra cash  on top of what the original releases were selling for. So if you have these original releases on vinyl or Red Book, keep them until EMI learns how to make a proper SACD.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The second in the new Trekkie series proved to be a little less fun than the original, but a better film.  Characters become more developed and action is still there.  Benedict (from BBC Sherlock) is a wonderfully creepy Khan.
B00DYEBM3I|3.0|The music is fine: its Mazzy Star.  My problem is the minimal packaging.  For example, the credits mention that Bert Jansch plays on this record; however, no mention of what song or songs he plays on.  My point is, if I'm going to pay a couple extra bucks over and above the price of the download for a CD, what I expect is some information.
B008602KQI|4.0|Enjoyed watching this with my son.  Heard it was a great series of books and the movie was definitely entertaining.<br /><br />Glad we got to see it before the next one comes out!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had some knowledge of the orphan trains of the last century. Kline's fictionalized telling of historical facts brings the plight of the orphans to light. Very thought-provoking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It makes you want to keep playing all the time. Can't stop at 2 stars got to get 3. Wish you were given more lives.
B008LP8QE8|4.0|Up to date as every one of the previous versions I know. This is my first version as e-book and I am surprised how easy it is to navigate and read on your PC or tablet. However navigation on iPad is not so easy as on your PC because the actual page-numbers are mixed up with the number of physical pages.<br />Having said this, more hyperlinks could have made my rating 5-stared
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent DVD!  I pre-ordered after the season finale and received the lowest price offered when it was finally released in late August!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was wary of buying this book.  The whole plot and storyline sounded, well, weird and dumb.  Was I ever wrong!<br /><br />The story is so engrossing that I had a hard time putting it down.  I kept looking at the progress meter at the bottom of my Kindle and was sad to say after reading my first \\"section\\" I was almost 40% through the book. Not that the book is that short, it's just that GREAT!<br /><br />Terrific characters, fun story, fantasy and imagination, good and evil all rolled into one.  This is the kind of book that, at the end (so sorry it had to end!), you go looking to see what else this author has written and only hope that those books can compare to this one.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to buy The Ocean at the End of the Lane.  You will not be disappointed!
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|All I needed was to record a phone conversation and this handy app did exactly that. No complaints. Works like a charm!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|All of us wonder what it's like after we die. Is there nothing or something? Like the Dr who wrote this I've always been more on the scientific side, so for this to be written by someone who is in fact a neurosurgeon that has always relied on science is believable and amazing to me. I lost my mom almost 3 years ago and have been devastated ever since. After reading this I actually believe she is watching me and I will be with her again some day!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|The Zoom H4N is the perfect companion for an amateur film maker like myself. It's ruggedly built, easy to use, and records wonderful sound<br /><br />The directional mics on the top work great as a shotgun mic during interviews and scenes. XLR inputs are very handy as well. I can easily mount the Zoom to my DSLR which is also handy for solo film projects.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Perfect characters for this movie.  Loved the music and magic.  Will not tell you the story and spoil it for you.  A must see and keep.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|It's ok, but better graphics would help this type of game. Since attention is a major point for this game, graphics would do wonders for it.
6305428352|5.0|I have this on VHS but wanted the DVD,  I have watched it only once on DVD, but oh my, it does make a huge difference.  This is a movie I watch about every 1-2 months.  If you have not seen it, you will love it as it has so many of the quality elements.  Actors for this one are just perfect too!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is still one of the best shows on television. The cast is superb and there is never a dull episode!
0071766588|5.0|I got this book with the aim to have a excellent grade in the TOEFL and because I did not have a lot of time to study was one of my main reasons to buy it. It is an excellent tool because it explains with great details all the major points you need to understand in order to obtain an excellent grade in all 4 sections of the test. In particular, I think the Writing section is extremely helpful not only because of the tips it gives you to improve your writing skills for the test, but also because it has at the end of the book great recommendations to improve your writing for academic and professional purposes.<br /><br />In general, I strongly recommend this book for anybody who not only would like to pass the TOEFL, but also would like to improve his/her english language skills. Good luck in your test!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and definitely gives you a view of human nature and the things we take for granted.  Enjoy the end of this series.

B00EDX5QNG|5.0|This is an incredible achievement. Dark, Brooding, Funky, Bluesy and beyond. A friend turned me on to this on behalf that I'm a huge Peter Gabriel fan.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the series but I thought the second and third books each lost a little from the one before
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent book, well written!  Heart warming and heart wrenching.  A Book Clubs must!  You won't be able to put it down!
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This is a great rocdoc for musicians and gearheads.  I actually got to visit Sound City once upon a time, but had no idea about the history that took place there.  Grohl's obvious appreciation for the recording process and his compassion for those that went before is refreshing in this age of cynicism.  Great story told by a great storyteller.
B00DJ3ITKS|5.0|This is a book on Strategic Management and Strategic Thinking. This book decrypts the brain of Bezos in organizing, building, disrupting, confronting, diverting and doing all what it takes to create tributaries of economy which makes amazon.com
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz has been on a roll for awhile now.  This homage to Memphis R&B fits nicely with the super-fine jazz standards of But Beautiful and Speak Low which I think are just excellent.  The guy has the feel, chops and experience to do these old chestnuts justice.<br />Keep them coming.
B007ZYK3CE|3.0|the tyrannosaur is alcoholic psychopath played in an unintelligible mumble by mullan...and many or most of us have already encountered some variety of him...the hopeless man of violence encounters a hopeless woman, of an equal violence, but disguised by a gentle and sharing nature, and together they manage to revive one another, against odds.  my advice, for a much better illustration of life's wrong side (which may be most of it), except for the unlikely saves, try nelson algren.  seems a well done film (if i could hear it, or acquire gaellic), but many better versions of just how trapped one can be, and still continue, for better or worse, have already been done.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|By far, this series, up until the near the end of Season Three, has been the most intelligent, engrossing, and well written I have taken the time to watch in years.  I found myself engrossed in the depth of the characters; enamored with acting, costumes, scenery, and brilliant twists in all subplots.  I would have been beyond impatient waiting for Season Four had the ending of Season Three not been so horrid.  The development of Matthew's character was one of the main reasons I so looked forward to future episodes; I couldn't wait to see how he would save Downton and even possibly bring to it an even more exciting future.  But now, I have no desire to watch next season.  The plans I had to purchase all three seasons on DVD for my parents as a Christmas gift are now by the wayside because it is just too dreadful to watch.  So sad to see a beautiful series disintegrate.  The only way I will reconsider is if by some remarkable twist, Matthew survived the crash.  I'll wait to hear from friends who choose to watch in January ... but as mentioned, they've lost my business for now.
B006LXQID8|5.0|the film is interspersed with authoritative announcements, that cite incidents and coincidences of data...as the anarchic amelie frolics here way past an aboriginal truth that may be her undoing...a life measured out in &#34;strategems&#34;, complexes of time, place, and execution, may be missing it's own point, which they counterpoint nicely.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I began reading the A Song of Ice and Fire books earlier this year, and it took me most of it to get to A Dance with Dragons.  But ADWD was the book I read the fastest, I couldn't put it down.
B00C2C637I|5.0|If you enjoy a story that is a bit unpredictable, a bit spooky, told in language that is poetic, unexpected and visually evocative, you'll like this!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I'm sure there are countless great works of art that were never appreciated in their time and won't be luckily enough ever be fully appreciated.  Luckily, Rodriguez' story was brought to light by the excellent film and now many more people know his music.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Well it does make a rather weak case for the existence of god but overall an exciting fantasy tale and the Indian culture of stressing on details with comic effect is lost on so many readers who might find the writing style exaggerated or forced. If only religious people took their own religion this lightly and didn't take it seriously enough to judge and condemn others by it.<br /><br />I'm sure the expression &#34;Jesus, Mary, Mohammed and Vishnu!&#34; will provoke many religious people into anger more than make many atheists laugh at its simplistic approach to religion.<br /><br />Highly recommended reading.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandberg<br /><br />\\"Lean In\\" is a well-balanced book that calls for equality.  It provides guidance on how to help women seek leadership roles and seek fulfillment and satisfaction in all aspects of their lives.  It's an inspirational book that encourages women to dream big and achieve their full potential by \\"leaning in\\".  It also helps men gain an understanding on how to support women in the workplace and at home. Chief operating officer at Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg shares her fascinating personal journey while providing the public with an illuminating and useful book.  This enlightening 241-page book includes the following eleven chapters: 1. The Leadership Ambition Gap: What Would You Do if You Weren't Afraid?, 2. Sit at the Table, 3. Success and Likeability, 4. It's a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder, 5. Are You My Mentor?, 6. Seek and Speak Your Truth, 7. Don't Leave Before You Leave, 8. Make Your Partner a Real Partner, 9. The Myth of Doing It All, 10. Let's Start Talking About It, and 11. Working Together Toward Equality.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. As well written a book as you will find.  Engaging prose.<br />2. Gender equality is such an important yet neglected topic. I'm glad to see someone of Sandberg's credentials tackling this issue in a powerful yet reasonable manner.<br />3. I was concerned that this book was going to inspire women at the expense of men (male bashing) but nothing could be further from the truth. Sandberg is an energetic force but she is fair and instructive.<br />4. I really liked the balanced style of how this book was written.  Sandberg is engaging (a touch of humor, a little deprecation), forthright, and the book is well sourced (love that).<br />5. Sandberg loves to speak with substance.  This book is full of facts and source material. \\"A meager twenty-one of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. Women hold about 14 percent of executive officer positions, 17 percent of board seats, and constitute 18 percent of our elected congressional officials.\\"<br />6. Does a wonderful job of going over the complex challenges that women face. \\"The gender stereotypes introduced in childhood are reinforced throughout our lives and become self-fulfilling prophesies. Most leadership positions are held by men, so women don't expect to achieve them, and that becomes one of the reasons they don't.\\"<br />7. Shares some fascinating stories and testimonials about her life.  The people who inspired her and those who played an instrumental role in her career.  Some high-level name dropping...it's good to be well connected.<br />8. The insecurities that hold people back. \\"This phenomenon of capable people being plagued by self-doubt has a name--the impostor syndrome. Both men and women are susceptible to the impostor syndrome, but women tend to experience it more intensely and be more limited by it.\\"<br />9. The book is also surprisingly candid, \\"Many of us have experienced being angry with someone and then having to pretend everything's great in public. My husband, Dave, and I have our moments, and just when we are getting into it, it will be time to go to a friend's house for dinner. We put on our \\"everything's great\\" smiles, and amazingly, after a few hours, it often is.\\"<br />10. There are a lot of tidbits that are enlightening and useful.  \\"If we want a world with greater equality, we need to acknowledge that women are less likely to keep their hands up. We need institutions and individuals to notice and correct for this behavior by encouraging, promoting, and championing more women.\\" Interesting, I'll keep that in mind along with other useful information.<br />11. The reality of stereotypes. \\"This experiment supports what research has already clearly shown: success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women.\\" \\"Fear is at the root of so many of the barriers that women face.\\" Many great examples.<br />12. An interesting discussion on career growth, \\"ladders are limiting--people can move up or down, on or off. Jungle gyms offer more creative exploration. There's only one way to get to the top of a ladder, but there are many ways to get to the top of a jungle gym.\\"<br />13. Excellent chapter on mentorship. \\"Studies show that mentors select prot&eacute;g&eacute;s based on performance and potential.\\" A lot of interesting subtopics covered.<br />14. Important traits to have. \\"Communication works best when we combine appropriateness with authenticity, finding that sweet spot where opinions are not brutally honest but delicately honest.\\" \\"Taking initiative pays off. It is hard to visualize someone as a leader if she is always waiting to be told what to do.\\"<br />15. Great quotes, one of my favorites \\"the upside of painful knowledge is so much greater than the downside of blissful ignorance\\". Another, \\"The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.\\"<br />16. A great discussion on making your partner a real partner.  \\"A more equal division of labor between parents will model better behavior for the next generation.\\"<br />17. Find out the worst question to ask a woman.  Hint...Tina Fey said it.<br />18. As a husband and a father of two, Sandberg makes some cogent points regarding shared-parenting duties that resonate. \\"If there is a new normal for the workplace, there is a new normal for the home too.\\"<br />19. The need for not only the conversation about equality to take place but to inspire a transformation.  Sandberg's success as a business leader, drive and global visibility will go a long way toward reaching such goals. \\"Talking can transform minds, which can transform behaviors, which can transform institutions.\\"<br />20. Defining what leadership is ultimately about. \\"Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.\\"<br />21. One of the best referenced books you'll ever read.<br />22.  Sandberg is donating all her income from this book to establish the Lean In nonprofit organization.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. One of the most difficult aspects of dealing with gender issues is recognizing that we are evolved primates and differences between the sexes manifest themselves in our behavior.  As Gloria Steinem incorrectly observed, \\"It's not about biology, but about consciousness.\\"  No, it's about both.  We are limited by our biology but we can certainly become a better society if we consciously empower women by improving conditions that lead to their full fulfillment as potential leaders if they so desire.  Recognizing our biological differences and putting our evolved brains to better use will in the end lead to the desired results that Sandberg so eloquently inspires us to seek.  I always cringe when people conveniently want to do deny or set aside our biology.  For the record, I have the utmost respect and admiration for Gloria Steinem I just happen to disagree on this issue.<br />2. How effectively can an average woman put this book to practical use?  The meteoric rise of Sandberg is reflected in this book and immediately puts her in circles that the average person can't relate to.  In short, how relevant will this book be for the average woman?<br />3. I have reservations about one testimonial that Sandberg shared.  Honestly, how many women have the opportunity to pump milk while conducting a high-level meeting? \\"But the advent of the modern-day breast pump has changed the equation. At Google, I would lock my office door and pump during conference calls.\\" It's a cultural issue worth discussing and it's one area where leadership can do more to help.<br />4. Single women jumping around in the jungle gym (more reflective of the modern corporate ladder) may feel left out. There is one good reference worth mentioning though, \\"My coworkers should understand that I need to go to a party tonight--and this is just as legitimate as their kids' soccer game--because going to a party is the only way I might actually meet someone and start a family so I can have a soccer game to go to one day!\\" A good story but few and far between.<br />5. As Sandberg stated herself this is not a self-help book or a book strictly about career management; it's an inspirational book that incorporates such elements.  Women looking for books strictly along those lines would be advised to read someone like Selena Rezvani.<br />6. The lack of a bibliography.  A book that makes so many references warranted a separate formal bibliography.  Notes are included and they are excellent but a bibliography would have added value.<br /><br />In summary, this is an important book that will hopefully achieve its goal of inspiring more women to \\"lean in\\" and achieve their full potential.  You may not agree with every suggestion or conclusion Sandberg reaches but we may all agree that we owe it to our wives, mothers, sisters and daughters to true equality.  Despite some of my reservations, I really enjoyed and learned some valuable lessons from this enlightening book.  I highly recommend it and men this is a conversation worth having!<br /><br />Further recommendations: \\"[[ASIN:1591795176 Conscious Business: How to Build Value Through Values]]\\" by Fred Kofman, \\"[[ASIN:0671027034 How to Win Friends & Influence People]]\\" by Dale Carnegie, \\"[[ASIN:1118104900 Pushback: How Smart Women Ask--and Stand Up--for What They Want]]\\" by Selena Rezvani, \\"[[ASIN:1401303706 The Dream Manager]]\\" by Mathew Kelly, \\"[[ASIN:1885167776 The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results]]\\" by Gary Keller, \\"[[ASIN:0385528752 Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard]]\\" by Chip and Dan Heath, \\"[[ASIN:023034190X Work with Me: The 8 Blind Spots Between Men and Women in Business]]\\" by Barbara Annis and John Gray, \\"[[ASIN:0061789089 Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don't]]\\" by Jeffrey Pfeffer, \\"[[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]]\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, \\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\" by Charles Duhigg, \\"Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success\\" by Rick Newman, and \\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\\".andberg is donating all her income from this book to establish the Lean In nonprofit organization.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1.

1451613520|5.0|I have had a wonderful experience learning about this book, and I can't wait to read Mr. Stone's point of view.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I like to hike but this book is not really about hiking.  In my opinion it is about dealing with one's troubles and emotions.  The author, who is the main character, had her life in a downward spiral.  She decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail.  She was not at all prepared but the act of hiking did cassist her to putting her life back in order.<br /><br />The book also deals with the lives of the other people on the trail she meets.  Many of the people also have problems in their lives and we learn how they are dealing well (or poorly) with their problems.<br /><br />The book reads like a novel although it is biographical.  It's a good book for discussion - book clubs.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Great to see two beautiful people in the same movie - Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.  Alfred Hitchcock had a cameo appearance as well. The movie was well worth watching just for the cinematic landscape views. Just good old fashioned classical Hollywood entertainment.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|I enjoyed this. I have never seen the original. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light action film.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Amazing book....until the lynchpin was removed :( I don't want to give anything away, but I loved it and hated it at the same time.
B000GFLE1S|3.0|It reminded me of the movie I saw when it first played in the USA. I liked it then and now want to see the Broadway production...just wanted to see how well I remembered it.
0525953728|3.0|The book was very boring in contents, donated to local library after reading it. Not really worth the amount it was purchased at.
B0045HCJ94|2.0|all i can say is what the hell?<br />listening to e.t. saying gd every 10 minutes was gross<br /><br />this movie does remind me of some drunks i used to babysit for<br />in the early 70s<br /><br />and yeah, this probably is how the liberal professors think life is<br /><br />blah, i gotta go walk the dogs to get this out of my brain
1594203334|4.0|it's a good reading and information about raising a child with different culture. it was such a nice insights for mothers to be.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wasn't the ending I was hoping for but very well done nonetheless I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 books
B00G32QIEG|4.0|This was an entertaining movie with some good monsters in it. It was a bit predicable, but worth watching and we look forward to watching a sequel to it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Liked the story line.  Wished that there was more about the aftermath.  Will look for the next books for sure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. The one thing that I wish it had was a hint button for a hint or two. I told my about it and also some of my family, they all are playing it now. Hope you get more levels soon.
1401937519|5.0|Everyone should read this but especially people working with cancer patients.  This should give everyone hope that we are capable of healing from any serious disease.
B005PK553C|5.0|Effortlessly twisted and macab... I found the first season of American Horror Story, horrificly Excellent!<br />This show will have you staying up all night, watching episode after episode.
B008Y212PI|1.0|This is a paid app, I completed all puzzles in one week, thought I would be getting more puzzles but NO. I got a page saying congratulations you have completed ALL the puzzles please BUY another game!!!!!!!!<br />What? You want me to give you $2.00 a week to play your games????<br />When I buy an app I expect to be able to use it for a while.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun, entertaining, and progressive. Ideal for down time with the kids. Allows for imaginative and cognitive skills. Hate the squirrel.ppl
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a great game and a fun time waster.  Now that being said,  It will never be a 5 star game with the limitations it has with android operating systems.  There are a lot of extras that you get with apple IOS version.  Actually if you look at some of the apple IOS features you could say the android version really sucks.  So I give it 3 stars for fun only, but a big thumbs down for equality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to play.  It kept me guessing each time. Definitely makes you think in order to escape!! Looking forward to new levels to come!!
006202406X|5.0|I thought the book really started off great. I always get sad when Tris and Tobias have problems, but who doesn't. I read many of these reviews before I read this book so I braced myself for the worst, but as the book went on I hoped that the death wouldn't be true. I understand what Roth did and it totally makes sense if you think about events that happened in the other two books. Read this book you won't regret it if you are a true fan, no matter what. Experience this read for yourself.
B009CG25JM|5.0|I love this movie and it was awesome to get to watch it in HD.  The soundtrack is full of great music from the time period and tons of beautiful cars.  Love it!!!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Loved it! Thank you John Grisham for another wonderful read! It was hard to put down and made me laugh and cry.
B000065V3H|3.0|I purchased this item for my son. It's not an easy item to find so thank you. we will enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when I found Candy Crush for the Kindle. I was thinking about getting an iPad so I could play. So glad that I can keep my Kindle and play. Candy Crush is addictingly fun. Love It!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It is one of her all time favorites. Not easy to find.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is  awesome and when u get to level 32 u unlock dino world and if u have a dino it automatically goes to dino world and another thing is if u  get an update do it immediately or u will not get to play for awhile.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this series of books. I was only sorry there were only 3 in the series. I recommend these books. Great for teens.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Bought it with good price, and it does look good. However, if you are not wearing it more than 24hour, it stops. I through away the box, else I would return it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook has gotten to be a lot of pretty little sayings. I really don't have time for this right now.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is the best app ever.  I use it all the time, it offers daily reading plans, different translations and everything you need to read and understand the Bible.  I have been using it on a variety of platforms for four years.  They just keep making it better.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I seriously don't even know where to begin.  I loved the first two books.  I hated this one.  WHY KILL TRIS?! I read to escape - this wasn't escape - more like sensationalism and trying to make a statement.  I get its a dystopian novel - but the draw of the dystopian novel (for me) is seeing the rise of the underdog and making things better if not giddily-living-in-paradisiacal-like-peace.  If you like that sort of thing (depressingly close to real life outcomes), then this is the book for you! However, I'm just going to pretend this doesn't exist and imagine Four and Tris got their HEA anyways.<br /><br />I don't think I'll be reading any more of Ms. Roth's books unless she can get through another series without killing the main characters off - OR - give them the HEA they deserve.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of the best games ever and I would recommend this game to everyone. I can't believe how far I have gotten so quickly.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This should have been a free app.  Every time the alarm goes off it asks if you want to download pro.  Save yourself the money.  It is pretty but......  Totally not worth the aggravation.
B0042TV4IC|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford resonates beyond period piece status because we can identify with people grappling with circumstances beyond their control. This is a masterful blend of the intricacies of community, with it's many personalities, and the greater human condition. The ever present need to find a way to support a family, sparse incomes, and a feudal system that limited people from financial advancement bring a fresh perspective to the screen. Despite all, the community bonds to try to make things right and people help one another.  The post mistress is incredible, leading by example and connecting helpers with those who need help, like a poised diplomat, unaffected by station, keeping the peace. This is a fabulous dramatic series that the entire family can enjoy!
031624662X|5.0|I tore through this book like my life depended on it. Complex, engrossing, with great characters and intriguing political machinations.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Kawasaki walks you through the steps to fundamentally improve the relationships and perceptions of those around you by focusing on your own actions, attitude and vision .  Echoing themes from The 4 Agreements, Leadership and Self Deception and How to Win Friends and  Influence People, this book takes somewhat abstract ideas and shows you in concise terms how to apply them and bring people not just to position of agreement but to a position of advocation.<br />If you lead a team or a company, sell a product or just yourself this is a book to not just read but study.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game, so glad I can play it on my kindle now! I think it needs to have a little more in the instructions. I am new to the game and can't figure out how to move to the next level w/o purchasing it.
B005FITIGO|4.0|If you look at the crisis and controversy of the era- housing bubble, bank failures, and the political pressure to give loans to those who couldn't pay for their housing... it all gets laid out for you to put together.  Brilliantly done and better than the original.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A well-known tome by this time. Nevertheless, my two cents: Illuminating Lincoln by illuminating his cabinet is a masterstroke. Superbly written.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was very good, especially the second half. It was interesting to see the adjustment back into &#34;life&#34; for them. You don't think about that, and the difficulty of trying to mold back into society.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book is a great continuation of Beautiful Creatures.  Its really kept me interested in the story and is well written.  I enjoy books with a lot of twist and turns and mystery and this book delivers.
B006QKKMBA|4.0|Love all these movies, this one was the most intense and kept you hooked through the whole movie.  Thought it was the final movie, but its not.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|It's nice to be able to browse items on my tablet.  I don't usually order on my tablet; wait til I get on my computer, etc.  But it's nice to be able to see what's available online and check on availability, reviews, etc.
B002YDTPHA|4.0|I love all these movies, but I always felt that they should end after three movies.  I love what happens at the end of this movie and ties all the other movies in together!
030758836X|5.0|The book was in great condition! and the STORY WAS FANTASTIC. I bought this for book club, and loved it. I've loaned it to a few friends since. GREAT BOOK!
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie brings back the best of memories from my childhood.  This movie is something that I have watched numerous times and continue to have my children watch.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Felt like it was written by a different author and was trying too hard to be 'deep'.  I was excited for it to come out and was extremely disappointed.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great realistic game. The graphics are Unmatched! The only thing I dispute so far is when you shoot its like your gun blows up! Just a little too much on that.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|This is absolutely a great movie,the fact that will smith wrote this movie even make's it  greater, man where do I start,wills son for his first real movie his acting was spot on I was truly impressed how he displayed such emotions as a new actor,will I thought was a little to serious for his role but was still impressive as all-ways,M.knight-who in my opinion films movies with really bad camera angles really toned it down for this one, and earned his seat as a director,I've only liked two movies that he did,the happening and and the village,I only notice one bad angle in the movie.overall if you like sci-fi movies In my humble opinion this is one of greats sci fi movie ever made.people please ignore people'saying this movie bad their blind or dumb.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I need one of my friends to finish this book so we can discuss it!  I'm heartbroken but happy. I don't think this series could have ended any other way. Keep the stories coming Veronica Roth!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game and it's highly addictive. Love to play when the kids are asleep . Recommend to all my friend's
0761171703|5.0|This item was posted direct to my granddaughter and she rang me immediately to tell me how delighted she was to received it.  It was a complete surprise for her.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another winner for Grisham.  The plot was tight, but littered with collI'mar Southern story telling.  Reading this was in many ways like sitting on the front porch after Sunday dinner.  Grisham accurately and passionate describes life in the Deep South during the last century.<br /><br />An excellent book--I heartedly recommend.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. It's very fun an interactive. You can do all sorts of stuff in ponyville, canterlot, and the canterlot wondercolts school as you go through the mirror and dance to the EG Stomp, opening theme of the movie,and strange new world. Thank you Gameloft. XOXO, MLPstopmoition.
B0035LMTZA|3.0|A fun movie, frankly nothing to do with the original Italian Job. The location shots are awesome and the action filming is great. Don't think too hard about the plot and be prepared to suspend your disbelief.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Have always loved this concert ever since i seen it originally aired. Glad that i have it to watch anytime i want. Love the extras! RIP Kurt &#60;3 Always!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|yeah! wonderful exciting my husband and. my daughter. love the game to. and we cant wait for the weekly challenges
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I noticed that kindle is getting apps from Apple but that's awesome I love kindle now  this is great put yes if u agree
B004685W3C|5.0|I already owned the previous deluxe edition with the &#34;Live from Paris&#34; EP, but the more I thought about it and the farther in love I fell with Melody Gardot and this album in particular, the more reasonable it became to double-dip for this second deluxe edition for the three remixes and the &#34;Bye Bye Blackbird&#34; EP. I'm glad I splurged, because the four new tracks are terrific (admittedly, I'm less enthralled with the three remixes). Plus, my original purchase of the album was digital and now I have a gorgeous CD box set on my shelf, allowing me to stare endlessly at the young chanteuse who has so roundly captured my attention.<br /><br />As for the album proper, it's already a Top 10 for me after just four years (is it really that old already?). I couldn't even guess how many times I've played it. &#34;Baby, I'm a Fool&#34; gets me every time. &#34;Your Heart Is as Black as Ice&#34;? Gardot vamps it up and it's amazing. The simple sweetness of &#34;If the Stars Were Mine&#34; is the joy of falling in love set to music. The title track could be dull and overlong in someone else's hands, but Gardot's aching vocals make it one of the most intimate songs she's yet recorded.<br /><br />I've thought it over, and the truth is that I don't think I could recommend just one edition of the &#34;My One and Only Thrill&#34; album. I really do think you need both &#34;Live in Paris&#34; and &#34;Bye Bye Blackbird&#34; to go with it.
B00492ANTS|1.0|I love Bill Evans, and as originally issued, the sound on this recording might have been great, but the MP3 sound is very poor on my computer/ipod.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Iron Man 3 was so amazing that I need to have the blu-ray. So when I got my order on-time and no damages on the item, it just makes everything perfect!
B004742Y68|4.0|Not overly frightening or scary. But a classic movie to watch during the Halloween season. We all enjoyed it and it didn't give us nightmares.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I absolutely love this show.!!!  I can't wait to get season 6!! Thats next on my list!!! I love Castle!!!
1401242855|5.0|Wow! Anyone thats a Batman fan needs one of these.Awesome for the collection looks great on self for display. Or if you want to wear mask,it is a adult size and would fit most.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Best cast, story and acting I've ever seen. Ever. Had me glued from the very start and kept me glued till the end.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The first two episodes in the new season are simply breath taking! Looking forward for new episodes coming out this weekend.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game but its not fun after you try to pass a level for awhile and you cant. I have lives and moves sent to me but I cant use them :(
B008K6HN8I|1.0|did not like the app and took it off...how else can you say i did not like the app....but have to rite 20 words....gesh
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Love anything free. My kids love it because they get to see all the new releases.  I like it also I can watch all my favorite singers when ever I want.  And it a whole lot easier to use then the VH1 on the DTV4 loader.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  It was very captivating!!  I loved all the characters.  I highly recommend this series.  Be sure to read it you will be glad you did!! Enjoy!!
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Grease is always a fun movie even if it is corny.  My little 4 year old likes it also.  Good music so-so acting.  Trovolta early years.  Liked it at the theater when it came out also.
0307346609|5.0|At first I didn't like the format, or the way it was written. However, after a few chapters I was addicted! It was easy to &#34;see&#34; all the scenarios and it was never boring. It is the most &#34;believable&#34; zombie book I have ever read. I highly recommend it to any readers interested in zombie books! The movie is great too, but very different, and should not be compared to this amazing book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|OMG I can't even watch this alone at night because I get so scared!  I love it!  And the cast is great, I loved Connie Britton in Friday Night Lights so it was fun to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is hard if you get far but it is fun I like to play it a lot I love it
0440246008|5.0|The Hard Way is a super novel.  As with all Lee Child's books, it is hard to put down once you start reading it. Recommend this book to anyone who likes the Jack Reacher character.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|Aaaargh! I'm a totally drunk pilot snortin' coke totally ignoring the regular drink/drug checks on pilots that would never let me get away with 11 years of being a boozy pilot!  Blergg!  Aaahh! Exciting action sequence!  That got you through the first 20 minutes?  OK, well there are another 118 minutes of heavy handed Christian and A.A. propoganda to follow! Just stone cold drinking gallons of vodka and whisky like godless drunks do, hating on family, and just drinking more vodka.  If you want to reinforce your existing beliefs about religion and booze, then this is the movie for you.  If you come into it expecting an interesting film with nuanced performances from established actors - sorry.  Talent wasted on a lousy script.  I've seen better on ABC After-School Specials... including the over the top gallons of pure ethanol consumed
0515142247|5.0|Rated 5 stars. Would have rated even higher if it were an option. Lee Child's books are by far my favorites.  Die Trying is truly a MUST READ.  You won't be disappointed.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|This movie was pretty good, but not nearly as good as the first one.  There are some odd plot decisions and poor dialogue that really keep me from loving this movie.  There are some good jokes here, but I just wish the script had been better.  The special effects, sound, acting, all great.  This one is just not as fun as the first movie was.  Also, this movie doesn't really teach you anything new about any character, making the movie feel rather shallow, and the characters feel static.  It could have been soo much more, but this movie just boils down into a generic action flick.<br /><br />I recommend buying the first one, and renting this one, unless you are a super fan ;)
0515153656|5.0|This is one of the best books by Lee Child.  Hard to put the book down.  Gets your mind trying to figure what will happen next.  Never a dull moment.
B001XUKFAQ|4.0|I love this movie, a lot of fun!  This is fun to watch in groups.  There are a lot of laughs.  I love the fake commercials / trailers that run before the movie to help introduce some of the characters.  In my opinion the movie kind of drags a bit towards the end, but it is still worth watching.<br /><br />I would call this a rental, buy it if you love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hook after the first board!<br />Great game, so glad it's on the Kindle Fire HD!  Now waiting on Zombies vs Plants 2!
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is a good Bond flick, but not a great movie.  Of the three Blonde Bond movies, this one is the worst.  It has fun parts, and some cool new characters, however I didn't enjoy it as much as the last two movies.  Too much of this movie is spent on the topid of Bond being 'too old' or 'damaged' or whatever, this takes away from time they could have spent on a better plot.  There are no cool gadgets in this movie either.  Javier did a great job as the villain, and Daniel Craig is good as usual.  This movie was super over hyped.  Good but not great.<br /><br />I recommend renting it first.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I can not stop listing to it, and for once i love every song!!! I am very happy with it!!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|This was the only book they made me read in school that I actually liked.  This movie is fresh and fun.  The acting is great from everyone involved.  The costumes and sets are fantastic.<br /><br />My girlfriend liked the music, I didn't.  This movie is full of music that was popular like six months ago...  Knowing this I am sure that this movie will feel very dated in a few years because of all this early 2013 music.  I don't understand why they didn't just use music that was popular in the time period this movie actually takes place in.  My gf doesn't feel the same way, she loved all the songs and thinks I'm dumb for thinking that this bad pop music will date the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone that likes good, fun, stylized, drama.  This movie has a lot of each of those qualities, however be aware that this is a tragedy, so don't expect a happy ending or anything.<br /><br />I bought it and I'm sure I will enjoy it for years to come!
B006Z00R1Q|2.0|The movie is very boring and does not live up to the expectation built from the first two movies.  The story does not add any value to the other movies, need better actors
B008XG1X18|5.0|I  am an addict! And i absolutely love the new update. This app keeps getting better and better. I would rather use the app on my Kindle than get on my computer. Pinning from bed is great.
076115728X|5.0|Love that it's so creative...seems like she could see something new each time we read it.  It's a small book, but we love it!
B004JRVQX0|5.0|Does what old one does... Same thing.. just making us spend more money... lol.. darn you avid!!! But it looks fancier it that helps.. price is O K for what it does.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I have to admit my hearing was bad and my wife got this for me. It worked fine and I used it. But being a video photographer as a hobby I discovered I could also plug it into my camera as a microphone. I now have one for each of my video cameras by simply adding a male to male sound cable with one end in the Super ear and the other in the camera.<br />I now carry one with me at all times. It works great and for me has more than one use. I can also split the cable and be listing to what the camera is picking up through the mike.<br />Super Ear Personal Sound Amplifier Listening Device
B005K0HDGE|4.0|In some scenes too many names were introduced too quickly losing the flo of the characters. I was hard to put down. I loved the sudden actions to protect the past.
B008EL25LE|5.0|This game is simply amazing!  The graphics are wonderful and the premise is unique.  Before each level, you must find certain parts of a scene before the time runs out.  When the actual puzzle begins, you must match up three or more of the same shapes in a row.  At each level, a new aspect to the puzzle is introduced - special pieces, different challenges, or different times.  It is clever, fast paced and really engaging. This app is wonderful and well worth the price.  This is so much fun and kept me engaged the whole time (warning, though, it is pretty addictive).
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun and easy to learn. Is a little addictive once you start playing you do not want to stop ever. I have only reached level thirty and I enjoy the challenges I have reached already.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I chose this rating because I am impressed with the programming for the game, and enjoy playing it. However, some of the levels are very frustrating, and also very violent.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I updated the game and lost all my data I had a lot of dragons and many gemstone dragons as well as four Sun dragons and I had just got the lunar eclipse dragon. If they could get my data back I would give it five stars but it's one star for now
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I chose this game because I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but playing it is a bit violent for me, to be honest. I pity the poor pigs!
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|Works really well. A perfect macro option for those who cant afford expensive macro lens. Love it and would recommend to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun and I am addicted thanks for making it people. this game is just like temple run but way better. once again thanks for this AWSOME game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad you finally have it for the kindle fire. I love this game but it is very addicting. So wish it gave us unlimited lives.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the fact that each book in this series is different except for Reacher. Always confident, always dependable and definitely talented. Could we send him after Congress?  I think he could straighten them out.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have slept with a fan on for the last couple of decades as a sound buffer. This is definitely an improvement on that! All the options for sound mixing and volume are amazing, but I just use the &#34;Fan&#34;. :) Also, I am sure this uses a lot less electricity than running a fan every night! I have it on my Kindle and plug in external speakers so I can get the volume just right. Another bonus--this is much easier to pack for travel than a fan! I used to lay awake at night in hotel rooms because the sounds would keep me awake. No more! Just punch into this app and all is as it should be!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|We watched the whole series in one day, could not get enough. It took us to a place we wanted to be.
B000BI0WOA|4.0|This really is the best of Dire Straits in a 2 volume set.  I really like the group and this completes the collection that I was looking for.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great program with good plotting and characters, excellent writing and perfect actors. It is so good that it could be on HBO
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not a lot of apps supported, yet. It was a bit tricky setting up to my router, I did a reset of my router and it was not difficult after that. Note, I have not had problems hooking up anything else in the past, i.e.: roku, wii, tablets, e t c. It is a little buggy,  have had to switch my wireless router off and back on a few times. I primarily use it for YouTube. It is fairly clear and worth every bit of $35.  Hopefully Google will run with it and make it able to cast/mirror your phone/tablet/laptop.
1451624468|3.0|As the title suggests, Krauss wrote this book to answer the age-old question of why there is something rather than nothing. The book was heralded by many atheists as the definitive answer to theists who claim God is necessary to explain the existence of physical reality. Indeed, in the afterward Richard Dawkins claimed that Krauss' book devastates theistic arguments based on cosmology just as Darwin's On the Origin of Species devastated theistic arguments based on design in biology. Other reviewers, however - including scientists, philosophers, and theologians - beg to differ. Having read the book myself (not just once, but two times now), I can see why they were less than impressed with Krauss' argument.<br /><br />While my overall assessment of Krauss' argument is not positive, truth be told, most of the book was quite enjoyable and informative.  That's because the first 2/3 of the book is a lesson on the historical development of modern cosmology.  Krauss doesn't make his case for why there is something rather than nothing until the last four chapters.  Unfortunately, that's where the book falls apart.<br /><br />Changing the question<br /><br />The most significant problem with Krauss' handling of the issue is the fact that he redefines the question in two significant ways.  First, he changes why to how.  Krauss says \\"why\\" questions are meaningless from a scientific perspective.  Science speaks to the \\"how\\" questions.  So to \\"scientize\\" the question of why there is something rather than nothing, Krauss changes the question to how there is something rather than nothing.  While this may be necessary to scientize the question, it is not necessary to make it meaningful.  Indeed, it actually changes the question.  Perhaps a scientific approach to the question that focuses on the how may give us great insight into origins, but answering the how question does not make the why question meaningless, or answer the why question.  At best, it would simply show that there are two sides to the question, and while science can answer one aspect of the question, it is incapable of answering the other.  It would not follow that the why question can be eliminated, or simply reduced to the how question.<br /><br />\\"Somethifying\\" nothing<br /><br />Secondly, and more importantly, Krauss changes the definition of \\"nothing.\\"  For Krauss, nothing is really something, namely the quantum vacuum. He attempts to show that natural processes are capable of transforming the quantum vacuum into all of the stuff we see today.  If true, it is very interesting, but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the question being asked.  The question posed is not how something became something else, but why there is something rather than nothing at all. And by \\"nothing,\\" we mean the absence of being, not a \\"thin\\" kind of something. The quantum vacuum is clearly something, not nothing, despite Krauss' claims to the contrary. Indeed, at times Krauss admits as much by saying things like \\"one should be tempted to consider [the quantum vacuum] as nothing,\\"[1] and repeatedly describes the quantum vacuum as \\"almost nothing.\\" If the quantum vacuum is almost nothing, then it is not truly nothing. Nothing is even less than the quantum vacuum. Nothing is the absence of all being itself: no quantum vacuum, no physical laws, not anything!  It's disingenuous, then, for Krauss to claim that science can explain how something came from nothing.  Science can do nothing of the sort.  As William Lane Craig has quipped, there are no physics of non-being!  Science can explain how things work, and even tell us their natural history, but in all cases they are explaining how something came from something, not how something came from nothing.<br /><br />Krauss can't plead ignorance regarding the intended meaning of \\"nothing\\" either. He acknowledges that the age-old philosophical question understands \\"nothing\\" as non-being (although elsewhere in the book he chides philosophers and theologians for always changing the definition so that science can never answer it), but says he takes a \\"flippant attitude toward this concern\\"[2] because it doesn't add to the conversation...because it can't be answered by science.  In other words, he doesn't like the actual question because his favored discipline (science) and favored epistemology (empiricism) cannot answer it (though he tries, as I'll discuss in a bit).  That is an interesting piece of biographical information, but it doesn't make the actual question one bit less meaningful.<br /><br />On second thought, science can answer that too!<br /><br />While Krauss' preferred approach to answering the question of why there is something rather than nothing is to change the definition of nothing so that it becomes another something, later in the book (page 146) Krauss claims that science can even explain how something can come from true nothingness.  How so?  Virtual particles.  Krauss writes:<br /><br />[M]erely defining \\"nothingness\\" as \\"nonbeing\\" is not sufficient to suggest that physics, and more generally science, is not adequate to address the question.  Let me give an additional, more specific argument here. Consider an electron-positron pair that spontaneously pops out of empty space near the nucleus of an atom and affects the property of that atom for the short time the pair exists. In what sense did the electron or positron exist before?  Surely by any sensible definition they didn't. There was potential for their existence, certainly, but that doesn't define being any more than a potential human being exists because I carry sperm in my testicles near a woman who is ovulating, and she and I might mate.<br /><br />And your argument is...?  What follows from this is...what precisely?\\"  His argument appears to be that since virtual particles come into being from non-being all the time, and this is a natural phenomenon that scientists \\"observe,\\" therefore science can provide a naturalistic explanation for howsomething can come from truly nothing.  If you're not scratching your head yet, let me help create the itch.  Krauss' \\"argument\\" is misguided on several counts.<br /><br />First, even if virtual particles are truly coming into being from non-being, observing this and explaining this are entirely different matters.  The only thing scientists know is that it happens.  They have no idea how or why it happens (which is why some have even resorted to the absurd conclusion that these are uncaused events).  Virtual particles coming into being from utter nothingness would simply presents scientists with an innumerable number of additional examples of the problem needing to be answered.  Rather than trying to explain a single event in which something comes into being from non-being (the coming into being of physical reality), they have to explain the occurrence of countless events in which something comes into being from non-being.  Thinking you have solved one problem by pointing to the existence of innumerable instances of the same inexplicable problem does not get you one step closer to actually solving the problem![3]  It would only prove that the problem is worse than originally conceived.  Pointing to virtual particles does nothing to explain how something can come from nothing.  At best, it just demonstrates how ubiquitous and intractable the problem of creation ex nihilo is for science to explain.<br /><br />Second, it cannot be the case that virtual particles are coming into being from true nothingness.  For some X to come into being, it must have a source that contains within it the potential for X.  For example, cars can come into being because the steel they are created from has the potential to become a car if acted upon in a certain fashion.  If there is no source material, however, then there is no potential for a car.  Nothingness has no properties, and thus has no potential for anything.  If you start with nothing, you will always and only end up with nothing.  Something can only come from something else.  Krauss' own analogy reveals this same point.  There is potential for a human being to come into existence only because a source exists with properties sufficient to produce a human being under the right circumstances. But if there was no man carrying sperm in his testicles, and there was no woman ovulating, would it make any sense to speak of the potential for a human being?  No.  The potential for X requires a source of X, and yet Krauss denies the existence of any source for virtual particles, and the universe itself.  While Krauss is right to distinguish between the potential for existence and actual existence, that distinction is only relevant when we are talking about something coming from something.  When we are talking about something coming from nothing, however, we are talking about actual existence arising without a source that contains the potential for it to exist.  How one can get an actual something without even a potential something is beyond me.<br /><br />Thirdly, virtual particles are not coming from non-being, but arise from within the quantum vacuum itself.  Krauss admits as much.  While we may not understand what causes this phenomenon, this is not an example of something coming from nothing, but of something coming from something else.<br /><br />Stop...in the name of natural law<br /><br />Every causal explanation must come to a terminus at some point. For theists, the causal terminus is God - a necessary being who is the source and cause of everything other than Himself.  For many atheists, the causal terminus is natural laws.  Natural laws are eternal, and the source of all physical reality (this represents a gross misunderstanding of the ontology of natural law), and a brute fact of reality (they are the necessary beings, not God).  Krauss so desires to answer the problem of how something can come from nothing that he even attempts to explain the origin of physical laws...or so he says.  Inreality, he punts on the issue by appealing to a multiverse that causes physical laws, without explaining the origin of the multiverse.  In the end, the fundamental physical reality is neither named nor explained.<br /><br />Krauss acknowledges two possible explanations for the origin of natural laws: God or something non-supernatural.  It should come as no surprise that he rejects the God explanation.  What is surprising is how poor his reasons are for rejecting it.  Then again, given his general disdain for and lack of familiarity with philosophy, his inability to critically evaluate the hypothesis is not at all surprising.  First, he trots out the `if God created the natural laws, then who created God' line.  I never cease to be amazed at how many times Christians have answered this point, and how many times atheists don't pay attention.  On theism, God is a necessary and hence uncreated being.  To ask, Who caused God?, then, is to ask, Who caused the Uncreated Being to exist?, which is meaningless.  It makes no more sense to ask who created God then to ask what sound silence makes.<br /><br />Next, he posits that if we invoke God to explain what determines \\"the rules,\\" then who determines God's rules for Him?  Really?  On theism, God is the metaphysical ultimate and first cause.  There can be nothing that determines \\"the rules\\" for God?  Krauss' question makes as much sense as asking what mathematical equation determines mathematical truths.  It's actually worse than that since \\"the rules\\" Krauss has in mind, natural law, could not possibly apply to God since God is not a physical being.  I don't know what other rules Krauss could possibly have in mind, but whatever they may be, it doesn't make any sense to speak of rules that govern a free-will agent.<br /><br />Then, Krauss argues that a First Cause of the universe would only argue for deism, not theism.  Ok?  No theist would dispute that?  Other arguments are necessary as part of a cumulative case to get tothe God of the Bible, but that does nothing to detract from the fact that a divine being would still be the cause of the universe, and deism is miles away from the atheism espoused by Krauss!  Deism may not get you to Christianity, but it would definitely invalidate atheism.<br /><br />Next, Krauss argues that God cannot be a first cause because every effect must have a prior cause, ad infinitum (strange, given his admission that the best evidence available to us today supports an absolute beginning to the universe).  Once again, Krauss would benefit from the help of philosophy, which demonstrates the absurdity of an actual infinite.<br /><br />Finally, he argues that if something can only come from something, then even God cannot create natural laws from nothing.  Apparently it hasn't dawned on him that God is not nothing.  God's creation of physical laws would be an example of something coming from something, not something from nothing.<br /><br />After dismissing the God hypothesis, Krauss turns to a non-supernatural hypothesis: the multiverse.  Krauss knows the precise values of the physical constants are fine-tuned for the existence of intelligent life, and proposes that the multiverse could explain the value of the physical constants since, in a multiverse, each universe could have a different set of values for the physical constants.  We just happen to live in a universe in which the random distribution of those values is life-permitting.  But once again, Krauss has moved the goal post.  When it comes to questions of origins, what Krauss needs to explain is why there are physical laws in the first place, not why the physical laws in our universe have assumed the values they do.  If the multiverse both creates and determines the value of the physical laws in each universe, then the multiverse, not physical laws, is a more basic feature of physical reality.  What, then, explains the multiverse?  What explains the mechanism that produces multiple universes withmultiple values for the physical constants?  In the end, Krauss admits he can't answer the question. He writes, \\"Where did they [physical laws] come from? That is a good question, and one of the more modern answers is that even the laws themselves may be random, coming into existence along with universes that may arise. This may still beg the question of what allows any of this to be possible, but at some level it is... `turtles all the way down'.\\"[4]  In other words, he doesn't have a clue.  So much for explaining the origin of all physical reality from nothing!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />At the end of the day, Krauss' book answers a question that no one was asking.  He has explained how something could become something else, but not how something could come from nothing.  In that respect, his book is an abject failure.  And yet, it remains a monument to materialist thinking, and demonstrates the bankruptcy of scientism and empiricism to answer the most fundamental questions humans can ask.  Science is a marvelous discipline, and can tell us much about the physical world.  What it cannot do is tell us why or how something could come from absolutely nothing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|All I can say is AMAZING! Did not want to put this fantastic book down. A definite read for anyone!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show. Smart and witty but to much use of GD. Why does Hollywood think that everyone takes God's name in vain. It is ridiculous.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved the story lines and how they eventually all come together... a very clever turn of events.  I like when a book surprises me!  But the story is sad and tragic and will pull at your heart strings.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Expertly written and profoundly moving, this story feels real in it's details and poetic in it's delivery. It asks larger questions about family and trust, about resilience and remorse, and boils it down again and again to guilty or innocent. Even with the predictable lilt of a trial, I found myself continually surprised, till the last chapter, the last sentence, the last word.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|The title of this album is perfect because she feels like home singing country.  She has a voice that literally puts me in a upbeat and happy mood.  This is one of my favorites and will get played repeatedly in my car.  No matter what Sheryl does...she is herself.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It is amazing what Marcus endured and survived! Especially that damn pepsi bottle!<br /><br />What do you mean longer review required! That is some BS!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|If you a true metal fan, and love that old sound of trash, then pick this album up the riffing is amazing and the face melting solos are all there. This is a great buy.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|The jigsaw ones are the best.  It's a change from the routine 9 squares.  The others are good, too.  I would love to be able to get the ones Conceptis Logic puzzles have on the internet, but these are good.
B001BANK32|5.0|Great read. I loved the movie version . But I'm glad I finally got around to reading the book. I thought the book was great and surprising all around . Thanks Stephen King!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I consult TripAdvisor when ever I'm traveling and looking for a &#34;out of the way&#34; restaurant.  By that I mean that I want to avoid the usual chain restaurants and eat at a truly local place.  I also review hotels listed on the site to see if it's a place that I would want to stay at.  I have been very pleased with the opinions that I have read on TripAdvisor that my fellow travelers listed.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|Gilbert is always writing a book for the stage of my life that I am experiencing. I read Eat, Pray, Love when I was on the verge of divorce. I am now reading this book as a divorced woman contemplating living with someone and wrestling with the decision that I previously botched.  Love her writing, her intellect, sense of adventure and helping me think through these tough decisions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About friggin time this app became available on kindle! I've been checking for it regularly for months! Now waiting for the other saga games :-)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|who's going to want to see the movies now that everyone knows/will know what happens at the end?  I know I'm not interested.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The overall quality of this show is excellent. Great writing, great cast.. cannot wait to watch the rest of the seasons!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the 1st two books and I will say that I liked the two perspectives being written. Downhill from here folks. Even though Tris was getting annoying you had hope since it was a trilogy. You invest in this  type of book for a little something different with your romantic story. You see her grow and struggle and in the end you expect her to triumph. Readers beware - there is no triumph - there is practically no point in reading this series. As I kept watching the percentage get higher and higher on the book, I knew something was wrong. If Tobias is any better from knowing Tris you can not tell. Nothing is really that different - so what was the goal of this story? Sure people are living a little differently but did I really care about that piece of the story. Not really. The secondary story ended up being the main point. Ridiculous. Did someone actually read this with the author and say - yes this is great? Surely she knew people would not like this book.  I actually invested in the relationship of two main characters and frankly I feel jipped. The only thing I can do now is hope that they change the movie to make sense. Will not recommend the series now.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Finally thrilled to see this last part of the series. Am so happy I have the whole series. Thank you for selling it to me. Was sad at the ending, but I guess it had to end that way. Am very happy with my purchase.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Not sure yet, moves very quickly and I don't seem to be getting much &#34;friends&#34; posts, more advertising. Will reevaluate.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I just finished this book so I may have to come back and amend this review later, but I feel robbed and horrible enough to share it with others who are still reading this book for the first time. I heard that this ending was going to be \\"shocking\\" and so have been avoiding GoodReads, Pinterest, and my other reader Facebook friends all week so nothing would be ruined for me and it wasn't. Maybe expecting \\"shocking\\" enough was enough to ruin things for me though, because I did predict what would happen, I just really hoped I would be wrong.<br /><br />I feel robbed. This book was not anything what I had been expecting and anticipating. Compared to the exhilaration of just sitting reading Divergent and Insurgent, this book was boring. Tris and Four find themselves out of one rebellion and into another. There is a lot of explanation for all the plot holes in the first two books, so many that parts of the book begin to feel like a lecture. It's not until the last segment of the book that the pacing picks up and begins to even approach the intensity levels of the previous books. Not only was the book boring, but I felt like all of the things I liked about the first two books were taken away from me. Understanding that the books were originally designed to be written from Tobias's point of view makes it a little easier to understand why they ended the way they did but I still don't get it. I don't get why the shock effect was more important than the messages that were so strongly promoted in Insurgent.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still love the series and can't wait to re-read them. I love Tris, Four, Uriah, Christina, and all of the characters and the complexity of their relationships. I love the grittiness and dark-side of the story. None of the characters in this series have it easy. They survive and then they deal with things- there's no glossing over the violence or pain just because it's a popular young adult book. Most of all, I love how these books investigatethe flaws in our own society and leave readers mind's reeling. I'll probably be sitting here for the next few weeks trying to figure out the ending.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved it, will be this years Christmas stocking stuffer to many friends and relatives. Such a neat perspective of a dog's eye view of his surroundings and family.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|I always wanted to see the original movie after seeing the tv show. I was curious to see what happened to Nev. It turned out a little different than I thought. I'm glad I got to see where it all began.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|NEVER have i been more frightened during a film.  From the first 5 minutes, until the very end, I could barely take it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that Candy Crush is finally available here. It is an addictive game that can give hours of fun. Everyone will enjoy this game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the hidden objects and they give you proper clues, fascinating game<br />. I am in bed, then I allowed myself to play a bit<br /><br /> :)
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|incredibly talented brazilian singer...  great group of musicians...... and a wonderful tribute to one of the greatest jazz player and singer............
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad I can finally play Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle.  It was hard to play on the iPhone screen.  I can take my Kindle Fire anywhere,
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The 4th book was harder to follow than the previous 3 but the 5th is hard to put down. Can't wait for the next one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that this is finally available for Kindle Fire!  I've been waiting for this for quite some time.  Definitely worth downloading.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I am 100% addicted to candy crush I play it on facebook all the time, so I was super excited it was available for my kindle fire. However, I do not like that you can only go to a certain level until you have use real money to move on! I understand this was a free app, but I don't think it is right! So aside from that I love this game
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I don't mind this item because it let's me not have to carry around and HDMI cable anymore.  First, I was hoping to be able to cast anything on my computer though so that is a drawback.  I wanted to be able to use it to project MS Office to do presentations but that is not possible.  It would have been cool to have a presentation for work on my phone and then project it on a large screen.<br /><br />Second, it has to go through WiFi, so that is the second draw back. I thought it would just cast directly from the computer to the TV like AppleTV. Like I said I don't have to carry around an HDMI but that is only to view a browser or Netflix.<br /><br />Finally, I don't like that it won't let you stream any \\"side loaded\\" music as it terms it. I have downloaded many of my old CDs onto my computer and then transferred to my phone but the device won't let me stream any of it.<br /><br />So for the $35 price you get a more convienient way to view what is on your computer on the big screen instead of being restricted with a HDMI cable.
B000065V3H|5.0|This little gem of a movie tells a timeless story of a guy on the fringe who wants his day in the sun. Through a clever plot contrivance, he gets his wish and learns about life and love. It's a feel good movie with great morals and no sex! You can watch this movie with any age folks. It's a classic.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|I just happened to read these books in reverse.  Even though I knew which way the story would go, it didn't stop me from wanting to read how it transpired.  I haven't read many books about Native American fantasy and I really enjoyed these two.  Oria went through a great change from being a normal teen to a very important person.  It amazed me how they went from modern living to tribal living without much of a hassle.  Sometimes I wish it were that easily done this day and time.  Grey Wolf is my favorite character in the book.  I guess because I'm a hopeless romantic and I believe in soul mates.  I enjoyed his slight cockiness.  The book was an easy read that had me sitting at the edge of my seat wondering what was gong to happen next!  This book had romance, fantasy, paranormal activities, drama...just a lot of things going on so that the read is never bored.  I would love to see it on television as it played out in my head.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you love the Eagles, you will love this video.  I wish all of my fave bands had documentaries like this on them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so much fun, but very additive so set a timer if you have other things to do.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Wow, eye opening to say the least! I first have to say that Seaworld must have ties to the CIA for them to be able to sweep some of these shocking facts under the rug for so long. Secondly, I have to say shame on all of the people who know about the social behaviors of killer whales but choose to ignore these truths in order to make money. ie. how can anyone with a conscience decide to separate these whales from their pods knowing that in the wild they stay in those pods their entire life? I was angered and heartbroken to learn about some of the atrocities that have occurred to these animals in captivity. I'm afraid I will no longer be able to visit any marine animal park that keeps killer whales in captivity. I understand that there was a time and place for it, to want to learn about these creatures, and captivity was a way to learn about them. However, now that we know the things we know about their social and emotional nature, there is no justification for continuing to keep and breed them in captivity.  If you don't think you agree with me, you need to see this documentary. Thank goodness that OSHA has had the good sense to put a stop to trainers interacting with these animals in the water, although I have to say that I can't fault the whales for their aggressive behavior in captivity. If I had been taken away from my family at two years of age and placed in a jail cell with angry females who like to beat me up and caretakers who deprive me of food when I don't do exactly what they want, who knows what I would resort to. Again, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, you need to see the documentary because that is exactly what they did to Tilkium, the whale who has killed 3 people while in captivity.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|THIS GAME IS PURELY $H IT TY AND DONT BUY IT!!! WOW, SUCH A BAD GAME! SUCKS! WONT EVEN DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE!!!!!

B009NH9IMM|5.0|AWESOME
B008220BLG|5.0|came right on time and was fine. no problems with the cd or case. i love watching this movie. maybe i watch it too much but its really a good love/zombie movie and its funny too.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|The music of this song enters you so easily that you your body starts to move to the song.  Then the lyrics start and it takes you to the places she sings about.  Her voice is so sweet and child like that it appeals to all who listen to it.  makes you trust her words and know that her song is possible to bring love to the word.<br />a song well worth the money
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Kids will totally enjoy the characters especially collecting them..Fun. Fun.  Fun. IGreat game for children to learn space management and value of earned items.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a very nice because there is lists of action pack speed performance in your head itself make you love candy this will go far and fast
B0062YADWI|5.0|exactly what I needed to open my cold corona beers Carabiner never leaves my belt loop.I  don't know what else to say but good stuff
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a great story Kline weaves. I learned a lot. The characters are well developed and the story mesmerizing. Another part of our history that is overlooked.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|The Invicta Men's 1514 &#34;Force Collection&#34; watch is rather thick and does not look quite as impressive in &#34;person&#34; as in its photographic depictions.  I thought I would be getting a watch worth several times its modest price.  I should know better.  The hands are painted white for the first 2/3 or so of their length from the center, making the watch very difficult to read.<br /><br />Still, it is a nice looking watch, priced well, seems to work well, and as a southpaw, I enjoy having the buttons on the left for the first time in my life, which eliminates my having to remove the watch entirely to change the settings.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I downloaded a sample into my Kindle...<br />It hooked me. Had to purchase it to keep reading. Very glad I did. Loved it.
B00DCZ34CG|5.0|A very unusual type of movie, interesting storyline bordering on science fiction but still believable. Great CGI  tiger, considering the Pi actor never confronted the live animal.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is an addictive game because some levels are extremely challenging. Especially, when you need to remove the chocolate squares in the corners on level 275.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|The title says it all, if you like Horatio Hornblower style political intrigue/French Revolution/sailing ship stories, books with a strong intelligent female lead, and space adventure, then you might like this book.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|The material is serious and timely, but the chapters alternate between an account of a 1982 Titan missile silo blowing up in Arkansas and historical items dating from 1945 to the present. This was distracting and confusing. I would have given the book five stars if the 1982 Titan silo incident had been put together into one chapter in its proper chronological sequence.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Hmmmm....where to start.  I LOVED the first and second books.  I think the biggest reason I loved them was because of how strong and tough the characters of Tris and Four were.  SPOILER ALERT so don't read the rest if you haven't read the book.  I was devastated that the author killed off Tris.  I get that she was trying to turn her into a hero but she already was a hero.  It's really devastating to be so vested in the characters and storyline for so long and then have it just end that way.  I did think it was bittersweet with her ashes and how Tobias spread them but just way too depressing.  I thought Four/Tobias' character was weak in this book compared to the first two books.  Just my opinion but I'm disappointed in the final book.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|It definitely has it's good and bad parts but I would say this is the worst of the first 3 books.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|This app is very uplifting. It's a super simple, fuss-free, one or three card deal. A card of the day or three cards for the past, present, and future. They've been pretty applicable to my life situations thus far. Even if you don't really believe in this sort of thing, it makes you stop and reflect on your life and yourself. If you're looking for a more sophisticated, in-depth tarot app, then this probably won't be your cup of tea. I use this along with another tarot app. Recommend.
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter LOVES this game!  It keeps her interested and she loves the action. She has tried other similar games, but goes back to this one very time.
B001C08RHA|4.0|The first iron man was the best one - everything else seems stale. Of course, I liked Robert Downey in this, but the other characters were good
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Very techno-savy, maybe a little too much for my taste, but yet that is the story!  Love the character's and was sorry for the book to end. Look forward to reading the pre-quel next! Try this and if you have every used a computer I promise you will enjoy it!
B00009TB5G|4.0|What an effort to make the trilogy! True to book, but sometimes all the war scenes become exhausting. Worth it, though
B002PZC8BM|3.0|Fun, but a bit repetitive at times. The only thing that ties the episodes is Red John, but it's only dealt with in two or three episodes
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Cannot stop playing this game!  So fun!  I had not played it on facebook so I did not understand the fuss.  I do now!  Great little app that I highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I thought that it was really great, and I was so excited that I read right through it. I waited for a year for it to come out, and was counting down the days. I loved the entire beginning, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I couldn't list all the good pats, but I can list the bad.<br />Let's put it this way; If you didn't like what happened to Prim in the Hunger Games, you don't want to read this.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I couldn't put it down, but around 90% I was ready to throw it across the room. When Tris enhaled the death serum, I was really hoping she wouldn't die. I was SO relieved that she resisted it. When she was shot, my heart was racing. I was really mad when her mom showed up, because I knew she was dying. After at chapter ended I still had some sliver of hope she lived, but I gave up hope after Tobias saw the body. I was really just reading to get through it after that. I guess the zip-lining part was okay, but really? I think what happened to her ruined the whole thing. It's not like they can just pretend she was in a coma and wake her up because she turned into ashes. I want to cry just because I thought it would end better.
B005LJETYI|5.0|Great story. Heard about the book because Tom Cruise is going to star in the movie adaptation, titled \\"Edge of Tomorrow\\". I am a fan of Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise sci-fi, and sci-fi in general. I read this book in less than 24 hours. It was fast paced and didn't let up for a second. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a thrilling read. Nice plot twist as well.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|We got this movie for my nieces. They loved it. It wasn't bad watching for the adults, either. We liked it.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Amazing! I love this movie. I like to get the blu ray and DVD and digital copy. It is one of the best deals there is.
0307346617|3.0|I realize people love this book. I enjoyed the movie, but because we like to read our scary books aloud, fireside, while we're camping, the interview format of this book doesn't read aloud well. So, it didn't work well for us during our camping season, but again…we liked the movie. I think if I had purchased the book for the purpose of reading it to myself, it'd have worked much better.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love the clear design of this case to show off my iPhone and for the price this case really can't be beat. It has held up wonderfully! I will definitely be purchasing more of these cases! The screen protector went on easily and is comparable to the much more expensive one that i purchased from my cell phone carrier.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Oh, he's so cute, and he sings and sways his head back and forth. He's adorable. People like to listen to him sing.
006202406X|2.0|I'm disappointed in Allegiant. I truly enjoyed the first two books in the series and was eagerly awaiting the finale of the trilogy. Meh. It was disjointed, repetitive and honestly...boring. The ending seemed to be simply for shock value - there was no purpose and I finished the book feeling like I'd just wasted my time. I'm so disappointed in this book. I feel the way I did after the second Sex and the City movie. I wish I'd never read it. You probably will read it to finish the series, but be prepared for a letdown.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book has been getting an awful lot of negative reviews. I will admit, for me it was not as great as Divergent or Insurgent, but I still really liked it.<br /><br />I thought it lacked the same on the edge of your seat action and suspense of the previous two books. Also, the romance between Tobias and Tris was frustrating and heart breaking, they just did not connect in the same way, there was something missing, but at the same time, that is the ebb and flow of relationship.<br /><br />I would have loved a happy ending, I am a sap for happy endings and really don't like to read a book that doesn't have that ending where you smile and sigh and feel like it is all wrapped up with a nice little bow on top. If you are hard core in this belief, unwavering in your need for the nice ending, please do not read this book.<br /><br />I never dreamed the series would finish in this way, it literally left me sobbing into my pillow, with a feeling of emptiness and resignation. It almost seemed like the fighting and the sacrifices, the loss and the pain were for naught. However, that is not the case. There is a new start. Pieces are picked up, life goes on. There is no such thing as a utopian society. No such thing as perfection. The fight was fought and a victory won, even with great sacrifice.<br /><br />So Veronica Roth, good job. Good job with a realistic ending, one that teaches that there is life after heartache, through heartache. That we must go on and make the best of any situation. While I may be heartbroken over this ending, I think it was definitely worth the journey, and such good lessons, real life lessons, can be taught if eyes and minds are open to the truths found in this fiction.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|First Harry Potter movie and the whole family enjoyed it.  We haven't seen other ones yet so cannot really compare.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Great product and as described it was in mint condition. Would recommend to anyone who likes scary movies and dinosaurs!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can&acute;t stop playing this game!!!!! Not enough time in a day to play. They should be ashamed for making such an addictive game!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I loved this show, Benedict Cumberbatch makes a really good modern Holmes.  I should have this expected since its a British show, but the episodes are very long.
0385484518|5.0|If you want a simple, satisfying, heart-expanding read, this is it. Of course, millions agree with me. Also a great manual for how to grow old with grace and love. One of those books that leaves you changed for life---for the better.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|i have been into fitness and lifting for a few years now, and i still learned a lot about nutrition and the science behind weight training. i have changed most aspects of what i do on a daily basis from this book, and i find myself learning more every time i read it. a must have for any fitness nut!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I gave the book a 5 star rating since I had a hard time putting it down.  The action is fast paced and well written.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the authors had included more about the lives of the main characters after the Final Battle was over.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|One of my BEST favorite; Just Simply Amazing entertaining movie.  I have watched it over and over and over, many times already.  Still love watching it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I am enjoying the game,just wish my energy wouldn't keep running out.<br />But all and all it is an enjoyable game.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|In some ways I like this more than Angry Birds. Rather than just the physics of how to aim to knock down piggy forts, you actually get to move around the most adorable medieval setting: castles, dungeons, taverns, ships. Your little thief is a monk, a sort of Robin Hood. Corrupt sheriff's, greedy pirates, smarmy tax collectors, they're all here stealing from good people. So you get to help these folks out.<br />  You have to use items in the environment in unexpected and surprising ways. Each item usually solves only a tiny part. And it's not just figuring out which item, but how and when to use it. There are truly comical nits, as to be expected from Rovio. The graphics are cute and crisp. My son adores this game. In 3rd grade, I'd say it's just right for him. Any younger might be too hard, though there are hints. My son looks so forward to this game each day, that it's a great motivator for him to get his homework done :-)
0887081770|4.0|Should have read the fine print, the book is about 4 inches high. Nice story just had to read to my granddaughter with the book being sooooo small.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My toddler and I love this app but there is always an advertising with every task you complete. Totally annoying!! If there weren't so many, I would have given a better rating. Have fun playing.
1400032717|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the story from the perspective of an autistic teen. It not only is a credible moving story but is so entertaining. I would recommend.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I've always loved this movie, and I was delaying purchasing a new version of the movie until one of the two remaining vhs tapes broke, but those old tapes just won't budge. So when they started to get fuzzy and got that little line through the middle of the screen, I bought a new one here.<br /><br />I fell in love with it all over again. This movie was the reason I pursued a Biology career, and while I might not have the privilege of cloning dinosaurs, this is an exceptionally enjoyable film.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|First off, I have listened to music, all sorts since the mid sixties.  I live everything.... But I have an affinity for the Dead. I saw many shows up until 1993 when it stopped being fun due to various things both in the Band, and the people in the lot,band venue.  I believe I have around 1000 plus hours on tape. Most first generation. And quite a few board tapes. Lots of jerry solo shows etc.<br />this is for my the holy grail,  I have a friend who had vault access this show was my favorite. The only one close is the allman/ fleetwood mac jam. Hopefully, that will come out. Now onto this discussion<br />This show was and us special in soooooo many ways. They are on fire. The vibe is good. The crowd is all cool. Probably flying air Owsley .  Pranksters just roaring. And through it all the music. Damn. What a treat. Only tines I ever wish I was a few years older. Is when confronted with this level of weirdness. Get it. Turn up the stereo. And wish you were there. Oh yeah. Actually you are. Cool
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is addicting and fun to play.  plus it syncs with your facebook so you can get help from your friends.
1481130331|5.0|Christoph Fischer makes his mark with &#34;The Luck Of The Weissensteiners&#34;, an intensely woven family drama driven by the twin tides of history and politics.  His story revolves around the Weissensteiners, a non-religious Jewish family leading their lives in Bratislava, Slovakia, before and throughout WWII.  Fischer demonstrates a masterly grip on history, politics, and the constant ebb and flow of human relationships.  Multiple intertwined dramas unfold in the story as Europe marches toward war, Hitler annexes Czechoslovakia, allows the establishment of a free Slovak Republic, and the Nazi's Jewish policies are gradually imposed upon the new nation.  Throughout these events, the Weissensteiner family struggles to survive, and fate and luck leads them down a winding path of human drama.  Fischer's historical knowledge and keen insight into human conflict make for a dramatic and intense read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's my addiction as well as my secret weapon against boredom.  I  do get frustrated because some of the levels take a month to get past.
B00ARVRD1Q|5.0|Enjoy this record and recommend it to people that enjoy Jazz Music and like listening to Vinyl records from the old days. This Record is excellent.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is certainly not how I thought the story of Tris, Tobias, Christina, Caleb and the gang would end, but I'm glad for it. This has been a thrilling series to become engrossed in these past few years.

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I purchased this game for 1.99 on my Kindle Fire months ago, everything was fine and it synced with FB then the game just disappeared. Now it's back and free but doesn't sync. What's the point???
B001NLL93W|4.0|Another decent read in this series. Not as frustrating as the last book. This one didn't have as many inconsistencies. Though I feel like the story is being strung out a bit much. Three more books? Seems like a bit over kill. Guess I just have to read the next.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Freaking awesome series! It was sad to see it come to an end. Spartacus, Crixus, and Ganicus will forever be remembered!
B007WPM7SO|3.0|I loved the film version, but after just having read the book, I was disappointed it didn't stay faithful to the book's ending. Although I expected a happier ending in the novel, I think it was more true to life than the film's skew.

B0092S4WLY|2.0|Not great - disjointed- not designed as well as can you escape and dooors. Would not recommend this to others
B00DJWV11I|3.0|Drew is a certified butthole! I mean wow! That guy was the definition of certifiable dueche baggery. He was a shallow, sex crazed butthole. I wanted to punch him the face during half the book. He had ZERO respect for women<br /><br />Now, I enjoyed how his and Kates relationship changed. That man needed to be brought down a few notches and I'm glad she was the one to do it.<br /><br />Even though Drew was a complete dbag, I love the fact that even though he changed his behavior towards women he still kept his personality.<br /><br />I'm giving this book a 3.5 because Drew ticked me off a lot. The way he used women was disgusting and his &#34;advice&#34; was a bit juvenile.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|The discs were in amazing condition and were awesome to watch! would absolutely recommend them to any one to buy!

006202406X|1.0|What annoyed me about Allegiant was not only the death but that it did not live up to the amazing standards of the first two novels, which have received little to no bad reviews. I felt like the story didn't really go anywhere, was under-developed, and just plain boring. There were points in the other two where everything was intense and action packed, and there was always such a lead up to climax moments. Allegiant, on the other hand, was monotone and boring. It doesn't spend any time getting you emotionally involved or building suspense. And the ending was extremely anti-climatic and only produced for shock value. I know some might argue that it depicts real life and eludes to Christ. However, fans expect a better ending than the main character dying! I expected so much more! The different POVs were extremely hard to distinguish between, and both of the characters sounded exactly the same. We are also reminded frequently throughout the book that Tris is extremely resistant to serums, but we never find out if there is a special reason! I have been looking forward to this book all year, and I was sadly disappointed!
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|I love their interpretation of old songs. I will consider buying other albums if they are this great. They sing wonderfully.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Dead people make great subjects for novelists and for lawyers. In fact an entire genre-mystery- is devoted to the newly departed. In my profession an entire speciality-probate-is similarly dependent on the newly dead.<br /><br />John Grisham is a lawyer and a mystery writer. Among my peers at the trial bar, one novel [[ASIN:0440245915 A Time to Kill]] has achieved iconic status. That is because Jake Brigance thinks and acts like a real trial lawyer and the pace of the buildup to the trial and the events in the courtroom are seen through eyes of those  who have chosen to live or to die in courtrooms.<br /><br />Jake is back and this time he has a will contest. Only three years have elapsed since the events in that classic tale, and Jake is restless, and scratching out a living on car wrecks and that most boring of tasks, writing wills.<br /><br />Then suddenly Jake has fortune drop upon him in the form of a holographic (written entirely in the hand of the decedent)  will penned by a strange but rich old man who cures his lung cancer at the end of a hangman's noose. The suicide seems apparent, but the will leaves 90% of a lot to a most unexpected beneficiary.<br /><br />This is the stuff of which lawsuits are made-money, green and humanity. Brigance has the case of a lifetime (or at least the coming year) and tempers are short. Lawyers will love this will contest and the rest of you will too. Don't miss it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Don't waste your money on this last book of what was an awesome series.  It was my most anticipated release and was very disappointed.  The content will not keep your attention, it is boring and feels like a hunger games wannabe.  The ending will leave your devastated and wanting to wish you never finished the series.  I will not be purchasing any other books from this author.
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|It's amazing how quickly you can tear down the lies we were led to believe would work to help get more done, achieve success, and \\"make it\\" in life. \\"The One Thing\\" does an excellent job of not only squashing the myths, but also building to a new truth about goals, purpose, priorities, and productivity. I wish this was available 30 years ago... but even still it is never too late to make a difference in every aspect of your life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad they finally put this game on the kindle fire! My kids and I always play it on Facebook and on my phone. It is nice to be able for us to play it on a bigger screen while on the go! It makes the time go faster and it is very challenging!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Sigh. I was trying to avoid writing a review. But what I think about this book appears not to have been written by anyone else up to this point, so here it is:<br /><br />First off, this gets two stars instead of one because I LOVED the development of Tris and Tobias's relationship.  I loved reading their date-like interactions and that they are actually talking through things and communicating with one another in this book. They learn the value of love and forgiveness and it's very satisfying to watch that develop after all the craziness from Insurgent. It's nice to see a healthy relationship portrayed in a YA novel. On that front, well done Ms. Roth.<br /><br />HOWEVER.....<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** - I don't plan on any blatant spoilers, but just in case... read at your own risk.<br /><br />Everyone is harping on the ending of this book.  Within hours of its release there were scads of reviews coming out that it was disappointing and depressing, and people are angry about it.  I finished the whole book in one day, on release day earlier this week, but waited till now to write this review so I could think it through.  But I'm still depressed. Not angry anymore.  Just depressed, and disappointed.<br /><br />My gut reaction to the ending was anger and sadness and disappointment that Ms. Roth would take this turn.  Then I read an interview with her the next day that said she always planned to end the story this way.  That knowledge, in and of itself, is why I give this book a low review. If she had that ending planned from the get go, then she didn't do a good job of taking her readers and beloved Tris and Tobias fans there (because let's face it, Divergent fans are Tris and Tobias fans, period.). The end came completely out of left field and was completely pointless.  It doesn't follow from the previous two books or especially from anything that takes place in this third book that SPOILER Tris would sacrifice herself in this way. Tobias was her family. She saysin this book that everything, their whole lives, are entwined as one.  They consummate this oneness. She says she already grieved the loss of Caleb at Erudite HQ. She says she can see a time on the horizon when she and Tobias can be together in calm times. Why oh WHY would an author write all of these hopeful sentiments in a book just to kill off her main character? Whom she apparently did not love as much as her fans did. If her plan was to write the books with this ending in mind, it was poorly done.  There is no redeeming value to Tris's death. It makes no sense and does not follow the track of the story. To me this says that Ms. Roth is an arrogant writer who was stuck on her ending regardless of where her characters took her.  Stories like this often take on a life of their own, and given the life this story had, not to mention her devoted fan base, she should have rethought the ending she planned years ago. Going through with it makes her look like an amateur and someone who was in it for the shock value.<br /><br />All this to say, this was just terribly depressing. The final chapters and the Epilogue were so very hard to read. I've loved reading and re-reading Divergent and Insurgent, but I can't even read the good parts of this book again because I know how it ends.  I've rewritten a half a dozen happy endings in my head--even wrote one out on paper!--but I still can't get the sad one out.  You let us down Ms. Roth.  You let us down.  And I doubt I'll be seeing the movie unless I hear the producers are doing all three and basically rewriting the final installment to be more worthwhile.  Even if it ends with a death, if that death is more justifiable than this I will hate it, but I will accept it.  Ms. Roth's ending I cannot even accept.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|Very disappointed, it does even fit the KIndleFire, it is about 1/4&#34; on top and bottom to  small! I will really think twice before offsetting anything like this again. I am very disappointed with order. And the cost of return would cost more as I would be charge twice for shipping.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I don't typically leave reviews, but with this watch, I felt like it would be an injustice not to.  I own SEVERAL watches..and I'd been eyeing this one for a while, but had never owned an automatic before.  This is the first...and hopefully the last automatic I purchase.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS WATCH.  Gorgeous time piece...exactly as described.  Note that several folks have mentioned that the watch is small...and that's very accurate.  Having read that is one of the reasons I considered this watch, because I have small wrists.  Watch is great looking..and is super comfortable.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a really great app, was worth getting. I use the app when there is the threat of a power outage so that I won't be late for work.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I don't think there is a  comedy sitcom like this ever and I'm going to order season two and so on can't get enough of this show ....while shipping was slow it was worth the wait although it was used it came in very good packaging and played well with no problems.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|if you have anything planned for the rest of the day. You may think, as I did, that there are 57 short chapters, so you will just start by reading one or two. then as you turn page after page you won't even notice chapter numbers, you will just know you must keep reading. I should have known better. I picked up \\"The Hypnotist's Love Story\\" by the same author yesterday, and couldn't stop reading till the book ended. I don't know why I thought this book would be different.  The author has a way with plot, character development and her use of language that just completely draw you in from the very first page. Earlier this year, I \\"discovered\\" Jojo Moyes, who quickly became my favorite new author. I have been lamenting the fact that many of her books (on Kindle) are  only available in the UK. Now having discovered Liane Moriarty helps to soften that blow. I am purchasing every thing else she has written. She has a unique way of exploring relationships, identity, coping skills and the unexpected ways in which we can respond to extraordinary circumstances.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book grabbed me from the beginning and didnt' let go. Love the style (he said, she said) and unlike some others, I loved the ending. This book is unpredictable, fast-paced, and clever as all get out. Good luck putting this down once you start.  I loved Dark Places and Sharp Objects by Flynn, as well, but this one is her piece de resistance. Love!
0385523394|5.0|I bought this after watching the show on Netflix, and it's much better and tells a much different story than the show has so far. It's filled with humor, thoughts on society, humanity and adversity in the face of terrible circumstances. Highly recommend it.
B000GCFY0I|2.0|I couldn't finish this. As a big fan of The Hunger Games and Insurgent (and dystopian novels in general), I really wanted to like this, but the writing style is just not very strong. It lost me in the middle and never grabbed me again. Disappointing.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|*Spoiler-free review*<br /><br />Horror films have recently been relying on jump-out scares or scenes of torture to convince the viewer that what's happening is frightening.  These tales force superficial fear on the viewer because the storytelling doesn't get the job done.  The biggest drawback to films such as these is that the eerie feeling doesn't linger.  Once you exit the theater, the movie falls off you, forgotten without trouble.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" resurrects the genre of ambient horror, though.  It trades in cheap thrills for something more substantive that sticks to you like cobwebs you can't shake off.  Vera Farmiga is - as always - captivating.  To be fair, the rest of the ensemble does remarkable work here.  Acting, dialogue, and story stop just short of flawless.  The \\"based on a true story\\" element isn't even needed to propel the eerie mood but certainly doesn't hurt either.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I love this movie! Without giving too much away, the story is great and the twists are awesome! Definitely worth it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is great!  The same as on Facebook.  I had to find out that it only worked with Wi Fi or I would have to start all over.  That was because I wasn't paying attention to what the screen was telling me to do.  I'm so glad Amazon decided to make it available for the Kindle Fire.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I read this book because it was suggested on a fitness site.  Excellent read. Hard to wait a week between chapters and practice the skills learned in each chapter but very informative and thought provoking.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a good read!  I think it was worth the price.  It's always neat to see what happens to the characters when a follow up book comes out.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Beautifully executed a cinematic masterpiece! especially exorcism scene in the basement is one of the most intense and scariest scenes of all times.

B00FAX6XQC|1.0|it wont install. And I was looking foward to playing it.<br />ugh it looked like a good game but oh well.
B000FBFM9S|5.0|It's funny. Some people I know didn't get the humor and took it all to seriously. It is supposed to be funny but what struck me most is how well it is written and how well the characters are developed. She's brilliant.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Being heartbroken about a book isn't a reason to criticize it. I have never cried so much over a book in my entire life. It absolutely ruined my evening and I feel empty like I've been throwing up for hours, but that book was beautifully written. It MEANT something. It wasn't just about giving the reader what he/she wanted, but about teaching a lesson. And that lesson was beautiful. Veronica Roth, I hate you right now because I literally ache inside, but well done.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I had a ton of old slides that I wanted to put on my computer. The slides often got jammed and wouldn't advance. It's hard to see the details of the pictures on the little screen so I couldn't really tell if the picture needed to be flipped horizontally until I looked at them on the computer.  (I have a few pictures with Happy Birthday spelled backwards on the cake. My photo program won't flip horizontally.) Every speck of dust on the film holder shows up and the holders scratch really easily. To do slides with only two photos (like at the end of a role) have to be cut and put in the single slide holder which is kind of a pain when you have a lot to do.  If you have a lot of slides I'd look at another device.

006202406X|4.0|I just finished Allegiant last night and I wanted to share some thoughts:<br /><br />One of the big hurdles that any series like this has to overcome is big secrets (the answer is always less satisfying than what you think the secret is. JJ Abrams called it a magic box problem - what's in the magic box? when you open it you're let down, before it can be anything). Through Divergent and Insurgent the big secret was how this world came to be. There are many examples (LOST, I'm looking at you) of worlds that were created with large secrets where the payoff wasn't there. For Allegiant, the payoff really isn't there but I don't think that's Roth's fault, it's my imagination's. My understanding of the outside world was much different than the written one in Allegiant and so there was disappointment. I knew, though, that the disappointment was coming.<br /><br />What I liked about the book is what many people have been panning. The development of all the major characters happened in this book. It's almost as if we got to knew them and before they were taken away, motivations were shaped and we were allowed to mourn the ending of the book.<br /><br />The narrative switch between Four and Tris was confusing in a couple of the chapters and I found myself looking at the front of the chapter to see who was speaking, but for the most part, I thought the 'lack of voice' of Four fleshed him out a bit and humanized him. Where in Divergent he was introduced as a macho, shallow guy, this book evolved him into more of a thinker and more to a person who had a firm grasp on how he felt. I don't think it was bad and I'm probably not alone in saying his thoughts often looked a lot like how I would think and approach a situation as a guy.<br /><br />I also thought the last 10 chapters or so were handled well and the writing reflected how the characters thought and felt and I felt their sense of loss (trying not to give anything away).<br /><br />My lack of a 5th star comes from, in my opinion, confusion about how the outside of Chicago world worked. I understand the Fringe and how cities were setup, but I was confused about where everyone else was. The world would benefit from even a short story explaining how it came to be the way it was and where everyone outside of Chicago lived.<br /><br />Take it for what you will, I thought it was a strong ending to a book even though it had some things going against it. :)
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|The Heath brothers have a lighthearted, easy-to-read style that makes this book one of the more entertaining 'business/management' books I've read. As an organizational change management practitioner by trade, I found that their book offers great examples and simple concepts that I can share with executives sponsoring a project, business owners of that project, and actually have the ideas get traction within the organization. It overlays well with other change models, and offers new, fresh ideas for why changes may not be working in your workplace or personal life. Great read, and I recommend it highly.
B00B9JDBSO|5.0|This is my first encounter with The Knife - I am 57yo -. I enjoy 'experimental music' such as The Residents.  The Knife reminds me sometimes to Cabaret Voltaire from the 1980s.  I appreciate their challenge in releasing a double CD album with some tracks coming from electronic composers-like - successfully.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I was terrified to watch this movie when my wife first kept going on an on about it just from the previews! We got it as soon as the store put it out. We watched it and were jumping left and right. We were both scared out of our minds! I held onto her and she held onto me! No there was no cussing in it or gore, but there didn't need to be. THIS WAS A TRUE STORY!!! It was horrifying just to know it could and did happen. I've experienced paranormal activity before, but nothing to this degree and it was bone chilling!!! I'm glad that the family survived and that Ed and Lorraine were able to help the family, but the story was just seriously disturbing! Excellent movie that scared me half to death!

B0007LGCB8|4.0|My third pair of Keen Newports. These feel smaller than the others but it's too late to return them because they're on my feet, I'm on my way to Europe for a walkabout, and I'm taking no other shoes. That should say what I think about Keen Newports.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I had 3 qualms about this great movie but can only remember 2:  Kahn should not have been the bad guy's name and we all know why and, Kirk shouldn't have &#34;died&#34; the  same way that Spock did in the Genesis movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game months ago and I still haven't gotten bored of it. I love how they are always changing the game to make it better. One thing I would suggest is adding more short cuts and hidden trails.
B00EV2OY6Y|4.0|I always have been a Def Leppard fan and I go see them live every time they come to town.<br />They put on a great show everytime and the energy is amazing. But I didn't like this live DVD as much. Maybe it's because I am used to see them live. To me, it's the bad editing and the camera view but the songs and the sound are great on Blueray or the CDs. I got the blueray set that came with 2 CDs. I also got their live album from their 2011 tour and I like those set better than this new one. Either way you will love them if you are a fan.<br />But do go see them live if you haven't.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Clair Danes was excellent in portraying Temple Grandin and a realistic interpretation of Aspergers. As an Aspie myself, I identified with so many behaviors. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to know more about autism or has a family member with autism. It could actually also be useful to people without autism, to learn about persistence and the will to get up after a knock-down.

B003Q6D5PM|5.0|This is a book I really needed to read, and has helped me tons with the relationship with my parents. First, because you finally realize that you are not alone, that there are more people with the same problem, that you are not going crazy. Second, because it has given me tools to face the problem. I would totally recommend it if you find yourself in this situation.
B00846WWVM|2.0|More geared toward children except it would be difficult for young children ...especially with the poor implementation of the aiming of the water hose.  The controls ruin any fun ...at least in my opinion.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books are great, they are not cheesy, they keep you hooked and have a bit of everything that is needed in a great book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 of this series is the best of all.  The storyline is powerful and moving.  The cast is incredible. This ensemble of actors is second to none.  From starring roles to the most minor of characters, each actor inhabits his or her character with such skill and talent, that it's hard to believe the characters aren't real, breathing human beings from the early 20th century.  I'm a big Maggie Smith fan so I'm not surprised that she is magnificent as the dowager countess, after all she's not Dame Maggie Smith for nothing, but every other actor in this cast also gives a sensitive, nuanced performance in every episode.<br /><br />Of course, none of this would be possible without some of the best writing on television.  From storyline to dialogue to character development to historical detail, the writing makes it seem that not a word is out of place.  Unlike some other multi-episode family sagas of the past TV seasons, there is nothing sprawling or extraneous about the way the story evolves.  Tight direction and editing make certain each episode flows smoothly and effortlessly.  Add to that , a beautiful setting, great production values and costume design and you have the makings of one of the finest series ever seen on television.<br /><br />If you are not watching this series, you are missing out on something truly special.
B009HSPODE|5.0|Alice Munro through her short stories opens a window to the essentials of life. Usually her stories are ten or fifteen pages long, and not much is being said except normal situations of the character's life. But then, in one or two paragraphs she is able to explain you why is their life like it is, what drives them, what moves them, what are they scared of. Wonderful.

B008D28HYS|2.0|The controls are a bit counter intuitive.  The graphics and concepts are good but I just can't get over the controls.
B000I3UMLQ|1.0|William Shatner was jealous Leonard Nimoy directed a great Star Trek movie. So he responded by directing the worst Star Trek movie, ensuring his place in history.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A terrific read, a captivating story.  I literally couldn't put the book down.  Appealing to all ages, a story of the human spirit.
B002IDDRT8|4.0|This was a great film to watch and the special effects were awesome! Definately going to watch it again on a later date
B002PZC8BM|5.0|I have extremely enjoyed watching season 1,2,3 of the Mentalist.  I have also purchased season 4 and 5. Makes terrific watching.
B0019IIPZO|4.0|Loved this movie no matter how many time  I see it over keeps my at the edge of my seat
B0062YADWI|3.0|Man, I wanted this to be perfect, but the clip design is too square and not curved enough to clip easily, perhaps once the tension wears out, it will become easier.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|When compared to the other books in the series, this one never really grabs your attention and curiosity, which is disappointing. However, you want to learn what happens to the characters you have come to know so well, so you keep reading.
B0012GMV4O|5.0|This album is BOSS. Every song is simply amazing, and the arrangements, the grit and sizzle, just shine! A good start into the realms of 70's Rock... Mountain really kind of started the cross over into the gritty 70's sound from where Cream left off.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is very good and very fun to play and I'm out of words to use and this is a run on sentence and good bye
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I used to laugh at people that were Candy Crush Crazies until it became available on the Kindle Fire. Now I am one of them.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The best one out of the three, didn't think it was possible to top iron man 2 but they pulled it off. And if u have a home theater system, it makes the experience twice as good!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|This is an excellent movie. All the actirs did a wonderful job. Especially Michale Douglas. I would recommend this movie.
0060254920|5.0|The book came so fast in the mail, i was surprised and excited to open it. and when i did, i found that the book was in extremely good condition. it had no markings or major dents. it was just aged; which is ok because vintage is supposedly cool. me and my daughter are over the moon about this book.<br />Em & EM
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All my friends had Candy Crush and I was unable to get it, but now...I know what their addiction of this game is all about!!! Loads of fun and challenging!!!!
B0085BHHOS|5.0|It's obviously not a studio release, but it's great for the fans to collect! :) I myself loved the cover choose for this album, as well as the flawless set list.!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie. From the start you can tell things are going to be different from the first Star Trek reboot movie and while the pace gets a bit slow at times you just can't pull yourself away for fear of missing something important.They once or twice reference the original Khan, and those who haven't seen it might not understand the references but it doesn't detract from the movie a bit. 5 Stars.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|The songs were very pleasing and Adele has great lyrics. Adele has a wonderful range and perfect pitch.  I might want to purchase more of her music in the future.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but this movie turned out a bit better than I was expecting. I was expecting something similar to Knight & Day, and it is a little similar, but definitely has much more depth and less cheesy moments. It gets a bit predictable near the end but it doesn't ruin the movie.
B00006879E|5.0|The songs are intriguing and make me want to hear more.  I think Adam Levine has a very interesting voice.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Really liked this movie, maybe even more than the 2nd one. You could really tell they put a lot of work in the suits in this one and that really made the movie better. Not to mention you get to see a side of Stark we haven't seen before. If you haven't seen it yet just buy it already!
B0091LS07E|3.0|Girl on fire had parts by Nicky Minaj, I did not care for those parts, would have  preferred Alicia keys alone.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I can't believe something this simple works, I was able to use my old MacBook Pro charger on my new Retina MacBook Pro & it fit perfectly!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|They said it would be a 20 day wait for the update,but it has been 3 weeks! Still the game is the best,so get it! Get it now!!!!!!!!!
B002RSOTSM|5.0|Hitchock was a great director, and it really shows in this classic.  An excellent film.  Funny and thrilling. Would definitely watch it again!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I love this game app soo cute! The pictures make me laugh and the story line is awesome. I highly recommend this game to those in love with cartoons and solving things. Have fun with it and thanks to th  person who made it!!<br /><br />Also, I it'd have been longer but it doesn't matter, I didn't have to pay a dime for it, got it while it was a free app on free app day ;)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. The story is so moving about a man who takes off on a 500 mile walk and reflects on his marriage,  relationships and life choices. For a first novel, it's amazing and well written that I can't wait for the 2nd.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the most fun I have ever had with a game and I am not a gamer by far! You will be<br />hooked!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Such a fun book with twists and turns to the very end. Moriarty sucks you into liking her characters and identifying with their flaws, guilt,, and very human traits. I want to read more from this author!!
B00981V68W|5.0|Kass a very good singer,<br />I keep on replaying the CD in my car.<br />What a treat to hear the Kass interpretations of these classic songs
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This movie features something for everyone. Mystery, thriller, comedy and love story all wrapped into one. A must see for everyone.
B00EMIE0CA|3.0|We'll see what happens over time, but on first listen it seems like a good jam session, but not really a collection of cohesive, long lasting, memorable songs.<br /><br />**A word of warning to those who often purchase the disk to get liner notes etc.... there are none.  I feel stupid for not buying the digital version.  Faster, cheaper and the same information.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Captivating story! I was caught up right from the start. Alma is such a complex character, and so well written. I felt I knew her.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Plot minimal<br />Sex scenes overdone<br />No reason to read this beyond the urge  to get through it as fast as possible<br />I wouldn't walk across the room to turn it on. on TV, let alone buy the next thousand pages.
006202406X|1.0|This book is horrible, and I'm not just talking about the controversial ending.  It is full of storyline contradictions, inconsistencies and poor writing.  As a reader, I feel completely betrayed by the author's sloppy work.<br /><br />There is a dual-narration device that is confusing to follow (Who's talking now?  Is it Tris?  Is it Tobias?  They sound the same!), and major characters have undergone complete personality changes with no rational explanation or justification.<br /><br />Within the first few pages, Roth almost completely abandons every character and plot thread that made the first two books so compelling.  There is an entire new setting away from the Hub we the readers don't care about, and ditto on new characters who come and go with inadequate character development or storyline purpose.  Similarly, there are way too many pointless deaths that serve no plot purpose.  The storyline is muddled and confusing, and major plot points are simply illogical, given what was previously developed in a prior chapter/book.<br /><br />And as for that controversial ending?  The worst offense of all in a pretty offensive book.  Leaving aside the issue of whether there should be a happy ending in a dystopian future-themed series, the ending is inauthentic.  I can accept such an ending if it is well-written or serves a plot purpose, but in this case the characters involved simply wouldn't do what we're asked to believe they did.<br /><br />Although I think she's committed professional suicide by publishing this book, I don't think Roth is completely responsible for this debacle.  I blame her editors and the publishing company too.  Someone should've had the guts to stand up and call her out on what an inauthentic, rushed mess this book is.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive but challenging.  Fun to follow along with family and friends.  Challenge yourself to see how fast you can level up,or challenge others to see who can get through each quicker.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Please don't let the one star reviews fool you, this is honestly the best book I have read. Although it tore out my heart,chewed it up, spit It out and put it back in, it was worth it. I was in tears, I have my ideas I wish she put into the epilogue but my goodness this book`s perfection is ridiculous. I just can't even. This was the best ending to any trilogy I have read. For once it's SPOILER not a happy ending. But you know what I'm okay with it and I think the one star reviews are not. Thank you Veronica Roth, but please know you will be getting my medical bill in the mail for my broken heart. I'm just kidding. Don't let the risk of a few tears shed keep u from reading this book. BE BRAVE
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun great graphics and nice people on the game, and is much better than the game howrse that game sucks
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|The app has really good features that work splendid with the direction I want both pictures and videos to present themselves. I am absolutely with a doubt satisfied.
006202406X|1.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS FROM THE START. TURN BACK NOW YE WHO WISH TO REMAIN UNSPOILED.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I was going to write a review of Allegiant, especially because a lot of other people have already touched on my primary problems (POV shifts being weak, writing so spare and minimalistic as to be completely incomprehensible at times) but I did want to talk a little more about Tris's death.<br /><br />Tris is a Christ figure. Throughout each book, even the bulk of Allegiant, we're shown over and over that she is her world's messiah. She is immune to the serums, she's shockingly \\"genetically pure\\" (which has it's own slew of problems that I don't think a white, upper-middle class woman should ever have written about, least of all someone as young as Roth), she's powerfully Divergent, etc etc etc. These things aren't necessarily a problem. The messianic figure has been a trope for hundreds of years, even pre-Christ. The Christ story is the one Western culture associates most strongly with the messianic figure, however, and because of that we expect a messiah story to go a certain way. Namely, we expect the messiah to come back from the dead.<br /><br />There are plenty of stories that deconstruct tropes - and the deconstruction of tropes is incredibly popular in media right now. Allegiant isn't a deconstruction. None of the Divergent books were a deconstruction of the messiah. None of them implied, in any way, that the human race doesn't need someone to lead it to salvation - which is exactly what Tris is doing throughout two and a half books. When she dies in Allegiant, the messiah trope isn't deconstructed. It's destroyed. And because tropes are a way to understand and parse media and stories, the reader is left utterly baffled and confused. This, in my opinion, is the primary failure of Allegiant. The destruction of a trope that Roth spent no time deconstructing is the problem, and it's the reason people are railing so hard against this story..
B005G02RIC|5.0|I enjoyed watching it. I've seen it twice since I bought it. It is the second Opera I have on Blu Ray DVD<br />Puccini was a great Composer. I wish I was a great Composer
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|A lot of King's recent work tends to be overly convoluted and doesn't have the edginess or the intensity of his earlier works, and this criticism applies to 'Doctor Sleep' as well. Not a bad read, but a little disappointing.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I enjoyed reading it. It was a famous Nineteenth Century Book<br />It was Emily Bronte's only Novel. It is a shame she didn't write more
006202406X|2.0|*Warning contains spoilers*<br /><br /> Let's just start with how much I loved the first two books and how greatly I anticipated the third. this trilogy had so much potential, her idea's were amazing if only she used them for good and not the destruction of hopes and dreams. when you write a book, yes, you want to make you character feel what the characters are feeling and I understand that it does include pain and loss. But it is possible to cross a line. As an author you have our trust in your hands. We know you are going to drag our feelings through the mud, clean them and then drag them through again, but we know especially with trilogies that you will make everything right at the end. Make the reading worth while. After reading allegiant I have never been so disappointed with an author. She made everything so perfect, made you believe that Tris and Tobias could finally have a chance at their relationship. A chance to love each other without being surrounded by violence, but she must have some underlying hatred for love prevailing through the worst of circumstances.<br /><br /> When you finish a book you want to leave with some feeling of content, that is not the case here. Why she felt the need to kill Tris is beyond me. They couldn't live happily together in Chicago for the rest of their days? Or she couldn't just kill Tobias' mom as soon as they made peace with each other? I'm sure Tobias and every reader would have been much more content with that ending.<br /><br />  Reading a trilogy is much different than reading a single book. If the main character in a singe book died I'd probably be upset for a couple of minutes and then get over it. Although with this book, I know it's pathetic in a way but I cried through the last five chapters and finished it at roughly 12:30 in the morning and was up until 4. I couldn't get over the betrayal and the sadness that overcame me. You saw Tris become the person people looked up to. You saw her almost die multiple times and you reassured yourself that she couldn't die because she was far too important. To have everything you believed ripped away from you is tragic.<br /><br />  I do not recommend reading this book if you loved the first two. make up your own ending and save yourself the tears, trust me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It finally came out on kindle! When I first saw it for free, I was all like ahhhhhhh :p I love this game  alot.....it challenges my brain..and most tim  My fingers xD<br />Download it, by meme &lt;3
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time they came out with this for th fire.  Love it, addicted!  Don't want to connect to facebook so the 3 days for quest is ok I guess
B00CATSONE|4.0|Great book. Tesla was robbed his due. I never realized...... This was well written  and entertaining<br />.A great read.Enjoy this. I did.
0805047905|5.0|My son loves the repetition in this book! I have read it so many times I don't even have to look at the pages which amazes and amuses him. It's such a fun book to bond over. He also loves to chew on the edges and look at the pictures on his own when we aren't reading.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a great app! If you want something that will keep you up to date on the weather get this!!
B000002KB8|5.0|This thrilling 1970 debut by Black Sabbath still sends chills down my spine, even though I really am too old to be listening to heavy metal any more.  Regardless, this is fantastic stuff that had as much of an impact on me as the 1969 debut by King Crimson.  I think chilling power sums up the Black Sabbath sound on the debut nicely.<br /><br />This stuff is at times raw, yet fairly sophisticated too. Geezer Butler simply thrashes his bass and really sets the tone for this early phase of the groups sound.  Although generally pretty loud, there is nice use of dynamics and creepy atmospheres - the title track with the combination of rain, thunder, and the terrifying sound of a tritone (\\"Devils interval\\") played on the electric guitar and bass is a great example. Oddly, this stands in contrast to the lyrics, which do not embrace evil in any way; rather the lyrics warn against such a thing.  There are also traces of the bands beginning as a blues band - the harmonica pops up here and there. Last, but not least, Ozzy really belts out with a signature vocal style that helped define the group during the 1970s.<br /><br />The sound quality of this US Warner Bros. release is not too bad and the CD booklet comes with some historical tidbits although the whole package is pretty skimpy. As a I recall, the vinyl LP was not much to write home about either.<br /><br />All in all, this is unbelievably powerful stuff that is truly heavy in a cosmic/metaphysical sense.  Great stuff that is recommended along with Paranoid (1970), Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973), and Sabotage (1975).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just like the original!  Love the game, even if it is way too addictive!  Get it quickly while you can.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|This follow up to Teenage Dream is really good. You wont be disappointed. There are probably a couple filler tracks on here that arent so good but when you have more then 2 or 3 good songs you cant go wrong buying the whole thing. Id say there is about 11 really good songs on here and rest are just ok. You probably might like the non deluxe version better maybe as it seems like the few songs towards the end after Grace of God are more the so so ones to me. Birthday song i would say is my favorite of the best non singles so far!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|This was an epic novel for me. From the father of Alma and his life, then Alma's life with all of it's personal revelations . I can just say that I related to her because I am also an obscure scientist who loves living and learning about this world.  Thank you Elizabeth Gilbert.  Very entertaining and absorbing.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My kids love this.. And in secret I love it too!  You can style a few people's hair from buzz cut to crazy.  It is easy to learn for my 4 year old and entertains me too!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app so much because I can watch videos without wick once I download them and the app works perfect!
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Wanna hear true talent and musicianship?  Maybe a little risk-taking?  Forget the formula, Elvis has given the world another sophisticated work here.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Not having played Magic for several years, I was really pleased to see that this app was fun and got me back up to speed in no time. I liked it so much that I bought the full version.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Very inspiring. have already started decluttering my house and can't wait to see if my shopping habits change and I feel more free!
6305428042|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine at Halloween.  Couldnt wait to show it to my son.  He absolutely fell in love with it. Great kids movie for Halloween!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Apart from the ending, I really liked the book. I enjoyed it as much as the other two books. I really wish it would have ended differently though.I don't understand why she couldn't make it a happy ending. It would have still made a great story and everyone would have been happy. But, I don't think it's fair to give a one star review just because you didn't like the ending. I loved all three books and enjoyed them more than the hunger games.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was when she was telling the story from Tris and Tobbis's viewpoint, it was so similar that I had to look at the beginning of the chapter to see whose viewpoint I am reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a game you have fun playing.  You keep going back to this game. This game make you us your mind. You can not wait to see what the next step will bring.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Watching these beloved classics later in life energizes your soul. Was catching myself with these distant -yet familiar- songs in my head... I began craving it.<br />I've had my favorite songs on repeat.<br />'Nough said. Very pleased.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Interesting and well-written book that keeps you reading. But more than that, it keeps you interested. This is a book that I can say impacts how I think and see the world.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|So far pretty awesome on k fire. Haven't played on I5 yet but did download. Keep em coming. Thanks. 20
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Tedious/boring in parts and not the usual Follett &#34;can't put down&#34; book which I wanted for a fifteen hour flight.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Like most people reviewing this release, I have been a long time fan of Rush. I've seen them live more times then I can count and have been a fan since the 70's. My first Rush concert was after \\"All the World's a Stage\\" came out so I've been a fan for a looong time. Anyway, when this first came out I really liked it for a couple weeks and then it sort of dropped off my radar. Then I read the book! All of a sudden I HAD to relisten and when I did and the concept fell into place, this became one of my favorite Rush releases of the modern era of Rush. No, it's not Hemispheres, but what is? I think reading the book should be required before listening, because as stand alone songs, there will not be a lot to grasp onto lyric wise and I think this is where some of the 1 and 2 star reviews come from. But read the book and relisten and you can follow the concept from song 1. It is now in constant rotation on my IPod and I truly love this album. People that say they phoned this in are not listening to the same recording I am. The riffs on The Anarchist or Seven Cities call back to a past day in Rush's history, and this is the first album in a long time that had me wanting to pick up my guitar and learn the songs. And to the people the say Geddy is not singing with emotion, really? Have they listened to The Garden?<br /><br />Wait I changed my mind... this is not one of my favorites from modern era Rush, but from any Rush!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It's rare that the writing of a book is done so well that you want to read passages over and over just be sure your caught every nuanced meaning in them. This is one of those books.
B00122Z9DS|3.0|Can I just say first, that when reading negative reviews here, you should always look at the commentors other reviews. So many 1 and 2 star reviews on Amazon are from people that give 1 and 2 stars to everything they review. How can those reviews be taken seriously?! If everything in your life is so miserable I feel sorry for you...<br /><br />As with most people doing Rush reviews, I have been a fan for a long time (the '70s) and they are easily on my short list of favs. That said, this is one of my least favorite releases. It just doesn't resonate with me for some reason. Some specifics would be the constant use of dual vocal lines and Geddy's annoying new habit of drawing out the last word of each line. Makes him sound like a newbie trying to make accents where there doesn't need to be any. Or the way some of the lyrics just feel crow-barred in. Also, I love Alex, but some of the stuff on here is so uninventive it almost feels like he wrote it while doing something else that was more important at the time. The whole album feels phoned in to me, save for a couple highlights like Far Cry, Spindrift or Main Monkey Business. I find that I will turn this on and about 4 or 5 songs in I switch to Counterparts or Clockwork Angels. Sorry to Rush fans that like this album, but it is just not my cup of the milk of paradise...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT CANDY CRUSH SAGA MADE IT TO KINDLE! Now please get Poppa Pear Saga!!!!
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I enjoyed it but it did look cartoonish at times. If you need a movie to pass the time with this is just the one.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Good game, just frustrating.  Can't get to the pork side right away.  Some levels are nearly impossible to finish.  You have to buy the good characters.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Samsung Galaxy SII, I guess the game was OK, but the other one-star I've seen is not far off about the spyware. The full network access is Amazn's way of counting the number of times you use the app- by customer. Just try and run it for two weeks without network enabled, and you'll get an error saying the program needs to be reinstalled, but really if you connect to Amzn again, it will work (the app has now reported how many times you've used it...tied to your device/account).<br />  Why waste your $ here when you can buy it once on play store and it's yours forever? I've been upside down with Amzn about this, then suddenly they stopped replying and lost my case.<br />UPDATE: I finally got someone's attention (see reply from Amazon cust. support), There is a privacy setting which allows you to turn off the tracking in the appstore app. Sure don't know why the email/phone support folks would string me on for so long if the answer was this simple...<br />...I have given the app my true star rating of 4- I hope the rep was right...will change again if not.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game. The only problem is that every time they do an update something goes wrong with my current game. This time almost all of my friends villages were wiped out and I can't shop for new items anymore. I will have to reupload it again and lose all of my progress up to now and start all over again.it has taken me months to get this far and now it will all be wiped out.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|In this fast paced and stress ridden world to watch Elf is to embrace all that is good and right about us and to laugh, not at someone, but just for the pure and childlike innocence of it.<br /><br />I bought Elf to watch with my 6 year old Grandson.  It is pure magic and a memory we will always share.  we will quote something from the movie and bring all the joy back immediately.<br /><br />When did you just belly laugh last?
1451695195|5.0|This book is very good and gives us a glimpes into what heaven will be like. Well written and as a doctor expains many things clearly.
B00005K3NR|3.0|Recieved this movie with a different picture on the box and nothing about special edition like the picture shows. The movie was there and it played ok. I enjoyed it but don't understand why the package was different. This isn't the first thing I have bought from Amazon that didn't seem right.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I wanted to give this 2.5 stars but it won't. let me :( Anyway,  its a fun game if you use facebook. Prepare to get tons of friend requests because you get a lot of bonuses. The kindle doesn't refresh your count as it should. But hey, its free and fun overall.
006202406X|1.0|There was so much potential here, which makes it that much more disappointing that it ended the way it did. There was no creativity involved in the two dozen \\"rebellions\\" that took place. And then at the end, Tobias works for a political leader and everyone else has an office job. How exciting! That really leaves a lot of hope for the future (/sarcasm). I find it kind of pathetic that the best ending the author could come up with was literally taking a dystopian future world and turning it into the world we live in now. And scattering ashes? Centuries from now are we really going to be disposing of human remains the same way we do now? I just think that everything in this book was either a repeat of something that happened in one of the previous two, or something that we do now that she didn't bother to update creatively to reflect the \\"future\\" world. Anyone who was allowed to read the drafts of this definitely dropped the ball. I found Tris annoying and wasn't really feeling the romance anyway, but I think this ending was a mistake, especially since it was all for nothing. I thought one of the lessons was that sacrificing some for the good of many was bad, but that's what they ended up doing. I don't know what I was expecting, but anything would have been better than this. I returned my Kindle copy for a refund and selected \\"Offensive content\\" as my reason. That helped me feel a little better.
B00FR0PVSY|5.0|Once again Lemmy and the boys put out a fantastic album! If you're a fan of music that grabs you by the throat and kicks your ass, then you'll like this album! There really isn't another band like Motorhead. I am very thankful that they keep giving us such great music to listen to.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Thrilling pace.  Perhaps a tick below Dragon, but still a great read.  Few metaphors and similes, but they aren't missed.  More of a journalistic style.  Now to crack open &#34;the girl who kicked the hornet's nest.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Makes me crazy but I still love it. lol husband and kids play it as well. Family craziness.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|It'll keep you entertained and the prose is not half bad. But if well rounded characters are your thing you may be a bit sad.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|This album is unique. No qualifiers. You can love it or hate it, but there's nothing like it. A strange fusion of many styles with marvelous arrangements and production. I did like later albums (of the 70s band) but this music is as colourful and as intricate as its cover. Forget where it sits in the pantaloons of history and its critics - listen with new ears.
B002RUA524|5.0|It was entertaining and funny in a way that a lot of things these days are not. The humor did not rely on mocking someone or being cleverer than someone, it was pure ridiculousness of situations and actions of people. It felt good to laugh at the things that were happening.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yeyyyyy!! So happy to see candy crush, haven't been off of it since I downloaded!!! Well only to see if I could get pretty rescue saga! I am a candy crush fiend! Send me to rehab quick!!!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I could see this with a buck though. It's pretty fun. There are some awkward little things that make it seem the game is cheating at times but all in all I like it as a way to keep my mind thinking as it does work on that front well
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved Divergent and liked Insurgent. I love Tris & Four but the ending they got was heart wrenching. I didn't care for the ending, although emotionally she did get to me since I cried through the last few chapters. I couldn't tell the difference between Tris's POV & Tobias's POV & I keep having to go back to see who's chapter it was and that was annoying. Also Tobias's POV didn't seem to mesh with what we know of him from the first two books. He seemed weaker. She had so many repetitive kissing scenes with almost the exact same dialogue each time that they started to feel ridiculous. I also didn't buy into the explanation in the book for why things were the way they were. No one in the fringe ever tried to break into one of the experiment cities? The whole genetically pure or damaged scenario just didn't seem plausible to me as the cause for wars and the collapse of the entire civilization. It all seemed illogical to me. I truly loved Divergent, but the series ending was sad & felt contrived and manipulative. I know the Divergent movie comes out next year. I wonder now if they'll even finish the rest of the series or change to a more \\"Hollywood\\" ending.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Sheryl Strayed is a brave woman. She walked the Pacific Coast Trail alone, carrying a monster backpack and wearing shoes that hurt. What an adventure! She turned it into an engrossing, contemplative book. I recommend this to anyone who wants to expand their horizons.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE this game. 2nd best to my farmville !  THRILLED I can get it on my inexpensive tablet !!!!!<br /> I really like some of the KING games . Hope Zynga does the same
B009LGO88E|4.0|If you're into certain 3DS games like Resident Evil or Monster Hunter, this is an excellent addition to your 3DS XL.  In case you're wondering, this import works fine on US 3DS XLs.<br /><br />There are some drawbacks, though:<br /><br />One, this pad will get in the way and needs to be removed if you're using a game that's not CPP-compatible, as it blocks one of the normal shoulder buttons.  Unless a game specifically supports the CPP, you cannot use any of the CPP buttons in-game.<br /><br />Two, there really aren't that many CPP-compatible games to play.  Buy thins only you know a game you're wanting to use it for is CPP compatible.<br /><br />Three, it takes batteries - it's powered separately from the 3DS.  They last a while, but it's an additional expense.<br /><br />Still, f you know your game is compatible and you want the second slide pad, this thing is great.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I was spellbound by this whole series. It's dark, but oddly hopeful. I recommend it for more mature readers. Atwood is a prophet.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|(Spoilers)<br />Honestly I would not give this book any stars, just my review. But I have to, so I'm giving it three.<br />Upon getting the first book, I locked myself away in my room for the four hours it took for me to read it. But this book was different.<br />I've never been a big fan of the constant switching of the POV's. This book contained the things I hate about POV switching. Tris and Tobias' personalities became the same and when I would stop reading midchapter and come back I wouldn't be able to tell the two apart.<br />But the major thing is the ending. I am fine with killing your protagonist off- if it's done in the right way. In this case it wasn't. Tris's character didn't deserve such a sudden death. I feel that a more emotional death would've have been much better.<br />Nonetheless, I still cried for a solid twenty minutes over this tragic ending that couldn't even be described as bittersweet as many of the other novels I've read similar to this.<br />Overall, this book was okay. It didn't keep me as hooked as the first two. A lot of the action was mediocre and by the time of Tris's death I was tired of the relationship between her and Tobias<br />The ending would have been much better if Uriah had lived and we had gotten to see a relationship between him and Christina. I probably will not read this book again and just try to imagine a happier ending. If any of my friends start reading the trilogy I will tell them to stop at insurgent and try to think of their own ending.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|my granddaughter loved it and all the dolls they made for it.thank you very much for the movie. she word have me order thing

B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Such a great movie i love it soooo much i watch it ALL the time deffinantly a ten star movie for me
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am so disappointed with how the author decided to end the series. I feel like she was trying  to prove something, like she's a badass and can make her story something crazy and memorable. I am now angry that I finished the book she completely ruined  the entire series! I couldn't even finish I skimmed the last chapter or so because I was so angry! I sill never read another book by her, I don't trust her to be faithful to a good story only that she ruins them.

B00D29CBIU|5.0|This book goes deeper than any other money, wealth, abundance, prosperity book, holding up a clear mirror to how each of us handles money. Helpfully breaks out money to various topics - income, savings, etc. - to further refine the individual's path to abundance by bringing to conscious awareness long-forgotten emotionally charged events and situations. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

B001QB5S3G|5.0|great film. music, plot, cinematography, acting, and all based on true facts. has it all. it is a must see movie.
B00ESNE696|5.0|I have been a fan of The Good Wife for a long time and somehow I was not aware that this season had started. By the time I realized it, I had missed the first four episodes. Thanks to Amazon instant video, I was able to purchase them and watch them in a couple of days. I am up to date now and anxiously waiting for the next to air. I have had recourse several times to Amazon for missed episodes on several series. It is a lifesaver!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|great story! Time period which is so well done. I don't know how the film industry does it. Keep them coming.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting's latest endeavor, The Last Ship, goes well beyond a score for a planned play.  These Everyman ballads celebrate the grueling lives defined by hard labor and hearty celebration.  Their spirit belongs to every age, every culture.  Sting is truly a troubadour who draws from an ancient well.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This well written tome reveals an aspect of the 1960's (and beyond) that makes one shudder.  There are enough near nuclear mishaps documented here to give even &#34;hawks&#34; the opportunity to re-examine the true cost of wars be they hot or cold.  Without, hopefully, giving too much away I was fascinated to read why the movie, &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; is factually more accurate than it's counter part, &#34;Fail-Safe&#34;.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie is watched regularly at my home. My husband and son enjoy the action and the little bits of humor that was written into the dialog. If you enjoy the superhero movies then you need to add this to your collection!
031623480X|4.0|Be your own best skeptic this is definitely one theory of issues with too much grain. I like the science in the book they use fear and stretched data to make points. Making food evil when factors like behavior portion and genetics are involved is a little below average. I found this book to be fascinating, insightful and brings up more good questions along with action plans. I appreciate books that point folks in the right direction for eating healthy and lifestyle changes that lead to longer healthier lives.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|If your a big fan of the show then you will not be disappointed. Once you put in the first disk it is hard to stop watching. So these are great for long winters and rainy days. Love this show!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a really fun game, similar to bejeweled but without the time limit. It's getting kind of challenging and I'm only on level 20. Plays smoothly on my Kindle Fire.
B00007GZR5|4.0|If you'd like to see a movie about a soul journey then look no farther. This is very interesting view on what happens when we die. If you have done a lot of reading on past life regression and soul journey, then this movie will help you gain a visiual perception.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that this app is available on Kindle. It's so much fun and I love that it's very challenging. I never get tired of playing Candy Crush!!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This is not high theater, and the acting is mostly good (although Thor's emotional transformation seemed a bit abrupt with no discernible time lapse spent in introspection). Visual effects are stunning, storyline is mostly true. There are some great verbal gems and a few decent moments. We had a great time with it.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|I've only watched two episodes but I have already ordered the second season and plan on ordering the third season.<br />Both shocking and entertaining at once!!!<br />So far - I love it<br />Morgan
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally Candy Crush on the kindle. I've been waiting for this forever. I love it. Way to go Amazon. Thanks.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|What an enjoyable book!!  I really liked this story.  I have noticed a trend in the books I choose, many have an ode to reading.  This book seemed to be written by someone who truly knows the joys of being lost in the written word.  I found myself getting carried away by the story.  I did not find the twist to be obvious, it was nice not guessing the truth before it was revealed.  This was a great ghost story for right before Halloween.
0425263924|5.0|I have enjoyed this series. I prefer them over the 50 Shades series. Can't wait for the next book to come out. Really hope Sylvia continues.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|Good cast, worrisome story line, but keeps your interest.  I don't purchase many series, but this was worth it.  The end.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|i chose the rating of 5 stars because i LOVE this show!! When it first came out it reminded me a bit like twilight....but better!!! more realistic and breath taking moments!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Must have series.  Extremely entertaining.  Thrones, swords, mystical stuff, feuds, bonds to be broken, liars.  Just everything you could want in a Medieval Fantasy setting.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the way it gently wakes you up. It isn't jarring so I wake up in a better mood to start the day.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|My form comment from now on:  If you quit<br />requiring a written review for movies, more people will give a rating for movies.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Overall I think the book concluded the series in an emotive, cohesive way.  Moreover, for me this book and the whole series was a good ride, despite issues I had with the writing.  I didn't find any significant differences between Roth's writing style in this book versus the other two; the same issues annoyed me throughout (repetitive language, story elements that made no sense, plot holes, etc.). Switching back and forth between Tris and Tobias didn't bother me, but I think that's because their voices were so darn similar (that's not a good thing).  But, I guess I don't expect much nuanced writing out of YA books.  What I do expect are engaging characters and plot, which the book delivers, similarly to Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />This isn't to say I wasn't totally crying at the end, and at first so mad at Roth for concluding things the way she did (I am a grown woman and was crying at a YA book... jeez!).  But my feelings toward the finale have softened a couple days after finishing, and I appreciate it more.  So for those just winding up the series now, I'd say give yourself a couple days to mope and see how you feel about it in a little while.<br /><br />I have to give props to Roth for having the gumption to put a story out there that evokes major emotion, and not just the happy kind.  I'm mildly embarassed to admit that I've been thinking about it almost constantly since I wrapped up the book!  And even though many of my thoughts have centered on the final tragedy of the series, I think the fact I can't get it out of my head is the sign of a powerful book.  Few authors, particularly in this genre, are willing to bring their readers to a place filled with such heavy emotions (partially, I imagine, because of the type of backlash Roth is getting now).<br /><br />**SPOILERS AHEAD!  BE WARNED!**<br /><br />...<br /><br />...<br /><br />...<br /><br />...<br /><br />Unlike some readers, I don't think Tris' final decision was solely for the sake of her brother... it was because she wouldn't have been able to live with herself had she let Caleb die for the wrong reasons.  I also don't think her actions showed the same recklessness as they did in Insurgent; she really thought she might survive. However, parts of her death did feel contrived.  Roth brought us to a hopeful place, where Tris and Tobias were talking about their future together, only to have our hopes dashed at the very end!  Felt a bit like rubbing it in to me, and the death itself felt seemed abrupt.  It could have been explained better within the political context of the Divergent world, in order to make it feel more significant.<br /><br />I could imagine other ways for it to go that would have tied up the book's themes and pleased fans at the same time (for example, Tris could have become gravely hurt but survived anyway... and we could have waited to find that out until the Epilogue).  But I do think her mindset as she risked her life was totally consistent with her character and sense of morality.  Though it was sad, it was also beautiful.<br /><br />To sum up:  I enjoyed the ride, despite my misgivings about the writing style,  and in the end that's my main rating criteria.  Good series plagued with typical storytelling issues of the YA genre.  Twisty ending that will leave you thinking, for better or worse.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Usually a biography tends to polarise the reader, rarely have I read a book which makes us love the imperfections of a person and take the niceties in a subtle almost subconscious way. I love this even more because it explains why I like the good things and love the imperfections of apple as a company and their products. Absolutely loved it and would declare it a must read for people who own apple products and others who ask why apple?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire HD (7&#34; version) and it is not very good about updating the news feed.  Other than that, it works okay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I chose this game to try because every one plays it and loves it. It is a great addictive game.<br />The only thing I don't like is, it prompts for payment when you run out of lives, and then you have to wait for more lives.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is a CD that I can listen to without skipping any songs. Which in my book makes it a outstanding CD.
B00A2H9WW8|1.0|Hello it's Sunnydale Girl here....Well I FINALLY got to see the trailer for this movie (You know cause that's how I am.....I'm either Classic Scary movie Scream Queen....or I like to watch them Real late at night (Its like watching Scary Movies when it's raining......and I thought I'm having ALOT of fun watching Stephen King movies this Halloween(it's been a long running tradition with me) But before we delve deep into my review let's just get one thing straight (I'm NOT making fun of the other fans here; and the reason I used  THAT as my Headline title was because I couldn't get that Wayne's World movie joke out of my head; that also goes with Mike Myers drinking a Pepsi saying...Yes and its the Choice of a new Generation) Okay enough of that, now onto The Carrie of 2013. WTF? When did this movie turn into She's All That with Telekinesis? And yes I do like THAT movie....but here, They aren't even trying....and we already had a very good remake that was Real close to the book. So let me 1st tackle Carrie. I saw the original when I was 16 in 1999, and Sissy Spaceck was perfect. In fact ( I was the geeky Stephen King at school) I read the book so many times I could still say it in my sleep and the same with the movie! Then I hear of the re-make in 2000; now this is where my review comes 2 a screeching hault for a  moment. This is a Very Descent remake.....I thought the coach who was Carries friend was very good (sorry if I don't  know all the actors names in this, sometimes I just memorize character names.) And Carrie was very good (They even had that great Going to Prom scene from the book.) And Ginger from Gingersnaps; was Great as the Popular girls friend who always wore that red baseball cap( THAT was the Carrie for the next Generation....So Hollywood---WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I mean are things Really THAT bad...that you have to Re-write a Remake that had NOTHING wrong with it except a few minor inconsistencies? Cause you screwed up the MAIN character 4 crying out loud! This ISN'T SHE'S ALL THAT! CARRIE IS NOT the geeky girl who's just in need of a makeover and she'll be fine, and Julianne Moore, Go back 2 Jurassic Park! Because you aren't acting ANYTHING like the mom should (and I've always been on Carrie's side, but I saw the scene in the Trailer where she says &#34;They're all going to laugh at you ....and well I laughed (and I have NEVER done that with that scene! But she sounds like she can't even read the line....So Julianne Moore...take the 1970s version of your script and Go to your closet until you get it right.....(but that's just for her to get it right to save herself some embarrassment, we Definitely Don't want her in this movie....and this new Carrie actress; whoever you are I'm going to use Telekinesis to fling you off the set....and I'm going to be Carrie (my friends gave me that nickname a while back cause Carrie's my Favorite Stephen King book and movie) And I'll make the Carrie for a New Generation.....but as for THIS horrible, one I Really would like to know when this comes out on DVD so I can buy EVERY copy, just to burn them in a High school Football field with my telekinesis....Cut and Print!
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I really like the fact that so many disks came for such a low price. My daughter loves Nicki Minaj which is why I purchased this and she was beyond excited when I showed it to her.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|CableJive is exactly what I needed for my listening devices. It is easy to set up. It pairs quickly and works on many different units.<br />Sound quality depends on what you connect it to . I like having my iPod touch, 5th gen on my desk and the ability to control the sound from there and not  have to get up to check what song is playing on Pandora. the price makes this a bargain. It extends my capabilities and is convenient . It does exactly what it is advertised to do.

B003F5NSTW|5.0|An exceptionally talented writer who offers a refreshingly honest albeit chilling and grotesquely visceral look at the fury behind the visage of a child born into a world where he feels neither needed nor loved. Draws you in and spits you out the other side thinking of all the times you could've been kinder to the girl with a poor fashion sense in lower school; all the times you could've been more accepting of the boy with an annoying hobby in high school.. And all the times you should've showed your family how much you loved them during those tumultuous adolescent years. A must read for the self centred, closed minded and prospective middle class white parent alike.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|So, I understand where Roth was trying to go with the overall themes/messages in the book (be brave, forgive, self-sacrifice, choose love, good/evil are different shades of gray, etc.), and I appreciated the plot closure and additional character insights...<br />- In past books, Four was always the bad-ass, albeit a broken bad-ass, but in this book, Four showed much more vulnerability, weakness (since we saw his POV) and grew in his life journey.<br />- Tris got to heal her relationships and grieve her parents' death.<br />- I feel like I understood Evelyn and Johanna on a deeper level in this book, which was a nice surprise as I never particularly cared for them before this last book. Evelyn was forced to abandon her son in order to flee her abusive husband (Marcus) and survive, then waged a war against her husband as revenge for all his abuse/falsehood/transgressions, but always loved her son (Four). Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - or separated from her son! Johanna's scar came from an abusive past, which most likely led her to join Amity and become their faction leader.<br /><br />...BUT the plot details and implementation kinda sucked!!<br />- It was hard to tell which POV you were reading because the language and tone barely changed.<br />- The war on the outside plus war on the inside plus fringe plus nebulous \\"government\\" was a bit much and much too long. (This is YA - give us more teenage hormonal romance!)<br />- I'm a believer but the characters' self-realizations & actualizations were too preachy for me. The realism of the story and the raw emotions would have been enough for me. I didn't need the characters to spell it out for me and then sell me their life lesson too.<br />- I didn't need a happy ending but a little hope would have been nice. Sure, there is nothing happy about death and war, but if you're going to get all preachy on me, then at least throw in a little faith and hope!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show, will be watching all of them now. Glad that it is available to watch on streaming video. Will look into other similar shows.
193700788X|4.0|Through many years I visited the thoughts of Sookie and experienced her life. Some excellent mysteries were unveiled simultaneously discovering an ever expanding world of darkness and light. CH had the balls to bring a closing scenery...an end to the saga.<br /><br />It was certainly tough on many levels. It would be difficult to please all &#34;clubs&#34; (like team Eric, or team Bill), to revisit the main secondary characters (without similarities to the endings of soap operas), to portray a minimally realistic cast of characters in the final &#34;battlelines&#34; and, most important, to end her main saga (it's not easy to finish something that was your main income provider...it needs courage).<br /><br />The authoress uses in this book occasionally third person view. Although it's different from all the other books in the series (which had exclusively Sookie's POV), it really intensifies the doom and dread, of something that is happening at that moment and there's nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />So several foes from the past decide to make a final plot against that nosy Sookie; and they don't play by the rules (although they use the law). Like the other installments, there is more than one plot...but here they have roughly the same objective - the destruction of Sookie Stackhouse.<br /><br />---------BIG SPOILERS AHEAD--------------<br /><br />About the romantic question, which is so important for so many readers...I must confess it was something of a surprise. Bill wasn't an option after the betrayal; Eric is a thousand years old!!! He is ambitious, self-serving and have long term plans (which I've never doubted included turning Sookie into a vampire). He also knows that love never lasts forever...it's implied on the limited time span of marriages and in some expressions through the series. Between a human that he now loves (and would grow old and die because she refuses to being turned into a vampire) and marrying mighty Freyda, eternally beautiful, intelligent and QUEEN of Oklahoma, I haven't absolutely no doubt about the path Eric would follow...and he was right...if Sookie had used the Cluviel dor she might solve all the questions (but she waited and waited, until a situation came that she instinctively had to use it - on Sam - the ever present friend...and much more then that).<br /><br />One other thought dear reader. It is extremely important and shows the intelligence of CH that the last desperate fight is exclusively fought by Sookie with no supernatural aid; just her wit, knowledge of the foes and bravery. No supe could have saved her; she had to do it herself.elligent and QUEEN of Oklahoma, I haven't absolutely no doubt about the path Eric would follow...and he was right...if Sookie had used the Cluviel dor she might solve all the questions (but she waited and waited, until a situation came that she instinctively had to use it - on Sam - the ever present friend...and much more then that).<br /><br />One other thought dear reader.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|Got the entire series of this outstanding comedy for a dirt cheap price...thank goodness for Amazon!  It'll take me a long time to get through all the discs but I'm really looking forward to it.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|First confession - I only read the first 50 pages or so. But each page was like the last so I had no reason to think the next 1000 pages would be any different. Perhaps being a published author with great reviews (both reader and professional) and approaching my 68th birthday, I wasn't in the mood for a book that flouts all the rules of good writing and gets praise heaped on it for that. This is self-indulgent, unedited writing at its most extreme. I imagine that if someone unknown like myself sent this sprawling stream-of-semi-consciousness book to a literary agent or publisher, I would not only get rejected, I would get a lot of letters back telling me to learn how to write before wasting people's time on such garbage. I suppose Mr. Wallace was hailed as a genius, because people couldn't understand what the hell he is writing about, so they assume he must be on a different level than them, but if they jump on his genius bandwagon, then they'll at least appear smart enough to recognize genius - the myth of it takes one to know one. Mr. Wallace may have been a genius in IQ terms, but this book is self-indulgent stupidity. Sure maybe there's a 200 page book in this behemoth of 1000+ pages, but why should anyone have to wade through all that crap to get there. And no, the crap is not amusing.
B00917IQFY|3.0|Graham Parker's one of my Top 5 favorite music artists and I'd love to give this CD a full 5 stars but I can't.<br /><br />Some of the songs on here are nothing short of excellent and among their best ever (&#34;Long Emotional Ride&#34;, &#34;Stop Cryin' About The Rain&#34;, and &#34;Coathangers&#34; really stand out for this reviewer) but some of the other songs (such as &#34;Old Soul&#34;, &#34;Live In Shadows&#34;, and &#34;That Moon Was Low&#34;) are clunkers and the kind I'll quickly skip over.<br /><br />So overall, the album as a whole is very up-and-down in my opinion.  An even amount of highs and lows.  Thus, 3 stars.  If you want a much better (fairly) recent GP album, I'd recommend 2005's &#34;Song of No Consequence&#34; or 2001's &#34;Deepcut to Nowhere&#34; since there's hardly a weak cut on either of those releases.

1594744769|5.0|I'd been seeing this in bookstores for a while, but I try not to pay the ridiculous B&N prices so I eventually bought it on here. The photos intrigued me, but once I received it I worried it would be a bit too adolescent for me. It is about a young teenage boy, and intended for young teenage readers, but even though I am in my twenties I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a hard time putting it down and was constantly dying to find out what would happen next.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|It works great. I use it on my laptop along with an ocean navigator programs that use charts. Now, with this little GPS the charts scroll along with my location.<br /><br />Configuring the com port was easy and the little program that comes with it works great.<br /><br />But, here's a clue. Due to the nature of the com port (even though it runs through a USB port) only one program at a time will be able to use it. So, if you have the included GPSinfo utility running any navigation program or other program, for that matter,will not be able to use the GPS.  Remember - only one program at a time due to the nature of the com port and its limitations.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Love! Love! This series!!!! I could seriously watch it all what time if yes had more episodes and I had more time!!
B00ANA27IU|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi novels of all time. Considering the time in which was written, it is impressive how many aspects of society and space exploration got them right.<br />Is it worth reading after having watched Kubrik's movie? The answer is beyond any doubt a definitive YES! It is actually arguable what came first (actually, both were developed at the same time, as the prologue of this edition clearly explains).
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Now I have been really harsh on the other games, not being educational and all; this one was a little better. At least there is a need to problem solve. This game at least challenges my kid and make her use mind to figure out how to get the water where it needs to go. Now I'm not saying its the most beneficial, just a little better than the other choices my daughter has made....
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Loved it!  Purchased for my husband and we both have enjoyed it to the fullest!  A good Christmas gift for any Cher fan on your list.
B00F1RR3Y8|2.0|I personally feel like this is a waste of space on the kindle fire, but having a little girl that is super prissy I guess it keeps her busy for about 10 minutes (definitely not long though).  There is no educational value or skill set needed.  BORING!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging. I even had to take notes at one point to remember the clues. very fun game in an adult sort of way. can't wait for more rooms.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|I don't feel like this game was a good use of brain cells, thats why I would never download games like this but my 7 year old conned her uncle into downloading it for her.....  There is no educational value at all and a waste of memory on the kindle.  After about 1 week and she wasn't playing the game anymore I deleted it.  Definitely would not recommend this to anyone.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|Every notepad has the same basic features, in this app i like the readability and size of the font used.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|Now I have been really harsh on the other games, not being educational and all; this one was a little better. At least there is a need to problem solve.

B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Excellent movie and I recommend it for anyone who likes good action packed entertainment with a bit of comedy.  Very realistic parts and gets a bit bloody in parts.  Arnold does a pretty good job along with the other actors.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|What's not to love???? She is back, stronger than ever with some GREAT dance songs. Women's World is not the only hit on this super compilation. Love the ballads to. Her voice is still so strong and clear. The mix of songs follows the last two albums but, again, they're all great! And, the hit from Burlesque is included and...that is one great performance! GET IT!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addictive but lots of fun and mind boggling.<br />Sometims you get stuck on a level and then 1 day you do it
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|After hearing the songs on the tv show, I had to buy this. Great listen...some really good songs! Looking to get the next set too.
B00881VLCE|1.0|it won,t launch. I played and completed the first pack and when<br />I signed in for another pack it now won.t even launch.<br />it just spins and spins and spins.<br />I really enjoyed the puzzles
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|The best bluegrass pickers does not turn a country singer into a bluegrass album. The is pure Alan Jackson country album with bluegrass pickers backing him up. the album is okay but not what I was expecting.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|I finally took the time to see this movie and it was surprisingly good. It is for mature audience and is from a different era<br />The actors were what makes this film memorable.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|This movie belongs to it's child star but Mathew McConaughey's performance is not to be missed. This is a great movie, that tells the story of individuals who are outside the mainstream and lets us be apart of their lives.  The dialogue is perfect and the characters are intriguing.  Highly recommended.
006202406X|1.0|I have absolutely loved the first two books of this series, but this book is completely different than the first two. The plot line is extremely boring, and not to mention that too many conflicts are created when earlier conflicts still aren't resolved. The GD and GP conflict is messy and uncoordinated, and not to mention the ending! I'm not a person that hates on books that have a sad ending, if its makes sense...however the ending to this trilogy felt completely out of place and just intended for &#34;shock value&#34;. It was a horrible way to end the series and the sacrifice...wasn't worth it at all. Completely ruined this book series for me, not to mention the movie franchise. Disappointing.
0425252868|5.0|No question that this is a five star rating. I would like to see the younger generation read this book so they could see what HONOR is all about.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Spend a lot of time indoors when it is cold due to ling problems. It is a very challenging game after you get to the upper levels. I enjoy trying to increase my scores each time I play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad that Candy Crush is finally for the kindle,.<br />The books to play Candy Crush will be put to use finally.<br />Thanks to King.com.<br />Hoping for more of the king.com games<br />will be available for the kindles.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought it was a great sequel to The Shining! Great read. I would recommend this to any Arephen King fan. Does not disappoint.
B004WR125O|3.0|Not sure that i shouldnt have chosen the trendnet alternative that i read about. This product does work though.  OK
0553381695|5.0|I am still enjoying the story which throws in its plot twist unexpectedly, and each page leaves me wanting more.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Iv tried many times to get it on my kindle fire and it says I don't have enough room. I got rid of all my apps and it still wont let me!!!the reason I'm giving it 1 star is it wont let me put 0 stars.
006202406X|3.0|If you are a true fan of the trilogy I ask of you to carefully and truthfully prepare for something you could not possibly expect. By all means I wish this could have ended differently, an end of which we could all been happy with. It does not meet up with the first two novels yet to a degree settles to wrap up the world and questions Roth made play out in our heads. After finishing the Epilogue I surely lost all sense of power over the emotions that stirred through the last few chapters. The only thought running through my mind right now is the need of a vial of memory serum, for I wish to forget this ending, it's just not that ending I wish to settle with.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Save your time and money. Glad I read the book prior to allowing my child access. It seems the author couldn't hold it together long enough to finish the series. Writing was horrific and I felt as if I was reading a book from a completely different author - an author I would not publish. Huge disappointment.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I am beyond words on how I can explain how excellent this movie is, it has great writing and traumatic surprises in horror that makes this a must see movie. This is a type of movie that makes you want to watch a second time. Further, this movie is so scary. It makes you want to buy a night light so you can sleep at night. In short, it is truly superb.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG!!  Been waiting. And Finally kindle fire has this game... Its really fun game and addictive lol... hope this was helpful
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This application is very good and helpful and I use it on all of my devices. It runs clean and smooth an syncs great.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots of fun.. great download.. anyone who likes hunting games will like it. Very smooth gameplay and good picture. Very good way to kill time
B00BGI08GG|5.0|Absolutely loved the first season of this show. I've checked out some of the special features and they have been very informative.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I was so happy when I finally was able to get this game and it did not disappoint. another plus it is not bombarded with ads. I would suggest everyone should try this game.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Dark Roots of Earth is a awesome album. The Musicianship of Testament is amazing. The solos are great. Every aspect of the album is great. I just got into Testament and they are a great band.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|I have tons of pictures but it will NOT let you use one of your own. All it is is their pics you can write things on. Nothing new or amazing. It should be free. If you want something like this get picsay. It's free, let's you use ANY picture, you can put frames, make collages, change picture style, write on it, change picture type like on instagram, save, upload, post to Facebook and so on...or just type in photo editor app and any of them will be better then this. This is just using their pics and writing on them, nothing more. I have to think these reviews are written by owner.  See for yourself if your curious.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I was a little little over kill but had nice action. at least it didnot have the alien space ships, which is not my type of movie. young kids enjoy that , Not me.
B00849F82E|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Chesterton viewed Christianity with a combined logic and sense of humor. His illustrations are from life and the truths they illustrate are instructive.  Of course, he is thoroughly early 20th century British, but has a way about his writing that will appeal to anyone.  I recommend Chesterton's book to anyone who wishes to understand why the Christian faith is the only really logical way of life .  I look forward to reading more of Chesterton's works.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|you have to like this type of book which i obviously do, it gives you a feel for how people actually lived in those times,it is multi layered with different plots,and most of all it is interwoven with historical events and a fantastic imagination.<br />Despite its size this an absolute page turner.
1490313370|5.0|I almost never read a book more than once. I loved this book so much that as soon as I finished reading it I started over. It's absolutely packed with great advice for almost anybody (with an open mind). Step one to a better you: read this book. Step two: read it again. Then get to work.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I like the show ,but the first two series of the season 4 were a little boring for me :(<br />Video stream quality is ok, was a bit slow sometime ... But overall it is fine<br />Thank you Amazon!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I know some of you don't but the kindle fire is better with this app.  no more to say even though Amazon wants more.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I'm not one to grasp what lie between the lines most of the times. Particularly in this book. A great read and every chapter had me on edge waiting for the turn of devastation that may have completely changed the story for me... All in all I was happy with its ending, though I thought it ended fast. I would read the second book to see where the story of Ender Wiggins takes me, in hopes that it takes me down another great path.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This was a waste of time to download. The advertisement button is too close to the puzzle pieces so when you try to move a piece you end up on an ad page. I had about one third of a puzzle finished when this happened for the 2nd time. All of my puzzle pieces that were on board just disappeared. They weren't back in with the rest of the pieces; they were just gone. So I ended up with a partial puzzle. Pointless. Don't trouble yourself with this one.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Hey kids, sometimes people die, even the heroes (or should I say, especially the heroes). I think Roth followed the progression of the story to the only conclusion that made sense. Tris' sacrifice was true to who she was. I would love to thank Roth for not succumbing to the desires of her fans, and being loyal to the nature of her characters. Part of what makes this trilogy so great to read is how real the flaws in these people are, seeing them fail, and then rise above their failings because there is an inherent good in them (most of them, anyway). To have everyone live happily ever seems like an insult to that realness.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|We know a lot about the facts of World War I, but not so much of the human pathos. Follett brings the issues forward by creating an amazing number of characters in the involved countries and then having them interact with well-known historical movers of the hands of time. The outcome is an improved understanding of the tragedy of history, something like a tidal wave that swept the world before it.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Very good buy, shipping on time, razonable price. When used, It doesn't heat with two inputs are used.  Looks like durable material,  adjust perfectly to cigarette input.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This sequel follows well on its leader, Fall of Giants. The mix of characters, real and fictional, is carried off one more time.
B000GWE44U|5.0|A classic! Jack at his best, not to mention, it's based on a book by Stephen King. Horror at it's best.
0920668372|5.0|My son and I found it humorous when he was younger and as he grew it became very sentimental though still with humor.<br />He is 29 now.<br /><br />At the orientation meeting for Freshman Parents, when he left for college, they read this story.  A room full of boo hoos.<br /><br />Our last word on cards and notes now are I'll Love You Forever, I'll Like you for always.  He signs cards that way as do I.<br />Now he is expecting his own son and of course, I had to give him and the mother to be this book. I send to to all my new parent friends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I admit I tried this app because it was free. However, it did not disappoint! This was surprisingly fun. I expected it to be pretty easy, but I actually had to put my thinking cap on for a few of the floors. Much better than what I was expecting! I was disappointed when I reached the end and I'm now looking forward to new floors.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is nice to have some length to play with to move around.  A shorter cord makes using and charging at the same time very difficult. Just wish it didn't cost almost $10.
0060723513|5.0|Love this book and it's message.  I realize there is a lot of controversy regarding the validity of the story.  So what if it is fiction? The message is what's important! I say, read it! Let it speak to you and inspire you to be better. I am thankful I read this and believe that you should too!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I got this for my 7&quot; Fire and deleted it pretty quick. Thought I would try it on new 8.9 Fire but it's still not loud. My phone's default clock wins again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Would have liked more detail at the end.  Good completion to the series.  I enjoyed it, but found it a little too heavy to be considered a youth/tween series.
B000NY12LO|5.0|We'll written and very thought provoking !  I found it to be a must read for anyone working with kids.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Pauseunpause is here and I recommend this book so if you need a good book you should get it bye
B000FC10MU|5.0|After spending three years in prison, all Shadow wanted was to get back into the arms of his loving wife. However, sometimes fate can be cruel. Just days before he is scheduled to be released, Shadow learns that his wife has been killed in a car accident. Suddenly his world begins to crumble and become a much colder place.<br /><br />On his way home for the funeral, Shadow meets Wednesday. When the stranger offers him a job, having nothing to lose, Shadow accepts. Little does he know that his life will never be the same.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before Shadow realizes just how dangerous his new job is. While working for Wednesday, Shadow embarks on a road trip unlike any other. He encounters many unique and interesting people, all of which have their own stories to tell and know more about him then he does about himself.<br /><br />As an epic storms brews, Shadow has many lessons to learn. The past doesn't always die and everyone, including his late wife has secrets.  The stakes are high as he finds himself pulled into a battle, a conflict, as old as humanity itself. Hidden away from the everyday world, a great war is fought over the very soil on which they stand. The soil of America is the prize.<br /><br />American Gods will take the reader on an exhilarating journey across America and through myths, some long forgotten, that may challenge their perspectives long after they turn the final page.<br /><br />The author, Neil Gaiman, does a remarkable job making his story and characters come to life. I often found myself on the edge of my seat, being drawn into the story. The plot was well thought out and kept me guessing as each new twist was introduced.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and say that for fans of myth and legend, this is a must read.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|You can barely do anything without paying 10 dollars and like me at 13 I can't get a job. You can do 1sealed play 1 section of champagne and 0 challenges 0 deck modification and 6 pictures to represent you
B0036TGT2A|4.0|I enjoy this movie and when I found out it was coming out I knew I had to buy it. I bought this version for the digital copy and the music thinking the music was going to be the soundtrack. Sadly it wasn't but the movie itself gets 5 stars..So there you go<br /><br />Don't Buy this if you think the music is the soundtrack it is a few songs fro the soundtrack and the other songs are eh.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Good game well done developers of angry birds you have satisfied my boredom by creating this cool app for free also
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great product and was well worth the price. It went along great with the screen protector and had no issues applying or putting on the product. Will keep this on my phone unless a better case comes along like an Otter box or lifeproof
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series of books is great. It provides a good story and twist and turns everywhere. I recommend reading all three books. I loved them all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY they make it for kindle. Been waiting forever. Been Crush free for 5 months and now I h am an addict again. Thanks.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great product & it works well for me . For music, which moves me all day, one just can get any better than this. This product provides an ease of access to the singles that you want to the whole master . To preview & get the old goodies MAN WHAT!!!!!
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|I thought this movie was ok.  I wouldn't go so far as to say I liked it but I also wouldn't say I didn't like it.  That's why I gave it three stars.  Because, according to Amazon, three stars means &#34;it's okay.&#34;  I probably would have said &#34;it's okay&#34; would be two stars, &#34;I don't like it&#34; would be one star and &#34;I hate it&#34; would be no stars.  Why would we give any stars to something we hated.  When you were a kid and you failed a test did you get a star? No.  If you got anything it was a frowny face, crudely drawn in the margin in red ink, that served as cold confirmation that you were turning out to be an intellectual failure and a disappointment to your parents.  But I digress.  I feel like three stars is just too many stars for something that's only ok.  Then I guess three stars would be &#34;I like it&#34; and four stars would be &#34;I love it&#34; and maybe we could do away with the fifth star altogether.  I mean, do we really need a fifth star?  Who are we trying to impress here?  Rich Hollywood fat cats?  Siskel and Ebert only had two thumbs and they managed to impart their feelings regarding films just fine.  In summation, I give Amazon's rating system one star.  Also, the movie was ok.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|It was a cute movie....One that I probably won't watch again. The cutie pie actor is the only reason I finished watching the movie!
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|It has so many different tempos, its more the jam cd while the first one was the chill cd..love it!!!
B000DZIGE4|5.0|Touching in so many ways....made me sad though.<br />Great movie to watch to get a grasp on what is happening in the military.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|Lame. More of the same: static, motionless. Nobody wonders what there is out the prison, the rest of the country, where is the goberment, how everything got started...<br />I give up
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book may well be a &#34;women's book.&#34;  Loving flowers, being a mother, having empathy for children who are born into difficult family situations and being a &#34;sucker&#34; for a good love story made this book a quick read for me.  However, the more that my husband heard about the story as I was reading, the more sure he was that he would not enjoy it though he usually reads every book I read plus all of his books.
B00637D114|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. My son loves it! It is a great continuation of the Smurfs games we play on his Kindle Fire
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|It's very difficult to compete with the original productions on some of these iconic songs, so each DJ/Producer deserves some credit -- particularly those who tackle the MONSTER hits of Summer's repertoire -- on this Verve release, LOVE TO LOVE YOU DONNA CD.<br /><br />This is a mixed bag with some hitting with fresh re-imaginings of the classics, while others miss altogether. I'm going to review each song, which I never do, and those that are hits are ones that have been able to keep a sense of the original in tone and meaning, giving a fresh new take on each; the misses are going to be the ones that are so different that the song becomes obliterated in the remix, creating something else entirely. Here's my example of what I mean by hits: \\"You Keep Me Hanging On\\" remake by Kim Wilde -- although it was given the makeover treatment in the 80s, one could go back to the original done by The Supremes and still appreciate both, as they hit the same mark in stylistic choice/tone, approach, theme, even though musically they're from different genres. I know that covers aren't exactly the same as remixes, but I wanted you to understand my reasoning of what I think is a successful update.<br /><br />I'm also glad that one of the DJs decided on a lesser known song \\"Working The Midnight Shift,\\" which wasn't released as a single (I don't think) and on the [[ASIN:B000001FEE Once Upon a Time]] album.<br /><br />LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY -- HIT<br />This is a good re-imagining of the original keeping the moans and adding in electronic drum beats and embellishments, but never ruining the integrity of the song. The lyrics are intact, while the undercurrent keeps the original driving beats percolating throughout. This should be released as a single. In fact, I wish it was stretched out to the full 17+ minute version.<br /><br />DIM ALL THE LIGHTS -- MISS<br />This is so far off the mark it could be a different song completely. It is repetitive both with the small 4-word selection of lyrics and same inane cooing, along with the same 4 bars of music. This reminded me of the techno songs in the early 90s where one had to be rolling to enjoy what was incoherent to the sober.<br /><br />HOT STUFF -- MISS<br />This attempt just replaces the music track with another one, while keeping the vocals and lyrics intact. What you have is a competition between song and music and neither is the winner. It gets better towards the last quarter, but otherwise it's jarring, with the new musical track detracting from the vocals.<br /><br />I FEEL LOVE -- HIT<br />This is great, but it's mostly the original with the synth drums pumped way up, along with other artificial embellishments, but it retains the original flavor, sounding exquisitely refreshed especially with the choppy reverb on some parts of the lyrics, giving a real computerized and mechanical sound. It could be another successful single if released today.<br /><br />LOVE IS IN CONTROL (FINGER ON THE TRIGGER) -- HIT<br />This doesn't really sound new but it does sound like it could be part of an 80s movie soundtrack or something that could be done by the Scissor Sisters in present day. Sounds fresh and different than the original, but still retains the soul of the original.<br /><br />SUNSET PEOPLE -- HIT<br />This is another good update with added musical embellishments, taking out the original music track altogether, but retains the mood of the original, which I always heard as haunting and solemn. Lyrics are intact and it keeps the driving beat (albeit new -- almost like a counter beat?) with familiar sounds that link back to the original (namely the sound that sounds like a laser ray gun).<br /><br />WORKING THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT -- HIT/MISS<br />The original was somewhat melancholy and in a slower tempo and this presentation is faster and more lively, but still dark. This is a miss as far as updated Summer song because someone else is doing the vocals (Tiffany Roth), while retaining Summer's vocals on the bridge (high part), but I'm not even sure about that, so it's a hit as a cover version. I thought the vocals sounded way too different to be just a speeded up version of the original, so I looked at the credits.<br /><br />BAD GIRLS -- MISS<br />Here's another remix where the music is competing with the vocals, even though it starts off with a promising beat. I think the music sounds like a cross between the high energy/freeestyle 80s songs \\"Don Qichotte,\\" \\"Wake Up,\\" and \\"So Many Men, So Little Time,\\" all on [[ASIN:B000003Z9I TSR Retro Dance Classics]]. And the iconic \\"Toot, toot! Hey, beep, beep!\\" was left out until the very end, which is a let down.<br /><br />MACARTHUR PARK -- HIT<br />Updated musical embellishments, retains the original flavor, and has that big sound. The only thing missing would be the symphonic climax where the sound comes crashing down in the original; although this has the new improved build up, right at the moment of climax, it repeats rather than going over the top and cascading down. I don't even know how to put it in words, but fans of the original version will know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I FEEL LOVE -- MISS<br />This remix is not as good as track 4. It loses its hypnotic power of the original and just sounds like some one-hit wonder from the 90s. This sounds like a few bars were taken from an 90s existing song (Robin S's \\"Show Me Love) and then overlaid over the original vocals and some instrumentation from \\"I Feel Love.\\" The only time it actually gets good is when you only hear the original.<br /><br />ON THE RADIO -- MISS<br />Although this track starts off with a promising drum beat (like the intro to Taana Gardner's \\"Heartbeat\\"), it starts to get murky and the different tempos make it less successful than it could be. If the remix used only the extremely slow ballad version of the vocals, like in the movie [[ASIN:B00009OWJT Foxes]], which used the ballad as interludes between scenes, this would have been a blistering remix: updated, fresh, and still hauntingly beautiful as the original used in the movie.<br /><br />LAST DANCE -- HIT<br />Ironically the musical track added to the Oscar winning song sounds more like an updated version of \\"Boogie Oogie Oogie\\" by  [[ASIN:B0040U8XR8 Taste of Honey]]. Despite this pairing, the song actually works. The vocals are intact as well as the violins and surprisingly, though the music and vocals are at different tempos at the beginning, the track still works. The only complaint I can find about this track is the repetition of the lines \\"Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me,\\" which is repeated as a segment five times. But I guess it was to build up anticipation for the payoff.<br /><br />LA DOLCE VITA -- HIT<br />I've never heard this song before, so I'm not sure if it was a previously unreleased track, but I like it. It does sound like there's a filter used on her voice, so it has a slight computer/artificial sound to it, but it's still pretty good. The filter makes her sound a little like Nina Simone with higher octave and range.<br /><br />The CD presentation is less than stellar. There's no booklet and the liner notes are sparse to say the least, which are behind the CD on the cardboard case. No pictures included either. Universal should take a cue from BIG BREAK RECORDS that does incredible reissues with booklets, pictures etc., but I guess it's this division of Universal -- the Verve imprint -- because Hip-O Select does a decent job with the presentation of reissues and I believe they're also part of the Universal Music Group.<br /><br />These are not better than the original releases of these songs, nor do I think that was the goal of this CD. They are different and vary from interpretation to interpretation from DJ/Producer to DJ/Producer, and I believe that it was done more as a homage not only to Donna Summer, but also to Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellote. There's not a great DJ out there today who can say that they weren't inspiredor influenced by this team's contribution to dance music -- regardless of age or what genre they might be spinning now.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for the originals might I suggest either [[ASIN:B0000DZP5X Ultimate Collection]], 3-CD set which includes all of Summer's hits including those from different record labels and has the 12\\" version of \\"Love To Love (Baby)\\" (that was only available on the album) or [[ASIN:B00009U5J5 Bad Girls]], the deluxe 2-CD set includes the multi-platinum album \\"BAD GIRLS,\\" and features the demo version of title song. The second CD has the 12\\" (extended play) of the monster hits (this CD is basically remastered version of [[ASIN:B000001FKP The Dance Collection]] minus the song \\"With Your Love,\\" but includes 12-inch \\"Bad Girls\\" and \\"On The Radio\\" long version.<br /><br />I'm sure fans will already know this, but Universal Japan has released all of Summer's Casablanca albums on Mini-Album CDs with 24-bit remastering. The one I would definitely recommend from that lot is [[ASIN:B008861TWQ Live & More]]. This reissue includes the original album fold and the inclusion of the nearly 18-minute opus, \\"MacArthur Park Suite.\\" I bought mine from Amazon Japan, which was much cheaper (at the time) than buying as an import from Amazon USA, even with shipping.: updated, fresh, and still hauntingly beautiful as the original used in the movie.<br /><br />LAST DANCE -- HIT<br />Ironically the musical track added to the Oscar winning song sounds more like an updated version of \\"Boogie Oogie Oogie\\" by  [[ASIN:B0040U8XR8 Taste of Honey]]. Despite this pairing, the song actually works. The vocals are intact as well as the violins and surprisingly, though the music and vocals are at different tempos at the beginning, the track still works. The only complaint I can find about this track is the repetition of the lines \\"Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me,\\" which is repeated as a segment five times. But I guess it was to build up anticipation for the payoff.<br /><br />LA DOLCE VITA -- HIT<br />I've never heard this song before, so I'm not sure if it was a previously unreleased track, but I like it. It does sound like there's a filter used on her voice, so it has a slight computer/artificial sound to it, but it's still pretty good. The filter makes her sound a little like Nina Simone with higher octave and range.<br /><br />The CD presentation is less than stellar. There's no booklet and the liner notes are sparse to say the least, which are behind the CD on the cardboard case. No pictures included either. Universal should take a cue from BIG BREAK RECORDS that does incredible reissues with booklets, pictures etc., but I guess it's this division of Universal -- the Verve imprint -- because Hip-O Select does a decent job with the presentation of reissues and I believe they're also part of the Universal Music Group.<br /><br />These are not better than the original releases of these songs, nor do I think that was the goal of this CD. They are different and vary from interpretation to interpretation from DJ/Producer to DJ/Producer, and I believe that it was done more as a homage not only to Donna Summer, but also to Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellote. There's not a great DJ out there today who can say that they weren't inspiredor influenced by this team's contribution to dance music -- regardless of age or what genre they might be spinning now.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for the originals might I suggest either [[ASIN:B0000DZP5X Ultimate Collection]], 3-CD set which includes all of Summer's hits including those from different record labels and has the 12\\" version of \\"Love To Love (Baby)\\" (that was only available on the album) or [[ASIN:B00009U5J5 Bad Girls]], the deluxe 2-CD set includes the multi-platinum album \\"BAD GIRLS,\\" and features the demo version of title song. The second CD has the 12\\" (extended play) of the monster hits (this CD is basically remastered version of [[ASIN:B000001FKP The Dance Collection]] minus the song \\"With Your Love,\\" but includes 12-inch \\"Bad Girls\\" and \\"On The Radio\\" long version.<br /><br />I'm sure fans will already know this, but Universal Japan has released all of Summer's Casablanca albums on Mini-Album CDs with 24-bit remastering.

B007GE2H3G|4.0|I did not know much about this picture before watching it, so I had little expectations going into the experience. I was able to follow the plot, and it was engaging and clever, helping the story build nicely. I was pleased to be thrust into an ever-changing environment from a busy city square, to modern pirates, to an Arabic paradise. The Adventures of Tintin captured the kid in me for certain, and was an enjoyable plight. I can't say that I learned a great deal or had my views broadened in any sense, but there was no disappointment from this fun and exciting story of unlikely friends.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I am very happy with My Alarm Clock.  I can see it.  It shows which alarms are set.<br />I'm glad I got it!!<br /><br />It will be recommended to others.
0596805527|5.0|I've had an edition of the &#34;rhino book&#34; within reach since 1997.  In fact, it's the only javascript book I've kept and continue to reference.  It's a must-have for any web developer and these days those that are using javascript off the browser as well.  It covers pretty much everything you could need to know and then some.  Some reviews had made complaints about it covering too much, for instance indicating things that don't work in older browsers or showing possible polyfills for missing es5 functionality.  It's true that it provides a lot of depth that some may find superfluous, but personally I find this valuable as it gives me greater insights into the functioning of the language for making more informed decisions and believe it or not there are still some large client's out there that can't seem to upgrade past IE7 (ehem, you know who you are!).  There are plenty of other books out there that will happily serve those wanting a concise jump-start but one will keep coming back to this book over and over.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|It's is nice for the money, but I would not recommend it for larger cameras. I would say DSLRs and super zoom cameras would need a bigger case.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Had me stuck a few times. I did have to turn off the music after a while. Good game to pass the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome. I just hate that you can't go to the ender world<br />. Still please buy it is so worth 7 cash. Buy now.
B00B3YDOGO|4.0|Gone Girl was our book club selection.  Most of the women in the club were offended by the rough language and therefore hated the book.  I spent the last eight years that I worked as a school counselor with at-risk teenagers, so the rough language, and over use of the &#34;f&#34; word wasn't too offensive to me.  The reason I sent the book on to my son was that I felt he should know that women like the main character exist, and he, and all eligible males, should become acquainted with women who follow these patterns of behavior.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It has been 48 hours now since I finished Allegiant, I purposely delayed my review so as not to come across as another angry ex-fan.<br /><br />I personally was very disappointed with the sloppy writing in this book.  As stated in multiple other reviews the switch in POV was extremely confusing.  I am very familiar with two POV having read Gone Girl just a few months previously. In Gone Girl you knew instantly who was narrating, however, in Allegiant it was very confusing because apparently Tris and Tobias have the same internal dialogue and thought process.  I can't even count how many times I had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter so I could figure out whose brain I was in at the moment.<br /><br />The story moves VERY slow. I loved all the action in Divergent and Insurgent but Allegiant just seemed to drag. The genetic purity stuff made no sense whatsoever. The Purity Wars, really? And how many serums can there possibly be, death serum, memory serum, simulation serum, how about give me a break serum? It seems like Roth was just grabbing at words and created a mess not a masterpiece.<br /><br />What happened to Marcus and Evelyn? Did they eat a little too much of Amity's bread? They just give up all they have worked for without a fight? Seems rather doubtful.<br /><br />The deaths in this book made no sense. Tori?! Uriah?! I won't mention the big one in case you haven't read the book yet.  I have to admit I enjoy a good death scene a la Rue in The Hunger Games but none of the deaths in Allegiant seemed to make sense. The one that did make some sense was killed in such a bizarre out of character way as to make it senseless.<br /><br />I don't know what happened with Roth between Insurgent and Allegiant but this book was not good and I am very disappointed! I do plan on seeing the movies, unlike a lot of other fans. I am hoping and praying that the screenwriter for Allegiant can tighten up the plot and the fans will finally have their satisfying ending since Roth has stated in multiple interviews she is very satisfied with her ending.<br /><br />I personally recommend reading the first two books and skipping the last. It isn't worthy of your time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I like a good book that you just can't put down.  To me it has to be easy to read and none of that drama queen stuff.  This was one of those books.  It had a satysfying ending, which is also a big problem with some authors - they might write books that are real page turners but the end leaves you feeling deflated - like you just lost all that time looking forward to finding out how it all turns out for nothing because maybe it didn't all turn out.  This book had a wonderful ending.  It had closure.  I liked it so much that I have purchased 4 more of her books and I am enjoying all of them!!!
B00C83QYIE|4.0|so silly to even comment on yet another internet troll with NO LIFE except to gripe, whine & make over the top negative remarks! Internet troll anthony morelli...NO ONE CARES what you have to say about the great & awesome Sarah Brightman's Dreamchaser cd!! Have seen over 140 concerts...a don't miss event...absolutely amazing...three standing ovations(about 6300 people). What I might pay to have a 5 minute face-to-face with internet troll anthony morelli!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very fun and addicting :) The only downfall is the energy time u have to wait to get more,,,,, gayyyt
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This was bought for the wife's second kindle. Her first kindle has a nice leather case but this new HDX kindle is so light that she uses it without a case. She loves it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Decent story,  fun to read. Hot scenes,  so that's always a bonus...  Looking forward to the last installment of this series!
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Absolutley or of the best movies out there right now.  Great concept. Great story. Awesome battles and a great soundtrack.  This is a must see movie!
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|Some of the games are challenging and interesting. Some seem ridiculously difficult.  Some just don't seem to work well. There is a color recognition game that may require you to pick if something is grey or silver. Really hard to tell on screen. Or choose if the color is blue and dark blue, I'm an artist and I'm not scoring well on that.<br />Also, what is 90/30 x 5? I get 15 but the math game says 150. Hmmmm.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed everything about this book with the exception of the end and some of the obviously forced romance between Tris and Tobias. Nothing felt natural about their relationship in some scenes. It felt like Roth was trying to fit it in to make the readers happy. Maybe she should have put more effort into a logical ending.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|outstanding and so simiar to  today with the president trying to help some unfortunate people and the teajits trying everything to defeat him
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I found the characters and story of The Art of Racing in the Rain real, relateable, and poignant. As other reviews say, the book is told through the eyes and mind of a dog who has attained the mental facilities of a human. If you cannot get past that aspect of the story, then this book is simply not for you. If you have the imagination to suspend your disbelief, then read-on.<br /><br />Having no prior interest in this book other than it was recommended by a server while I was eating lunch at a CPK in Pleasanton, CA, I was completely surprised and pleased to depart from my normal diet of sci-fi and fantasy.<br /><br />Without spoilers, our narrator, Enzo the dog, observes his family interactions and relates different events to his love of racing. I couldn't care much less about racing (either human- or machine-powered) so I was skeptical about picking this book off the shelf. Once I did, I was so very pleased I set aside my prejudices.<br /><br />Some will call this book emotion porn, and I agree to some point. The story is certainly written to evoke intense emotions. I also feel that real life can be equally emotional and I think the milestones of the story are also very well-told. One of the most profound ideas in this book is \\"your car goes where your eyes go\\". It makes sense when you read the story. I don't think anyone should read too much into the ideas of The Art of Racing in the Rain, but consider them as reinforcement of good mental exercises.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love, love, love it! It's really great to be able to get my books on my Galaxy Note. I enjoy reading when I travel and this is perfect.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So much more user friendly than my tv's smart controls. Using my Nexus 7 (2013) and gs3 for Netflix and YouTube is just awesome.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved loved it!!! Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and so erotic. So great
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive game but some levels are quite frustratingly difficult. Graphics are bright and thankfully you can turn off the music.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I keep reading the negative reviews and seeing a lot of great points.<br /><br />Tris and Four were some of the only developed characters in the book, which is why they were the main characters.  There was more going on in the world outside and this book that applied to each character and therefore, showed their different viewpoints, plus added the whole relationship element that made it for some.<br /><br />People complained about revolutions and how they were so repetitive. The reasons there are so many revolutions is because history repeats itself over and over again.  And the only way to change that is to do something different, instead of doing it the same way and expecting different results.<br /><br />People said that the 'voice' of this book was lost.  This book wasn't about doing something different than your parents, like the first book.  This book wasn't about a trying to figure out who you are, like the second book.  This book was about accepting the path you chose and seeing how they fit into the bigger scheme of things.<br /><br />In conclusion about this book.  I thought it was a well thought out book that ended as it should have.  The reason I enjoyed these books is because each had a unique voice that had a theme growing as a person.  Which has external and internal forces.  What Tris did was what she believed was right, not what everybody else thought.  She lived her life how she wanted and not in the fear of others approval.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|Im really satisfied with it. The box, the poster, everything looks great. I really like the extra stuff. Absolutely love it.
1476727651|5.0|This is for hardcore and casual fan alike.  The story is half Danny Torrance and half (new-comer) Abra Stone. It's got some strong, scary visuals, but the iconic hotel (blown up in the original) is nowhere to be found.
1476727651|5.0|I would recommend Doctor Sleep to all Stephen King fans who liked The Shining.  It is a spellbinding supernatural story of Danny Torrance all grown up but still dealing with the shining and creatures out to destroy him.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|You will want to hold this one in your hands. Buy it and read it carefully and give it to someone you like for Xmas. Actually, you will want to keep it, so you have it on hand so you can give it to someone spontaneously. You will have to buy more copies for Xmas and birthday gifts.  This book is a joy to read, a joy to have and a joy to give.  It is lovely. Not a profound exploration of the life of someone with autism, and via this of the human condition. But an empathetic view of the world as seen through the eyes a someone at the high-functioning end of the spectrum - and a wonderful portrayal of him as seen by other people. The author has done his research, but treats his topic lightly and lovingly, through humour. The ending is possibly a bit schmaltzy, but I don't see how this story could have finished in any other way. This is a feel-good book, a clever, insightful, beautifully written and very funny feel-good book, and it would be a betrayal of the genre and more importantly of the reader to end it in any other way.
