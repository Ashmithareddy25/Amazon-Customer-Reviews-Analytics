B003Z2LAAO|4.0|Good tape not only exciting to watch but also good educational tape.<br />I will recommend to anyone to buy this tape.
034580404X|5.0|I read this book twice and will go back and read it a gain thank you please let me know when the sequels are out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I<br /> I find this game very relaxing,therapeutic and addictive. I play just before nodding off if that is ok to say¡
1451695195|4.0|The only complaint I had about the book (and many other life-after-death descriptions) is that so little of it is spent trying to explain what was seen or experienced in the after-life realm.  I think the argument about consciousness not being a result of the biological process is extremely convincing.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was unsure of this book at first just because it was written in the dogs point of view, but I am so happy that I decided to give it a chance! What a sweet story.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is easy to figure out how to play with increasingly difficult levels which equals addiction. You find yourself saying &#34;just one more level&#34;. Anyone who loves Angry Birds will also love this.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|For those of us who are Pendergast fans, this is a terrific book. It answers so many questions about many things regarding Pendergast's past, how his was killed and much more. It also introduces two new characters related to Pendergast that undoubtedly will appear in future Preston and Child books involving Aloysuis Pendergast and his remarkable skills and life. For Pendergast fans this is a must read. For those looking for a great read that pulls you from page to page with a great detective character with deep substance, this is for you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love this website...I wish it were around when I was planning my wedding.  I only wish I had time to do all the projects I find on here.

B0081SPK0I|5.0|this game beings back so many memories. it also takes up less space than most racing games. very easy to use. good controls.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|loved the book Always enjoy Jo Nesbo books. This was particulalry thrilling and held my attention all the way through
B006TTC5JK|4.0|Not only is this a timeless classic, it comes with a with 2 discs plus a digital download.<br />  I was disappointed that this did not come with any of the 100th anniversary booklets or similar objects like other universal titles (like 'all quiet on the western front') and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  The price was the same as the rest and yet it came with less.<br /><br />  As the movie goes.  Jimmy Stewart makes anyone who watches this movie want to either be a better person or just makes you happy to think there could be someone like that.  It is a hilarious play on everyone thinking that the best person on earth must be insane just because he sees a 6 foot tall white rabbit.  His kindness, sincerity, and overall goodness sets him apart from everyone else and everyone wants to change him because it is not normal.<br />  Elwood (Jimmy Stewart's character) is pleased to help anyone and creates hilarious moments that are timeless.<br /> I insist any student of mine that shows interest in film to watch this and the ones that have, have come back in love with the movie and love to talk about it.<br /><br />  this is a great set for any enthusiast.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun because u coherently want to play it. the only bad thing is it says there are 101 games there and there is but it really.hard to gain enough coins to get all the games unlocked!!!!!!

034580404X|5.0|If you are going to ready Fifty Shades of Grey, you might as well by the Trilogy all at once.. as you wont be able to put it down until you have finished every single book.. look forward to see who is going to star in the movie version, could  be quite interesting!
B004UID2LC|5.0|great for the tablet. works fine. easy to click and watch no crashing either of app. recommended for download to tablet

B005PR2FD8|5.0|Tekken is one of my favorite video games and in the 90's the first movie &#34;Tekken&#34; came out and was awesome as a drawn cartoon video. This movie is so awesome, the characters look so real and the story goes right along with the Tekken games.  GET IT!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A book that makes you take a hard look at life and it's choices in a charming way. I couldn't put it down.
0486266885|5.0|This thin little book should not intimidate the early teen from experiencing this classic!  My 13 yo read it on the plane home.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|You can only switch from creative to survival.That is pretty helpful though because if you are creative mode and switch to survival after building a house or something you can use those materials.
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. My dad and I watch it together at least once a year. I love Anthony Hopkins character.
030758836X|5.0|I love the way Gillian writes. I really disliked the people in this story and hated the ending! It kept me reading!!
B008RYN44U|4.0|I enjoyed this album, but it seems to be lacking something.  Perhaps I built it up too much?  Regardless, I do like it and it will be playing in my car for months.  A must buy for No Doubt fans!
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Its a Very funny movie. Bought for someone as a christmas gift and wished I would have picked myself one up.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I thought it would be hard to top his previous cd, but Adam has done so!  A perfect mix of pop dance hits and hard hitting, soulful ballads.  Loving every minute of it!
B002MJV75O|3.0|Love this show but the music is not the same as the original. Found a box set later that is smaller and cheaper.
0345803485|3.0|The Fifty Shades trilogy is like an adult version of the Twilight series with the same plot(or almost a plot) that makes you all mushy and gooey (and here-a little more). While I like books where the overprotective boyfriend is saved from his loneliness by the clumsy and innocent girlfriend who is completely unaware of her ravenous beauty, I was disappointed to go through 1000 pages of nothing more.<br /><br />What astounded and resonated with me throughout the book was this one thought- what about stamina?I know it's fiction and it's meant to be over the top but really, there has got to be some semblance of reality. I thought by the end of the book she might have to go to the hospital for being burnt out- I know I was a bit burnt out simply reading it.<br /><br />While this book is a good way to get cozy and go wild with your fantasies, for anyone looking at something fast paced and thrilling- it's a disappointment. For women who are going to go nuts about it I'd say- do enjoy it but do not raise your expectations and get confused with reality<br /><br />I am grateful for the insights on certain lifestyles and mindsets but this book does not bowl me over.<br /><br />PS- I had a feeling that the author really likes Grey Anatomy. To base this in Seattle and have an african-american doc named \\"Dr.Bratley\\", I think she and I might hi-five on this one!
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|Was so happy when they released this on blu ray. Love the halloween series. The colors and sound make the movie look almost brand new.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I thought Suzanne Collins was such an amazing writer! I didn't want to put down the book! She wrote with such intensity. I do wish I knew what happened with Gale. He was just cut off at a current point. Even though it says he got a good job in district 2, I wish it told more about what he had become or about returning to Katniss. I am only 11 and it made me think about so much. It made me cry in some parts because it was so sad, but over all I loved this book. I have read all three and loved them.
B005KA188S|2.0|Movie is dragged out and poorly written story line. Nothing like the original. I would consider this a b movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my girl loves this game . Where can i find more like this ? Is alot of fun ...keeps her playings for hours
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Been playing since May. Customer service is awesome. Game initially buggy, but love this game.<br />I feel that ice age the game is simple, enjoyable for all ages.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Really really great book! I highly recommend this book. I love it so much.can't wait to read the next book!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I read The 4-Hour Body first and loved Tim's concepts of minimal effort for maximum results.  It was genius to use this basic mindset to learn everything from a language to having better sex. The 4-Hour Chef is fantastic as well.  I bought it on my Kindle and will be purchasing the hard copy for better reference capabilities.  Tim is positive, down to earth; just seemingly a very real guy with a great sense of humor.  This book is also going to be a great gift for my brothers as there's something in this book for just about everyone, from cooking to hunting to surviving in the wild.  I can't say enough about this book or it's author.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|I loved this book. It was so amazing and interesting and awesome. I loveeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddd it. It was the best book I've ever read.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|This movie was a waste of an hour and 50 minutes.  The story line is stupid.  Good thing I did not pay for it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book! It made me smile and it made me cry! One of the best books I've ever read!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I use this in conjunction with P90X. I have to do the ab portion of P90X at night for time constraints so I add the 7.5 random workout to that from Daily Ab Workout plus some knee ups and leg ups on the chin up bar. This is straight forward and kinda robotic but exactly what I wanted!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been reading fantasy books for 15 years.  Elfs, orks, dragons and all the other races. I was searching for something new.  A breath of fresh air. Wool has rubbed me the right way I can breath
B009AMANBA|2.0|There is a critical and individual rush to praise this film, as if  the topic and enormous star power (of Spielberg, Kushner and well-known actors) have guaranteed that it is a masterpiece.  Far from it, in my humble opinion.  First, the direction provides no pacing, is self-indulgent and engages in far too many  loooong shots of scenes or faces when nothing is happening.  I had to keep reminding myself that this was done by Steven Spielberg but it did not match any of his earlier and justifiably praised work.  Second, the writing is just plain poor.  Tony Kushner made some decisions on emphasis, comments and other aspects that do nothing but add ponderousness and length to the film.  Third, while I've admired Daniel Day-Lewis in other work, here he doesn't act, doesn't emote and mumbles most of his lines.  An acting Oscar?  No way.  And I wouldn't vote for the person who glued on his whiskers or created his wig either - both patently unreal-looking.  There are far too many other characters; with all the costumes, various wig styles and incoherent script it is much too difficult to figure out who is who and doing what.  Tommy Lee Jones is identifiable but having the camera focus on the crags in his face does not equal acting.<br /><br />It all reminds me of the emperor's new clothes - people look at the naked emperor and see what they expect to see:  that he is clothed and bedecked.  In fact, he is naked.  The film, while not naked, is overlong, poorly directed and written and a bore.<br /><br />Kudos to Mr. Masloski, above, for writing such an excellent and accurate analysis of the film, showing the many technical mistakes that help make this so much less than it could have been.<br /><br />Disappointing.
0062206044|5.0|I think these books are fascinating and I think that kids will like to read like I do .  this book is about 3 kids miserable life and living with relatives that die because an awful guy kills them well murders them . he just wants the fortunes.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely beautiful book. Completely heart wrenching and gave me butterflies and tears all throughout. I could not put it down, finished  in two days.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book was really good.  Palacio did a great job describing everything through different perspectives.  I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it for anyone looking for a good book to read.
B0049J0CTM|1.0|The movie played perfectly, but the volume was way too quiet in the quiet parts of the movie and way too loud at other times. I know it's not our sound system because we play other movies with no problem
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was incredible to me. I really enjoyed it:) this is one of my best books I ever read \\"in my opinion\\"
B004SDEP38|1.0|This product refused to work. I tried to save my word documents onto this product many times and it forced closed every single time and would not at all. I hope that the customer service is able to help with this issue or that the creators improve the reliability of this product. Bye.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works quite well on my Samsung Galaxy S2, and I have been using it for several months.  It presents lots of useful information about remaining battery life, sorted by activity type.  It also indicates remaining time needed ro charge by both AC and USB.  it even includes the health of the battery.  Very useful.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie has convinced me to try a whole foods diet.  Its not a perfect documentary, but I think everyone will be glad they saw it (and surprised by what they learn), so I'm giving 5 stars.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book...solid story..heartwarming......... ...... .... ... .. ... ....... ... ............... .... ....... .. ..... ................ .. .. .. ..
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|its a remake of the old classic, the visuals are better and the story a little more detailed in my opinion. the show later deviates further from the original story but in a good way. but 1.11 pretty much stays right on course with the first few episodes of the original. im really enjoying this reboot to the series and i expect all fans of the original will too. Amazon delivered a quality item quickly, and at a more then fair price
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love trying to find various artists and songs with this app.  I just downloaded it and it is already one of my favorite apps!  You can lose hours on this one!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.It had very brand details.I would prefer a more detailed ending,like how they lived three months after she came home.But it was very good.Maybe you can do another fantasy one like this?
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I am always drawn to 1930's period films.  The portrayals of simpler times and morality fascinate me.  The settings, wardrobes, and autos in this movie are spectacular, and the story is compelling.  Glad I viewed it, and I highly recommend to all who enjoy recreations of the 1930's.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is really an amazing read. I was so intrigued and interested in this book, I could barely take my eyes off of it! Anyone interested should DEFINITELY give it a try!
0525952926|5.0|WINTER WORLD, the second of Ken Follet's century trilogy, is as good as the first, FALL OF GIANTS...hard to put down once you begin.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fun book with a nicely evolved plot and a bit of mystery, too.  Quick read for beside the fire with a coffee.
081299471X|5.0|Although when the first story breaks abruptly and made me wonder if part of the book was missing, the marioska effect of the stories was intriguing.  It also created a more emphatic closure of the overall story.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Good enough to eat. I'll be looking to buy the pro version As soon as I master the free one.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Never downloaded on my kindle!  Said it was corrupted!  So I don't have it on anywhere on my kindle!! hmm
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I am giving this movie 3 stars because I was expecting more.  I am a fan of both Depp and Burton and really enjoy their collaborations.  This one was just not what I was expecting.  There were many places they started down an interesting path and then just dropped the ball.  In my opinion it was trying to be a comedy and a horror movie, but missed both paths completely.  Maybe if it had picked one and used all its energy in that direction, it would have made a better impression.  I can not honestly say it was bad, but I can't say it was good either.  If you have 2 hours to kill, it will do the trick and not give you nightmares.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I have read many of Michael Connelly's books and this one did not measure up to the other ones. Mabe it was because they were short stories. Perhaps the short story does not give enough time to build an interesting foundation and finish.
1400069289|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year.  Insight into how people, organizations, businesses, and societies are governed by habitual patterns--which can be changed with the right combination of factors. I appreciated both the analysis as well as the prescriptions for how changes can be made at every level of life.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This show is full of surprises and wow... Wouldn't it be great if there would such persons???!!! the world would be a much better place.
B00821OUT6|2.0|The acting is poor, the special effects are B quality, the dialog is below average, and the pacing can best be compared to continental drift.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|I love the show and the cd showed up on time and perfect.  The show is slowing down quite a bit, wish they went back to God and Devil again....
145162607X|3.0|Loved the first half. It was tough  to keep the characters straight; second half dragged.  Not up to her usual standards.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I love the movie as soon as I saw the preview.  I love love love love love love love it!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This one will pull on  your heart strings. I get goose bumps every time I hear those lions all roar. Great animation and great story. My daughter has watched it so many times she knows all the words.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I love this movie- brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan and spectacular in every way- animation, set,  character development, storyline, etc.<br /><br />HOWEVER, my cousin ordered this for me for Christmas, and...  I kind of ended up with the Canadian Version.  As in, this version:  [...]<br />So I don't know what that's about, but hey, it still works.  Same film, just bilingual packaging.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Special affects, beautiful men,  okay storyline. I'm a big halloween fan and this is the greatest movie ever. And Hugh Jackman  can eat crackers in my bed any day. What a hottie.
1594488886|5.0|Wow! What an amazing story! I've read it twice and I find myself honking about it randomly throughout the day sometimes. I loved Kite runner, but this is my favorite book right now and I recommend it to everyone!
B00005N5S2|4.0|This movie, starring Gregory Peck, follows the military career of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur from early 1942 during the fall of the Phillipines to his relief by President Harry Truman in 1951. Very little of his personal life is covered and the movie focuses on a small period of time in his career.<br /><br />Gregory Peck gives a fine, professional performance in his role as MacArthur and the movie itself is well-acted and directed in general. Locations, special effects, cinematography and score are all quite good.<br /><br />The movie itself gives a portrayal of MacArthur as both brilliant military commander and vainglorious ego. The movie, while not especially fair to MacArthur, at least does allow the viewer to see his military brilliance and hear his often brilliant oration. The movie recounts MacArthur's use of \\"island hopping\\" strategy to cut off and isolate significant Japanese forces rather than fight them at a high cost in casualties. MacArthur is presented as essentially a \\"benevolent dictator\\" during the postwar occupation of Japan. The DVD moves on to Korea where MacArthur's Inchon invasion is a brilliant and bold operational move which is negated by the Chinese invasion - which everyone, not just MacArthur, didn't see coming.<br /><br />The best scenes in the film are when Gregory Peck is able to convey the deep emotions of MacArthur at beginning and end of the movie speaking to cadets at West Point, coming ashore at Leyte and addressing the Fillipino people he loved as well as his visit to a POW camp for a long-awaited reunion with survivors of the \\"Death March\\" and a tearful reunion with Gen. Wainwright.<br /><br />The movie handles his conflict with and eventual relief by President Harry Truman in the standard fashion - which is to say, overwhelmingly from the Truman point of view. Truman was often vindictive and petty, relieving the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld in 1948 over public disagreement regarding naval budget cuts. He even demanded the resignation of his own Secretary of Defense over a minor issue. Truman could tolerate little to no disagreement and often acted rashly in temper tantrums.<br /><br />Although the movie presents events in a less than fair fashion, the movie itself is not completely one-sided and it is certainly a well-made and acted film. I give this DVD four stars.ts. He even demanded the resignation of his own Secretary of Defense over a minor issue.

B008WCP2PG|4.0|Channing Tatum makes the whole stupid movie worth watching.  Matthew McConaughey almost makes the whole movie unwatchable.  Don't watch it for the story line or the acting - watch it for the manskin!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The kids downloaded this to their Kindles and they had problems learning how to play.  They are 8 and 11.  For older kids.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What a sale - we hadn't yet bought the last one and my daughter lost one of the earlier films; it would have cost more for those two than it did for the whole set - and it's great to have them all in one small package.

B002VHI8J0|4.0|I've just finished this book and it's one of the best crafted narratives I've read in a long time.<br />The way six independent and completely different stories come together to make a whole is absolutely amazing. I especially enjoyed the positive messages conveyed, messages that mean that a positive, fair, free world is worth fighting for.<br />I must admit that the language in some parts is difficult to understand especially for a non native English speaker and that's the main reason why I rated it four stars.
0545265355|5.0|These books are well-written and captivating.  I couldn't put them down until I was done with all 3 of them.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Where can you get more hours of great classic fiction for $0.99?  I'm 95% through reading this collection and dreading reaching the end.  It has provided so many hours of wonderful entertainment that finishing it will be like attending the funeral of a best friend!  The navigation could be improved, but what do you expect for $0.99?  Besides that, just start at the beginning and read to the end.  Everything in it is worth reading!
B00633W614|5.0|Read a preview of Jeffrey Archer via Kindle, ordered the first one, enjoyed it and really like the second book, too!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Overall, I enjoyed Ted but the humor got to be old. Obviously, a movie about a talking Teddy Bear is a stretch in itself, but there was also a pretty lame attempt at a story line. I could have taken 30 minutes of the humor without a story line, but it got to be too much and too predictable.
B005LAII1C|5.0|My husband and i laughed through the whole movie!  We had it playing on christmas morning with family  and they were laughing too
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For a freebie, this is a great app.  The keys are sensitive to the touch; but not too sensitive. The screen is easy to see and the product has abilities far above my ability to use.  I really like this one!  It is a keeper!
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|SAVE your money, this movie is a bomb!  It bears no resemblance to the original starring &#34;Ahnawd&#34;.  A thin plot with horrible acting and bad special effects.  It's too bad I can't recall my money back into my wallet...
B004T4LUPW|3.0|After reading the web site for this product I was really impressed with the available pages, etc.  But I am not a computer guru and I don't have an android phone.  I am trying to get in touch with the company to get some assistance, but I am not optimistic of my chances.  If it works like it says it will and I can use it with my limited equpment and knowledge, it is a five star product.  But for me at this early stage, I struggle to give it a three star rating.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hilarious and fun for everyone to read. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book, a real page turn er. Very unexpected,lots of twist and turns to this book.  Was not able to predict the plot.
0439882826|5.0|Though kids will love it too, just have to be careful as it is fragile. The light up light sabers were a great touch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I picked this book to read because of the film. I love reading books, then watching the movie, and then comparing the two. I hope the movie is as great as the book was!!!
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I decided to purchase this particular cover for my Kindle Fire because I wanted one that would keep it secure and protected.  This fills those requirements.<br />I would readily recommend this to anyone that wants a protective zippered Kindle cover.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am 57 years old and do not read romance novels, ever. If this is a romance novel I have missed out. I kept falling asleep but would wake up and try to read more. I have not read a book non stop like this since The Thornbirds. I guess I have read a romance novel! I had to wait to finish it in the morning. I recommend this to anyone who reads. Really enjoyed it. I snickered a couple of times at the wit of the characters but it was not so mushy that I cried. I just might check out her others.
B00004XQ83|4.0|I really wanted to get the CD.  I still love all the songs.  They just don't have quite the same impact as when heard in the theater where I assume they had surround sound.  I have a Bose.  And, of course, the movie has the very loud volume.  No regrets.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Probably listened to it 5 times already. Have it playing while playing Eve Online, another excellent purchase.<br /><br />The stuff directly out of the movie is total GOLD, ok yeah all of it is, but.. As in the songs sung by the Dwarves at Bilbo's house are just so well done. If you liked the other LoTR films music scores, get this one.<br /><br />More from Howard Shore = win.  Only thing better probably would be Shore and John Williams.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for my wife. She likes Rod Stward and she is very happy with it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The story line follows a logical sequence.  Characters from prior novels were further developed.  The concept of cyber warfare was developed at a fast pace.  Really gave a challenging look at future conflict.  Well done!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I heard about the trilogy on TV and bought the kindle version. I finished this book in 3.days and couldn t wait to read the rest of them.
1440503257|5.0|I love collecting recipes and this book is wonderful!  It has a lot of the foods that are featured in the movies and books.  It has extras as well that people from &#34;across the pond&#34; would eat.  The only recipe it didn't have in it was Butterbeer.  But that's ok, because I found a great recipe for Butterbeer on Facebook one day.  If you love Harry Potter and you love trying new recipes, or just love to bake or cook, this is a wonderful addition to anyones cookbook collection.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all 3 books of the trilogy. I highly recommend it. It was ver entertaining. Loved the history wrapping after so much adventure
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I found this to be a good read. It had a very interesting perspective! I also loved the characterisation of this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I like John Grisham books and this one is no exception.  Did not have a clue what the ending would be
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app, because I have no problem downloading free music. I always use this because I know it has no issues or glitches.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This keeps  me with insomnia &amp; my son who has ADHD &amp; daughter who is autistic asleep until the alarm goes off. But we have to turn it off in order to start our day because if we don't, we would never get out of bed. This will be hooked up to an surround sound soon. Hope you all enjoy it as well.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Having loved the first two I was fully expecting the same from this third installment. But, unfortunately this is one of those films where they are really attempting to outdo the others and make it spectacular. They proceeded to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, but then what the hell they threw that in too. Poor plot, poor story telling; very disappointing. Then to end with Disney's: \\"And they lived happily ever after,\\" was just too much. I wish they had never made this one. It left a bad taste in my mouth.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|A reasonable heir to the series but the least of the four. Cool beginning but by the end of the protracted final chase scene I had had enough. There was not a conclusive ending - nothing complete.Can anybody come up with an original chase scene.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I remember sitting in the theater to see The Muppet Movie and seeing this hilarious film trailer and thinking that I absolutely couldn't wait to see it.  I see so many cartoons that it is a joy to find one that truly appeals to both adults and children.  It is also fun to find one that isn't so dark.  The recent trend with the princess movies is sad (Princess and the Frog and Brave both at times being downright scary) and so I'm always looking for a FUN film to watch with my daughters.  Well, we never got around to seeing this in the theaters, but last night we snuggled up on the couch to take it all in, and I'm so happy that we did.<br /><br />This was hilarious!<br /><br />The Pirates! Band of Misfits tells the story of The Pirate Captain, a simple minded man who captains a ship that is, well, not all there.  His ship his falling apart, his crew is week and incompetent, his parrot is fat and in a society where the more feared you are the more important you are seen, The Pirate Captain is only worth 12 doubloons.  Still, The Pirate Captain is hopeful of becoming Pirate of the Year.  He applies and then sets off on an adventure to find a lot of booty.<br /><br />But he hits a snag when he meets Charles Darwin and finds out that his fat parrot is anything but a parrot, but is the long thought extinct Dodo Bird.  What happens next is pure hilarity.<br /><br />The Claymation process is astonishing and so much fun to watch, and the progression of story is great.  It never grows tired because each additional slice of storyline feels intended and fresh.  I couldn't stop laughing, and the visual gags are met each step of the way with smart humor.  The plaque cards are a great touch and the pirate humor is golden.  Nothing feels wasted or unnecessary.  The voice work is superb, with Hugh Grant and David Tennant taking the cake.<br /><br />At the end of the day, these misfits hit it out of the park!
0308102282|5.0|Very good self help book to help you see things clearer and be happier!  I love Dyer!  He is an excellent literary communicator.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|have not finished the novel  Very interesting  Cdertainly the view of the unions and the capitalists can be related to todays problems.  Somethings just never change  The earth just keeps turning and we face the same problems in a different era.
B007THA4FI|3.0|What an odd book!  The adolescent characters are fully formed; the adults are all cartoon characters.  The adolescents, wounded and noble and confused, enjoy full humanity while the adult characters are predictable, boring, and soulless.  The theme seems to be a rant against materialism, racism, and class warfare in the English towns and villages, and some of the details and vocabulary probably resonate best with an English reader.  To my eye, however, this is an poor-to-average effort by a talented writer - a lack of nuance and sloppy character development.  Are we to conclude that anyone over the age of 19 does not deserve anything but cardboard cut-out development in a novel?  Odd.  Seems like so much more could have been done with some guidance by a good editor.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|IT TOOK ALMOST A MONTH GETTING FROM HONGKONG,BUT  IT WORKS GREAT BUT THERE IS NO BRAND NAME ON IT WHAT SO EVER
B005K17RU0|5.0|The title says it all. and its free what more could you ask for from a weather application.<br />Thank you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The author's subtle manipulation of the characters was masterfully done. I would begin to dislike a character, only to realize a few chapters later that I'd been mistaken in my judgement,  then after another chapter or so, my opinion may change again. This story had more twists and turns than a cool ride at Disney World.
0316067598|5.0|Great account of a SEAL teams action in combat.  Caution about strong language and gory details, but a great read.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|La coleccion esta barbara. Los vinilos son de primera y la edicion es de lujo. No falta nada. Los insert dentro de Sgt. Pepper´s igual a los de 1967. Con El Album Blanco y Gira MAgica pasa lo msmo.<br />Es imperdible!!!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|totally enjoyed this movie, but I would highly recommend watching Captain America, then Thor, before watching this one. Everything you look for in an action movie including great one liners, epic final battle. My wife even liked it! I only wish Natalie Portmans character was in it
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great deal. You get all movies in Blu-ray format and a production booklet as an added bonus. I loved it. Arrived here on time:)
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This is a good sized camera bag.  Room for the camera, and for any accessories I want to take along. . .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably my favorite book Nicholas Sparks has written yet! It's a wonderful love story with a warm twist. READ!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|MY BEAUTICIAN RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK.  IT TOOK ME  A YEAR BEFORE I READ IT.  THIS IS A GREAT BOOK.  THE RESEACH WAS EXTRAORDINARY!!!!!!!!!
0553384775|1.0|BS. This is a poorly written, corny, macho,and a far fetched fairy tale. The author seems to have suffered long term effects from his self described drug use and most likely imagined most of this piece of pulp fiction.<br /><br />One of the worst books I have ever read, bar none. This book is not entertaining in the least.<br /><br />Two thumbs down.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I can't connect on my kindle :( I play on my phone, my computer... but no love on the kindle...
B004EKCNMA|2.0|The movie theatrics was good, but was ruined by inaudible dialog and unbalance sound levels. It was maddening - I would raise the volume in order to hear the characters, and then an enormous boom would nearly blow my eardrum out. Or, simply background noise would drown out the dialog, and there was nothing I could do at that point. Disappointing.<br /><br />(The movie was watched using Amazon streaming - perhaps they don't have the bugs worked out yet.)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Simply an awesome book. Excited about the movie coming out in February and glad I finished the book before it does
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this because its a mix up on angry birds and I love angry birds and its also a creativity game and I love art. the best thing about this game is THE PIGS in angry birds my favrite character is the pigs by jaylyn magruder
B0076DELIG|3.0|This one was hard to get into, for me.  I can't muster great enthusiasm for the characters.  Slow....a bit plodding..,and not quite up to his usual standard.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|it was not predictable. it kept me guessing constantly. i felt personally invested in the film because of the believablity of the acting. i felt my heart racing, frantically wondering if they would make it out. while the beginning is a little slow, it is definitely worth watching once you get to the bulk of the film. i cant say enough great things about this film. i watch a lot of movies, and this is the best one i have seen in years!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A little slow to start but hooks you in by Chapter 5. Will read more books by Mira Lyn Kelly.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I'd recommend it for anyone who has imagination. I loved it and had a very hard time putting it down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|FANTASTIC BOOK VERY GOOD READ!!! You can actually feel the strong love they have for one another!!! This is the first book I've read from this author will definitely be reading her other books!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would recommend this bookshelf again because I really loved it. I like how Jeff Kinney mAde it seem like he asse
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just received a Kindle Fire HD and this is the first game I downloaded.  Having a blast playing the game!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This I add a very fun game! Keep those updates a comin` with new elements! I like the amount of elements there are!
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|This movie was boring and slow. We feel asleep several times and do not recommend this movie to anyone to rent or buy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Duck games has outdone itself. It's fun for all ages and is easy to learn. A little grid with 5 different colored dots may sound like a lame game but boy is it addicting.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I have to confess, this was my first McEwan book (no, I have not even read his accliaimed 2003 novel, Atonement...). So, I'm coming into this with no prior opinion of McEwan's writing.<br /><br />I thought the spy thriller/love story plot sounded intriguing, but this was a \\"stop and start\\" book for me. I got to certain parts and thought \\"hooray, this is getting good\\". Then, shortly after, the story would meander and I found my mind wandering. This happened over and over.<br /><br />There were a few very long \\"stories within the story\\" that completely interrupted the flow of the central plot and could have been summarized in a quarter of the length. There were also too many references to various \\"serious literary authors\\" and long, boring discussions about the merits of these authors.<br /><br />Finally, I found it somewhat odd that Serena did not begin her involvement in Operation Sweet Tooth until fairly far into the book given the Operation was the story's central premise.<br /><br />All that being said, I thought the ending was intriguing, I enjoyed McEwan's writing style, and I may try another one of his books at some point...possibly Atonement.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Although the story is well written, I struggled with the loss of innocence that a teen or young adult faces when reading this.  The material addresses the loss, pain and moral choices faced in these situations, but is this really necessary for our youth to contemplate head on?
B0083SBJXS|5.0|We love this movie, and have watched it many times...we even have favorite parts that we rewind over and over again!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Heartbreaking ending. Can't wait to read the next two!<br />Most definitely in my top ten favorites.<br />I would suggest this book to all my friends!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This item is poor quality. It's like a cheap plastic toy. I'm in the process of trying to return it. I will definitely buy another Otterbox.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|I was excited to read about this game controller for the iPad. It basically turns ones iPad into a gaming system like all of the consoles on the market. Installing it could not be easier; the hardest part was putting in the batteries (JK). My kids love it and now there is one more reason that they won't let me use the iPad.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|This film was purchased as a gift for a studio Ghilbi enthusiast. He liked it and appreciated the gift. I liked Howl's Castle MUCH better, as it held my attention a lot more.  Nausicaa is a decent movie, but has bug creatures as a main presence of plot line and character development- (did i mention im not a fan of bugs? ). Its philosophical point I think was well developed and made a wonderful use of the genre it is partaking thereof. However, if you want a movie you want to watch with your girlfriend and you like this type of genre, buy Howls Castle instead.
0679731369|5.0|The story is told by Geoffrey Braithwaite who is a physician just as was<br />Charles Bovary and whose wife Ellen shares a great deal more with Emma Bovary<br />than just their initials. To enjoy and understand, you have to first read a summary<br />of Madame Bovary (if you haven't read the book) and then very carefully read<br />the story (especially the final chapters). The references to Ellen are so scattered and<br />brief I mostly missed them at first reading. A true picture of Ellen surfaced only<br />after a second more careful reading and a good deal of cross referencing. The bit about the<br />parrots is a side story but makes for an intriguing title. All in all, a wonderfully entertaining and intriguing story!
B00005LOUQ|5.0|The Grinch has always been a favorite of mine since the movie came out. Now my son is a big fan and brings joy to me as he watches it like when I was younger!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Husband and wife in a mid life marriage crisis could have turned out to be a terribly boring comedy. I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. But I found it delightful. I even had belly laughs.
0783225482|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all time, great story, good special effects, fun & humorous, you won't be disappointed
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The Blu-ray release of 'Star Trek: The Complete Original Series' is the best presentation ever.  I can still see the episodes as originally aired, or view with the enhanced CGI.  The presentation for every episode is crisp and the sound runs through my 5.1 speaker system as clearly as if I were on the sound state.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I'm reading this while on an island so while he talks about being on a boat in the wide blue ocean it's nice to look up at the sea and realize how vast it is. This isn't just about being stranded, but also the main characters life and how it has prepared him for his journey.
B0063GORYU|5.0|play a lot of solitare but spider is by far the best. love the challenges it gives. would recommend this game to anyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am nor sure what caught my eye on this book,  but I am glad it did. I couldn't put it down. Great read for any age.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Excellent movie - good storyline and great pictures.  Even a die-hard Trekkie must love this movie which can be enjoyed more than once.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked this book. I thought it was funny and enjoyable. I loved it and wish it was longer. I give it 4/5 stars.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|The game is fun and easy to play with fairly straight forward play, although it get's harder faster than the ability to level freely.
B009O2XY12|3.0|i really couldt play the game because i was been interrupted by too many commercials popping up at the wrong time. i dont mind commercials but they have to be well placed. the commercials ruined the game for me.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find it very easy to operate. I can leave what I`m doing for a quick equation and back, without any trouble. This was a great find at a great price!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow. So simple and yet so complex. I love it! I have already wasted hours of my life on this. Great buy!
B0058VW36U|1.0|Got this game because we loved the free version and wanted more levels. It doesn't open! What a disappointment, hopefully it will be resolved!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Very interesting book. Entertaining but awkward and vulgar at some points. Very straight forward. However, I really enjoyed the writing style.
B000NY17J6|5.0|She can grind a song, kiss and caress it or kick it and belt it out, and always make you want more. Her greatest hits are here in this two disk set. I love how she sings.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game! Fun to play, and very intresting... I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure games.....Please make more like this one...
B008N1V11U|3.0|this game would be great except the kindle 8.9 massive resolution means that 3D games that take advantage of that resolution bog down quickly. this game needs to be played on a device with more power than a kindle or lower resolution. do yourself a favor and save your dollar for another game. ill update this review if gameloft issues a patch that will lower the graphics to make this game playable on a kindle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing can't even begin to describe this book. If you have not read this book don't wait another minute. It is by far the best book I have read maybe in forever. I feel in love with the characters and must admit I didn't want the book to end. Maybe Colleen will consider a sequel.
B000VHMF0A|4.0|We love this type of music.  Play it often while sitting on the deck of our lake home.  It kind of takes you away from reality to a much more festive place.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Some years ago the tiny town of Barrow, Alaska got kicked around when vampires chose it for their latest hunting ground. There may even have been a movie about it. From a more heartwarming front, Barrow, Alaska was also the site of a bunch of disparate people and corporations that came together for a wonderful cause. Were you around back in October, 1988, when rose that furor over them three California grey whales what got trapped in the ice off Barrow? The media, on a global scale, ate this story up.<br /><br />Encircled by solid ice and stranded five miles away to open water. Five miles is too long for the whales to swim AND breathe underwater. Several of the Alaskan whalers favored putting them out of their misery and using them as food. Local television reporter Adam Carlson (John Krasinski), who dreams of going national, lands the story that promptly ignites a massive groundswell of support. Soon Adam and his wilful ex, passionate Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore), are in the middle of an epic rescue operation. Because who doesn't love whales? To quote one of the officials of the Alaska National Guard, \\"It's like going out and freeing Bambi.\\" If it were a family of platypuses caught in ice, I wonder, would they have warmed up the Soviet icebreaker?<br /><br />Back in 1988, for a brief period of time, the media descended on a tiny town three hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle (and boasting the northernmost Mexican restaurant on the planet). It's a feel-good story. I remember flashing a huge, happy grin when the whales were freed. Recall that this was when the two global superpowers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., were constantly at loggerheads. Excepting that one brief interlude of detente during the whale-saving campaign. In a remarkable effort, Eskimo whalers, Federal and state officials, the National Guard, the oil people, and environmentalists, and, yes, the Soviets all shelved agendas and got together in the freezing cold. That's a lot of hot coffee.<br /><br />BIG MIRACLE chronicles the daunting challenges that faced the would-be rescuers and how these challenges were overcome. One example: The battered, exhausted whales only had an open pool of water from which they could draw in oxygen. Alaskan whalers applied chain saws to chop off blocks of ice to expand the pool, except that the ice reformed in such alarming pace that they were hard pressed to keep up. One solution: two oddball characters from Minnesota with an unorthodox invention.<br /><br />It's a good cast that toes the line between groundedness and rampant sentimentality. Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski anchor the film, but Kristen Bell (as an ambitious reporter) and Ted Danson (as an, um, oily oil baron) provide good support. Dermot Mulroney's character doesn't get as much screen time, but his is a pretty interesting story in real life. He plays a brusque military pilot tasked with hauling a Veco barge to Point Barrow (the barge will hopefully punch thru the ice barrier). He ends up engaged in several tense phone conversations with a pretty liaison from the White House. This really isn't a romantic comedy picture, but you get the gist. And again, unlike Barrow's vampire invasion, this is a true story.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary by director Ken Kwapis<br />- \\"Truth is Stranger than Fiction\\" - the behind-the-scenes featurette, with interviews with Cindy Lowry, the real life activist on whom Rachel is based (00:12:10 minutes)<br />-  4 Deleted Scenes (each with the director's intro), including the hilarious \\"The Prince of Whales\\" segment (00:06:52 minutes)hot coffee.<br /><br />BIG MIRACLE chronicles the daunting challenges that faced the would-be rescuers and how these challenges were overcome.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good story for kids through teenagers. Started a little slow but the movie really got good - and it carried a very positive message regarding parent-teen relations.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It is part of our yearly tradition to watch this movie plus all the versions of A Christmas Carol, so we purchased this to complete our DVD set. This has 2 DVDs, one in black and white and the other in color. It also has special features including The Making of \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" and a \\"Personal Remembrance,\\" a special tribute to Frank Capra.

B000TEUSJK|4.0|GOOD ENJOYABLE MOVIE.  WELL DONE AND WELL ACTED.  I RATE THE QUALITY OF THE ACTUAL DVD AT 80%.  SOME OF THE SCEENS ARE BLURY.
0930289234|5.0|This is the only graphic novel I've read, and it is phenomenal. The artwork is stunning and the book is done incredibly well. The pictures are clear and for a novel comprised entirely of images, it is a great price. Awesome purchase!

B005CRQ4GU|1.0|The dairy of a wimpy kid were a great series but they should've stopped while they were still good This last book was completely different than the other s and frankly sucked.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|The Weeknd's Trilogy is a great body of work and it should catapult him to top with other rhythm and blues heavyweights. There are slight changes to the background vocals and production on this release which makes for good comparison. I'm pleased with this body of work.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is great. It organizers my recipes, class notes, church meeting notes,and vacation photos. The best thing about it is the tag feature. I use it to sort my recipes by ingredient, genre, and event. It couldn't be easier to edit, share, and store recipes. Why didn't I find this app sooner?!?!<br /><br />The list feature can be used for everything from grocery lists to homework lists to simple task list.<br /><br />This app does take some time to figure out but the tutorials are great and it is pretty easy once you figure it out.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I felt every emotion Abby felt and could not put the book down. I loved the fact that this was a realistic love story. The characters were flawed and complicated which made it much more realistic and accessible to readers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. Very colorful, and it lets you change the background and the back of the cards. It's a great and entertaining game.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|it is the best game ever! its fun and everyone in my family loves it! I wish they had more great games like this one
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is the Special Edition of the soundtrack of \\"The Unexpected Journey,\\" the first of the three Hobbit movies. The packaging is very nice, the music (composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Howard Shore) is beautiful, and while as the Special Edition costs a few dollars more, you receive more music selections and information as well. Spend a few dollars more and get this edition; it is worth it.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoy this game and I hope some kid's abusive parent will be consumed by this gameplay to lay off smacking him around for a short time.
B001DZ9GRE|5.0|A customer wrote &#34;buy the import&#34; and they were right. I love the DVD  and my favorite video is  &#34;Shining Light&#34;  theres a gospel/pop sound about the song thats just makes me smile and the visuals are well, puro Annie Lennox acting it up in her happier moments. The other end of the spectrum &#34;A Thousand Beautiful Things&#34; is touching... She goes through all the range of emotions and Its just a thoughtful collection of her music well put together.  Its a treasure, Its a keeper. Buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST. I LOVED EVERY MINUTE.  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. JOHN263G.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|I love the old school look to this game but it still needs some newer options onit.  Like others have said, the car slows down randomly during game play.  There are no markers to say what place you're in nor any markers above the competitions cars.  If you get near one their face appears in the screen mocking you.  I have played only on beginner &amp; am finding it difficult to get far.  I wish their was a blip with the map so I know how steep a curve is as I am approaching it because that's where I have the most troubles.  Since I don't know what place I am in &amp; am not getting far in the game I find it rather boring.
B00AMSLRAC|3.0|My kids love the Dr Panda apps and normally have no problems. This app flips constantly and the screen goes blank when you need to make strawberries. It may happen with other foods, but haven't watched the kids play enough to notice. I hope there is an update to this app.

B005I4JG80|4.0|I saw the author on the Today show a while back and made a note to read this. I'm glad I did, this is a very interesting book to compare parenting styles in American and French cultures.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|I recently discovered Hiromi Uehara on youtube (about 2 years ago) on the recommendation of a local musician conducting a jazz improv clinic (I am a local musician who plays trumpet in a local R&B dance band). I have been listening to jazz for 30 years and this musician plays things that I have never heard before. For example, on Choux a la Creme Hiromi puts her right hand inside the grand piano and makes the piano sound like a stand up bass.  I could give other examples here, but I won't at this time.  For me, this is what jazz music is all about- pushing boundaries of the music and taking things to a whole new level.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|This is one of their best shows ever. They still got it! It's like someone dusted off a box from 30 years ago, plugged it back in and everything still worked! They were well rehearsed and just let it rip for one epic song after another. The sound is amazing.  Kashmir never sounded more epic!
1575666286|4.0|Most interesting & very informative. Certainly increased my awareness of positive foods for fighting illness. I have recommended this book.
1594484805|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Daniel Pink - He's not terribly engaging, he has a tendency to be one sided in his arguments, he shows political bias, and he's extremely idealistic in the way that he presents his material.<br /><br />That said, this book is absolutely worth a read.  If, like me, you go into these types of books with a few grains of salt to be sprinkled in at particularly over the top moments, you'll find this book incredibly expository and explanatory.<br /><br />Since being placed in a leadership / management position, I've worked hard to understand the key concept - how to motivate people to perform their best while enjoying what they do.  Along that path, I've noticed that cutting people loose to do their own work within certain boundaries is a terrific way of maximizing their abilities while keeping their happiness high.  My ultimate goal has been to get my reports to a point where I trust them implicitly - which allows me to give them as much autonomy as the work allows.<br /><br />Pink lays out a key concept which has taken me several years to learn and understand - that people are motivated by what he terms as Motivation 3.0 - autonomy, mastery, and purpose rather than Motivation 2.0 (again, his term) - the carrot and the stick.  I would throw in a few indefinites (more, most, etc. but this is his book, not mine.)  Pink spends the first few chapters explaining the problem with 2.0 and how we need an adjustment.  The next three chapters are about the adjustment itself - why autonomy, mastery, and purpose matter to people.  The final section of the book is a toolkit of sorts - ideas for implementation in different scenarios.  Some of this is to inflate the size of the book (a chapter that is just a recap, and another on discussion points?  Seriously?,)  but some is fairly valuable, such as the \\"Listen to the Gurus\\" chapter.<br /><br />The book is a fairly quick read, I did it in about 5 hours.  It can be a bit dry and wordy, but overall it's well thoughtout.  More importantly, I found myself marking and highlighting continuously, which means I felt that there's material here that's definitely worth coming back to.<br /><br />Ultimately there is no silver bullet for motivating people.  I think that's the biggest fact that Pink ignores in this book, despite the fact that he indirectly acknowledges it a few times (after the company implemented Type I, a couple people left . . .)  Then again, my management style is an amalgamation of the continual self-education I do.  Every time I increase my level of education I adjust my style, I don't throw the old style out.  As long as you go into this book with that in mind, you'll find it extremely enlightening.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter is a huge 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' FANATIC! What else can I say \\"Jeff Kinney Rules\\". WINNING!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this game,she hasit downloaded on every electronic product in the house. She was thrilled when she found out she could download it on her New Kindle Fire HD.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show and the second season did not disappoint! A must watch for any fan. I can't wait for season 3!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun. Challenging at the higher levels, and great for kids. I am using a Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 tablet.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|tying in several threads of scientific and social advances into a historical romance.  Gives a different look on how theories that are now acceptable were so very radical when they were first proposed.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I like this app because it is intertaing for the littel onesand you got to let them play with it it is like you are cooking. in real life
B009JBWOU0|4.0|These movies were a hit and will be watched during the long winter months. Some good scenes from the Pittsburgh area.
B006TTC54A|5.0|This is an all-time classic!  There is no reason to write any more about it.  It seems to get better EVERY time you watch it.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Why cant you charge this thing with a USB wall charger? I can charge my third-party PS3 controllers this way, but not the official Sony product. It seems like they did this to purposely try to get you to buy their charger. That is just stupid and makes me think twice before buying more Sony products. You can however charge this through your computer. That means you have to leave your computer on, and I think the wall chargers provide a higher power source than a USB 2.0 computer, so the wall chargers charge up faster.<br /><br />When using the thumb sticks, if you are pressing really hard eventually there will be a groove that wears that wears into the shaft because the shaft grinds against the wall. This groove makes it difficult to press down on the stick because it ends up getting stuck on the wall. This is actually a huge annoyance and just plain bad design.<br /><br />My favorite controller so far has actually been the power a mini pro elite. The third-party controller does not have some stick aiming that's as accurate as the official controller, but everything else feels better especially for people with small hands. With the third-party controller, it's easier to reach the start button and the home button without having to move your hand away from the normal position.
B003N9ASEI|5.0|This also is an all-time classic.  There is nothing to dislike about it,  It also gets better EVERY time you watch it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Normally I cannot stand novels written in the first person. I could not put this book down! Stayed up all night to finish. So worth it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Basically I thought this book defines the term paper porn.  I thought it was a weak story woven in between the many sexual encounters.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Jeremy Renner's great in the movie. Lots of action. Lived up to expectations. Fast paced. Rachel Weizmann does the usual damsel in distress.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|it is not good when I play it it will not let me play it. also it is not a good game it is a bad game I hats it you should too!
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I am a pretty big fan of the resident evil series and I found this movie to be very repetitious. They didn't really introduce any new characters or monsters. It seemed like they just rehashed a bunch of old characters and threw them into a generic script. I was looking for some sort of escalation in Alice's powers and a new monster to be introduced. The story line really lacked direction and was all over the place. The whole movie was kind of a let down. This may be the last resident evil movie I watch.
0525425764|4.0|I love all books by John Grisham.  This series is not quite as good as the rest but still very well written, good story line.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished this book in a day. I couldn't put it down. In fact I just lent it to my daughter.  I loved the characters, especially Holder.  You will not regret getting this book no matter your age (17+).  I had no idea what I was getting into and I thought I had it all figured out, but I was wrong. The only thing that I was skeptical about was the maturity of the characters.  I know adults who could not handle themselves as well, especially in the face of such adversity.  But all of that is secondary,  the story is worth the skepticism.  Loved it.
0525425578|4.0|I love all books by John Grisham.  This series is not quite as good as the rest but still very well written, good story line.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|Plus one of my favorite dancers from &#34;America's Best Dance Crew&#34; Laura Edwards, is in this movie as &#34;Vicky&#34;. Whenever this movie comes on tv and I don't have the DVD handy, I just watch it from there.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I had gone off epic fantasy novels as they started feeling formulaic. This book has fantastic depth and complexity and has me very excited to keep reading the series. I cannot put it down.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Who doesn't love Les Mis.  This is ONE of my all time favorite musical scores and this production with this cast I think is one of the very best!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use Facebook to keep in contact with family & friendsand recently downloaded the AP to my fire...huge disappointment! The status lines are very fuzzy and small in comparison to the pictures.  Not a fan at all! I'll stick with the Android phone AP<br />(Kindle fire 8.9)
B005LAIGW8|2.0|This movie sucked and I found it in despert need of better film and it was just bad and nothing like DC
B0086700CM|5.0|So far this game been amazing. The graffics are near 3D. I was worried about lag in processing which I've experienced on my tablet...but not on the fire. Its a great, challenging game! (Kindle fire 8.9)
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in this series. However, this book was simply atrocious. The whole plot seemed like it was picked up from some kind of fan fiction. Everything throughout the whole book seemed to go way too perfectly, even if it is just a book, making it really difficult to get into the story.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love puzzles. This is creative and innovative. Can play for hours!!!  Mark  more games please. I already have  your other game, and want more!
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Great movie, was so much fun. Has a very nice combination between romance and comedy. Was completely worth watching. .
B00632HWOG|2.0|worked great in the past but sucks on windows 8 -- windows 8 sucks -- what a s*** system -- the microsoft windows 8 sucks -- reason to buy an apple product
B005K17RU0|5.0|good, reliable weather data.  We check it frequently.  easy to use my 4 yr old can do it, you can too
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This is a great installment of the Pendergast series, especially if you are only interested in his story line. . My only disappointment was that I had been anxiously waiting for some answers regarding Constance....still waiting...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a Star Wars junkie from way back and could not pass up this deal. Soon as it came my fiance and I had a Star Wars movie weekend.
B005XT10YS|5.0|I now have seen the movie after leaving a comment a couple of days ago, which I still stand by, because I think conspiracies abound all throughout history and we NEVER get the real or whole truth on the matter. Just like JFK, they pushed the Warren Commission to come up with its report so as to quiet a country, we find the same evidence here in the Lincoln assassination.<br />I am a Civil War buff and know much more than the lay person on the facts, but I have to say, I knew very little about Mary Surratt then and now even more so after the film.  Robert Redford did a beautiful job recreating the events as best as possible in both look and feel, though no one is 100% on the mark after over a century and a half has gone by.  I have to admit that after I saw the movie, I couldn't get enough to read to see what I could come up with.<br /><br />I knew little of Mary Surratt and after the movie, I got to know more of her, but still, she had a mysterious way about her. There was one comment in the film where Aiken goes up to Stanton and as I forget his lead in line, but it was to protect Mary, he said, John or Mary, he didn't care as long as he got one of them! Now that should make you ears prick up right away! For the sake of expediency he was willing to sacrifice Mary for her son John so that the trial was over with and the country could move on, which it did. Oddly enough, when John did come back and got arrested, there were NO CHARGES brought against him and he went scott free. Now how could that be if he was the one who was in the middle of the group and was far more guilty than his mother, but it was over with and there was no need to go any further.<br />I found it odd that the 7 defendants, only 4 were executed and 3 served little time! How could that be? What plagued me throughout the movie is that I could not tell if Mary knew more than she was admitting to. I seem to think that she did not know much more, and if tried by a jury of peers, as she should have been, she would not have been found guilty, let alone hanged! She was a religious woman and more so than people understand. She sent her children to Catholic schools to get the best education and religious training. This does not sound like a revengeful woman who would be in the thick of things in assassinating the President! Mind you, she did know a little more than let on, but it was nothing that would condemn her. She was a very protective mother and she only wanted to make sure that her son would be spared, so she took the fall for him.<br /><br />There were things that were brought up at the tribunal that in a court of law, would not have been admissible in court. The character backgrounds of the witnesses against her were either extremely flawed, or they out and out lied on the stand. I tend to think that if John Surratt had come back, his mother would have been let off on lesser charges...but it was not to be so and the trial went speedily to its conclusion. It was also odd that they tried all the defendants at the same time.<br /><br />I think everyone should see this movie, whether interested or not, to see how this happens again and again in our history and how the right of habeous corpous is thrown to the side for a swift resolution and lets the powers that be have their own way with the law. We've seen this right after JFK was assassinated and again soon after 9/11! Is our guaranteed Constitutional rights to be ignored when those in power deem it expedient to do so...and what they think is the best for the country, even though it may be a total lie? I feel this movie is trying to tell us that, from the very first time it happened to the American public.<br /><br />I can't say for sure, nor can anyone else, just how guilty Mary Surratt was. But I feel she was NOT that guilty to warrant the verdict put upon her and that history has a dark blotch because of it. If she was guilty of anything, it was protecting her son. All this movie did for me was bring up moreand more questions on a subject I never thought about...but isn't that a good thing that we should question history as to its motives and try to find out as best we can, why they turned out the way they did? At the end, I felt nothing but pity for Mary, for she was the only one of the 4 that did NOT try and kill anyone and she was even more innocent than the other 3 who escaped without much of a punishment. How's that for justice!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I haven't gotten it yet. my friend has it and looks like fun. I dint have it because its seven dollars.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Great idea, great execution. Laugh out loud funny over and over again. Some foolish and silly parts towards the end involving a car and foot chase, plus a Norah Jones concert.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|The passion behind the story really grips the reader. I enjoy reading the books because they give you more insight on who these people really are and what drives their actions.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Normally, I'd be inclined to think battery apps are useless but this one is great. Calibration took a little longer than I would've liked, beyond that this is one of the more useful apps I've seen. Alerts can be set to advise you as to battery level. More than worth the $2.
0061714372|3.0|I used to like Megadeth. Dave is a great guitarist. Unfortunately he's also a huge pretentious d-bag. It was an ok read, but not memorable. Pretty much read all these stories over the years in various rock magazines and the interweb.
B00164CM46|5.0|Great movie and everything just gets better in bluray! All big time actors come together in this thrilling movie. The accents bring it all together!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|awesome show and worth the money.  big bang theory is a show we have always bought and tried the instant video from Amazon this time.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Pretty much everyone in here is dysfunctional, so it was a bit like the National Enquirer, but it was entertaining and well written.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the second Stephen King book I've read (the first was Carrie), and it was surprisingly easy to get through.  The story caught my attention from the first page, and it was really hard to put down.  Great book that I would recommend to anyone!
B009ETEEAU|2.0|I bought this for my son in conjunction with his new dirt bike. The hopes was to give him a helmet cam. Unfortunately the only mounting option for a helmet is for a vented helmet with strap. It has no option to attach to motorcross style helmet. Video quality is fair in the brightest sunshine and quickly goes downhill from there. Even on a cloudy day the video is very grainy and dark. I should have opted for something a little more expensive from a more reputable digital camera company. No matter how much it tries to look like a GOPRO it is definitely NOT a GOPRO
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Some movies with the endless sequels all you can think...oh great not again. Can't they leave well enough alone. Thank God they stepped out with MIB again. What a great movie. I may like this one even more than the first two. Though okay to make it completely perfect there would have to have been even more Tommy Lee but I loved seeing his younger and...\\"wilder\\"/flirter self. Good addition.
B003O86FMW|5.0|love using kindle downloads. they are quick, easy, and generally a great price. I also love that I get to lend it to other kindle users when i'm done reading it.
B0065NAKRO|5.0|This is a wonderful version of Dominoes.  I actually feel like I'm sitting across the table playing a game with someone.  I play a lot of Dominoes with my husband, but when he's not available, this is the next best thing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|kindle downloads are amazing. they are fast quick and generally a great price. I also like that I get to lend them when im done
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've tried several of the Mahjong games, but this is my favorite.  I love the variety of the puzzles and the many choices.  The games are just challenging enough for me to enjoy them without over-taxing my brain at the end of a long day.  I highly recommend it to Mahjong lovers.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|Great Aardman movie but like with all their creations you'll wear your pause button or space button down trying to catch the little background bits or just admire the little touches. As a movie this is very cute but the details with the curls on a character's hair or the little clay buckles has me in awe. The time also put into setting up a humorous background bit or funny painting/statue is appreciated. Great for a rainy or in day!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this was a good movie. Watch it and see for yourself. Men In Black 3
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I placed my order on a Thursday, and received my case on Saturday. I was so surprised to receive it so fast. Once I got it I was amazed on how well it was constructed. Very stable, & strong. I think I made the right choice.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I love this movie, particularly because of Nightcrawler's inclusion in the film. It was a big disappointment that he didn't return for the following film.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story is a fantasy that could or could not happen, but it put me in a good mood. I really enjoyed it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I'm a fan of Pandora and Slacker radio.  Pandora and Slacer are great for music, but not great when it comes to news and talk radio.  TuneIn is where I got my talk/news radio.  Some stations do skip.  I think it is more of an issue with the station than with the app.  The radio app gets 5 stars.<br /><br />I got the pro hoping I could record a talk radio show with a timer (like how you record on your TV), so I could listen while not connected to internet.  I like to listen to talk radio when driving, thus no internet.<br /><br />Unfortunately it does not work that way.  You have to turn on the radio and hit record.  So the recording ability is a pretty much useless upgrade.<br /><br />However there are a very limitted selection of podcasts you can download for free.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh Laurie once again shows his versatility with 15 great blues songs featuring his vocal, piano, guitar and percussion skills (he gets some help from Irma Thomas, Dr. John & Tom Jones on three tracks).  Really great listening!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This book made me appreciate how difficult it was for humanity to \\"transfer knowledge \\" in past history - its amazing how far we have come - or you can argue not - when you consider what some of those civillzations had. Good read- recommended.
0062082353|4.0|Chris Kyle takes the reader through his experiences in SEAL training, his multiple deployments, and his struggles between his call to serve his family and call to serve his country. You will get an honest understanding of the war and a better understanding of our soldiers after reading this book.
B00101ZOTA|3.0|I had heard for year about what a great movie this was but when I finally got around to watching it I wasn't impressed.  Great cast and I liked Kevin Spacey as always, but it literally put me to sleep.
034580404X|1.0|There was so much hype when this book was released in England I felt I had to give it a go, however, it turned out to be a disappointing read.<br /><br />Whilst I realise it is fiction, it is so far fetched that it was unbelievable for me.<br /><br />I did manage to get to the end of the books but this was pure dedication and self motivation.<br /><br />Its not a book I'd recommend I'm afraid.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Was a bit long and the end credits should have been part of the movie. Wouldn't pay for it, wait till its a free stream.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Started reading but could not get interested in it. Maybe will go back to later & try again later on.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Bastante casual, super comodo, bonito. Sirve para cualquier ocasion. Recomendado sinceramente. Excelente calidad de producto y atencion. Pronto realizare otra compra.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Just finished reading this book. Another great Grisham novel. Would recommend to anyone who likes his books. Reads very easily.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great story like a fairy tail story only in Vegas.I really enjoyed it. Makes you dream a little and puts you on the clouds.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great music from a rising star! i believe we will start hearing many of these songs on radio and tv in future years. Love it!
B002361MLA|5.0|A deep understanding of Spirituality which will appeal only to those with a similar insight.I would reccommend this book to anyone with an interest in the subject.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was a great read and it will suck you in. I couldn't stop reading it! A book worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I ever read it is a piece of art truly it is....it's also sheer genius.
068816689X|5.0|Ciould not put down the book.  One of the best books I have ever read.  Absolutely fascinating story that reads like a novel, but it is a true story written by the woman who lived this life.  Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Holocaust.  After reading this book, I got the documentary of this story.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I've read it before in paperback form but it had been years and this book didn't disappoint the second time. Love reading about Drizzt and his exploits.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|This game would really be good if it did not have so many bugs in it. I have had to restart several levels do to techinal problems. I am trying to get through level 21 for the fourth time but the last symbal will not stick to the scroll. The other annoying thing is that you can not save your work and have to start the level all over again. The walkthrough is useless if the game will not do what it shows you what to do. Lots of running back and forth. I doubt that I will work on this game any more. Good graphics and story line but if the game does not work well it is just frustrating.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Would never have expected a free game to be this good. Super addicting, love it. It works really well on my Droid phone and my Kindle.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Got this at my front door as soon as it was released.  Was delighted at the prompt service.  Enjoyed every moment of the movie and am looking for a Beverly Hills Chihuahua 4.  I certainly will preorder it just as I did this time. Thanks!!!!
B004GGTAQE|5.0|Loved it, great read.<br />German band of brothers.<br />Superb great info from perspective of German soldiers.<br />I highly recommend you read it
B005EGXNLS|3.0|A good time filler -- predictable story.  Most interesting part is figuring out how the place names relate to present places -- for example, &#34;ceastre&#34; has to be present-day Chester, &#34;Sceaftesburi&#34; must be Shaftsbury, &#34;Wintanceaster&#34; must be Winchester.  Some names are a mystery.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my favorite book by far!!! It is a great book for anyone I can't wait to read the second!!
0307276902|5.0|I have heard many great things about this book and they were all true! It was one of my favorite reads. Some parts can be a little slow or repetitive, but I still very much enjoyed it. For a 500+ page book, it was a quick read since it was so interesting. The author has his own writing style that I have never seen before, and I have since then ordered many more of his books. Book was also in great condition when it came in, considering it was used.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very fun game that's free!!! And best of all the game continues without you having to pay for anything necessary!!!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is the first Oscar Wilde book I have read...but it will not be the last! My curiosity brought me to download it onto my Kindle (I LOVE my Kindle!), and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The plot was intriguing, the characters engaging, and the ending was not disappointing in the least.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever thought about growing older (or not growing older)...it is a very quick read, and you will be glad you took the time to visit Dorian Gray.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I really enjoy this show. The characters and story lines are complex and compelling. The writing and performances are superb. And there are enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes and engaged.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The multi-generational classic. Nothing more needs to be said, except- What other Beatles albums do we need in the house?
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book really kept my attention with all of its twists and turns. I loved the fun and humorous style of the writing as well. Even the ending was surprising but a bit of a let down. I want the sequel!
B00005ABIP|5.0|we love this album!  the item was received in its original packaging and promptly,  thanks for a great purchasing experience!
B0018QQQK8|1.0|One of the worst most unsatisfying endings of all time.  From high drama to \\"what the hell happened?\\" at break neck speed.  Left me feeling lost and cheated.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|My husband and I really got into season 1. Once we started watching the second season we were a bit disapointed. It's ok.  I would watch it for free, but def not going to pay to watch this.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|My son had this on his wishlist it arrived on time and was a great gift for him.  He was very excited to see all of the gifts from his Amazon list!
1465001123|5.0|Gave this as a Christmas gift to my daughter.  It looks like a very nice calendar. She loves it.  Seems to be good quality.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I can't rate this yet, because the App store will not load right on my tablet. It keeps crashing on me. So i've download it twice. Still no lucky. Going to try after all the kids go back to school, and see if it will work then.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Driving story line keeps you riveted until the last scene. Wished for a family homecoming with those back at home.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I bought the DVD for my son-in-law, and the CD for me.  Saw this on PBS and couldn't resist...I want to continue to enjoy it!
B000LXISE6|3.0|After two spectacular prior album releases, this was just ok for me. I'm a big Josh Groban fan and find myself migrating back to his first two albums: Josh Groban (2001) and Closer (2003). Call me old school. I do prefer, however, Awake over Illuminations (2010).<br /><br />I'm anxiously awaiting the upcoming release of his next album: &#34;All That Echoes&#34; (to be released February 5, 2013) and hope it will revert again from just good...to great..
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I saw this on PBS and immediately ordered it for my son-inlaw's birthday, he plays the saxophone and will enjoy it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This much-hyped book actually lives up to its billing.  It is a fast-paced, action-packed, and thoroughly gripping read from start to finish, and yet also displays a surprising amount of philosophical and emotional depth.  A good read for a wide range of readers.
143911000X|5.0|Just like on the show, The Bro Code is a fun book that will have you laughing out loud! Highly recommended, especially for fans of How I Met Your Mother.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Great way to relive the musical!  Minus the gritty scenes that are questionable for younger kids, but follows the story enough to enjoy.  My daughter wants to be Samantha Barks.
B009POCFTG|5.0|In the opening moments of director William Friedkin's KILLER JOE, you're going to know whether or not you're the target audience for this film as Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch; INTO THE WILD; MILK) is let into his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church; SPIDER-MAN 3, SIDEWAYS) and stepmother Sharla's (Gina Gershon; SHOWGIRLS, BOUND) trailer by Sharla who is wearing nothing but a shirt. If you repel in moral disgust and indignation, you're really not going to like this film at all. If you are unsettled, find it funny, or shaken by this moment, then you are probably someone that will enjoy this twisted amorality play.<br /><br />Chris is desperate. He owes more than he can pay to some violent bookies and hatches a doomed scheme to kill his birth mother for her insurance money. He gets his father in on the scheme by assuring that a near-mythical hit man named Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a Dallas homicide detective, will do the job. But since they don't have the money, they only have one option available: Joe will do the job with a retainer on receiving the $25,000 he demands for his work. The problem is that the retainer is Chris's sister Dottie (Juno Temple; THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, ATONEMENT), a beautiful, innocent and very strange young woman. Once things are set in motion, the film begins to reach a fever pitch of hilarity, violence and disturbing sexuality leading to its unforgettable final act, which has events likely to stay with you for some time.<br /><br />Friedkin collaborates once again with Tracy Letts, a playwright who also adapted another of his plays, Friedkin's 2006 much more disturbing BUG and this is yet another thing that will very likely polarize audiences. The highly-stylized direction and dialogue have the sensibilities of being more theatrical than cinematic, but Friedkin and his decades of experience bring the visual fabric of this film to very vivid life. The script is something like the deranged love child of Sam Shepard and surrealist Maria Irene Fornes; hyper-real at certain points and terrifically bizarre at others. Another thing about this film is that I don't know exactly what the differences might be between this \\"Unrated\\" cut and its theatrical NC-17 cut, but they can't be too far removed from one another. It's not a film packed with scenes of sexuality or extreme violence; in fact, there are really no \\"sex scenes\\" to speak of. But the film does have scenes of explicit nudity, and the one scene guaranteed to garner its NC-17 rating is not a scene I will describe here, but it's a scene of sexual violence involving fried chicken that, frankly, you can never unsee. Again, this is NOT a film for the faint of heart.<br /><br />As far as the performances, they are career highs for just about everyone involved. Hirsch brings as much sympathy and relatability to an intensely unlikable character; Gershon, who hasn't really been seen in quite some time, gives easily her best performance since BOUND; Haden Church is wonderfully funny as the unforgivably dim Ansel, and his deadpan delivery and facial expressions are in top form. But the real triumpths belong to Temple and McConaughey, who do the best work of their careers thus far here. Temple, who hasn't been in much, and rarely in a highly-featured role, shines with a radiant beauty and wide-eyed innocence particularly as she regales with stories of her only boyfriend that she had in the third grade, and the way she describes the attempt on her life by her mother. McConaughey owns this film with what is truly his best work to date. He does away completely with the charming good-ole-boyness that he often brings to his work, and instead oozes menace with an evil intelligence that allows him to be so good at what he does, a steely gaze that is almost hypnotic, and a calm demeanor that holds something much more frightening beneath it.<br /><br />KILLER JOE seems to exist in the same sub-genre of film (what I, and others call \\"Redneck Noir\\") as The Coen Brothers films BLOOD SIMPLE and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. While it includes many of the tropes of noir, it also turns them on their heads with such bravura and skill that it puts most other modern neo-noir films to shame. It's a terrifying and challenging masterpiece of filmmaking, and it's a shame that most audience members looking to see a dark comedy with Matthew McConaughey The Movie Star are going to be sorely disappointed because Matthew McConaughey The Actor has arrived, and I look forward to seeing many more films with THIS Matthew McConaughey in them.ms BLOOD SIMPLE and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I ordered this movie with the intent of my wife and I watching it instantly.  I got repeated errors stating that the movie could not be played at that time.  I thought it might be my FIOS connection so I tried Netflix and other online video sources like U Tube to see if they were working properly, which they were.  After verifying it wasn't my internet connection I tried to watch Ted again and after multiple attempts I still got the same error.  It took me almost two days, and the rental period had almost expired, before I was able to successfully watch the movie.  The Amazon service was horrible!  The only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one is that the movie, while very raunchy, was hilarious....

1416955070|5.0|I got this book right away. It was brand new! Read it in three days. Can't wait for the film to come out in August.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this series up on kindle because book one was FREE.  What a great read.  I love all of the wool series and the \\"prequel\\" Silo.  I have read every thing he has on Amazon an would buy more!! Loved it and I have not found an \\"end of the world\\" book that could capture my attention.  this was a great ride full of surprises... also love that the IT department seems to be the root of all evil!! Waiting for another good read from this guy!!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|It's great that I have access to these movies at my fingertips. Judd Nelson and the gang are irreplaceable. Kudos.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|LOVE it!  Great gift for my husband, got on sale for an amazing price for Christmas deals.  We watched one of the movies Christmas night!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story. It was heartbreaking but the ending was good. When you are half way through the book everything starts coming together. There are so many twists and I spent the last half of the book saying OMG!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Ho_hum plot with an expected ending. But cute in a raunchy sort of way. I am a fan of Wahlberg so I enjoyed it anyway.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Amazing amounts of research and investigation behind the information in this book.  Very helpful!  Try this good read and see for yourself!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, 3 adults watched it, no kids, we loved it. It had lovely scenery (something I never imagined saying for an animated film), a somewhat unpredictable story, and was just plain fun to watch. It was cute, but not sickly sweet, nor was it over the top goofy pie-in-the-face to appeal to 7 year old boys stereotypical crap so many animated films have nowadays. Bravo for Brave, this film has much more of the flavor of the old Pixar films, less of the typical Disney film, which is a good thing. And the other good thing: it is devoid of cliches and violence, so I highly recommend it for kids.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It would be extremely charitable to say this movie was 'mildly amusing'. It was a major waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get better but it got worse. I like Seth Macfarlane's work and I am a big Family Guy fan. But this was bad and not funny.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Grand-Daughter loved it. Katy Perry The Movie: Part of me is a favorite for the younger kids, would order again.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the dimming feature. If it would hide the menu and time feature on the tablet would be a plus.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|This game starts off &quot;OK&quot;with simple songs on easy mode but as you get to the harder difficulty like...freaken normal it goes from easy to impossible. The game can not register more then two fingers on the device (I'm using a kindle fire) so 80% of the songs you can't play because of poor touch reconization. Save the space and save your time.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Ok.. I have a bunch of SACD's and a few other DVD-A's... This is my new reference/demo for when friends come over. The first time I listened to this.. I kept running up stairs and dragging my wife into my man cave screaming .. 'Ok, you just have to hear this!!!!' The surround mixes are just amazing, I've never heard the beatles like this. Its not just that the sound quality is amazing, its the mix itself that really is stunning.. Even the song transitions.... the father and son team who did this are magicians. If you have a decent hi fi 5.1 system, just stop reading these reviews and buy it, I wasted far too much time reading how great this album is before pulling the trigger.. Best thing I've ever heard on my 5.1 system (yes I have DSOTM on SACD).
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Entertaining, beautifully filmed, and faithfully adapted. This is one of those rare movies that everyone likes and it is actually good.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I couldn't seem to get out of the \\"add city\\" screens. There was no way to quit the app or to set preferences. Similar app works great on my smart phone, but didn't work well with my kindle  :/
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app rocks. It is so detailed, every piece of art comes out unique and fantastic! Best way ever to pass time and be creative on kindle fire H D!! I personally love all of the colors available, as an artist in the real world this is second to none! And only 99c, definitely definitely definitely worth every penny!!
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book is well constructed, give facts in a readable manner and concludes with step-by-step guide on how to understand our habits - even how to modify / change them.<br /><br />The history and compexities of what drives us as humans beings is a truly insightful and helpful. Now I just need to apply it to my life!!!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This is by far the best book that I have ever read. The best love story ever. I loved it.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|While this might be what everyone who watches family guy or american dad would expect, it is still a really good movie to watch.  The punch lines are really well delivered.  It's a good comedy and good to watch with a group of friends ... if you weren't sick in your room for 2 days like I was.
B008K6DU4Y|4.0|MX players pretty great ,it plays everything ! have a 2 year old is absolutely loved it ,my  husband loves it too !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I saw the movie before I read the book it held my interest and I didn't want to put it down.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I have read most of the avengers comics , at least up to the 1980's. And they were great! This movie adapts the avengers in a decent enough manner with fantastic huuge budget effects and top notch actors. The 3d is great and very few scenes have ghosting, like lets say 'dial m for murder does'.  It's a good comic book movie like most of the marvel comic movies. I would state though that the comics are actually better! If your kids aren't reading them that's a shame.  And alot of libraries have them in book form for you to read. The package comes with a unneeded digital copy and a dvd?, we don't need dvds with blu rays as it drives up the price. The blu ray has the extra features on it so you need that copy. This is a great adventure film and it was a monster hit and deservedly so.  It's too bad they gave up on the fantastic four and daredevil and others. Because Marvel comics  make good movies. This one though is probably the best of the lot.  It's  a must have for fans of comic movies and the most expensively made one to date.
030758836X|3.0|I had heard that this was a great read.  So, I thought I would borrow the book and give it a try. It took a while to get into the story line.  Then it got interesting and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.  The main character of this book is a little difficult to believe.  I don't see how one would be able to think ahead and do the things this person does.  I was disappointed in the end since it was too stranger to believe.  I think a better ending should be written.  Especially if it is turned into a movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book kept my interest. I'd recommend this for a good read. My daughter enjoyed this and told me to read it as well.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This is fun.. you have to think a bit for some of the puzzles but a good mind game to keep your mind active.
B005GVF95O|5.0|My soon to be 3 year old son loves this app. I just wish there were more of them. Maybe an in app purchase?
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Love it. Slows sometimes but restarts just fine. Hope to see more of it. So glad to find it. Great game
1400067820|5.0|any organization, be it a business, a community or a whole country is more successful when as many people as possible have skin in the game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very cool game!! Addictive, once you start playing it's kinda hard to stop. plus you get coins just for not playing and you don't have to spend real money. I say this game is a winner on my kindle fire.
B00968Q7DQ|5.0|I picked this up as I'm a big fan of Nick D'Virgilio and supporter of all from the Spock's Tree. Excellent drumming along with great melodies and vocals. Nice keyboard and guitar work and a warm sounding production make this one of my favs.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series. I was told by others that the ending was disappointing, however I was delighted at the end. Couldn't imagine a better way to end an awesome series!
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|As mentioned by other users this app cannot be used in any kindle fire<br /> I bought a 7` and a 9` kindle and the app is forced to close after 20~30 seconds... not worth the bandwidth wasted
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I watched the film before reading the book and as always,the book was so much better! The manner in which the book was written and the honesty of Charlie made this book as amazing as it was. Thank you Stephen Chbosky for writing a book so beautifully written that inspired me and gave me hope for the good and bad times.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|This movie does not disappoint great coming of age dramedy. The young actress that plays the lead very good I suspect this won't be the last we see of her
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the 6.1 version it is really good with the graphics,but there is no minecarts and boats. That's the only negatives that I thought, and when is the 7.1 update coming to the Kindle fire
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I ordered this specifically to connect my computer to an old Bose Sound Dock speaker that lacked the audio input port.  I've been using if for a couple of months and it has worked perfectly so far.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a well rounded novel that really kept me interested. I gave this book 5 stars because it was unlike any other book I've read being that it was written in letters. I also loved that the character of Charlie was vulnerable...it made believe in the story. Gtest, easy read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game immensely and would highly recommended it.  The graphics are great, the puzzles are fun and the storyline is intriguing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I rated it 5 stars because it was great & made me felt as if I was a part of the boom. This book was different than other ones I have read.  The main character Charlie made me laugh,serious, & emotional at time. I recommend this book to anyone that will want an everlasting feeling from a good book like this one.
B002SKF564|5.0|Well, I was a little disappointed to not find the HTC logo on my headset. But when I compared it to the broken HTC headset that shipped with my phone two years ago, it was, otherwise, an identical twin.<br /><br />But what surprised me was the amount of bass this headset seems to 'introduce' into music. Well, I'm not sure if this is how it is supposed to function, but it sounds great! I'm so happy to have a headset that is even better than my original!<br /><br />I recommend this product,
0385536828|5.0|As usual, McEwan delights us with a cleverly constructed plot and narrative structure, more reminiscent of the dark comedy of Amsterdam than the dark tragedies of Atonement or Cement Garden. The special pleasure of this book, for me, were the stories within the story, with McEwan's subtle critical commentaries on his own offerings. Also, his peripheral characters such as Shirley and Max are so deftly and fully realized that they remind me of those preliminary sketches that great painters used to enable their students to fill in the details. I am the same age as the novel's purported narrator, so the cultural references ring true, but different age cohorts may not \\"get\\" the literary and political points of reference.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|DON'T BUY THIS! I love the movies but if you order the UK box set its 20$ less money. The movies are better and have special features and an interview with Daniel Radcliffe and JK Rowling! If you want to buy such incredible films on blu ray buy the UK version the only difference is the first movie is called the Philosephers Stone. If it really bothers you that you have to wait a week and a half get ripped off, its your choice.
B000YJ6736|5.0|If you like Ian Mcewan, this is a short, excellent read that describes the innermost thoughts of  two people and how their fears and impulsive behaviors effect their lives.
B0053KWDES|5.0|...and the speakers weren't even on. So yeah, it's pretty much perfect. You'll get some hiss on highly sensitive headsets like the Shure SE215's. No problems with the Audiotechnica m50.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book was a VERY long read, but well worth it.  I'll be seeing the movie on Jan. 1.  Can't wait!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie!  My husband, a baseball fan, pointed out to me that near the end of the movie, Mickey calls the catcher's mitt a &#34;glove&#34;.  We were surprised that got by the baseball experts on the movie.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|As many times as I tried to program it, it never worked and I woke up late.  I  recommend an analog alarm clock with either a wind-up or a long-life battery for people who truly want a reliable 'wake-up'.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This game can be engineered better so that the player doesn't have to shuffle the tiles so many times. Other than that I find at least the tiles are easy for me to read.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an awesome movie that you can watch with the entire family. Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it!
B008220D5K|2.0|When I saw Knocked Up in 2007, I thought it was...okay.  I thought it ran a bit long, and I can barely stand five minutes of Katherine Heigl on screen, so nearly two hours was quite a chore...but I did enjoy the characters played by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.  It surprised me when I heard about the psuedo-sequel to Knocked Up called This Is 40, focusing on those characters hitting the age milestone, but it intrigued me.  Did it hit the mark?<br /><br />Since Knocked Up, Judd Apatow has had his hand in many different things, but nothing as disappointing to me as Funny People.  It was marketed as a comedy and failed in that aspect...it ended up being an overlong drama.  I was hoping that This Is 40 would have more of the feeling of Knocked Up than Funny People, but it doesn't.  It's a mixture of the two.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the movie had a few chuckles, but it could have benefited from serious editing.  It runs over two hours long, and easily could have been chucked down to an hour and a half.  When it was all said and done, the characters really didn't 'go' anywhere, and the casting of his children as the kids in the film was a terrible choice.  The comedic timing just isn't there for these little ones (through no fault of their own).  The script is weak, and Paul Rudd works with what he has, but it just...doesn't work.<br /><br />I didn't like it.  I think if you loved Knocked Up and 40 Year Old Virgin, you will be disappointed, but if you liked Funny People, you'll probably enjoy this.

B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|I've read a few of the Reacher books. That being said, I thought this movie was...'okay'.<br /><br />I think that Cruise (despite his physical shortcomings for the role) did pretty well as Reacher. The dialog was sharp and actually provided quite a bit of laughs. The woman in this movie was awful and truly pulls off a 'deer in headlights' look the entire time. Herzog is basically wasted. I'm guessing he filmed his scenes in two days max and stands or sits around looking tired the entire time.<br /><br />The car chase was really cool, and even though it was goofy, I liked the scene in the drug house. However, there really wasn't as much action as I was going in expecting.<br /><br />This was a serviceable movie, but nothing to write home about. I was expecting more.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|some movie remakes really dont work  , this is not one of them lots of action and great efects .

B005LAIIKI|5.0|I am a self professed 'Tarantino fan boy', but even he is not without a dud (Death Proof, I'm looking at you).  I loved Inglourious Basterds from 2009, and have been eagerly awaiting Django Unchained since it was announced in 2011.  So?<br /><br />Django Unchained is the most fun I had at the theater in 2012.  The dialog is perfect, the pacing is fantastic, and the characters are insane.  There are many scenes from the script that didn't make it into the movie, so I'm hoping that they were just cut and will be on the eventual Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />This is a day one purchase on Blu-Ray for me, so I will be back then to talk about the extras.  For now though, go to the theater to see this film.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you are not familiar with this series I suggest you start at the very begining - Season 1, episode 1.  After that it just draws you in with great acting, good story lines and spectacular costumes and sets.<br />As others have said - don't watch the US PBS cut-up version - you must watch the original UK version.<br />Already have Season 3 on order.

B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Definitely a different feel to the album than &#34;Lights.&#34; I love most of the songs. The album title is pretty accurate. :)
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I know I wont watch that movie a second time. The story is slow and seen many times over in the past. Special effects aren't very impressive and seeing an angry Charlize Theron is not why I like and Noomi goes off on her own with a disasembled humanoid in a UFO and who knows what she's going to eat while she's looking.
B000003CMB|5.0|Allman Brothers live at the Fillmore East! It don't get any better than that. Six more word's, really? Plain stooped.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book, it kept me engaged and guessing. There are many layers, twists and turns to the characters and storyline. I kept thinking I had it figured out but then another twist. It's been a long time since I've read a book that kept me this interested.  Was it perfect?  No, but it's 'fun' in a diabolical way.  And when the book was finished I had a creeped out feeling that hung on for a while -  diabolically written.  After a while, I'll read another of Flynn's books when I get over this one!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was amazing book and great and I can't want to buy the movie.<br /><br />I rated  five stars and I really want Charlie sister to keep her baby
B0053O89WY|5.0|We love The Big Bang Theory and season 5 may just be the best yet. We can watch it over and over, this show is tv gold. Hilarious!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|this was given to my 4 1/2 year old grand daughter and she loves it.  also her brother who is 9 years old enjoys it and it is something they can watch together and both enjoy.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this show because, for me, its the perfect cross between Twilight and TruBlood. Its not as teeny boppy and annoying as Twilight (which I still love) but doesn't have the sex and gore of TruBlood (which I have only see 4 episodes of, so I'm not sure I can really accurately compare the two). The acting is good, the actors are certainly great to look at. It has an awesome story line. They resolve plot lines while still deepening the story. The character development is fantastic. Overall, just a really fun show to watch, I highly recommend it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|great shows and everyone loves to watch.  everyone very happy with this gift.  this was given to my niece who is 22 years old and she was most pleased.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I wish I could read on my Kindle but that is not a possibility anymore as my 3 year old has commandeered it to play this game.  :-)
B005LAJ16I|5.0|this was a gift to my 22 year old niece who had it on her request list because she doesn't have time to watch it while in college.  everyone agrees that this is a fun series.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Got this for a Christmas present for my son we love cuddling up and watching transformers even the old cartoons so now we can cuddle up anytime...thx Amazon for a family moment :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book. Blasted through this one in 3 days and cannot wait to get to the next one!
B007SUW24W|5.0|I loved all of the songs off of the album and plus it came just in time! favorite album of the year.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|Never down loaded onto my kindle fire!  This keeps happening when I order on my computer it never downloads onto my kindle fire.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Love this book! I've read it dozens of times and I never get tired of it. It's my favorite fantasy book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a race through read.  Just when you got you mind set....BOOM!  It is drastically  changed.  Constantly unbelievable!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very graphic and intimate details of love making..  Both characters are very descriptively detailed.  Au thor writes so that you can visually be seduced by the action and stream of consciousness of the characters. Not a gift for your grandmother
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this book would be corny bc the rest was so exciting and reading book summaries online, well let's say they couldn't keep my attention like the first two.. but this was actually quite good.. it was a tad confusing at some parts but you understand what happens later... I can't wait for the movies..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. I really enjoyed reading it. I can't wait to read the next one. Once again great book. Yeah
B008TRUDAS|5.0|The thing that I loved most about this book was how real it was. It was raw and emotional. The characters weren't perfect. They had flaws and they made mistakes just like you and me. Every character in this book was extremely relatable and unique. While reading this book I experienced a multitude of emotions. I would be laughing one second an d then crying the next. Over all, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was exciting from the very beginning. Definitely would recommend. Finished in one day!<br />Great love story and has some great twists.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great movie, packed with lots of action, and a lot of well known actors.  I would recommend this movie for those who love action movies.
0763657875|5.0|I gave this five stars because it is so imaginative, well-made, engaging and educational. It's so much fun to look around at all of the details and bits of information found on each page.
B001R10BMS|1.0|i know, i know, you'd think it would've been that uneven farce version of CASINO ROYALE from 1967, but nope: THIS is the low-water mark of the ertswile spy's cinematic career. if this film had been directed by Ed Wood and starred Gilbert Gottfried as Bond, it would take all of their \\"talents\\" pushed the proverbial 11 to make a cheesier, less satisfying film than the one we ended up with.<br />in this truly pointless, shameless vanity project, that crown prince of overrated, Sean Connery, compounds the sin of being merely adequate for the part AND the sin of failing to recognize that he had passed his prime, at least where this sort of character is concerned, with the sin of callous, cold-blooded mercenaryism. there was no attempt whatsoever to do anything new with the character and/or premise. it's well known that the film is basically a carbon-copy of THUNDERBALL, and has always been well known. i think the damn thing may well of been marketed as such.<br />the rhythm is all off. despite the instantly recognizable kinship to THUNDERBALL, it feels about as much like one of \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli's Bond productions as THE GODFATHER feels like SESAME STREET. one might expect more from director Irvin Kirschner, if only because he did the absolutely faultless THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. but one does have to remember that, while Star Wars and James Bond share the trait of being escapist franchises, they're not exactly twins. no, the real culprit here is the  overzealous producer, one Jack Schwartzman.<br />(although, given Kirchner's confession in the commentary that he feels THUNDERBALL was the very weakest of the Bond films, it does become plausible than he would simply give up \\"trying\\" at some point.)<br />the cleverest thing about the film (and even this only just barely qualifies) is the title. it has nothing to do with the plot: reportedly coined by Connery's wife, it refers to his vow to \\"never again\\" play James Bond a decade or so earlier. (Connery has always freely admitted he's disliked the character from the get-go.) and quite frankly, even if you don't know that story, it's not exactly a backward message on an Ozzy Osbourne album, now is it?<br />one must also consider that it was released hot on the heels of the not exactly perfect but still far more satisfying Roger Moore film OCTOPUSSY. this doesn't exactly create that unsavory feel of milking the cash cow, but it doesn't exactly detract from it, either. i've said it before and i'm willing to say again as often as i have to: the definitive 007 is Roger Moore, and that's all there is to it. whatever stories you've heard to the contrary are just a nasty rumor started by the same idiots who keep saying the Holocaust never happened.<br />i'm certainly not suggesting that Connery is a poor actor. he would grace not one, not two, but THREE of the very greatest films of the next couple years: HIGHLANDER, INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. i'm simply trying to point out where people get confused: the Bond films were the original action franchise - it was the beginning not merely of the franchise, but the subgenre itself - so Connery was admittedly the most TRENDSETTING Bond, but that's  a matter of circumstance, not ability. it's not unheard of to be first AND best, but nobody is best SOLELY because they happen to be first first. by that logic, Icarus - who fashioned crude wings from stray bird feathers and flapped his arms, only to see them melt when he got to close to the sun - achieved more than the Wright Brothers would.<br />simply put, Connery is like Edgar Allan Poe, who invented the detective story, and Moore is like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who fine-tuned and perfected the detective character via Sherlock Holmes. in other words, Connery may not be the pinnacle, but he still made a vital contribution to the series.<br />the official series, that is.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|A little slow at first but gets better with time.  It gets very addicting and it's fun making your dragons grow.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|The Bruder Mack Granite Dump Truck look's just like the real thing a great Christmas Present for my Grandson he loved it.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Great as the first, I will be buying the rest of the soundtracks soon. Incredible choice of artists and music.
B00008AB5D|4.0|This is a great collection, and I was very happy when it came on time. The only problem I had is that the case came shattered, and the paper insert was torn.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|After seeing the Jack Reacher movie, I went on to start reading the series. Just started reading it and I am not disaappointed with this author. I follow James Rollins, Clive Cussler and Daniel Silva and this is in the same attention holding as the other authors. I think I will continue with this series and see how they go.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I haven't read a good book in awhile. This one really reminded me of the feeling I get when I read a book I like. Throughout the story I felt as if I was right there beside Katniss and Peers the entire time. I've read better but I think this book is a great read and can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|Some of the facts and reading was a bit outside of what I call reality.<br />When I explained my thoughts on Clancy I always said he writes fiction that is on the verge of the truth.<br />In this case - it was less on the verge of truth and reality.<br />A bit disappointing...<br />Giora
B005HSL626|5.0|A really great game it is the first time since I've been using the kindle that I have been having fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone it's such a great love story that had me on my toes with anticipation about what would happen next. And Holder omg!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan delivers an amazingly vivid and realistic sequel. This is a book that teens and adults can relate to. While they may be off fighting monsters, they have ordinary teen problems like us. I recommend that teens up read this book for a fantastic adventure! Make sure to read the Percy Jackson series first!
B004EPYZZI|5.0|The movie shows a true question of faith, and an honest faith in God's love & care. I trust the same Lord & have often had similar questions.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This anthology brings back most of the old favorites of these well known singers and writers.  You'll love singing along to music you've forgotten existed.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Being a Rihanna fan, I have expected nothing less for her and with this album, she has outdone herself yet again. I love every single song. My personal favorite song from the album is Jump :) RiRi does it again!!
0345525558|5.0|This is the book for my next book club. Had trouble getting started with the book but once past that it got better.  Am sure there will be alot of discussion at my next meeting
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator doe's great for what I needed it for,simple calculations.It is a very good addition to my Kindle Fire.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I was initially a little hesitant in purchasing because some reviews mentioned lag time in the game.  I played the first one years ago and really liked it, so I had this on my radar for quite some time.  When the price dropped I made the plunge and have not regretted it at all!  It's more fun than the first one thanks to some variety in the puzzles now and again, plus the ability to level up, choose stat boosts, wear equipment, upgrade items, and so on.  All the fun things about an RPG.  It works great on my Kindle Fire running Android.  The device DOES heat up a little after playing awhile, but I have a case so it doesn't bother me.  And typically when I feel it getting &#34;too warm&#34; I know it's time to stop anyway.<br /><br />For the couple $ it costs, this game is well worth it!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Keeps your attention for awhile, sometimes it takes several tries before you can pick something up.  Good puzzle solver game.
B000068OCS|5.0|my son showed this to me on a vcr tape 15 years ago then took the tape. this is philip glass at his best
0399160450|4.0|This book falls short of the gripping intensity and intricacy that I've come to associate with Tom Clancy.  Many of the back stories were simplistic and the plot did not have the concrete under pinnings that make other stories in the series so believable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn's novel was captivating and a surprise (at least to me) up until the very end.  Amy is one sick woman and Nick is not too sane himself.  This is the only Gillian Flynn novel I have read but plan on reading some of her earlier works to see if they are as full of twists and turns as Gone Girl. (P.S. If I were Gillian's husband, I would be very careful :)--jk)
B009Z5BPZK|2.0|I'm a straight male but for some reason I was addicted to this series. My favorite characters were Chuck and Blair. The first two seasons were excellent. Then, when the characters graduated from Constance/St. Jude, the series jumped the shark. The last few seasons focused primarily on the on-again, off-again romance of Chuck and Blair. In season 5, Blair married a French prince (ridiculous plot). However, she had been cheating on him with Chuck. She was pregnant, but they never explained whether the baby belonged to Chuck or the prince. After a car accident, she had a miscarriage, but 2 episodes after the accident, it was almost as if the accident never occurred. No postpartum depression or PTSD. Another inconsistency is that Chuck and Nate rode the NYC transit bus to school in the pilot episode, even though their parents are billionaires and have private chauffeurs.<br /><br />When the series began, Dan was the underdog who everyone rooted for. However, as it progressed, he became a douche. All he did was whine about how he was an outsider who didn't fit in the Upper East Side. He turned on his friends, Vanessa, Nate, and Serena, on numerous occasions. You can't like a series if you despise the male lead character. I also felt that Rufus was underutilized in the last few seasons. They gave him that stupid storyline with Ivy, but they could've done more with his character. As for Serena, in the last few seasons, she had her flavor-of-the week boyfriend, but it was so predictable that she would end up with that loser Dan.<br /><br />The identity of Gossip Girl was revealed in the finale (which I felt was a rushed episode). I won't give away the ending, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. It made no sense in light of the events of prior seasons.<br /><br />If you just have to watch Gossip Girl, only get the first two seasons. Watch Girls on HBO, which is a much better series than Gossip Girl.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I was into temple run until this was avalible on kindle then I got it on my itouch. I like how there is mystery boxes and hoaverboards. I have 2 complaints #1 you need WAY to much of yutani's UFO I mean 500 UFO's to much. #2 the hoaverboards are good to have but they only last a certain time and once that time runs out and you didn't crash you wasted a hoaverboard and I never use them so I have almost 50. Anyway thank you Kiloo and Sybo!
B004QPOVF0|5.0|This DVD was a hit at Christmas! I gave it to my brother and it was playing before we finished unwrapping gifts! Great price, fast shipping, and I am so glad I purchased this! Rock on!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Love this book. Made me feel all the emotions. Sadness, anger, happiness, confused. Great book, and honestly, I couldn't love it More.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A lot of snow on my roof. I used my mind powers to increase the temperature on this VERY EASY TO USE Accuweather dealy. Wow! It actually started increasing the actual temperature outside actually. I acted out of impulses in writing this actually. Whatever! AaaAaaaCh! Great app.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I love this guy and was pleasantly surprised to like almost the entire track.  There are two songs that are not my personal favorite but the rest are wonderful and true to his unusual vocals.
B007N8RULO|4.0|easy to learn and entertaining. like that you can make more difficult or easily change the look of the screen
B005FLX1HS|5.0|This was a gift and my youngest son likes this CD. Great price and brand new as t was described.
B008M87GJK|5.0|looking for thorough, varied perspectives, mostly unbiased news? BBC has it all. really enjoy their articles since they cover everything from current news headlines to articles about home life
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book! I could not put it down. I stayed up until 3 am finishing it. Sad that it's over.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Really enjoyed this series, except the prequel - do not waste your time reading it, or you may pass on the rest of the series and miss a good story
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids love it. It is easy enough to play that my 2 year old enjoys it but interesting enough her 10 year old sister likes it to.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Just a great Christmas movie (Believe)<br />Exciting, full of adventure<br />Would recommend to all.  This will be a classic one day.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is really fun. I think it should be 5 star. I chose 5.really fun app. hope you get it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case does a great job securing my Kindle Fire. It's not too bulky or cumbersome. Perfect for what I was looking for
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|amazing game!!! great time killer and super addicting! been playing for about 2 weeks!! my little brother love Mr. cuddles and lil stomper and we have bought nearly all the gadgets and upgrades!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a great book from the perspective of a person who knows she is having a problem with her memory and confusion.  In my case, it's my husband who is showing dementia and he does not admit it like the lady in this book, but the book is still very interesting and shows how frightening it can be for the patient, whether or not he/she admits the problem.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I bought this for use with my Nikon D7000.  Thought that the Speedlights were insanely expensive, but once I started using it and saw how integrated the flash's controls and sensors are with Nikon cameras, I realized that it was the only product to buy.  I have never been particularly skilled at making really good photos with flash, but this product made me way, way better right out of the box.  With the various diffusers that it has and the easy light output / balancing adjustments you can make, I have found that I use flash for fill or highlighting much, much more frequently than I used to.  Now all I need is a good bracket arm so I can mount the flash to the side of the camera...  Highly recommended.
B009JBZH54|5.0|DVD not blu ray price per movie. great deal and we all know great remakes of a tired story. i got a few for family and friends for xmas.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've been a fan of Tim Ferriss since his freshman book \\"The 4-Hour Workweek\\" and have followed his maniacal escapades since then. \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" reacquainted by body with a better shape and level of fitness, so I imagined \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\" would be along the same lines. I was wrong! It exceeded the previous two books!<br /><br />With Tim's humor sprinkled throughout and great ideas and gadgets, it's a roller coaster of epicurean proportions that will spark an interest in food preparation if you have none, or in my case, re-ignite it and give you other skills along the way.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|My kids really.enjoys the game . The water looks so real. I even get a kick out of it. Great game
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game, a real challenge to keep a sharp mind while it is fun to play. Yay man

0756655307|5.0|It's really interesting - it's only flaw is its size and weight.  Can settle any geek disagreement.  (the official 11 year old assessment)

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|made a good addition to my dvd collection, was in great shape played well. I would recommend this to a friend
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually read much, but decided to try again after I got s Kindle for Christmas. A friend recommended this to me and I finished  it in 3 days, pretty good for a non reader. I couldn't put it down it was easy to read and just awesome! It got more intense with every page. Thank you!
0061906220|5.0|This book is a fun book to share with your little ones.  I sing the story to my grandaughter who nods her head in delight.  The story teaches acceptance and making the best out of a situation.  Hooray for Pete the Cat!
1419701533|5.0|Bought them for my 9yr old and she loves them. She decided paperbacks were much lighter though! Came in a sturdy box that holds all 5 books. Really great buy for any child.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I use this when doing video for sports, I will use my Nikon D600 on it and it's very sturdy, you have full command for shooting/video with this device. Great price as well. I am looking to test it for snowboarding this season, sure it will work great.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|same old story. Now with medications. Good diversion, but easy to forget. No good hand to hand combat that was in the other ones.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Except for the interesting premise of the story, casting the former president as Buffy, the movie is extremely humdrum. Story is entirely predictable, the action scenes mildly exciting.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Essentially a one-trick pony. The premise is funny at first, but not funny enough to support an entire movie. Still, if you've got nothing better, there are worse ways to spend an evening.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Very great movie!! This movie is a twisted romance in which time means everything!! It made me cry! I really enjoyed this movie and i recommend this to everyone!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Connector they works.  I only buy genuine products so I am never disappointed. This product does what's expected, so there's nothing else to say.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I greatly enjoyed the first book of the series and was excited to see how the main character Katniss developed from the events in her life. I was sorely disappointed by the writing style in the 2nd and 3rd books. The character Katniss wasn't even a shadow of her original self by the end of the series and there was no well-written transformation to orchestrate this change.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My family enjoyed this movie from my teenager to my three year old. Great laugh. Would definitely recommend it to all.
B007NQLK3K|5.0|This figure is Awesome! The paint, the detail within the figure itself and the joints, man!<br />Good God the joints!<br /><br />I'm going to do a bit of word-smithing on this one and say:<br />The Pose-ability is through the roof.<br /><br />If you've been an avid Revoltech collector then you might already be accustom to this, but if you're like myself; new to Revoltech, interested in pose-able figures and a fan of Transformers...<br /><br />Well, then this one is for you buddy!<br /><br />I bought Bumblebee in tandem with the Optimus Prime figure also available through Revoltech, and I am remarkably pleased with both of them.<br /><br />However on a side note; Both Optimus and Bumblebee, are around the same size. This would seem a bit odd indeed to the hardcore audience of the Transformers universe, but I stood aside from myself on that one and accepted these representations for what they are:<br /><br />And that is, truly badass figures.<br /><br />I recommend them!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Every bit as good as season one. I can hardly wait for season 3. Beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes. I love anticipating what marvelous gem will fall next from Maggie Smith's lips. Great script and fabulous delivery.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing! Unbelievable, I can't wait to read the last book I hope it has a happy ending..he better not die
B000PAAH3K|3.0|Repetitive, but thought provoking.  The author tends to make the sames points using other's research.  Fairly basic premise with some opposing points of view as well.  Worth a read if you're bored.  Otherwise, just read the overview and save the time and money.
B007VUCAVO|1.0|Where is it? My experience with this item is zip. Don't know where it is. Never rec'd any notice from Amozon or any one else.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|I love Jamie Oliver and can no longer get his shows on my cable lineup.  This app is great because in addition to the multitude of recipes, it includes his cooking demonstrations and video how-to's for things both new and experienced cooks could use.  I highly recommend this app!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is really a great game.  I played for hours and found it hard to stop.  Higher levels are challenging and really tests skills.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought that this a was a brilliant piece of  mythological adventure. It was very exciting with fabulous twists and turns. I CAN'T wait until Riordan releases the next one!
B008MEM24S|3.0|I love the game. But it was a little slow. Like I said it is good. And it said I needed to pay for those levels when I bought the game. If u like it I love it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A most unusual read, Very transfixing and enjoyable. Look forward to more Gillian Glynn work in the near future. Amen!
B008CX2A2I|5.0|My receiver has two USB ports, a front one and a back one. I keep the adapter in the back USB port and it connects seamlessly to my phone. It's great playing all my internet radio stations and MP3s from my phone thru my stereo.
B008HTQ28K|5.0|The Racketeer. Very readable, as usual. Great read. Kept one transfixed  from the beginning to the end. A great production.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Quality of recordings were just OK.  Just saw the movie and I didn't think the quality was nearly as good
0857685627|5.0|This is a great book about the artistry and creation of the halo universe. Lots of awesome art. If you own all the halo games then this is a book you will want to own.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Sweet love story with some unexpected twist, read it in two days and wanted more and I'm not a regular reader!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my parents, and they were very happy to receive it.  So far everything is great, although it may take a while to get through them all lol!  Shipping was fast too!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I have the movie and I have played it death, now I have the songs to sing with and I just love Aba, so this is right up my ally!
B008Q09K2U|4.0|If you are a Nelson de Mille fan, then this is an essential read.  Yet again, de Mille captures the reader's attention  from the start and he builds up the pace, willing the reader to carry on.  It was a most worthwhile purchase and I encourage anyone who enjoys a good thriller to read it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Great app, the only drawback are the ads you have to skip on each new game. Overall easy to use and settings are simple to personalize.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E L James wrote some of the hottest, sexiest, once-taboo scenes I have ever read.  Loved the series and couldn't put down a single book once I got started.
1449410243|2.0|I love the title and concept but...I didn't find the bobs funny at all.  Just obnoxious and juvenile.  Like someone else posted, maybe if I worked in a cubicle I would've liked the repetitive office jokes.  The humor was also crass at times.  Gay demon in your cat??  Not funny.  I returned the book asap.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L James wrote some of the hottest, sexiest, once-taboo scenes I have ever read.  Loved the series and couldn't put down a single book once I got started.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|Great product.  VERY solid ! !  Love this and carry it with me where I can't take other defensive items!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Boring. Like Chelsea Handlers books much better. I laughed a little but it was more sentimental than comedic. It was ok.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Looking for some newer stuff for Christmas.  This CD fits the bill nicely. Would recommend this as an addition to anyone's Christmas CD's.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game!  It would be better if there were some \\"bonus\\" rounds or something to change it up a little.  Gets a bit repetitive after a while..causing me to lose interest.
1452110581|5.0|For the cat lover this sweet imaginative book will be familiar!  It's very relatable if you have cats or know someone who loves their cat.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Crashes as soon as it starts. Samsung vibrant for tmobile. Tried reinstalling but still no luck. A really big shame
B004LUS390|4.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire and it's quite versatile. The interface is a bit clunky ... you have to constantly adjust some element such as screen size, brush, etc., and with the way the double taps for changes are set up it's prone to changing color from the color you are using to render in to whatever the background is. Saving and sharing is relatively easy, and the product can be easily worked with.  While its capable of high detail, the constant adjustments that have to be made keep the process from being fluid. However, with patience, the outcome is quite acceptable. If you are serious about using this I would choose this over the express version.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|To be quite honest I was reluctant to start this book, solely because I had heard of all the film's \\"hype\\" and what not. But it was better than I expected! The book was very enjoyable, Katniss is great female lead...very strong and bold! All in all I liked the book however I don't think I will reading the other books in the series....not my exact cup of tea...so I'm on the fence.
B005I64U5C|5.0|Really shows off grandfathers 3-D plasma. I love the fact that I have the option to watch on the big screen or the small bedroom tv.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good game, New twist on match 3 game. Almost half done with it but have been pleasantly surprised by it. Cut scenes (so far) have been well animated with voiceovers. Would look into buying other games from studio if same quality.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|excellent deal , three great movies , will always enjoy having this collection availible, anyone who enjoys these movies should buy this bundle
B008Y1YJ90|2.0|The story line was very confusing. Better suited for children. Would not recommend to anyone. Very childish movie. Bad. Bad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is so good ....so far very good..wonderful...time Rome consumingly awesome best thing I ever read in my life
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I love this trilogy. Great set of movies at bargain basement prices. I was able to score the set at 10 bucks so that was also great!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the  best game for android I've played so far.  I love it!  As good as any of the PC versions.  Beautiful graphics.  Good story.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was really good til it got closer to the end, then it got stupid.  It was worth reading it to the end though.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Unfortunately, you have to sit patiently through a bad plot to get to the entertaining dance scenes. But you have to give it to those guys, they can really move!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. sushi game is my fab :-) so much fun. well all the games are really fun to play. I could play them everyday!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|cute and takes up time otherwise used working, or doing homework,keeps your intrest, great game for the money, no brainer
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I luv this book it makes me emotional and I'm cry when I in my room alone but when I dropped my kindle on my face this were tears of payn not from sadness anyways 7 stars I rlly luv this book for luv nd blessings we accept the luv we think we deserve love always, Charlie
B008BGNMZU|5.0|Bought as a gift, received on time husband love this gift. Received it on time was not disappointed. Great service.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't really write reviews so that should tell you something.  The book was awesome, can't wait to read the third one.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Better than I imagined. Once we got it we tried out our new blue ray and had a marathon! Amazing!
B008JF8O9M|4.0|Set this up on my Motorola MB865 phone, my Kindle Fire, and my Samsung Tab 2 10.1.  I'm printing to my networked printers.  My Samsung ML-2510 and Epson Stylus Photo R220.  Not the latest printers but both were available via PrintBot.<br />You can't print directly from applications but you can select the document or pdf from a file menu.  Or with my Tab2 I can print a screenshot of anything.  Wow.  Not exactly what I hoped but it works great.  It would be 5 stars if it could print from the applications.  That's really a function of the devices, not this application.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|I enjoyed the idea that santa claus was a hereditary &#34;monarchy&#34; that was continued by a reigning Santa selecting his heir. Arthur appeared to be the least likely to win the &#34;throne&#34; considering his competition is his incredibly innovative and effective brother Steve.  But Steve lacks an essential trait that his younger brother has...empathy for the children they serve.  How this realization is made is a clever and often hysterical story.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A great book....I enjoyed the story all the way through.  I had never read Kate Morton before, but would gladly read something else by her.  I have been told that this is one of the best of her books.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Too slow. Clumsy ending.<br />Could've been better. Justin was good. Expected more from Clint Eastwood, but I guess I overestimated him on a baseball movie.
0393964582|2.0|Here is the other book I had hoped to finish by last Halloween.  I don't know if it is my open reading list that is too long, or that the fact that this book needs an editor so badly, that made me not only take months to get through it (it is quite short) but actually put it back on the shelf and gave up on it half way through.<br /><br />As with Dracula (sorry to compare it but I have always held the two in common), here is an example of literature using the \\"letters from home\\" and \\"diary entry\\" framework.  Unlike Dracula, though, where this convention barely (very barely) worked, in Frankenstein it doesn't work at all and is abandoned completely by the author except at the beginning to set the book up and at the end to tie it together.<br /><br />The book would have remained a plodding, over-worded tale without the \\"letters\\" convention but with it, credulity is strained to the breaking point and it becomes hard to ignore the failure and see much else here.  That said...<br /><br />I really wanted to like the book.  The writing, in terms of its images and judging only the craft of wordsmithing, is pretty good and might actually be the better of the two books (sorry, Dracula again...) but the story is so full of holes and so completely beyond anything that I could accept, even for the sake of the work, that it just falls down in the end.<br /><br />Sorry Mary...  You needed an editor and this book could have been very good.  Don't let it bother you too much...  your story has transcended its limitations and fueled many an imagination.  How lucky for you that so few people read.
157421327X|5.0|This is a great way to get started.  The instructions are specific and easy to follow.  Zentangle Basics is definitly for beginners.
B000INAXGU|4.0|Great CD!<br /><br />Owned it a few years back<br />Great listen once again<br />great band, always speak their mind and the TRUTH!
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|The last few Jack Reacher books seemed to me to be running out of steam because they were becoming a bit repetitive. Many authors who have written several books with the same character try to spice things up by writing a prequel or revisiting an earlier time in the character's career and mostly they fail to achieve their objective. In \\"The Affair\\" Lee Child not only succeeds but IMHO serves up one of the best of the Jack Reacher series.<br /><br />The reason this book works so well is that Child has never really fully explored the background to Reacher leaving the Army and becoming a drifter. This book is very good because it is great vintage Reacher and goes back to the time when he was at the top of his game as a military policeman. Reacher displays all of his great investigative skills, an unbelievable ability defend himself against overwhelming odds and a tenacity to close a case even if it goes against orders by his superiors.<br /><br />In this book we are introduced to Elizabeth Devereaux, the Sheriff of small town in Mississippi close to a large US Special Forces Base. Devereaux is a stunningly beautiful woman who has recently returned to her home town after several years with the military police of the Marines. She is investigating a brutal murder of a beautiful woman she suspects may have been committed by someone from the Base. Because of the potential impact on the Base, Reacher is sent there undercover, but with her military police background Devereaux soon spots Reacher and they start to look at the case together. As they progress their investigations they become more closely involved.<br /><br />Lee Child has written a Jack Reacher book with a bit of everything - a murder mystery, military cover-ups, hired militia, corruption at the highest political level and some romance. This is all set against the strange background of a huge freight train that shakes and deafens the small town every midnight.<br /><br />While it is clear that his superiors are not happy with him, we learn the actual reason why Reacher leaves the Army and becomes a drifter - and it really is something of a surprise.t happy with him, we learn the actual reason why Reacher leaves the Army and becomes a drifter - and it really is something of a surprise.
B003ZSH606|4.0|Didn't know this was out<br />Discovered this on a random amazon search<br /><br />Great songs, Love the new sounds and mix up!! Eve had some reggae sounds n there!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Awesome show, and watching it via amazon worked well. It was cheaper than purchasing at iTunes, so I recommend it if you need to watch more than one episode.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|The concept of a teddy bear being a part of normal, every day society is just part of what makes this a funny movie. Sure, it has some crude and raunchy humor at times but it's still funny. This isn't a movie for kids just because there's a teddy bear in it. It had some laugh out loud, tears in my eyes from laughing moments. Hope they make another one.
B009CPGZFS|4.0|I really love the show. I wish I could the entire series but paying for every episode would be to expensive. I really love the show though. I hope watch more.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Season 3 proves to be just as hilarious as the first two seasons. I highly recommend this to anyone that loves this show. You will not be disappointed!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Once again Susan has proven that she is one of the greatest vocalist of all times. This album is another magnificient tribute to her voice. I hope there are many albums to come. Her voice is clear, and has such presence that it gives one chills. To think that we have missed so much of her life and her voice is saddening.
B005JE1KHE|4.0|Having spent all my reading life (and it's a long one) avoiding science fiction and fantasy a new world has opened up to me this last year.  On the recommendation of a respected work colleague I have been reading George Martin and now Robin Hobb. I am really enjoying  this trilogy - I'm half way through the second book.  What an excellent story teller Robin Hobb is - and a really good writer.  She paints this world with such realism that you easily slip into the pages and inhabit her creation.<br /><br />If fantasy is your bag then you will enjoy this writer.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This is a beautiful combination of life with certain death or a second chance at a New life that is out of this world.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I have read all of the Jack Ryan stories and now the Jack Ryan Jr as well and found them to be true thrillers, hard to put down and must reads.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I chose this rating because it was sent right away.<br />My husband has always liked this flick.<br />I would recommend this movie.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I rated this movie a 5 because it is a family movie &  a classic you could watch again & again.<br />I would recommend this movie to a friend
B000JQUKKU|5.0|If ever you're feeling a little out of sorts about Christmas, this is the story that will set you back right.<br /><br />For most of my life I relied on movie versions of A Christmas Carol, until 2011, when I was grieving the death of my father. I saw I could get a free version of this book for Kindle and began the most pleasant adventure of Christmas ever.<br /><br />I've just read the story again (2012) and it was even better, as I found even more to like about the tale.<br /><br />May we all find the place in our hearts where we feel like Scrooge at times, and be converted to the true Christmas Spirit by this most wonderful work of Charles Dickens.
096798467X|4.0|I love this book. The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is because the pictures make it look easy. It takes much planning and prepping to pull off one of these. Otherwise, this is a fabulous guide.
B008QYT7DI|2.0|I was so excited when I first downloaded this book.  Its been on my must read list for quite a while.  However, it does not work on any of the Kindle products that I have, except for the cloud reader on my iphone.  I have a Kindle keyboard and it doesn't work on that.  I have the cloud reader on my computer (windows 8) and it doesn't work on that.  I can't read on my phone because the text is waaaayyyyyy too small and gives me a headache.  I am so disappointed.  It seems as though I am going to have to less amazon Kindle books purchasing and take advantage of my local library.
1416936386|5.0|This was a gift and I received it in impeccable condition! The person receiving it was very pleased and commented on how nice it looked!
B006O6F932|5.0|Both of my daughters ages 4 1/2 and 7 absolutely love love loves this toy. I am beyond pleased with it and so happy I found it for the prices I did just before Christmas.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This entry in the series has plenty of action. But the story lines aren't always satisfying. I visualize the Ryan, Clark, and Chavez characters from the Clear and Present Danger movie adaptation. I find that makes it more interesting to track their progress through \\"life\\".
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved every page. It is a unique perspective, both the dogs and the mans slant on tough issues.  I am telling all my friends to read it.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|The narrative was positively spellbinding and carried me along to read this book almost in one go.<br />At times I thought the story could be true as the description of Pi's day to day life adrift on the boat was so<br />detailed and real.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A bold and dangerous journey not planned nor wanted but shows the strength and will of man to live. A boy prepared by his parents and beliefs to meet a challenge no one should experience. Surreal and surprising. A must read.
1449410243|5.0|Some content from theoatmeal.com combined with new content, and it even comes with a pullout poster.  Great deal for a hilarious book from an excellent author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best! It is better than twitter, instagram,&amp;facebook!!If someone has told you that pinterest is arts&amp;crafts.......they were wrong.It is actually EXTREMELY similar to instagram but this site is generally directed towards females.I definatly love this website and give it 5 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
B002N5N5LG|5.0|When a show has such a rabid fan-base, it's clear that there's something to it.  Love it or hate it, it's a witty, creative, experimental comedy that rewards the devoted viewer.  DVDs are good quality and have insane rewatchability.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was the best... I could not stop reading it!!! It was the best book ever in my life!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The game is absurdly fun to play, the perfect mix of skill and chance.  However, the price is far too high for some plastic game pieces and crappy cardboard hexagons that make up the gameboard.  The hexagons warp over time, meaning they don't fit snugly together after a while.  Since the entire game is played along the edges of the hexagons, this is rather annoying.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I use to watch the movie all the time I'm glad I finally read the Book is amazing I highly recommend it
B004XDYJRU|5.0|The App is a very good app if you want to listen to your local police,fire,ems scanners. Also you can listen to your local aviation channels. Most all of my local radio stations the app found also. Im very pleased with the TuneIn Radio App.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|best app i have on kindle fire and best app i will ever have on a phone or ipod or some<br /> thing like that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I have been watching the series and have decided to read the books and I love this book and now on to the next
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Raw, shocking, and beautifully written. This is the type of book that leaves an emotional residue behind in your mind.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My all time favorite Christmas movie. It arrived fast and was properly packaged so the dvd was intact upon receiving. Would buy again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have to admit i was pretty sketchy about this book because it didn't seem like the type of books i usually read, but i fell in love with it.
1439196834|5.0|This book is hilarious and mirrors the show. If you're a HIMYM fan and think Barney Stinson is hilarious you'll enjoy this book. It's short but makes for a good laugh.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Absolutely hilarious.  I am 8 and read this book in 5 hours.  I want more Diary of a Wimpy Kid books!
B000MKD9P6|4.0|I love this movie. The movie arrived when expected. I deducted one star because the dvd cover had a puncture in it that went through to the dvd. The dvd itself was intact though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this book is amazing, I would recommend it to people who love action and romance books after I read the hunger games I was hooked a then started reading the whole series,  I love the twist of romance in it.The whole series is wonderful
143911000X|5.0|This book is hilarious and mirrors the show. If you're a HIMYM fan and think Barney Stinson is hilarious you'll enjoy this book. It's short but makes for a good laugh.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Though the series got a bit weaker after the second film, the bleak vision of a future dominated by unscrupulous corporations and filled with slimy xenomorphs has stood the test of time, and still stands as seminal material in the science fiction canon. Every steely-eyed space marine of the last twenty years owes his existence to Ripley and hicks, and every nasty alien owes a debt to H.R. Giger
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game so much! I liked the original Angry Birds, too, but come on...its Star Wars themed! A bit pricey, but in this case you get what you pay for; a fun, cool game that will be hard to put down.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Clint's grumpy old man act is tired and boring at this point. Amy Adams said her lines with faint enthusiasism. The baseball portions were frankly stupid and the whole thing was as predictable as a sunrise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great fast app that's easy and fun to use. literally any one can use this. plus the boards look really nice when swooping over
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Great story telling... Great visuals... Dragons. Steampunk, awesome soundtrack, what more can you ask for!? Snyder had won me over with his first film (dawn of the dead remake ) and every film since. Cannot wait for man of steel.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Good time pass game. Better than I thought it would be...even a little challenging at times to get all the stars...
B008OTTRXU|4.0|I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  It is one of those things that you are sort of embarrassed to admit you like - a guilty pleasure.  Not my genre of music for sure, but it gets in my head and I find myself singing along.  It is clean and upbeat.  Rare to find these days!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and must admit, I was confused.  There seemed like there were missing pieces.  Now after reading the book, the missing pieces fell in place.  Before, I didn't really care if I watched the movie again.  However, now that I have the bigger picture from reading the book, I would like to see it again.  A must-read, preferably before watching the film!
B003M2DWE4|4.0|I got this for my 10-year-old to wake him up.  I was disappointed because it takes batteries instead of plugging up.  It ran fast the first couple of days and the alarm is not very loud.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I was searching for something different and came across the rare gem. This is a great cd. Rebecca has sultry beautiful voice.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|a most excellent game &amp; it plays perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  I rarely write reviews but this game is well deserving of a positive review.  I highly recommend it!
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Absolutely great but after a while you must buy a plain to continue. But other than that ossam. Cool game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wanted to see the hype about the movie so I read the book first. Now I can't wait to finally see the movie.
1400069289|5.0|I ordered this book for reading material over Christmas Break and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. It was very informative
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved the three books.  couldn't stop reading. I liked the story wich involved a love story but also the struggles to change what seemed impossible.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I bought another product from this site and was given a $3 instant video credit and since it was right around Christmas time I figured a Christmas movie was a good choice.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Highly recommend this for anyone who loves the classic machine game. My whole family is addicted to it. Graphics and physics are great
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Previous to buying this movie I hadn't seen it all the way through. Such a fresh new beginning for such a great series
B009AY04A8|5.0|I really enjoy hidden object games like this and Nevosoft is one of the best developers. I've purchased all their games. Scenes are very chatty but can bypass that by going to Menu then Skip Dialogue. The graphics, storyline and characters are well thought of.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app has helped me so much in math class my grade has raised from a B to an A. Also,  it works fast you can type in a problem and in a blink of an eye you would have your CORRECT answer. I seriously recemmend you buy this app... like... NOW! ;-)
B00275EHJG|1.0|I got this as a Christmas present for my young son and it doesn't play.  We are sending it back.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|Not as good as other three before it but ok. Kind of lame ending.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1582406723|5.0|My husband liked it.  He is a fan of the show. I enjoy the show where they talk about the show, so I may read it also.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I absolutely love this app and I recommend it to everyone. It's a great way for me to make lists and notes regardless of whether I am af work on my computer or using my Fire or Android phone. It's also a great tool for my wife to send me a shopping list.
B005LAIISA|4.0|We have all of the Ice Age movies and had to add this one to our collection.  The grand kids have seen it along with other friends kids and they all love it.  I will gt a chance to see it when we get it back from being borrowed
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of my favorite all time books!  It will make you look in your own life and find representation for the characters!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I was looking for an engineering calculator.  This calculator is pretty basic. It works OK, but doesn't do what I want it to do.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Certainly a lot of technology has gone into the making of this film. One good thing about the movie is the hero is always on the run and people are constantly chasing him. Such movies are always bound to keep you interested. If you are looking for some futuristic action during the weekend try this!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grishan's typical good read.  Not great, but a good way to pass the time on an airplane.  Tricky ending is satisfying
B0017KIBAI|4.0|I may just be a &#34;big fella'&#34;, but I do believe that the diminutive frame of this controller gives the player a little trouble. The D-Pad and yellow analog joystick aren't too far off from being conjoined twins, if you catch my drift. Actually, I remember the N64 controller being a bit larger, too. Otherwise, the buttons work fine. They stick a bit in the beginning, but through wear - they become button-mashin' friendly. You might even have to become more familiar with the layout on the controller (because it isn't your traditional Nintendo design - mind you, it's for the Nintendo Gamecube). Appreciate the fair price and the additional &#34;blast to the past&#34; for all of the original Super Mario fans ( I DO miss my old Nintendo controller compared to the Wii Remotes, I admit it)!
B000SW16LC|5.0|We loved it.  All time classic.  Great resolution too.  Gotta have kinda movie.  Whole family loved it.  Glad we bought it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wish there was more things like inventory and enchanting.<br />too short too short too short<br />too short<br />too short
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never read a book better, everything was perfect...<br /><br />I feel lucky for reading it, I feel very lucky for reading it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You have to choose which wrong choice feels least wrong \\".<br /><br />Okay,  this was a good book, I am tempted to read it again,  immediately after because I feel like I missed something important.<br /><br />This book starts out about a 17 year old girl name Sky. She was adopted and homeschooled by a vegan,  anti-technology, 30 something year old woman name Karen who loves her to pieces. Sky is the socially deprived, boy crazy but NOT boy crazy teen with a truly boy crazy best friend named Six whose bedroom window is just feet from hers. Sky is pretty normal besides the fact she is unable to truly \\"feel \\". Seems like a pretty square YA book, right? But oh how it is not.<br /><br />Things start changing, she meets Holden and he ignites foreign feelings within Sky.......and this is when the book goes to a whole.new.level....a deep...dark.....intriguing pit of page turning bliss.<br /><br />Wow, this book goes deep and touches on very delicate subjects with a silk glove. I stay away from dark and depressing books because I read for the \\"happy endings \\" and this book took me on an interesting ride.<br /><br />I rode through loneliness, teenage giggles, childhood tears, fears and purple friendship bracelets. I experienced sadness, lough out loud happiness, my heart was broken and then welded back together. Strangely,  this author does not leave one high and dry with emotionally raging and draining scenerios, she actually helps you cope with her drama by offering a hot cup of coco with the plate of @#$% she serves your soul.<br /><br />I will read this again and will tell others to read it.......wow.....nicely done.
B006TTC54A|5.0|The movie is fantastic which I knew before I bought it. What impressed me most was the quality of picture in the bluray considering how old this movie is.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. We haven't watched the dvd's yet but everything looks great!
B0072V394E|4.0|I first saw this movie around 1968 and when I saw the new Django with j. Fox I decided to revisit the original Django and really had a great time watching it. Nice movie
B009KKLQKO|1.0|I was in the center front row of two of their concerts in Australia. Previous tours to Australia by Mike Love's 'Beach Boys' saw people walking out of the concert so I wasn't expecting 'too much'. The first concert in Brisbane was so good I dragged friends down to Sydney (600 miles away) to see them again.<br /><br />The best part of this video - the backing band. The worst part - besides my blu ray copy being out of sync - the Beach Boys themselves. Unfortunately this DVD portrays a non working band, with little or no interaction between them. Five old men (were they still being grumpy with each other) going through the motions; a dysfunctional 'family' at its best. Obviously recorded at the early stages of their world tour with a 'made for TV' look - watch it once - never to be watched again.<br /><br />A buddy set me a recording of the entire Sydney concert recorded on his iphone which is better than this DVD.<br /><br />Dismissing the out of sync problem, for me there were only two high points. Al Jardine's voice is as good as ever on 'Help Me Rhonda' and the pick song \\"All This Is That\\" ironically written by Al Jardine, Mike Love and Carl Wilson from the acrimonious \\"Carl and Passions\\" album where Bruce Johnson 'left' the band.<br /><br />One can only hope there is a real recording of the tour that will be released sometime in the future that does capture what a lot of us felt and saw in the last few months of the tour.<br /><br />Knowing what I know would I buy this DVD? Yes, because I've bought everything they have ever recorded and have just about everything they ever put down in a studio including stuff that has never been released.<br /><br />Is this really the worst ever recording of the Beach Boys? Other than some of the terrible uploads from phones on YouTube I think it probably is.<br /><br />For me the best ever Beach Boys recording is 'Live at Knebworth' recorded in England 1980.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|I really liked this movie, glad I didn't see in theatres.  The bad cop guy in this film is a horrible actor, really bad.  He made me want to just turn the movie off at several points.  The action was fun, not completely realistic, but hey its a movie for a cold Saturday night when there is to much snow on the road to go to the theatre.  Its a strong 3 stars.  Not a lot of violence, but when there is it is pretty rough for me.(the end scene with bad cop)
B004LWZWGA|4.0|As far as trilogy enders go (Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Santa Clause) this is hands down awesome...but that's only because the bar has been set so low. I'd rate The Dark Knight Rises slightly ahead of Star Wars III, but it doesn't hold up to the standards of quality set in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The pacing was forced, the story illogical, and a sense that this was Batman you were seeing, but that everything was trying to be wrapped up prematurely, like half the development team was doing their job and the other half just wanted to get it over with and get paid.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Bruce Wayne losing Wayne Corporation: between his wits and Lucius Fox that would never happen, nor would they build a fusion reactor without realizing beforehand that the technology could be converted into a bomb. That's an oversight neither man would make. Second, Bruce's personal fortune would not be tied up in a single location for someone to steal with a thumb print at the stock exchange. He would have bank accounts, etc that would be uneffected, so the idea of him being broke is ridiculous. Still, the way the movie is filmed it seems plausible if you don't think too hard and just go along for the ride, as most people seem to do with movies.<br /><br />Catwoman: pleasant surprise to see Anne Hathaway fit the roll so well. Her acting saved a badly written part, for her betraying Batman to his death then falling in love with him makes no sense, nor does Batman's telling her she's making a serious mistake and then is all 'forgive and forget' later. He didn't even punch her once for that, even though he nearly died.<br /><br />The Bat Plane: Fox says it's just another Wayne prototype...so where's it been the past 8 years? If it had been something Fox had been working on in the interim, fine, but he doesn't say that, so why didn't he give this to Bruce in Batman Begins? That said, the design and function is awesome. Good tech work, bad writing.<br /><br />Bruce the Hermit: The knee leg injury was said to have been from the fall that killed Dent, but we see Batman running away afterwards...so no serious injury. He's had 8 years of 'retirement' to heal up, get reconstructive surgery, whatever. No excuse for him to be in anything but perfect health. As for being a recluse, he should be a fit recluse, otherwise all the lessons he learned in the first two movies are tossed aside. Batman was supposed to be on the run, every night patroling the city looking for bad guys and having to run from the police at the same time, not retire and live in the east wing of Wayne manor pining over Rachel.<br /><br />Ras's daughter: Why wasn't she there when Bruce was trained? Was she already on the board of Wayne Enterprises? She and Bane pop out of thin air into the league of Shadows storyline.<br /><br />Bane: Supposed to get stronger from the drugs, not use them as painkillers for an injury that we never get to see. He is clunky, slow, and strong. Batman's fighting knowledge should have him dancing around the man with hit and run attacks, not going at him fist to fist. Bane's victory was forced. As for his line about having grown up in the dark...he lived in a prison with a giant sunroof!<br /><br />Gotham held hostage for 5 months: no point in this save to give Bruce time to heal and escape. If they planned on nuking the city they'd do it. If they planned on taking over and staging a revolution, they'd do it. Both didn't fit. Ras's manipulation was designed to destroy the city, not play with them. This was not a true league of shadows operation.<br /><br />Alfred leaves: not true to character, nor his revealing the note he'd burnt. His absence seemed to be written in to get Bruce alone and poor. Having a Butler sticking around would be counter productive. Again, the storyline was forced here.<br /><br />Bridge blown to stop bus: All the bridges were blown in the beginning...save one??? Supposedly to get supplies in, you assume, butthen you see barricades and fencing put up to keep people from getting out. Again, written in just to have something to blow up at the end for dramatic purposes.<br /><br />Robin discovers Batman: Apparently happens due to a look on Bruce Wayne's face, showing him the same pain at having lost his parents. But wait a second...Bruce Wayne lost his parents, so Bruce Wayne should look like that. Batman didn't lose his parents, as far as everyone knows, so where's the link between Bruce and Batman? Total bomb here. Makes zero sense.<br /><br />Training Robin: a few conversations, a bad of goodies, nothing more.<br /><br />Gordon's speach: Conveniently ends up in Bane's hands. He says 'search him' and the first thing the goons grab out of his pockets is a bunch of paper? They then find a gun...shouldn't they have got his gun when they knocked him out in the first place? Bad writing here, all to get the speach into Bane's hands.<br /><br />Clean Slate: Very convenient technology. Daggot's little speach points that out well.<br /><br />Fighting: Not enough effort put into this. Batman Begins level of choreography was not replicated. Bummer. You can see bad guys waiting around waiting their turn to get hit.<br /><br />Police mob at end: So cliche it doesn't deserve to be in Batman. Walk up at tanks held by criminals? Seriously? Bad writing again.<br /><br />Batman's armory: How did Bane find it? How did he know where to look for it? It was supposed to be a secret, so where was the security breach? Never explained.<br /><br />Batman getting owned: Little things like Catwoman disappearing when his back is turned...Batman doesn't turn his back. He's the badass, and the writing waters down the character to trump up catwoman. This was much more a Bruce Wayne movie than a Batman movie, and they didn't do Bruce Wayne well either. His intelligence disappears at convenient times.<br /><br />Bruce running away with Catwoman: nice ending after thinking he's dead, but totally out of character. Both them hooking up and him quitting being Batman. Gothan is a mess, Gordon needs help, and he leaves an untrained newbie to take care of everything and even a brand new bat signal on the roof? No, totally not right. Bruce Wayne leaving Gotham behind permanently and running off(supposedly broke)just doesn't fit. Batman/Bruce is not supposed to be happy. He is a tragic figure turned hero...not a lover/family man. Him being happy is not the objective, him keeping other people from avoiding the loss that plagues him is. That is Batman.<br /><br />A lot of good things in this movie, but the writing was subpar and contradictory with the previous two films. In the end it's worth watching a few times, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't live up to Batman Begins, at all.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game is moderately fun, but nothing addictive.  Plus it crashes my Kindle Fire HD regularly... Worth every penny, hah hah
B00447L4JG|5.0|My daughter has wantedc this for awhile and she got it for christmas, she was thrilled...she will get so much enjoyment out of her DVD....I am so happy we got this for her...
B009FZFONO|5.0|3$? what can you get better before the actual physical discs are available. if you can wait, then wait 5star show
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the better games, it easy but still make it interesting. I normally don't do games but thought I would give this one a try. I am glad I did, and it's enjoying.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Good useful app. Takes time for the second  up, however it is really useful after that and helpful. There is plenty of good information that it supplies you.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I bought this because all the reviews I'd read at various gaming websites had been overwhelmingly positive. After playing through the game multiple times, I can safely say that the reviews are correct. It plays like an incredibly well written &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; novel with tons of references to psychology, science fiction, and physics. It's not simply reading and choosing though- there are a number of &#34;point and click&#34; puzzle sequences that are challenging without ever being nonsensical. I recommend this game wholeheartedly.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|WooHoo, for Kelly Clarkson, would buy again, why do you have to put 17 words or more in a review to submit?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun way to challenge your mind. The levels get harder and stay challenging but don't get so tough you don't want to play.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome game spent hours so far on it and still loving it very easy to keep playing and they don't hassle u on buying more coins and very easy to achieve coins so u don't have to spent cash
B000EHSVOG|3.0|I received The Towering Inferno for Christmas this year. I first saw the movie as a young teen and always liked it. The DVD was well done and the movie played beautifully. I was, however, disappointed that the second DVD, containing the special features, does not work past the first 8 seconds! All we were able to access on it was the Warning about illegal copying. Sigh...
B00005JKNC|5.0|...Jim Carrey shows real talent in a welcome serious role.  Some of the reviews that I have read disturb me.  They seem to imply that the sentiments are phoney and that it should have been a Capra type satire...<br /><br />...A small town that lost 60 of its sons in the war.  Exceptionally bad luck for such a small place... like what happened to the community of Deer Island, Maine during the Civil War.  The impact of that can tear the heart out of a community... especially after the war when it turns out that all evil has *not* been vanquished in the world... Growing up in the 1950s, I knew many families that had lost sons, fathers, brothers in WWII... \\"Gold Star\\" flags still showed in windows... the number of stars represented the number of sons lost (blue stars showed sons serving)<br /><br />...The apparent return of the most distinguished of the boys thought to be dead... nine years later... gives the town a shot of hope and enthusiasm... The HUAC plot is disposable compared to the unfolding of the story in the community.  Martin Landau is splendid... and his \\"son's\\" return in his waning days justifies any incorrect identification.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was great at keeping my attention most of the time. Some parts were slow for me. All in all it was well written.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Fantastic for babies to hold onto while they suck on the pacifier!  Helps the baby to keep it in place because the monkey acts as a holder.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this knife as a Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves all kinds of knifes, but this is his favorite.  He uses it for big jobs because of the blade thickness.  Great knife!
B0043D2L9S|2.0|Got this for the wife and didn't realize that it was only one piece of the puzzle.  You also need the belt, connectors, etc.  I ended up ordering a Cotton Carrier that ships complete.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|I would have rated this product five stars if Bear and Gerber would have produced it for a true to life, emergency situation.<br /><br />1) A belt clip should have been used instead of a belt loop - If any of us need to BO, are we all wearing pants with a belt at all times (especially during the summer....?)<br /><br />NO. So the bottom line is that a clip would do the job, no matter what.<br /><br />Wearing a belt? CHECK.<br /><br />Wearing shorts without a belt? (If it only would have been designed with a belt clip) CHECK..<br /><br />2) Rubber covered handles on the cup sure do look pretty.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when you try use it to boil water then you end up with an obvious problem - hot, melting rubber handles. Truly a shame, indeed.<br /><br />It could have been such a much better product with these additions.
1423140605|5.0|The book arrived early and in perfect condition.  It was bigger than I'd expected and my 10 year old daughter can't put it down. I'm so thankful that it arrived in time for Christmas as I had ordered it a bit late.  5 stars are very well deserved - thank you!
B007TVANDM|5.0|I recommend this book to children, teenagers, and adults. No matter what keep walking on! Highly recommend it! I'm a teenager going through a lot(ADHD,BIPOLAR,ANXIETY,DEPRESSION) And this book motivated me to keep my head held up because there's always a new song!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I think it's safe to say that waiting for this film was pretty agonizing, both for director Tom Hooper's recent successes in The King's Speech and the John Adams mini-series, for for the renown that this book/play/film has accumulated ever since Victor Hugo penned it, and for the well-known cast that has shown a different talent through viral trailers.<br /><br />Because I don't know the full history of film adaptions, I won't be delving into the comparisons with such, but the history of the London (Queen's Theatre) play has been on the mind, since I took a trip there this spring to watch it performed live. It was an unforgettable experience, and while this adaption had a few pitfalls, it came close to that in many ways.<br /><br />An inescapable topic is the singing. In the first scene, Crowe (Javert) and Jackman (Valjean) moved the words into odd tempos, and their voices sounded a bit shallow (Crowe's in particular). With the exception of a great (if short) sequence, \\"A Work\\", it was a poor opening on the musical front, and they tried to erase it from our memory by quickly distracting us with landscape shots. After that, both Crowe and Jackman got louder, bolder, and much more appreciable. Anne Hathaway as Fantine was amazing. She provided one of the three best song performances in \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\", which was very heartbreaking and hardening. Next up comes Young Cosette, who did very well with \\"Castle on a Cloud,\\" and made viewers sorry that they didn't hear more from her. Helena Bonham Carter did respectably, I suppose, but Sacha Baron Cohen's not a singer, and \\"Master of the House\\" had to rely solely on the acting and humor. The real disappointment, though, was Amanda Seyfried (Cosette), in my opinion. While her voice may be very good in other circumstances, her shallow trill didn't do justice to the opera-level voices that Les Mis has seen in the past. Instead, I favored Samantha Barks (&Eacute;ponine) in every way, including acting. Her \\"On My Own\\" was possibly my favorite song from the whole film, and definitely making the top three. Finally, there is Eddie Redmayne (Marius). He is definitely a talented actor I will be watching for. And, he's a marvelous singer, too! Very down to earth, and very loud and bold when he ought to be. His \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" also makes the top 3.<br /><br />As usual, there were some problems I had with the edits. Here and there, lyrics were changed, removed, and even added, which disappointed me. The worst part, I think, is when they cut nearly the entirety of \\"Turning\\" after uttering only a few lines. I can only hope it will come out complete in the extended version.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT** As my final point, for the whole movie, I'd been wondering how Hooper would portray Javert's suicide. I think he did it very well, and it was my favorite scene in the entire movie, for Crowe's great performance in it, the allusion from earlier in the film, the great scope and imager, and for Crowe's final song, in which he brings his best to the table. I had no idea he was as great a singer as he was at his character's final moments. **END SPOILER**<br /><br />I would not suggest this movie for kids under 13, because they simply wouldn't understand a lot of the underlying themes that make this movie really important. Also, there is some suggestive,  inappropriate material after Fontine is removed from the factory and resorts to the docks.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a large-scale, impressive adaption that is definitely worth seeing as soon as you can manage, even if you aren't a big fan of musicals.y favorite song from the whole film, and definitely making the top three.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good book. Makes you want to keep reading the series. Definitely an interesting book.  Hard not to enjoy even if you aren't a big reader (for those who mainly use apps)
0061537969|5.0|Bought three copies of this book as Christmas gifts for three of our children.  It's a quick read, and I had thoroughly enjoyed it.  Two of our children have dogs, so I thought they would appreciate the fact that the narrator is a dog.  Also, our youngest grandson's name is Enzo (the name of the narrator), so I thought our daughter and son-in-law without a dog would find that amusing.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great book it was thrilling existing exciting suspenseful amazing cool awesome and great to read though it's a little adult
B0099114WO|5.0|Was a good watch.  Little different play on romatic comedy.  Great actress and actor, made for and nice evening watch.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I love Rick Riordan books. The way he uses mythology In his stories and keeps humor, makes me fall in love with the block more. I am definitely starting the second book right away and suggest this series to everyone.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great modern spin on Robin Hood.  Definitely recommend if you are into that kind of thing.  Main actor is great.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Kate has done it again. great plot with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end. I like how the story flows from generation to generation without getting the reader lost. Already looking forward to her next book, but until then, this will be re-read many times just like the Forgotten Garden and The Distant Hours
B009Y2KGSQ|3.0|not as good as the older stuff ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Awesome movie!!  Great battle between good and evil as Lincoln begins his career in politics. Loved how history was depicted combining what we thought we knew along with the &#34;what really happened&#34; story line. I found it very entertaining. Not for kids - a lot of blood and violence. Not as much Gore as you might expect.  If you enjoy vamp movies you will likely enjoy this.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|MIGHTY THOR - MIGHTY MOVIE.<br />Didn't expect much from this but damn was i surprised. I had never read the comic so didn't know of the story of Thor other than he had a big hammer and was the god of thunder.<br /><br />Great special effects and cgi. PQ was excellent 4.5/5 - Couple of instances where the shots looked out of focus / blurry.<br />AQ was outstanding 5/5. Blew me away. True 7.1 is so good and those surrounds are put to good use and often. Reference quality would be the term best to describe it.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I've really liked the show so far and the leads are doing a great job moving the story forward and keeping there characters interesting.  It's difficult not to compare it to the BBC's Sherlock, but after watching several of the episodes, you can start to compare them less and enjoy each one on it's own merits.<br /><br />Elementary has the familiarity of culture, language and idiosyncrasies that are specific to the American setting.  That's good in that it's a degree of comfort that some find lacking in Sherlock.  No, I don't  know why that's an issue for some folks, but it is based on the several friends I've had trying to watch both (weird, but okay).<br /><br />I think Jonny Lee Miller is underrated as an actor and I'm happy to see him as the lead in this series.  It seems to suit him very well and the offbeat/damaged nature of the character plays well to his strengths.  I also like Lucy Liu who seems to be playing the part equal parts frustration and fascination. I'm concerned the seemingly inevitable &#34;will they, won't they&#34; dynamic that seems to encompass these types of relationships will negatively impact the show, but not much to be done about it.<br /><br />Overall - good take on the Holmes theme with a modern twist.  I think it's a good effort and is different enough from the fantastic Sherlock series to warrant it's own following.
B000NQPZCY|2.0|I purchased this as a blind buy only because it was starring Kevin Costner and Tarintino gave it the thumbs up.<br />The story was oh so predictable and the acting for these class of actors not up to their usual great standards.<br /><br />The PQ at times was decent for the age of the film - 3.5/5<br />The AQ was very good especially the opening credits with the jet fighter plane but after that the surrounds were not in use much. Speech was clear. 3.5/5<br /><br />Being a fan of Kevin Costner i was really looking forward to this movie but at no stage could i get into its groove. I was glad when it did end so abruptly.
B0076DELIG|5.0|a well written story you do not want to put it down. I enjoyed it very much as I do with most of Connelly's books
1610454812|5.0|This move will seriously move you. Short summary: its about a guy who grew up normal, but a little crazy,  lost his was and became what many would consider a low life POS, then eventually turned himself into a true American hero, a loving husband and father, and devout christian.  Adam Brown is a true hero and a role model for all. This move truly moved me i would recommend it for all people.

B005VPRETE|4.0|Olivia House was purchased for my 8 year old grand daughter, whose name is also Olivia.  She had this listed as one of her top Santa choices.  She already has a couple smaller Lego versions. I heard her excitement when she opened the present, then I heard her parents groan.  Why?  This toy is a major project. It takes a lot of patients and time to essemble.<br /><br />Now here is the good news.  My Olivia (or your child) is an artist and a very detailed child.  So for her....this toy was a chance to create and assemble the way she invisions the project.  If not, this will not be a fun toy....plus you need the space and area to keep all the pieces (which are many) while being assembled. For her and maybe your child, this is an adventure in progress that appeals to her creativity.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Some idiot said oh boo-hoo doesn't work for 2 phones and 3 other TABLETS! Read the title. Do you see the words KINDLE FIRE EDITION? Some people... 5 star good game; most one stars are ignorance on the buyers part.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Whilst being in the group of those that liked this movie, I agree it has holes, but I feel compelled to point out to those doubters that I feel confident that they will be covered in the sequel as they often are.<br />For me, it was a well produced movie for both Hi-Def and 3D coverage, whilst I agree that the med-bed scene could have made better use of this in 3-D, the movie was superb in its presentation.<br />My only gripe (a word I started using years ago after the Alien scene: John Hurt's character to Veronica Cartwright's - quit griping!) is that the Captain and crew - inclusive scientists - were a little too everyday for such a highly funded and important mission, especially considering space flight would have still been in it's infancy in the date suggested (and inferred) - but taking the movie on it's charaters alone, I can see past this one!<br />The story finally gave me the answer to the space jockey, and that was more than enough for me!<br />Thank you Ridley Scott!
B0053O89KG|5.0|All the family can watch this show without my worrying about impressions...kids are tween and teens. We like crime solving shows/series.  Really enjoy it.
B008ROH07W|5.0|This is a wonderful recording of a brilliant artist on the natural trumpet (no valves).  The cut from Purcell's Come Ye Sons of Art is worth the price in itself.  We played this first thing Christmas morning and will do the same to welcome the new year.

B0073PPNE8|4.0|Very moving story. Lots of drama & suspense. Sure to be a classic movie. Will be buying the DVD for my library.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Some of the things Charlie said made me laugh and others broke my heart. Such a great character! Loved him!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|New owner of Kindle Fire HD and thought that saving the money was great.<br />Pros:  Color selection, price, opening for the speakers is great.  Returning this product was easy and Amazon customer service extremely helpful<br />cons:  seemed much more flimsy than the Amazon Kindle Fire hd leather case which other family member has.  Propping up is ok buy not as smooth as Amazon case.  Also found out that the slits for the Amazon case do not distort the sound from the speakers. First time Kindle user and didn't know how handy the automatic sleep mode when closing the case seemed.<br />Therefore:  I returned this case for the Amazon.  I'm not saying this is a bad case, but if the money isn't the issue I would get the Amazon.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I love these types of games . It had a really good story line and interesting cut scenes.the puzzles where also interesting and fun to figure out
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I love Les Misérables. It is the musical of my childhood; although being young, not grasping the incredible story of the characters until years later, I still adored the music as a child. I would play on the floor and listen as my parents watched the \\"10th Anniversary: Dream Cast\\".<br />Since then I have read Victor Hugo's masterpiece several times, despite its length, and even created a crossover of videos on YouTube combining the 10th Anniversary cast with Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy to make a 90 minute mini-musical-movie (and to introduce people who don't like Les Mis to the amazing story that it is).<br /><br />That being said, I was both eager and apprehensive for this film adapation of the musical.<br /><br />The SINGING:<br /><br />Everyone seems to sing in one key. There is no variety, no scale of music as they all speak in a monotone during sentances that are meant to be \\"sung\\", but they are barely coherent, do not ennunciate their words, and it sounds ridiculous. Volume control is unheard of by the leading roles in this movie.It felt like watching a really bad high school performance of Les Miserables, where you wince and cringe and feel sorry for them as they attempt to sing. Amanda Seyfreid's (Cosette) voice was so shrill that when she warbled through songs like \\"A Heart Full of Love\\" it hurt my ears.<br /><br />When Hugh Jackman began screeching out \\"Bring Him Home\\", I was ready to leave. Far from bringing emotion to the songs, most of the cast (with a few exceptions, eg. Samantha Barker as Eponine, or the child actors) spent more time trying to reach the notes. I'm sorry to say, but Hugh Jackman's Broadway days have been over for some time, and it clearly shows. The soft songs, eg. \\"Bring Him Home\\" are belted out, and the loud songs are whispered, eg. \\"Master of the House\\", as sung by Helena Bonham-Carter.<br /><br />Apparently the idea is to follow characters around with a camera and film them in one long scene. As if we couldn't getthis on stage? It would have been nice to see some soaring artistic cinemaphotography. Show some soft flashbacks during \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", because Fantine HAS a backstory and we never have time to see it in film adaptations. Instead we have to watch them sing in an extreme close-up, and this has been previously avoided for a good reason. People claim that it is \\"more personal, more intimate\\", but there is nothing redeeming about getting stuck watching someone's face in this \\"magnifying-glass\\" detail. And because most of the songs are done in one take, the actors can sing what-ever way they choose, ignoring important rhythms, time signatures, beat cues, and thus be unfaithful to the original song. (Hugh Jackman does this a lot).<br /><br />The CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Anne Hathaway held her own as Fantine, she did a decent job singing the role (she cried way too much though, making it over-dramatized). But she did not portray Fantine correctly: in Hathaway's version, she is timid, suffering, and pitiful from start to finish. But the true Fantine is a golden-haired, courageous woman who is trying to keep her pride, while making choices to earn money to send to her little girl. We see none of that inner lioness. Any actor/actress should know, it is all about colouring contrast within characters. For white to appear, you must show black, and vice versa. If you want to show the horrible conditions of Fantine's circumstance, you must show her valiant spirits trying to uphold her pride as her dignity is stripped away. You do not see her desperation in begging Javert to free her, at first standing up to him and then pleading with him.<br /><br />The Thénardiers, I feel, were poorly cast as well. None of the vocal range, and it seemed as if the whole \\"Master of the House\\" were a re-enactment of Tim Burton's \\"Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" as both Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were in \\"Sweeney Todd\\", and in this show they chop tails off of live catsand toss them into meat grinders as well. Instead of the typical Victor Hugo cynicism that depicts the conniving Thenardiers, we get a grisly duo that appears from time to time as an attempt for some morbid comedy.<br /><br />And what screen-play writer thought that throwing Santa into \\"Master of the House\\" and having him go at it with a whore was a good idea? In 1800s France, he would have been thought of as St. Nicholas. Yet we have a scene of debauchery that depicts a childhood icon, St. Nicholas, having sex with a prostitute as she shouts his name, \\"Santa\\", a name that he would not even have been called in 19th century France? Are we adults supposed to see this as \\"comedy\\"?<br /><br />Russell Crowe has an extremely difficult time singing/ acting the role of Javert. He brings no life to one of the most complex villains in literary history. There is no passion, force, fire, ice, or power to his performance. He is flat, offering no conflict or passions to illustrate the brutality of justice within his character, and why he is pursuing Jean Valjean. He just... pops up from time to time. \\"Oh yeah there's that one convict..I should go chase him\\".<br /><br />Javert's cold vindication that the law is the ultimate authority drives the story. He is too important to be one-dimensional. In the book and in the 10th Anniversary, we see the progression of the Chief Inspector as his world is stripped away. The two greatest rivals in literature share the same tune in their soliloquies. Both are shaken by a crucial devastation that destroys what they thought they believed. Yet while one chooses life, the other chooses death.<br /><br />At least... we missed where it happened somewhere in the movie...<br /><br />The EDITING:<br /><br />A warning: they CUT OUT vital pieces of music that explain the story and the characters. The exchange between Javert and Valjean in the first few minutes in dramatically shortened (explaining why Valjean is in prison, and showing how the concept offorgiveness and redemption is unthinkable to Javert, which is essential for his character).<br />Valjean: My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving-<br />Javert: You'll starve again, unless you learn the meaning of the Law!<br />Valjean: I know the meaning of those 19 years, a slave! - of the Law.<br />All this, and even more following, was left out.<br /><br />A great deal is OMITTED from the Bishop of Digne and the candlesticks, and they skip the awesome theme of the Policemen as they capture Valjean. This was one of the worst edits, because Jean Valjean's conversion and decision to turn his life around is the most important catalyst in the story.<br /><br />When Thenardier and his gang attempt to rob Valjean's house, and Eponine screams, the Director cuts out bit where Cosette, afraid that Marius may be discovered, tells Valjean that it was her that screamed and that she saw 3 men outside. Valjean fears that Javert has discovered him, and makes plans to leave.<br />In the MOVIE, they cut that all out, so Valjean hears a woman scream, and assumes that Javert is after him? How paranoid it that?<br /><br />In addition, they cut out bits of JAVERT'S SUICIDE, a terrible travesty. I cannot imagine anyone who is not familiar to the story understanding why Javert throws himself into the Seine. Buhh?<br />Caught between his iron, relentless duty to the law, and by the mercy of a convict, in despair Javert takes the only way out he knows: death. YET WE GET NONE OF THIS. Ahh, Phillip Quast, how I miss you.<br /><br />The CINEMAPHOTOGRAPHY:<br /><br />Or the lack of it? Here was the chance to do a MAJESTIC, incredible and epic-sweeping edition of Les Mis. And what we get instead: actors singing a'capella in front of a camera. Unlike a stage production, where you are confine to a small space, a FILM can explore new heights, grand artistic themes and combining motifs of the story to bring it all together.<br /><br />Is this too much to imagine? The \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (2004) did it, and it was a fantastic film adaptation. The broad scope, the pallette of colours available to the producers was wasted. Only once in the WHOLE film did I feel that they captured \\"Les Mis\\" in the glory that it was imagined, and that was with \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\".<br /><br />The STORY:<br /><br />What story? The only \\"story\\" I got out of it was that some students were starting a revolution. They simply did NOT CONVEY any compelling story between Valjean and Javert. They skip essential moments that build character and instead attempt to insert additional lines that aren't necessary. The prelude to \\"Javert's Suicide\\" was horribly missing, the turning point for the villain is wanting.<br /><br />They did not include any kind of bonding between Valjean and Fantine, or Valjean and Cosette. I did like the new song \\"Suddenly\\" that Jean Valjean sings after he rescues Cosette, but sadly we did not see a very strong paternal connection between him or Cosette later on. It's kind of sad that a stage musical can pull this off, but with the near-3-hour movie you feel as if connections are missing. I did admire how Hugh Jackman was able to convey Valjean's fear of losing Cosette, the one person he cares about, but there wasn't really a loving connection on Cosette's part.<br /><br />And it was somewhat confusing that they switched out the prison chain-gang at the quarry for ... dragging in a ship? I'm guessing that's why they omitted the lines in \\"Look Down\\" such as \\"The sun is strong / it's hot as hell below\\". They wanted to be different, apparently, but it did not convey the hellish conditions in which Jean Valjean was living.<br /><br />I was very disappointed. There were additional, un-needed insertions of sex (a full silent 10 seconds so that you can hear the ship captain touching Fantine and what-not at the end of \\"Lovely Ladies\\") and instead of drowning, Javert miscalculates his suicide in the river and smashes on some cement (whaa...?) soyou can hear the bones crunching. (How many of us SAW that coming when you saw the layers in the river? Predictable...)<br /><br />Time could have been better spent in so many different areas. I did not feel happy after seeing this movie. It lacked so badly; even the 1998 adaptation with Neeson and Rush was far better than this waste of time. The only reason to see this movie is for Samantha Barks, who portrays Eponine very well, but she is in the 25th Anniversary already so you might as well watch that instead.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful story with a cast of fabulous British actors....a very charming British film (as you'd expect from these actors)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in one day, mostly because I couldn't put it down. I loved all the twists to the plot and the love story is refreshing. It's very well written and was an enjoyable, easy read.

B00A2AU0KI|5.0|Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, and Justin Timberlake are truly awesome in this movie.  A real tear-jerker - you'll LOVE it
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly always delivers with Harry Bosch. Once again, I became the detective and lived the \\"cold case\\" investigation. I hated the characters he hated, loved the characters he loved, felt his fear, his anger, and angst. Hell, I even tasted his beer! Fantastic!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I am blown away at the irresponsibility of this man to promote his psychedelic experience as a scientific explanation for God.  While not a scientist, a medical doctor has a similar duty to the public.  When an expert speaks to a non-expert, an unofficial contract is struck and that expert has a certain responsibility to the laymen.  An uneducated reader will make unfounded conclusions from this book based on a sense of trust for someone much more educated. This man should be ashamed of himself for breaching that contract and, on the grounds of being a medical doctor, showcase his misfortune to (at best) make a buck and (at worst) mislead a guileless public.<br /><br />I am not criticizing his outreach for faith or his method for dealing with his own mortality.  But I am disgusted by his reckless misuse of the trust that uneducated readers will place in him.<br /><br />Others have addressed this topic better than I:<br />[...]<br />[...]
B0069JBKHI|5.0|We have a big house and were concerned regarding our newborn safety. We tested it several times with n-class WIFI and it really works as advertised. One of the best around, its pricey but good. We had parties on the first floor but new instantly if our son was making noises while sleeping or was awake...<br /><br />A good buy...
0345803485|2.0|So, I just had to check out this book - after all the raving I'd heard about it, I thought there must be something that made it worth reading. I quickly learned better after reading some of the reviews on here; still, I figured I'd at least get a few good laughs out of it, so I borrowed a copy from a friend. And I actually did find the book a bit amusing at first. The story just screams \\"I was written by an amateur\\", and I rolled my eyes at the protagonist Ana's ridiculous clumsiness, as well as the lines copied and pasted straight from Twilight. I quickly grew sick of it, though, even in the beginning. I decided to hang in there until the smut began - surely it must be good, right? Why else would this novel that was so lacking in all the areas I had seen so far have sold so many copies?<br /><br />Well, I was very disappointed with the smut. I can honestly say that I've read beautifully sensual sex scenes written by teenage authors of Fanfiction stories that were more erotic than this.<br /><br />The entire book was a huge letdown. It honestly made me sad - we have so many amazing young authors out there whose work deserves so much more attention than they're getting; so, why are stories like this that are sloppy and unoriginal being praised, and milking money as if they're brilliant?<br /><br />It makes no sense to me.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|Who doesn't love the Karate Kid?  This set is great, even though the first two movies are the only good movies.  Lets be honest.  Karate Kid III and The Next Karate Kid sucks, but to have the whole set, it's nostalgia factor alone is worth the $23 dollars.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This is a great movie two thumbs up awesome cast a e i o u y h j k l
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|A funny movie with a predictable plot, there was an excessive amount of strong language. enough so that it detracted from the humor at times.  Still some funny lines.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My son is 9 years old and he love this Angry Birds Space Game.  I got it at a really good price and will totally recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read each of Colleen Hoover's books and absolutely loved them! I can't wait for more from her....soon!! I have already told everyone to read her books
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|thrill to get phillips new cd,  wasn't disappointed.  music very fresh and easy,<br />put on at work when hectic, relaxes me
B004EK926K|4.0|Some parts a little intense for children, so parents use good judgment, but this was a great interpretretation of Dickens' classic!
B000002UVX|5.0|If you're familiar with hey joe, crossroads, etc, but wanted more intensity, duration and craziness in your guitar solos, get this. The band is on fire, and the solos are insane. Some ominous portents of the year to come (this was Jimmy's last new year's eve), but absolutely compelling listening.
B001G50QCK|5.0|I have loved Smallville from its very beginning.  The first season beyond the pilot was a little strange with all the weird mutations that the green meteor rock caused, but it did set the stage for an awesome series run.  I own seasons 1-7 on dvd.  Season 8 introduces the Justice League of America from the future assuring Kal-el that his team would continue to protect the world in centuries to come.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Not a bad read. A slight bit depressing. Nice to knock out a quick read of an old classic. Give it a try.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so full of emotion.  While so disgusted by the Hunger Games and the Capitol, I can't stop wanting to learn more of this story.  The love story unfolds slowly, an second plot behind the need and will to survive.  While the contestants are so desperate, I am hopeful for their survival.  Griping  and an all consuming page turner.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|My first book read on my kindle.  I enjoyed it and look forward too reading more classics.  A great read for the time of year.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This first season was what got me hooked on all the other seasons.  Great show and buying on Amazon was a great way to watch it!!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was wonderful ! I was on the edge of my seat . And who knows after this book we will be prepared . That law for the wedding may just come in handy
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I'm not a fan of comic books or comic book movies and was surprised how much I enjoyed this fantasy adventure
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My friends recommended this book to me. After a failed attempt for the one gal to nab it from the library... I finally bought it against my will. I'm truly glad I did. I will attempt the book gets plenty sad but I just loved it. I'm not even one for the depressing books, yet I put up & balled my eyes out through it. I felt like you could never know what was going to happen next... or maybe that's just absent minded me. I thoroughly enjoyed The Fault In Our Stars & look forward to going back & reading it AGAIN which doesn't happen much.
B005LAJ212|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this show and I've been addicted ever since. I Love the drama, the acting, the clothes, and of course the beautiful beach. This show draws you in and leaves you always wanting more.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It has been a long time since I've read a book that has truly taken my senses along the journey with the characters in `The Night Circus`.  I could not put this book down. I did not want the characters to fade away.  Thank you for the adventure!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|As I noted in the title getting into this book took me a little bit, but once I got used to the voice I really enjoyed it. It's a new way to look at life and the people around you, there are some great insights and interesting quotes. I did not really relate to the main character, but I found him charmingly quirky and by the time I got to the end of the book I wasn't ready for it to be over
B008P1EWIM|5.0|You can get free weather apps that are excellent but for .99 cents this is great with a beautiful interface and the ability to check the weather in multiple locations.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone! It's so unique yet amazing. The show is also very good and is pretty much exactly like the books. Well done George R. R Martin!!!
B009H2PCNC|4.0|Not quite as great as Neroli, Thursday Afternoon or Music for Airports, but still nice to have in the collection.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Gave this as a Christmas present, and it was awesome!!!! I wanted to keep it. in the words of the merc: BANG BANG BANG!! I shot you
B009439HEY|5.0|Maybe even better than the original versions. I look forward to each and every Hackett release.<br /><br />I find that I listen to the Hackett versions more often than I call up the originals.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I don't book anything without checking it out on trip advisor first! I love traditions the first hand reviews.  I have used his for my 2 all incluasives.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read A LOT of books and I just had to say that Colleen Hoover has to be one of the best writers I have ever read!! After reading Slammed and Point of Retreat, I thought there was no way she could beat that! But I was soooo wrong...Hopeless grabs you from the start and was almost impossible to put down. Please write faster Colleen Hoover, I need more books from you!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Heart wrenchingly beautiful and amazing. I felt as though I could have been a part of the story. Like it was  unraveling right in front of my eyes.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Not very happy about playing this and then it locks me out without paying for coins when I want to try to just get better. I have to keep installing and uninstalling in order to get better. Not happy with this feature at all.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay was a fitting end to an amazing series.  Not wanting to put this series in my past, I held off on listening to the final book for as long as I could.  Once I started, I could tell that this installment would give me a satisfying closure for the trilogy.<br /><br />Katniss gets caught up with the rebel alliance that is located at District 13.  Her family and Gayle are with her, but her thoughts are filled with Peeta every day.  The Capitol captured Peeta after the jumbled Quarter Quell and have been holding him hostage.  Katniss knows that his life hangs in the balance every moment he is in their custody.<br /><br />After much persuasion, Katniss agrees to become the face of the Mockingjay, satisfying all the residents of Panem that are in support of the revolution.  A big driving force for Katniss fulfilling this role is the knowledge that one day she will have the opportunity to be alone with President Snow, at which time she will be in  control of his demise.<br /><br />I don't think I've given any important details away.  Of course Katniss's romantic life is still in turmoil throughout most of the book, as she struggles to find out who truly owns her heart.  This will also be resolved by the end of the book, but I'm not going to tell you who she chooses!  This is a series that I didn't think I would enjoy, but SURPRISE, I loved it!  With themes of love, friendship, and survival, there is much in these books to ponder.  I don't know if I would necessarily suggest these books as a book club selection, but I don't hesitate in recommending the entire series for leisure reading.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Fun piano game to play.  Several songs available with different skill levels. Similar to how you play guitar hero, play the notes just right to get a high score.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|It is from Taylow Swift, so of course it's awesome.  I particularly liked the songs, &#34;Red&#34; and &#34;I Knew You Were Trouble.&#34; my 12 year old daughter and obvious Taylor Swift fan says.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays well, like that there is payoff for winning. The ads are minimally annoying and not visible during game play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I sat in the bath and read this book until I was completely prunned. I will not give anything away....but it's a must read for sure...you will not be disappointed!!!! 5 stars
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|It ok but now we have to wait for for the next one when is it over it never over but I like the movie
B003L77GG0|5.0|Believe it or not, I just heard about Smallville this year when my son was watching it. ( i dont watch much tv) Once I saw the episode with Brainac I was hooked and bought all 10 seasons
B0035LGXXO|5.0|Really liked how the movie took place on one rainy night. Always a fun movie to watch. Favorite gang is the baseball furies. I liked finding all the mistakes in the movies like trains that don't run in the bronx and using neighborhoods that were not in the bronx
B00338QENI|4.0|I found the book to be a very good read that really makes you sympathize with the Lacks family and the struggles they faced. It also proves the healing power of the Lord. A little drawn out at certain parts but overall recommended.
B000I8ERVM|4.0|I like scary movies, especially when they are based on a true story. Scared me more the first time I saw it. Laura Linney was scary. Interesting story.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I had to get this dvd to replace another. I've always enjoyed the movie. Fast service and dvd is quality. I'm satisfied Thanks.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had reservations about reading this book as I felt King might not be the best writer for this particular subject.  I was pleasantly surprised!  King did a great job!  I enjoyed it very much.  Would recommend it highly.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good read kept me turning pages but still like Fifty Shades Better. Reading the rest of the series might change my mind though. We will see.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I downloaded this app for my grandchildren but discovered that I love it for myself. I can't wait for them to try it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the besy solitaire app that I have encountered. It is very easy to operate and has great graphics. Definitely a keeper.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This was by far the most painful 105 minutes I've subjected myself to in a few years. I had a feeling I wouldn't like this but the sudden slow motion action shots were but one thing that made this unbearable to watch. I'll never get that time back again.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|One of the best books so far by Nesbo.  Just when you think you've figured it out you'll be surprised by the next twist----
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Gift for one of my brothers.  He loves this bag and uses it often when needing something larger then his smaller lens bag.  Good quality.  Very happy.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Almost all the family is a big fan of the show.  Perfect inexpensive Christmas present for one of them.  Arrived in time for Christmas.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game its challenging .its not a boring download . I like it makes you use your brain.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Almost all the family is a big fan of the show.  Perfect inexpensive Christmas present for one of them.  Arrived in time for Christmas.
B000SEI230|5.0|Amazing! I couldn't put it down. Read it you won't be sorry. Nicholas Sparks has a knack for writing books that always leave you wanting just a little bit more. Perhaps this is why most are made into movies.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn does an excellent job balancing between action, suspense, and informational writing.  This keeps the storyline flowing and makes the book hard to put down.  Perfect reading if you enjoy covert ops / assassin type action.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|DVD's arrived promptly and in good condition.  The series is a fun mixture of sci-fi and wild west, with a terrific group of characters and interesting story lines.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good to play while waiting for the bus or during slow periods at work. Some of the games are really tough.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wonderful series!  DVD's arrived promptly and in good condition.  My husband and I both enjoy the quirky characters and story lines.  The show is an interesting mix of wild west and sci-fi.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Great movie for families to enjoy older kids & for the adults too!!  Enjoy the whole movie series & the Harry Potter books too!<br />My 11 year old has read them all!
B005LAIHY0|2.0|the movie was okay but my blu-ray copy doesnt work. I have tried it on multiple ps3 and a new samsung blu-ray player.
B009POHHRG|5.0|The Joker was always my favorite villain but this novel shows a more psychological and personal plot much deeper than any Batman comic I've ever read so far. The writing and artwork is amazing and complement each other really well. I would recommend this to not only anyone who is fascinated by Batman but anyone who enjoys stories about the human condition.
B001NHNG64|3.0|There were some plot holes you could drive a moving van through, but I enjoyed the pacing and the main character so three stars it is.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the book second time reading and it kept my attention I laughed I cried I've already read the other two also glad things turned out the way they did I love happy endings
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|One of the best!!! The music plus being timed  makes it even more challenging and peaceful at the same time
B009VB97EY|2.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie & I almost turned it off about 1/3 of the way through.  The ONLY reason I kept watching is because I paid for it & because of the handsome men!  The acting is terrible, the story is terrible.  Don't waste your time.  It's not even funny.  Thumbs down!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great gift for a fan. Really cool cover art. Waited a long time for the final movie to get a boxed set.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|CD came in excellent shape, just as advertized. Disc plays<br />without issues and case was in tact, would buy again.
B001BFFTO0|1.0|The earthkeeper compound used is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS in wet conditions for almost any surface.  Don't buy this boot if you want to go hiking, work, or do anything outside.  Not waterproof.  Not Insulated.  Very soft, so no ankle support.  Looks cool, but thats about it.  Not even good for clubbing.  Probably slip on the dance floor.
B0053O89U6|5.0|Such a great show. Looks great on blu-ray too. Great because you don't have to watch them in order. They're all amazing on their own!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son who is a huge fan of House M.D. He couldn't wait and started watching it Christmas night!
0345803493|5.0|This is a great addition to the first book and very addicting.  It has suspense, love, and anger all at the same time, it's great!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|My 7-year-old grandson put this together in three day.  The directions are straight-forward and easy to understand.  While he has built many Lego themes and is a little pro, the pet shop is easy enough to understand.  It seems to stay together well so it is also fun to play with.<br /><br />Now that the pet shop is fully completed, I must tell you that it is quite amazing and very detailed both inside and out.  My 7-year-old tells me it was so much fun to put together.  The adults in the household were quite taken with the cuteness of entire building.  We took several photos of each level from the inside out.  Worth the money.
0345803485|5.0|If a woman has yet to read these books she needs to immediately.  These books however are not just for the female mind, a male can read them as well because my fiance read some of mine and said it was a good read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book so much!!!! I finished it in less than a week and trust me it is worth every second of your time. Probably one of the best books I have read!
B00009P1O2|5.0|Queen Rocks.. How we miss Freddy. I really enjoy this dvd and have watched it several times. I also like the covers of the songs they performed.Like ..Your so square.. Hello Mary Lou..
B0041KVW2K|5.0|After being a Beatles fan my entire life and collecting all the American pressings and then buying this set, I am proud of my purchase! I haven't found a single thing wrong with this box set! I'm a Beatles collector and I've heard worse quality recordings that don't even compare with how good this sounds!! I find it very \\"nerve racking\\" that people complain over just minor stuff such as quality and sound issues. You people probably got the very early pressings of this boxed set! My purchase is perfect and I enjoy it as much as possible! This will make a great gift for the hardcore beatles nut in your family!!!! Happy listening
B006M4RN3U|5.0|FUN.Came much sooner than expected! Given as a gift.  Was not expecting it to come before Christmas. Our son was pleased with it<br /> It is Some Nights  CD by FUN<br />.
1400069289|5.0|This is a great book if you are interested in improving anything in your life, in business, or in society.<br /><br />I wish the author had given more examples of possible cues and rewards (with associated cravings). Maybe I am just lazy and want the book to do the thinking for me. But either way I'd have appreciated a bit more \\"training material\\" before I'm trying to implement the ideas on my own.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Shipiping was really fast and dvd's quality was good :) thanks a lot!! I would recommend this dvd to anyone! I will buy another one next time :)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Everything is in the details! Loved the old world feel and the mystery throughout the story. This book makes you remember the wonderment and the excitement you felt your first time at a carnival.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Watched this during the holidays, which is a tradition with our family.  We've watched Wall-E and other cartoon movies at holiday time.  This one was equally entertaining.  Loved the hair on Merida, red and bouncy.  From a technical point of view the cartooning was tremendous.  Story was fun, might be a little bit scary for little tiny kids, but the message of a strong young lady is one that is important.  Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down! Loved how well it was written and how yoy became so easliy caught in the story. It is a must read!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|great price for the trilogy, I bought 3 copies for christmas presents. came on time. super happy with this purchase.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|A wonderful read for a true fan! I can not wait to read the rest of the series! Absolutely great!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I wish everyone would stop giving bad reviews about this game just because it cost an extra 99 cents. Big deal. So the game is less than 2 dollars. Is that so bad for a good game? I had alot of fun with this game. No glitches or anything. If I could rate Alawar Id give them 2 stars because they always do these kinds of sneaky tactics to get more money when they could just be honest about it. If the game were priced $1.99 noone would be complaining &amp; they'd get an extra penny. But Im not going to give this game a bad rating just because the company that put it out is dishonest. It really is a great game &amp; if someone made another game as good as this &amp; priced it at $2.99, Id buy it. I recommend this game. Just know it'll cost $1.98 &amp; be happy with that.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I've seen it before & loved it would highly recommend it to any who like Liam neeson a must have
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was well written and you couldn't put it down. It shows the heartaches of love and what the memories of past can do as well. It shows how much family should mean to you and that no matter if you don't get along with them or don't talk to them a lot that they are your family and you'd do anything to defend them or to make them happy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this series. It should have more pages though. I am in gifted for reading and I finish these books in an hour or so. This is a great series for all ages and has humor. If you like the books,  the first three movies are out for Amazon video! Highly recommended.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It is so fun.I love this game it is so entertaining.It can be hard at first but once you get the hang it is not hard at all.Little kids would love it even big kids. Thanks for reading this.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This movie is saved by some good acting.  In addition there are some wonderful metaphorical hints about our own lives.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I choose this rating because this book was my favorite i would recommand this book to all my family member
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Has lots of twist and turns in this story. Can wait to see what happens next.  Chuck needs to find his real family.
B005LAII3A|3.0|Perhaps adding a little reference to Shakespeare adds a bit of dignity to this exercise in special effects wrapping Philip K. Dick's little short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\". As entertainment this film works well for those who like clever constructs of apocalyptic destruction and robotic culture and the idea behind Dicks story is fascinating to a point. But to make this noisy jumble of fighting and falling and tension last over two hours is begging indulgence.<br /><br />The summary with the product tells it well enough: `Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), even though he's got a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter (Jessica Biel) to find the head of the underground resistance (Bill Nighy) and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.<br /><br />There is some fine dialogue that gives the film an uplift: Matthias (Bill Nighy) `It is each man's quest to find out who he truly is but the answer to that lies in the present, not in the past. As it is for all of us.' Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) 'But the past tells us who we've become.' Matthias: The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present, look there. You'll find your answer.' The actors cope with this concept well - Collin Farrell is more buff than ever and handles his impossible role well, and Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, and Bill Nighy (in a momentary role) all offer interesting moments.<br /><br />If you love sci-fi and clever visual tricks then this is a film for you. If story is more important to you, then pass.  Grady Harp, December 12Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, and Bill Nighy (in a momentary role) all offer interesting moments.<br /><br />If you love sci-fi and clever visual tricks then this is a film for you. If story is more important to you, then pass.  Grady Harp, December 12

B009D0LBRO|1.0|The game won't work on my tablet and Amazon says it will.  Google Play says it won't.  There is no recourse for buying the game.  Beware if you don't own a high dollar tablet, it won't work and you can't get your money back.  I love this game and was looking forward to playing it again.  Several months later and still doesn't load.<br /><br />I guess I am out of luck.  WARNING:  AMAZON DOES NOT GUARANTEE IT GAMES ASSESSMENT.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|fun game in trying to play the piano. My grandson really likes it especially if he gets a good grade for doing it
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great story. I felt like a voyeur sitting on the sidelines watching every move. I can't wait for book 3
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|This newer version was much better than the original..although the original was good for that time era.I would recommend seeing it
B0055SWM08|4.0|Challenging enough and beautiful too. Read about this history of the game - cute story. I'm not someone who likes games and I'm hooked on this one.
B0058VW36U|1.0|watch when obtaining these free or cheap games cause for you to go any further in the game...they want you to buy coins.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie. Watched in on video...now my brain hurts...not funny at all, big disappointment.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I LOVE these guys!!!!!!!! Most of the songs on this set are on other CD's but I don't care. I could listen to them over and over again.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Fantastic show... just watched the first episode and can't wait for the second one.  Excellent!!!!  Would recommend this show to anyone who likes mystery, humor, and good chemistry between actors.  Just Great.
B00471TLZS|5.0|Spielberg's stamp of sheer visual excellence and in the warmth and humor of the performances are all over this film.  Director Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot) lends his own scary sensibility.  It's a creative match made in heaven (and hell).<br /><br />What elevates Poltergeist beyond a mere ghost story or horror thriller into a genuine love story is the believable performances by all the actors.  You really feel for the Freeling family, and feel their pain, when their youngest child, 5-year-old Carol Anne, played by Heather O'Rourke, is abducted by spirits, and you root for the Freelings, as they struggle to re-claim her from the forces of the netherworld!  This love, along with the love in the performances of the actors in Spielberg's other \\"little\\" summer of '82 movie, E.T., is palpably real.<br /><br />It's amazing that parapsychologist Marty peeling his face off into the sink didn't garner this film an R rating!  It would be interesting to hear how producers Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall \\"negotiated\\" a PG rating with the MPAA.  Tell your young kids to cover their eyes during this scene!<br /><br />It would be nice to have a retrospective documentary here, containing interviews with surviving cast and crew, development of the Poltergeist story, an ILM featurette, with supervisor Richard Edlund, explaining how the groundbreaking-at-the-time, pre-CGI, pre-Ghostbusters visual-FX (whose visual FX Richard Edlund also supervised) were created, a sound-FX featurette on the film's otherworldly spirit noises, a memorial on the late, great Jerry Goldsmith, who composed Poltergeist's score, and a treatise on the \\"Poltergeist curse\\", which seems to have claimed not only Heather O'Rourke but Dominique Dunne, who played her older sister, Dana, who was strangled by her boyfriend.  The excellent Real Poltergeists Part I and II documentaries are the only extras already included here.  Reduce the sound level on these; they're much louder than the movie.<br /><br />I will re-purchase this title if a mondo Special Edition of Poltergeist containing these elements surfaces.  Until then, the transfer of this film is magnificent on blu-ray, the best it has ever looked outside a cinema, the best way to experience Poltergeist at home.  I endured the horrible pan/scan version on VHS before Ted Turner released a slightly sub-par letterbox version back in the late '80s.  The addition of anamorphic and a much cleaner transfer on DVD brought back some of the magic.  The blu-ray really shines, shows Spielberg's and director Tobe Hooper's wide-screen Panavision compositions of the ghostly spectacle in all their full-resolution glory.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on the Poltergeist sequels.  They blow.  This original Poltergeist is the seminal masterpiece, an all-encompassing story, a oner, that should've ended, for the Freeling family, anyway (spoiler alert), when dad Steve parks a TV (no more TV!) out on the balcony of the Holiday Inn on I-74.  A different family with a completely different family dynamic?  Might have made a good second movie.<br /><br />Poltergeist II adds some interesting Native American folklore and spirituality to the franchise, and the Reverend Kane, played by ANCIENT Julian Beck, is scary as hell.  Still, it's weak compared to the original.<br /><br />Poltergeist III (Poltergeist in a high-rise) is just ludicrous, absurd, merely an attempt to further cash in on the franchise.  It's only fascinating to watch because little Heather O' Rourke, who played Carol Anne, was visibly beginning to exhibit the signs of her real-life illness which would, shortly thereafter, really, tragically take her life.  The other side is a little brighter with Heather there, one more blonde angel.<br /><br />Cut down the tree outside your bedroom window, dim the lights, and tie your child's clown doll down in the closet...to the excellent Real Poltergeists Part I and II documentaries that are the only extras already included here (reduce the sound level on these; they're much louder than the movie).<br /><br />I will re-purchase this title if a mondo Special Edition of Poltergeist containing these elements surfaces.

B008LSVLW4|5.0|Whether you're relatively new to the world of the wonderful Miss Peggy Lee or are just getting around to upgrading your collection from LPs, the \\"Eight Classic Albums\\" series can't be beat. Yes, I wish they would have included some liner notes beyond the relevant names and dates, but given the amount of music you get for such a reasonable price, it's hard to complain.
B001HN6922|5.0|It was a gift for my son and he loves the movie.  He loves Cars and he loves the Cars Toons featuring Mater so this was a good fit.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Played once and then the app would not load because of the add. DELETED IT Would not load or run.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Considering that I didn't really enjoy the first movie all that much, this one was a repeat (which I expected because it is a sequel).  But again, I got it as a gift for someone else and he enjoyed the movie.  I enjoyed the great deal I got on one of the Amazon specials.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is a very good and very funny movie, so go see it if you haven't yet! Top notch comedy.
B002ZG999U|4.0|... it is a typical &#34;guys&#34; movie.  Since I bought this as a gift for my dad, he enjoyed it and overall I am satisfied with my purchase.  I got a great deal on one of the Amazon sales so it was worth the price.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love a game that makes me think.  You can feel your brain grow as you<br />play.  I highly recommend this application.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was very pleased with this book.  This book is my favorite out of all of the books that Rick Riordan has written. Read this book, you will not be disappointed.
B000T433CO|5.0|Several beautiful stories intertwine in this fun and heartwarming film. Gorgeous scenery, great music and wonderful acting make this a perennial favorite.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I would recommend this as a must have app! Flipboard is easy to customize, easy to use and has become my \\"go to\\" app for news.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Could not put it down. It is a tear jerker. Also, I learned a little more about conditions during World war two in France. Loved it.
B005VPRETE|3.0|Like the other LEGO Friends sets I bought, my granddaughter loves it but I wonder about the price for such few pieces also it limits what she can build with them.  She cannot be creative with the Friends LEGOs.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Lots of flowerery detail as writers are taught in writing classes. I like more direct writing. As I read it got better. It is worth readin.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|A lot of fun! Gives you a grade on how well you did. Practice can help you raise your grade.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Everyone should read this. The English in it is from the era it was written. It shows us how much grammar has changed over the years. Not always for the good.. Also the progress women have made in having control over their lives.
B000JIHP88|3.0|The animas are cute, a child can easily press the buttons, it has a night light feature, and it plays music. It spins but it's so slow moving that its almost not worth it. The songs/sounds could be better but if you're not looking for anything fancy, this is great.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book...I wish there were more in the series.  Just glad these were published. Love how quickly it downloads on my Kindle Fire!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Reminds me of the old game of breakout that I loved when all of the electronic games started. Thanks I use it on my kindle and have spend many enjoyable hours playing it everywhere I go. Thank you
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Good Game that well last a for same time and plus even more puzzles than the original. Cute Graphics. Runs Smoothy at 60 fps and also this game is for the patient type and not for little kids.
B0026PA05M|5.0|This is my follow up to their latest \\"The Strange Case Of...\\" & this is just as good (If not better)!! Both are highly recommended!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is Very entertaining. It is Easy and quick to access.without taking a lot of time. It also has a &#34;hint&#34; feature to help if you can not find a move.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|Didn't remember that it had so many bad words in it. Watched with my grandsons. A few funny parts in it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My kids loves this game. Is challenging, the kids needs to think, evaluate and plan the correct step order to resolve each level.
B0000ADY9I|3.0|I'm not sorry I bought it, but this music is too dated for my ears.  You might want 'Mountain Jam' but I would settle for the single disk version of this.
B004XANKVO|3.0|Yes, it's ok. Sturdy, nice hard glasses case, ok over the shoulder. Really should have a strap to secure the laptop into the pocket - necessity for safety. Front stuff pocket is handy. Side pockets are ok. Will probably go back to Swiss Army type; more functional pockets and safety features.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an engaging book that kept me wondering what's the real story. Hoping there is a book two to finish were it ended. Too many unanswered questions. Or maybe I just want to continue the story. I wasn't ready for the story to end. This was a quick read, less than four days while being a full time mom.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Beautiful graphics. Really worth paying seven dollars. I love how I can play both sides in campaign mode. Im completley addicted to this game. Best shooting game for kindle fire hd!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read Slammed and Point of Retreat earlier this year not knowing much about the books before I picked them up.  Turns out, those stories were about a high school senior who moved with her mother and younger brother after the death of her father, to live across the street from a guy who has lost both his parents while in college.  He changed his life course to take care of his younger brother.  Somehow, even in the middle of a story line tragically serious... Colleen Hoover wrote an amazingly beautiful, funny and butterflying awesome drama that had me unable to put them down.<br /><br />Because of this, I had no reservation picking up Hopeless knowing nothing about it.  I didn't even read the above synopsis.  Again, Colleen takes a story that is truly serious, but somehow finds the beauty in a story that made me fall in love with Sky, Holder...and maybe even a little bit more with her.  I think it's safe to say that if Colleen Hoover writes it... I will read it!!!<br /><br />There are some serious plot lines to this story.  I'm not going to pretend everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow and everything has it's rightful place.  Sometimes there are things in life that there are no reason for or answers for.  That makes this story that much more real.<br /><br />It's heart-breaking and scary, but even through the bad it's beautiful.<br /><br />Sky is a different type of teenage girl who would so badly like to just be normal, but being adopted,  home-schooled with no TV, Internet access or sugar in her diet has left her as far from normal as possible.  Her best friend lives outside her window and is fast and free when it comes to boys which has given Sky a guilt by association reputation.  She loves her best friend so much that she doesn't care. Even when she goes to public school and people call her a slut, she turns it into a joke.<br /><br />Dean Holder is a sexy guy with a bad reputation as well.  Rumors fly about the type of things he's done and where he was last year since he wasn't in school.  But that's what high school is, right? Just a bunch of rumors flying around.<br /><br />I honestly don't want to spoil, ruin or giveaway anything so I will say this... this book is anything but Hopeless.  I want to tell you that I \\"lived\\" this book, but I am no where in the middle with it.  I freakin' loved it.  My only word of advice other than read this and read it now...is pay attention to the warning.  If you are sensitive to certain subject materials, than beware but that's it.  Otherwise, this is as close to perfection as I believe can be achieved.as last year since he wasn't in school.  But that's what high school is, right?

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would not call this the greatest read of all time... however it does keep you involved.  While reading you cannot wait to see what happens next, and you really feel like you are sitting right next to Christian and Ana.  I think every woman secretly wants there man to be this guy... attentive, intense, irresistible and oh so naughty.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is great.  It has extas that make me want to open it every day.  If you use words and want help using and understanding them this is the app for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Yet again Nicholas Sparks pulls at you heart strings. Making you fall in love with every character may they be good or bad. This was the best $3.99 I have ever spent. I went in thinking I would read a few pages put it down and do something else. How far from the truth that was. You will not be able to put it down. It's not his typical love stories. He has a shocking ending that will surprise everyone. You will love this book just as I did.
B009MO5960|5.0|I have the whole collection now in blue ray. This has been a good movie And besides she does a good job actting in it.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone. I love Chris on the Fox TV show Glee and his book was also truly amazing and brings me right back to my childhood. This is what every young kid dreams of. Thank Chris Colfer for writing this amazing book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Only played for a few minutes , so far great. Good story line , fun mini games .looking forward to the rest of the game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It's a story that makes believe in God as Pi has stated. I too strongly believe in God. Thank you Yann Mattel for this thrilling beautifully crafted book.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|And here is why.  It shows you all the ones, when you are working on ones, makes it easier to see where in the game you are.  When you have all the ones, the one in the 9 digit choice area changes to solid to let you know you are done with them.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love this book it was very well plotted and the characters were drawn well. Judging from this book I might want to become an egyptologist when I'm older ;)<br /><br />I liked how they plotted the book as a recording and Sadie and Carter took turns telling it. It felt so real I could say that it is real. Like they really had a battle with set or the Washington's monument and the other obelisks are connected to the duat. I felt like I was in the story I loved it. It is definitely a must read!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|A good movie with great action & an ok plot. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you entertained, then this is not a bad choice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One word to describe this book? Incredible. Sky goes through the most roughest patch in life... finding out the truth about who she's really is what happened to the little girl Hope.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found myself not wanting to put it down. It still has all of the  elements I live about a good romance novel with just the right amount of suspense and action. And I won't spoil anything, but love  the ending.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|This is another Hollywood &#34;Fresh&#34; remake that is well worth missing. I don't understand the need to keep the old name after so much has been reworked. The only consistency that I liked was the prostiture with three breasts. I wanted to see movie because I like(ed) Colin Farrell past work.
B00014NE62|5.0|Given todays open attitude to being gay this story may seem out of date. it is none the less a fascinating picture of a society so 'buttoned down' in every way. We remain intrigued by the Edwardian period for all it opulence and the life style of the rich, we are equally fascinated by the upstairs downstairs  world of the country house of the landed gentry.<br />Its easy to overlook the pain society caused many people rich or poor in the area of personal freedom and self determination.
B0032KLAKE|4.0|Tremendous performances, especially Norton in his breakout.<br />The direction was superb and a delicate subject was handled extremely well.<br />A bravo performance all around.
0545265355|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite series! I love the adventure and twists throughout the book. I recommend this highly.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I am very happy so far - haven't used everything - with everything that I've used.  I really like being able to see e-mails on my tablet, read books and watch movies (though I haven't done that yet).  Thanks.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well written, very interesting, fun to read.  I would recommend it. Though I did not like the sudden ending, it was good for selling the second book which I am now reading with delight.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book SUCKS!!!!!! I got this book to see what all the fuss is all about and a little bit into it, I notice the poor writing, the heroine is extremely unlikeable, insecure, clumsy and just an airhead - this guy is a 27 year old self made billionaire and she had no idea who he is until she clumsily falls head first into his office. hello! Was she under a rock to not know what someone this successful at such a young age looks like - the media would eat him up especially since he has Greek gods looks. Am I also supposed to believe that Ana doesn't own a computer while in college in this day and age until Christian buys her one? Aside from that, there are numerous dumb writing, like the fact the heroine says \\"holy crap\\" almost every few paragraphs. Then, there were the email exchanges - were they written just to take up pages so the author will get paid more - they added nothing to the story. Also, the dialogues are awful - it is like reading online chats - full of meaningless lines. This book shouldn't be this long, it should at most be a quarter of its current length. There is no character development. I honestly couldn't finish the book. I read a little over half of it and I couldn't read anymore. I really tried to push myself to finish it, but it was such awful writing that I can't read another word. It really felt like some teenager wrote this as a fantasy first draft. I know going into this that my standards should be set pretty low and that I should shut off my brain when I read fluff like this, but even with my low standards for this book, it still disappointed. I can't believe it is a bestseller and got sequels! What a shame that such trash got published and received so much recognition when there are so much better writers out there who doesn't receive half of the recognition that this tragic excuse for a book received. By the way, my review is not biased by the fact that it is erotica or that it is violent (that is a whole other review) - it really is awfully poor writing no matter which way you look at it.lly poor writing no matter which way you look at it.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Definitely not a comedy although there are funny momemts. The performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones were incredible - spot on in my opinion. Steve Carrell did well in a serious role. Really enjoyed it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not as great as the actual game in real life, but a close second.  I got sucked in and played for quite some time.  thought it was a good game.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it wasn't as funny as I was expecting.  A good big-screen vehicle for Seth McFarland.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|My husband downloaded this and I still don't see the point of this game.  Why is it so popular?  I mean my kids are playing it and they don't get what is going on.  Only that you get to fling birds at pigs?  WHY
B0063IH60K|4.0|I find it fairly easy and very fun to play I would recommend to people who like to play solitaire.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|A very good read - very touching to see how she and her family members reacted to her disease.  It will make you concerned about yourself though.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun yet challenging.  I love how it makes you think. Great for waiting in line. My whole family enjoys this. Have a blessed day!
0684135051|1.0|I have a number of Elizabeth Zimmermann's (EZ) books. This was the very first one.  The sample pages shown at Amazon do not show you accurately how interesting this book is.  There is a Snail Hat in the book which I am eager to make.  The directions to knit projects are confusing & not clear.  Difficult.  The Snail Hat I had looked forward to knitting did not turn out at all like I would have thought it would.  Calling School House Press for help with EZ's directions is an unpleasant experience leaving you feeling like they don't really know, or that they are put off by your bothering them.  There are so many other companies you can get your knitting supplies from which have strong customer service, great products, and agents your are skilled knitters.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I Love this game all my nieces love it I got it on my kindle fire I do wish that when I update it there will be more people (that don't look like a lion)  but it is very fun I have been looking for a fun hair game for a long time now I'm solo glad I found this it is totally worth 1.99
B000002513|5.0|My favorite Springsteen album. This is a classic! Every single track is good and they all stand the test of time.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as a whole and the storyline as well.  Of course the sexy guys were a bonus!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Bone Bed.  Cornwell has gotten long winded.  Needs to sharpen up her stories.  Car rides take 40 pages.  Story was OK
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have stayed up 3 1/2 hours reading this book!! It's worth it everybody should read this!! I mean it is my second favorite book series
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The graphics are really well done. The storyline isn't anything original but still interesting enough to keep your attention. Overall a fun game to kill some time. Will be trying out some of their other games.
B009X01FJS|4.0|.This item is so close to being the perfect case for the kindle.  If there is one thing bad it's the absence of a stronger magnet to hold the case closed.  I would highly recommend this case to any kindle owner.
1423124111|5.0|I love this book. It has great pictures and information, from the beginning of Disneyland to today. I also bought one for my dad!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|These rock, I love all the movies, so if you like them, you will like this set! Nothing wrong with them at all!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was very good. I couldn't put it down and read it straight through. The book MADD me think about how I would be if that happen to me.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book kept me on my toes, was well written, and highly entertaining. Good original concept with some well woven realism.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun and hard to put down cant stop playing just wish there were easier ways to get more acorn.
B009VB97EY|5.0|what<br />more needs to be said - Channing<br />Tatum. Storyline is dismal but who cares.<br />wanted the dancing and that part is<br />great!
0307948560|2.0|Kate Reddy struggles to handle motherhood and a demanding job in finance.  The book is a mildly funny, breezy read for much of its run.  However, is this really what investment firms were like in London in the early '00s?  I find it hard to believe there was still so much overt, in-your-face sexism at that time.  I could be wrong, but Kate's resignation to the obnoxious old-boy network seemed anachronistic.  And maybe there would have been drawbacks to finding another job with less travel, but she doesn't even seem to consider it.<br /><br />I could sympathize with Kate being pulled in too many directions, and sometimes driving herself into mania to try and be the perfect mom.  I could kind of understand her flirting via email with a man who was not her husband, to escape from her hectic reality.  However, eventually I just became frustrated with Kate.  I wished she would learn to stand up to people instead of resenting them and wallowing in her own stress.  And learn to simplify - no, your bossy little diva of a daughter doesn't need a homemade birthday cake, and you could spend that time WITH her instead of going crazy over the cake.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT - I discuss the ending below:<br /><br />Any good will I had toward the book was destroyed by the ending, and how her husband's decision to leave her was handled.  He waits till she's on a business trip, moves out, and leaves a \\"Dear John\\" letter and the kids with the nanny.  I would have understood it if he had found out about the e-mail flirting, and talked to her and the kids about what he was doing.  But he apparently just feels neglected and slips away like a passive aggressive fool, apparently leaving it up to the nanny to explain his absence to the kids.<br /><br />He's not exactly parent of the year.<br />But the book acts like Kate taking him back, quitting her job, and moving the family to the country is the only solution.  At the very end, she does start to think about getting into a business venture.  But the ultimate message of the book seems to be: you can't do it all, so don't even try ...
0486236951|5.0|Good Co. to do business with.  Quick very good service, well priced.  Will be a good addition to my collection of vintage craft books.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Not everyone will enjoy this movie. Have to like site gags and absurdity.  Movie takes on romance, military and natural disaster movies in a comedic way. Don't know how the actors kept a straight face playing their roles. It's one of those movies that you'll watch when you feel like having a laugh.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved It such a great story.  Had a hard Time putting it down especially after an unexpected twist the story takes.
141694737X|4.0|My baby is 10 months old and loves this book.  It was his favorite for a few months.  He likes to lift the flaps himself.  We've read this over & over.  Absolutely recommend.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|loved it so much! big fan of her and her amazing music. an amazing purchase that I made. very glad!
030746363X|5.0|Has great information about different types of workouts and diets that do work! This book is very result oriented,which makes me a huge fan.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|do not regret it one bit. such a good purchase, and such a great album! Very satisfied with it yay!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I decided a while ago that I would wait for this series to end before buying the entire set on Blu Ray.  Quality is great, very pleased.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|this right here! XX tops the best albums I've ever purchased. so so good. looking forward to them coming to Dallas!
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I like this one, maybe even a little better than the other one. I think it is amazing how he raised his daughters to be so amazing in their own rights.
B004QL7K70|5.0|Imagined that it would be funnier, but when it was said to be the biggest party movie ever, they did not lie. Altogether it's just like attending the party in a bubble. All in all, an ok movie. Hard to top though that's for sure!
B008JFUTT0|4.0|We saw the documentary and love his music. It is amazing to me that he never has made the &#34;big time&#34;. Somebody made some money off of him and he never knew. The words are raw but very true.
B003B02PFO|5.0|Gave it as a gift.<br /><br />Has not been read yet, not sure if she likes it.<br /><br />I like the ease and speed of ordering.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a great read also. I wonder how he has been able to help others prove their experiences also. I am in a Bible Study group and one of the ladies in my class recommended this one and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Gave it as a gift.<br /><br />Has not been read yet, not sure if she likes it.<br /><br />I like the ease and speed of ordering.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|I heard the author of the Diane Rheem show talking about this one and it sounded fascinating. I have been to China and am very curious about the life there through the centuries. It is so sad that the father could not ever get anyone to listen to him when he finally solved the crime by himself.....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing!  The words colleen gives to her characters  to speak to each other to convey their feelings or there views on things is so poetic. I'm not even sure how to put in to words exactly how I feel about this bc it's just a feeling that I can't find the words for and  I don't want to give any of the book away. But if enjoyed colleen slammed books then you will this one. If I had to say one thing that I wish was in the book more would *** might be a little of a spoiler*****  be I wish she would have had sky voice to him how much of the little things and big (  pinky holding, stargazing, name sky, counting stars etc) had helped her through and impacted her life and she remembered what had did for her.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Downloaded this pp to our phones and our 3 kids love this app, easy to use and cant beat FREE!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|While I was reading this book and for a couple of days after I finished it, my main thought was that it could have been so much better. Since it was my first read by Colleen Hoover, I kind of ended up thinking that she's an OK author. Good but not unforgettable.<br />Now that I've read both Slammed and Point of Retreat, I know for a fact that this book could have been so, so much better.<br />And I'm not referring to the plot which, frankly, I very much enjoyed. The premise is nothing overly original: Sky, our protagonist, has been homeschooled by her anti-tech mother all her life. She decides - also thanks to the pressure of her best friend Six - to enroll in public school for her senior year and get a glimpse of what \\"real\\" school is all about before she goes to college. Except Six gets accepted for an exchange program to Europe and ends up leaving her alone to deal with school and with Six's reputation as a slut which she acquires by proxy. She soon befriends Breckin, a Mormon gay guy who becomes her \\"very best friend in the whole wide world\\" from day one and Holder, a mysterious yet attractive guy who completely freaks her out and who allegedly spent a year in juvie for a hate crime.<br />Of course, the romance between Sky and Holder blooms (and what a hot make out scene!) and the plot could have seriously gone lost in an ocean of YA tropes if not for the fact that the story suddenly takes an unexpected twist and ends up in an unsettling and terrible territory. I'd rather not say more to avoid spoiling the story. Though slightly hard to believe for some aspects, it was good and gripping, heart-breaking and exciting.<br /><br />Why then the three stars?<br /><br />There are three reasons, for the most part:<br /><br />the first is that I am tired of supporting characters who have no life of their own. Breckin and Six were there just to be Sky's sidekicks when needed and disappeared altogether as the story unravelled, with no closure. None. Since the main characters were well developed it felt superficial and hurried to me to have other characters which were not as well formed, thought out, and could stand by themselves.<br /><br />the second reason is that the cheesiness got a bit out of hand at times. I do like romantic but the I live you thing just about killed me. KILLED ME. And how is it supposed to be pronounced anyway? I'm still trying to lower down my glycemia because let me tell you, it shot straight through the roof after that line.<br /><br />the final reason is that I found the second part of the book a bit lacking in respect to the first. Whereas plot-wise it definitely becomes a page turner, I felt it was not as well edited as the first part, which flew more naturally. I caught myself huffing and puffing through some unnecessarily stretched out dialogues more than once.<br /><br />Having said that, I think I basically picked out all the bad in this book. What's left is a nice story with great characters, a swoon worthy guy and a very courageous girl. Lovers of contemporary fiction should definitely try out Colleen Hoover because she's good and worth keeping an eye on.<br />As for me? After reading Slammed I am going to be reading everything she writes.rs were well developed it felt superficial and hurried to me to have other characters which were not as well formed, thought out, and could stand by themselves.<br /><br />the second reason is that the cheesiness got a bit out of hand at times.

1451648537|4.0|The book is a good read and the story flows. Although there are some dull parts, most of the readings had been entertaining. Overall, nicely written for a biography!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very fast paced and perfect for a quick read. Really pulled me in and kept my attention. Couldn't put it down!
B000FC12C8|5.0|I had just read this book a second time and it seem like there is still a plethora of enlightenment. Contents that did not make sense to me three years ago make more sense now as intellect level grows and experiences accumulates. Intelligent investor is worth the read over and over again as perspective changes over time and its principle remains timeless.
B002OR18HQ|4.0|The accordian and the fiddle didn't seem to fit, but it would be hard to top 'The Long Road Home'.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|An okay film but expected more from this film considering the cast of actors.<br />Slow start and a few moments of sappiness that just didn't fit.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am a TVD addict. Stelena fan all the way. I have seasons 1 and 2 already so season 3 was a no brainer buy for me. Season 3 wasn't the best out of the other 2 but it was still pretty great.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|this was a nice little cover...too bad I had to send it back when I sent the kindle back.<br />the kindle was the problem, not this case
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|I don't even really have to write a review for this album. It's a classic in my book. I owned it when I was 9 it was one of my first I ever bought on my own, and it still to this day is as amazing as ever. It's worth any price you have to pay, and it will never get old
B008K8H9C6|1.0|alex is not compatible with my Kindle Fire. Don't remember how much I paid for this.  Maybe just 99 cents.
B0011Z8S8E|5.0|Tracy is one of my favorites. This CD is made up of some of my favorite songs, including Baby can I hold you, Fast car and Talkin bout a revolution. She's amazing soulful and her voice is truly one of a kind!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Not compatible with my Kindle Fire.  Good thing this was free.  Would really like to play this.  Maybe in the future.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|When I was a teenager, I had this CD, I listened to it every night before I went to bed and every morning while I was getting ready for school, and one day somehow I lost it. It had such amazing songs on it like Don't know Why and Come Away With Me. Norahs voice is so different from any other female artist out there, she is soulful and talented and this album gives you all of that and more!
B005LJETYI|4.0|The book is a nice read for military and sci-fi junkies, and warrants a good few hours of your time. It's a shame that the extra material wasn't included in the Kindle edition, and I had to go off to the wild internet to see the drawings of the characters that come with the Japanese version of the book.<br /><br />Considering that &#34;All You Need is Kill&#34; uses a charming combination of Engrish in its title and making an original twist on the Japanese otaku media trope of abusing time loops as a plot device/twist, this is definitely worth a casual read.
B003LXSY60|5.0|I LOVE the Black Keys. Lonely boy, Everlasting Love. You name it I love it. This album is amazing, and a must have if you are a Black Keys fan!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome product to get the whole trilogy on. Can't stop watching! It was shipped very promptly and in a very secure package.
1577311523|5.0|Great book by a very inspirational man. A must read for anyone in search of enlightenment. Finished this book in about two nights!
0143122061|3.0|Ferguson gives a good explanation of the origins of the rise of the West relative to the Rest, but especially after WW II he substitutes assertions for facts. Perhaps he believes his assertions so much that he believes them to be unquestionably factual.<br />Understandably he quotes Churchhill, but multiple quotes by and references to G.K. Chesterton and P.G. Wodehouse seem strange.<br />He seems to have a particular distaste for American college student protests of the 60's, perhaps explained by his coming of age during the Thatcher and Reagan years. He dismisses the protests against the Viet Nam war as just cover for the real goal of \\"unlimited male access to the females' dormitories.\\" He covers the \\"support [given by student protestors] to the African-American Civil Rights movement\\" in a single sentence. And what is his point?  - apparently that the protesters were hypocritics for using Marxist rhetoric while \\"remain[ing] chronically addicted to American popular culture\\" since they wore blue jeans and bought records. The import of that as it relates to the rise of the West or the possible fall of the West is not clear.<br />His conclusion is that China looks poised to become the most world's dominant nation in the not too distant future, or maybe not. He insults Obama, or as he calls him \\"the forty-fourth occupant of the White House,\\" by asserting he is \\"removed from the realist tradition of American foreign policy.\\" And why does he do that? As he explains it, a possible pitfall of the Chinese becoming dominant is that they will so antagonize their Asian neighbors that those neighbors will form a coalition with the U.S. to stop them; but with Obama in the White House that couldn't happen. He leaves unstated how such a coalition would stop China from what? - diverting water away from Bangladesh or embargoing rare earths?<br />I would give 4 or 5 stars for the pre-20th century parts of the book, perhaps through 1945; but byond WWII the book seems to be more opinionand conjecture than fact.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I always look forward to a new John  Grisham  opus.  This one  has its moments--an interesting likable protagonist and a fast moving  plot, etc..  Somehow, the grand finale falls rather flat and is not very believable.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This product exceeded all our expectations.  Does everything as described and then some.  Movement of leaves is just unbelievable.  Music is perfect and volume control perfect also.  Would recommend this for all babies.  Remote control is wonderful bonus!
0714864803|5.0|This is an astonishingly beautiful cookbook, and quite exhaustive in its coverage of Levantine cuisine.  Be aware, though, that the price of the very attractive deckle-edged pages is that they are stuck together somewhat in the way of uncut pages in the books of yore--separating the pages takes time and patience.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Keeping in the same spirit as previous movies, this one doesn't disappoint. My daughter loved the adventure and innocent story.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|The movie is built around generally excellent renditions of early and later Beatles' music. The story is a bit contrived (e.g., two characters are named Jude and Prudence), but the songs make sitting through some of the over-the-top scenes worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you like classic solitaire this is a very good version. easy to play and the colors are nice and bright
B004T340QY|4.0|Love this quirky movie with it's great music.<br />George Clooney is excellent and really stretches his ability in this roll.
0316069434|5.0|As always Connelly builds slowly and carefully to a climax. he builds his plot carefully putting the peices together like Harry Bosch does.
1933308087|4.0|This book was to hard for me to do ,I don't know drafting and one needs to figure out the patterns.<br />I returned the book. Toni S.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Even though the book was a lengthy read, it gave me great insight into the good and bad in the life of the genius that is Steve Jobs. Whether you are an avid Apple fan or not (I am indifferent really) this book has substance and a great story about innovation, defying masses, failure and resurrection. Not throwing out big words, read it and see for yourself!
B003C1SPX8|5.0|I previously owned this fabulous live performance album on VHS, and was delighted to see it available on DVD. AS an added bonus, the DVD also includes extra features, including interviews and performances by the original band members. Mark Knopfler is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this app so much. I love a challenge, and among the harder levels, it certainly is a challenge. The easy levels are good warm ups, too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Must confess... I'm addicted! If you like temple run, then you'll love this game. Super fun! It brings out the kid in me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We downloaded this app so that we would have something to do with the tablet when away from internet. My husband, a non-gamer, is now addicted.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is wonderful and I love the story line.  Would recommend this to every women I know.  Can't wait to read everyday.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|slow moving with plot that is unimpressive even if it is a bit unpredictable. grisham is capable of much better.  i would skip this one.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|What a waste of time....obviously this is very low budget movie that was riding on the coattails of the game - very sad!  I have to doubt the ratings on Amazon anymore.... I find it very hard to believe people who have played the Halo series (the audience they are appealing to) would enjoy this movie.  And if you have not played Halo, this movie would make no sense at all (especially the last 10 minutes of the movie).<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:  I love it when the soldiers tells the cadets they are the only 4 survivors of the planet - really, come on, no warning of a war or anything, not one enemy soldier ever seen up to that point but the world is conquered? I guess communications were down for the whole war such that noone had any idea what was going on???  I guess that fleet taking off in the end came from another planet or something.  The whole movie made no sense; it did not flow with a theme, choppy with no clear direction.  It is like the producer was given $1 million to make a movie from Halo Gamers and he just laughed at them and pissed it away hiring a bunch of kids to play parts and armature CGI effects.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|A good basic chess game app. Nothing fancy but does what it should and works well on Kindle Fire. Basic but entertaining.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Downloaded the free lite version to my KFHD and found out there is no search function.  Upgraded to the $4.99 pro version, and the search function is all but useless. Put in my own address and it kept auto-correcting my street name.  Picked the address of my place of work, and the screen just goes black... no map, no nothing.  Back up, start over, same thing.  Useless. Why does Amazon sell stuff that will not work on devices they KNOW will not work? The Wild-West App world... buyers beware.
0865479410|5.0|Excellent read.  Will read it over and over again.  Smart, introspective, funny, and insightful.  Loved it.  Perfect answer to those who do not buy into the &#34;good thoughts heal all&#34; philosophy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was brought tears to my eyes! It sad, exciting, surprising, overwhelming, and happy at the same time!! I loved it. Bravo, bravo!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|THIS APP IS JUST GREAT ONLY PROBLEM ARE ADS BUT OTHER THAN THAT THIS APP IS GREAT AND ADS ONLY POP UP WHEN YOU GET ON THE GAME
B001KQ031Y|5.0|My husband loves this movie and it is a greay find to have it on blue ray. The quality is remarkable.
B005WFPAU8|1.0|The Blu-ray disc I received is a Rental copy, and should have been advertised as such (both the box and the disc are labeled with &#34;Rental&#34;). Disc contains numerous previews/ads that can not be skipped (like a rental copy). I'll keep this one for the time being, then I'll purchase a non-rental copy from another seller.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Slept awesomely now thanks to this Great app all in all I recommend to everybody and anybody who wants sleep
B0085A9HXS|5.0|the movie is the best action film I have ever seen. The action is just unrivaled on all standards. In the mix is a good story which is also enjoyable. I give this movie a high recommendation to any Martial Arts movie fans. I can almost guarantee it will hit your best action movies list.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I think this is a good book for all ages(to understand it I would be good to watch it first).Whoever reads this should know the first blank word at the end is eat and second is cheese.<br /><br />  I recommend this book to,<br />  CASSIDY MEADE
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I heard this on the radio and couldn't wait to get it, the CD was easy to find and the price was very good.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good book I was very surprised at how  Connor was fine with having a marriage without love and how Megan was fine with it too
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I got this for someone else and they love the music.  The CD came to me in time to give it as a gift and was in an unbroken case.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's really good and fun but it takes a really long time to do things and you need WiFi to play
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I honestly have never cried so much while reading, but I didn't mind it. This book was amazing; I real the book in a matter of two days, mainly due to Mr green 's characters who grew so close to my heart I do not want to let go. I know a sequel would never work, but I do know that I intend to read all of this author's other works as soon as possible.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I love this move action pack  like watching batman movies no one recommend this movie to me but I will watch this movie over and over again.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Played on my KF.  Excellent game.  Fun puzzles and HO games were fun...and I am not a HOG lover.  Long game...not one to finish in a short time unless you constantly use the walkthru/hints each time you may be stuck.  Playing the bonus chapter now.  Had two game  slow downs but just waited and the game continued.  Did not shut the game down but waited it out and it was fine.  Worth the $.  Need to make more like this!
0547884591|5.0|This guy doesn't need any more 5 star ratings. You are either a fan of 'the Ferris' or a skeptic. He has proven himself as an Author and a MetaLearner or should I say MetaTeacher?<br />Regardless this book is well written and highly polished. I routinely recommend his work. If you are into learning new skills, this is the guy you should be reading.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I got this for my son for Christmas, who is relatively new to the Dr. Who phenomena.  After watching Season 6, my whole family is hooked on the Dr!  I used to watch Dr Who when I was a teenager in the 1980's, so this was step into the time machine for me, except it wasn't...  This incarnation of Dr Who, starring Matt Smith, is so much better than the Dr Who I remembered.  This Dr Who is action packed, with great character development, great story lines, and much better visual effects!  If you have ever wanted to watch Dr. Who, this is the season to start with!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is such a classic Christmas movie and Tom Hanks does a great job in his 5 different parts!  My family watches it every year.

0756655307|5.0|This is a very large book and since you can see that it has the look inside feature it is full of colorful pages. Each character is fully described and has a complete bio.  Some of the more common characters have longer historical timeline bio's which make it even a nicer feature.  This book is a must have for the comic enthusiast.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Exceeded all expectations and I will be listening to it over and over again<br /><br />The CD is wonderful and I will be listening to it again and again - would love to see Il Divo live,
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great book.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It was the first download to my new Kindle Fire HD and I could not believe how fast it was to download.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|facebook for kindle fire hd leaves much to be desired.  The pictures are bigger than the screen and text requires almost a magnifying glass to read.  There is no way provided to adjust either.  If you click on any link them return to your news list, your are taken back to the top of your list and forced to scroll all the way back to where you were.  Even this last pain is exacerbated by often throwing you back to the top of the list without warning.
B00003CXDG|5.0|Fast paced, constantly moving, exciting Tom Cruise epic film!  He does his own stunts, which makes it more exciting.  Would highly recommend to anyone who loves to get lost in a movie.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I wanted to watch it because I had seen all the rest of the Ice Age movies. Like all sequels, each additional one just doesn't seem to be as good as the original unless it is based on a really good book. Seemed like they were just grasping at straws and wanted to make another movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Did not like this book. It was boring and the  ending sucked. I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Like the title states, I had high expectations. It's Disney Pixar, I would have thought it deserved them. However I was disappointed. Yes, the movie had some entertaining parts, and over all I enjoyed it...but boy am I glad I didn't pay to go and see it in theaters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i absolutely loved this  book from beginning to end.<br />i loved mainly the reaping and after the games.<br />i would definitely recommend it.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Thank you Mr. Child.  Never disappointed with a Lee Child novel.  Can't wait for his next project to be finished and available.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Unique story that you don't really see everyday. Took a while to really get hooked but was a very interesting read.
B000ID1J5E|3.0|There were quite a few moments in the film that just weren't well acted or that believable. Actually, the problem was more with the script than the acting. There were too many plot points in which we are required to suspend disbelief and go along with an absurd moment that makes absolutely no sense. This movie has more in common with a low budget action flick with a contrived ending than a high quality suspense film that keeps you guessing. There was definitely no guessing about the end of this movie. About halfway through the movie you know exactly how it's going to turn out.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for a couple of hours of dumb fun mixed with a modicum of suspense, this might work.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased this book to see what all the fuss is about.  It really was not for me.  This book reminds me of books written for a teenage girl (minus all the graphic sex).  I just didn't find it holding my attention.  I think I would have had a different approach if I enjoyed reading this type of novel, but I found that after the first chapter, I was done.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a definite must read! It's an easy, quick read that keeps you fully engaged and always wanting more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|At first I compared with local news weather reports.  Now I don't have too.  This app is so reliable its my only source of weather now.
0345803485|5.0|This is a great book (the whole series is actually).  Of course this may open some people's eyes to a whole new sexual world, which for anyone could be amazing. I was astonished at the number of people I knew who read this book, although they thought it was out of this world crazy and I thought the sexual encounters were awesome and not unheard of.  The man's role in the book is one I think many of us women have dealt with (not to the full extreme) but to some extent and it really opens your eyes on many things.  I enjoyed the whole series and will probably read it again.  Even my fiance read it and enjoyed it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|DEFINITELY A MUST READ.  WONDERFUL WRITING AND SUCH A GOOD STORY.  I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK EVEN THOUGH SOME OF IT IS TOUGH TO READ.
B00846REIS|3.0|If you are into 50 Shades you will like this. Although some parts are almost identical! Hopefully 2nd book will have more twists in it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Ideas for decorating is great. I get lost in this app forgetting everything else. Love the humor section I can not tell you how many I have copied and sent to friends that were so hilarious!!
0451196716|3.0|Out of all of the books and short stories I've read by Stephen King, The Long Walk was the most unique. It still has that macabre part of Stephen King that we all know and love, but it isn't horror. It's comparable to the modern-day hit The Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Long Walk is an event that takes place where 200 boys, 100 participants and 100 back-ups, are picked randomly to participate where they walk for days on end. Keep your pace above 4 miles per hour, because if you don't after 3 warnings, you are shot and killed.<br /><br />The main character is Ray Garrity, and throughout the book he mingles with some of the 100 he's walking with and forms a bond with a few of them, one being a boy named Pete McVries. As day and night passes slowly and hundreds of miles have been walked and boys are killed (in the book it's called \\"buying their ticket\\") one by one, the struggle for life over death become extremely real.<br /><br />Each character you meet in the book has his own idea of life and death, their own way of coping with The Walk, and what their life has been like before The Walk. As the characters continue walking and some of them even go insane, you see from Garrity's point of view what it takes to stay alive and how important mind over body is.<br /><br />There are a few reasons I didn't give this book five stars. For one, the ending was predictable to me and it left me wanting way, way more than what was given. Also, there were many, many details throughout the book that I thought were unnecessary, and some pages could be completely skipped through. But at the end, I thought this book was a very good read, and you weren't left bored reading it. It was definitely something I finished quickly, and finishing it was my first priority. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone (over about 17, of course due to language, some sexual crudeness and gore) and am definitely going to end up reading this book again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I AM EXHAUSTED! And not because it's 4:13am and I've been up almost 24 hours reading this book. No, it's because I feel like I just lived this intense love affair. I've never experienced such emotion from any book. Really, the gamut! Let me also just say that I'm a 26 year old model/kickboxing, ex heroin addict whose fiance was murdered in front of her. I'm more than a bit desensitized and this book had me bawling! Like a little girl at a Beiber concert in the front row who just caught his sweat soaked boxers his mom wrote his number in. Bawling not to mention laughing and pulling my hair out in aggravation and awww-ing over sweet moments and having to stop myself several times from throwing my tablet across the room at some moronic thing Abby or Travis did.<br /><br />Truly this blurb needs to be edited cos it does NOT do justice to this 400+ page creation! Yes there's a bet and she has a past but there's also an underground fighting ring, the mob, gambling, Vegas,tattoos, make ups, break ups, mass death and a seriously NASTY copy h. Oh and the token gay friend. Always love him.<br /><br />AND FREAKING BROCK LESNER!!!! OF course his last name was changed but a fighter in Vegas named BROCK who was kicked out of the UFC?! Yeah. BROCK!<br /><br />You know I've always been bothered by books with reviews instead of descriptions, but now I finally understand why. Some stories there are just no words for. This is one of them. Also, only one typo I caught and very early on. The word fight missing a T. I'm almost scared to order the sequel. Why mess with perfection? The same reason I'm scared to see the movie. I'm also convinced the writers of the screen play are going to kill of the person at the last fight. I'm sure of it.<br /><br />Buy this book. I've NEVER read a book twice and I'll be rereading this again and again I'm sure.<br /><br />This book CANNOT disappoint.<br /><br />It also helps if you imagine yourself as Abby, Ian Somerhalder and Cam Gigandets love child asTravis, Paul Wesley as Shep, Shemar Moore as Parker, the hot mean blonde from Lost as Adam... you get the point. :) :) :) :) :)

B0070Y46UY|5.0|A beautiful story about an extraordinary man. I could read it over and over again! I highly recommend this to anyone!
B006UAWH2S|2.0|Weird movie. I enjoy Ewan McGregor in just about anything. Thought it was going to be more of a love story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I cannot express my love for this book. And if there was a real life Charlie, we would have more than a lot in common. So many things he did and so many thoughts he had mirrored my own. My connection with him did not add to the book, however; because it was great on its own. I cannot tell you how this book will change you, or why you should read it. You just should. I can absolutely guarantee that something will change within you, though, or you'll realize that you're doing it all wrong. Because you probably are. I just hope that everyone takes into account the perks of being a wallflower.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Disappointed. Not as good as other  recordings that  I have of Les Miserables  Probably not a waste of money,  but close.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a heartfelt book that showed that love conquers all and gets you through anything. I see loving someone in a whole new meaning thanks to this book.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I was expecting this to be funnier but I still enjoyed watching this. I'm not a fan of Glee or singing contest shows but this storyline kept my attention. Good characters and I even actually liked the singing!
B007V65R54|5.0|With his success in forecasting the past two presidential elections, Nate Silver has become a celebrity geek.  With this book, he explains why so many predictions (whether they are about politics, baseball, earhquakes, or the stock market) are wrong.  Often it is because of preconceived ideas or  prejudices but mostly it is due to the failure to identify what is important (the signal) and ignore what is irrelevant (the noise) and to be willing to adjust based on new information.  A great read!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Wow, really well done movie! I have known identical twins that have had a very close connection and although it puzzles the mind, I guess siblings can fall intimately in love with one another. I guess \\"Love is Blind\\"!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The book is a riveting tale of personal bravery and heroism written, expectedly, at a high school level.  What is perplexing and infuriating is why the military would drop four men in extremely hostile territory, without adequate communication and support. The SEALs may not mind, but somebody ought to.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Okay I agree it is a little predictable but very enjoyable, with some twists. Portman and Kutcher are well matched - a lot of fun to watch. Makes you smile.
0316228532|4.0|Yes, I know this book isn't for kids; it's J.K. Rowling's first attempt at writing a novel for adults. But as a died-in-the-wool fan of the Hogwarts clan - I've devoured every single page of every single Harry Potter book, seen all the movies and bought all the DVDs - I figured if she can work her magic that superbly on books that appeal to just about all ages, her new one is bound to be pretty good at the very worst.<br /><br />To be sure, reviews have been mixed; some folks think it's great, and others have given it so-so ratings. So from the git-go, I tried to keep an open mind and, of course, put wizards and Muggles out of my thoughts. That said, after just a few chapters, Rowling's writing style came through. Maybe it was my unconscious mind peeking through, but I could tell who wrote this book right from page one.<br /><br />The setting is set in the small English town of Pagford and opens with the unexpected death of one of the town's council members (thus creating the title for the book). From there, it explores the backgrounds of the town and its rival neighboring village of Yarvil and a number of the residents of both - warts and all. All this is tied to the search for a council replacement; the winner, it seems, will have the power to effect changes that will be welcomed by some and not others.<br /><br />Early on, it's a big of a chore to keep all the characters straight. Rowling does a terrific job of introducing them and providing background information, but perhaps because my aging brain doesn't have the recall ability of my younger years, I tended to be a little foggy on who's who in a until about a third of the way through, when new characters stopped coming and I was comfortable in knowing the good, the bad, and in some cases, the ugly, of each.<br /><br />Yes, it takes a bit of slogging to get through the book - at 512 pages, it's hardly a piece of fluff (but if you think this is long, try wading through the 739-page Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book in her HP series). But just as with the Potter books, it is character development, and using well-crafted words and phrases to show how they're all intertwined, that is Rowling's strong suit here. Described by some as a comedy, this book is not a cliff-hanger that will have you on the edge of your seat; there are no ax murders or kidnappings and nobody falls off a broom during a Quidditch match.  Rather, it's an in-depth look at life that touches the emotions on many levels. Worth reading? Absolutely!allows, the final book in her HP series).

B009KHDT0C|3.0|I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan so I was excited to see this. It was ok but seemed pretty long and somewhat drawn out. I was also hoping for it to be funnier but if you've seen the trailer you've seen all the funny parts.

B000IK8JTG|2.0|The movie looked ok, but the sound was so faint on my MacBook Pro, that I had to use earphones in order to hear it.  I am talking about the sound on Amazon instant video, not the sound on a DVD.<br /><br />The movie  itself is impressive; Andrew O’Hehir’s  of  Salon.com picked it as the best movie of the year.

0316056871|3.0|Let me say at the outset that I don't know a lot about Tina Fey except that she's exceptionally talented, and I chuckle every time I even think about her spot-on impression of Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live. But I've never watched her popular 30 Rock TV show or, for that matter anything else she's ever been in. But what little I do know was enough to entice me to take a peek at her autobiography - figuring at the very least I'd get a chuckle or two out of it.<br /><br />And I did, at least at the outset. In fact, I told my husband Jack to be prepared to hear me chortle as I read through this one. But alas, the laugh-out-loud stuff came to a halt rather quickly, and the best I could muster from then on was an occasional smile. Although it was somewhat interesting overall, discovering such life-of-Fey trivia like what she learned from Lorne Michaels (creator and producer of the aforementioned SNL) just didn't grab me much.<br /><br />What I learned isn't much beyond what I already knew: She's exceptionally talented and her Sarah Palin thing was a bit hit, in large part because they look so much alike. New to me was that she has a scar on her face that she got as a child that has helped mold the person she is today (see, I told you I've seen her only on SNL sketches, and most of that time I was half asleep).<br /><br />That's not to say the book isn't interesting; it's just that it's written much like one of her TV sketches - and sketches work best when they're seen, not read. Still, the book is punctuated with a few real gems. Her observation that \\"Politics and prostitution have to be the only jobs where inexperience are a virtue,\\" for instance, almost made me snort coffee out my nose. And near the end (when the book starts getting really funny again), her bit on breastfeeding is a hoot.<br /><br />I certainly wasn't disappointed after reading her life story as it's happened so far; for such a well-known, public \\"personality,\\" she's a relatively normal woman with a good head on her shoulders, feet solidly on the ground and a work ethic that would put a Midwesterner to shame -- and in my world, by golly, that's a Martha Stewart good thing.a good head on her shoulders, feet solidly on the ground and a work ethic that would put a Midwesterner to shame -- and in my world, by golly, that's a Martha Stewart good thing.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|I really enjoyed the music but the humor did not have to be as sophomoric for the movie to be good.  It seemed at times  like the writers felt like every few minutes or so they had to put in some ethnic or cultural slam or stereotype.  Subtle humor is far more difficult to write.
B007HGPBRC|2.0|Nothing really new here.  I generally like Christopher Hitchens because of his unabashed atheism.  I expected he might write about the inherent morality of our species.

B00001IVQT|5.0|I will limit my comments to the Third Concerto. Of the four Rach 3 recordings of this work that were issued on CD, the one with Fistoulari (recorded in 1963) is the one to have. It has always been in my top 10 list of Rach 3 recordings (I have over 150). There is vigor and spontaniety that are missing from the remakes, and he plays the preferable scherzo-like \\"regular\\" first-movement cadenza (the thicker, more chordal \\"alternate\\" cadenza in used in the remakes) I remember how disappointed I was when the first remake, the Previn-conducted version (as part of a concerto/Rhapsody cycle) was initially released back in the early 70s. I found that reading much tamer, with inferior sound quality to the earlier version on top of that. The review appearing in the 1973 edition of \\"Records in Review\\" made similar comments. Tellingly, it is the 1963 version that was reissued in \\"The Decca Sound\\" box set from 2011. His later remakes with Ormandy (RCA) and Haitink (Decca) are preferable to the Previn version but still not as good as his first recording. There is also a live performance that was issued on LP only from 1966 with Mehta/Montreal Symphony on CBC Radio Canada RM 164, impossible to find these days, that is also excellent, though collectors may have to wait forever for a reissue.

1451627297|5.0|I've lived in Brooklyn since I was born in the 80's but a quarter of the way through the novel I wished I could have seen a little bit of 1950's America and learned to swing dance. Halfway through it, I wanted to plan a trip through the dusty Midwest to see some old American towns with my own eyes. Three-quarters of the way though, I yearned to walk down a certain street and maybe see a man with a card stuck in the brim of his hat. Finally, at the very end, I sighed and thought, \\"I'll be okay with seeing these things when the movie for this novel comes out\\".<br />This book is pure genius and impossible to put down. It drew me in until I absolutely felt like I was living these small towns and thirsting for that sugary pop he describes so well. It made me so thirsty, I tried to make real lemonade (I failed). It's honestly an amazing novel. Don't worry about horror - this reads like science fact. Phenomenal!
B000FC1MOQ|3.0|There is no question it is a moving story of recovery with a deeply sympathetic protagonist.  However, after learning that the story is fiction (therefore, a hoax), the impact is somewhat lessened and a sense of unreality tends to pervade the story.  I would recommend not learning anything about the book while you are reading it or go in with a complete enlightened mind and, thus, avoid disappointment.  Although if you have read this review, before having read the book, that's unavoidable.
