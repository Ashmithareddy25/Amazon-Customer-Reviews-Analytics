B0002S947K|5.0|I loved this CD from the first listen.  It's got a timeless feel to it.  The basic feel is pretty stripped down.  But it's sprinkled throughout with harmonica, accordion, and 5 piece string section.  These add some really nice flashes of color  <br /> <br />Ray reminds me of a few of my favorite singers from Austin - Ian Moore, Malford Milligan, and Doyle Bramhall II.  (A couple of these guys have since moved to other locales). . . . I'm always on the lookout for artists who sound \\"vintage\\", yet still come up with something new.  There aren't many who can pull it off. . .  <br /> <br />Another reviewer said that this has all been done before by Marvin Gaye and Van Morrisson.  True, Ray LaMontagne definitely has some of those elements in his style, but the songwriting is fresh. <br />  <br />Who knows how I'll feel about this CD 10 years from now, but the first listen hit me like only a handful of other albums have - Stevie Wonder's \\"Inner Visions\\", Doyle Bramhall II's self-titled, the Indigo Girls first album, and Chris Robinson's first solo album.  It's really good stuff.  Do yourself a big favor and get this album!

B0002Z0EYK|1.0|How did it cost so much to make this movie?  The acting, with the exception of Eric Bana was horrible, the music overcame the movie instead of flowing with it.  The fight scenes were played out horribly and the directing made the story move along at the pace of a snail, atleast until the end which they rushed entirely too fast.  There were maybe two or three redeeming factors of this movie but I was so disappointed.  Maybe its because I enjoyed Homer's Illiad, maybe its because I'm a history major.  But I think it was because I perfer movies that have smooth dialogue, good acting, and over all a good production, which this one lacked.  Brad Pitt can't carry a picture, he's better when he has other actors to lean on and play against.  He was definitley miscast.  So was Wolfgang Peterson as the director.

B0002TT0NW|4.0|Year three at Hogwarts, and we encounter many more wonderful creatures from storybook fane, including a griffin named Buckbeak, a werewolf, a monsterous hound reminiscient of the Moore-Hound of The Baskervilles, vampiric Dementors, a shadowmantic creature called a boggart, which reveals the deepest fears of whomever it faces, and a shrunken head with a Jamaican accent.<br /><br />As Harry traverses adolescence, he becomes rightfully more rebellious against the group of muggles he has the misfortune to \\"live\\" with - when one of them snidely mentions something about his father, he becomes enraged, transforming her into a veritable balloon, wherein she floats away as a bloated blimp - quite hilarious, really. Happily, by taking a Magical triple-storied \\"Knight bus\\", he eventually meets up with Hermoine and Ron upon returning to his own enchanted environment. The dichotomy of these living conditions would prove to be quite frustrating, I would imagine, yet Harry perserveres through their ignorance, fear, and subsequent petty aggrivations.<br /><br />The storyline in this sequel is somewhat more involved than the previous, with a most magnificent twist at the end, as he and Hermoine veritably travel back in time to correct the potentially lethal circumstances to save his god-father {Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman, whom you will remember as portraying Count Dracula in the magnificent Francis Ford Copolla version} from the deadly effect of the Dementors, which I must say, are quite impressive creatures themselves, and My personal favorite herein. I see very close comparisons with a certain segment of Black Magicians I know... , the so-called \\"Proteus\\" notwithstanding.<br /><br />This year, along with the fine resident instructors, there are some new members of the school staff as well as promotions: Professor Lupin {also a werewolf, ergo, the similarity to the latin \\"lupus\\" for wolf}; Professor Sybil Trelawney {a schizophrenic, crystal ball-gazing fruitcake}; Hagrid is promoted to Professor of enchanted creatures.<br /><br />Malfoy remains a rotten little [...], despite being a part of the fine House of Slytherin, and eventually is the recipient of a broken nose, compliments of little Ms. Granger.<br /><br />Again, in order to condense the film into a two-hour time frame, many scenes whiz by too quickly, but still remains a wonderful compliment to this most imaginative and enchanting series conjured by veritable \\"word witch\\", the nucleic J.K.

0393317552|5.0|Geography may not be destiny, but it sure helps. In this best-selling work, Jared Diamond attempts to answer the question of a friend from Papua New Guinea: Why did whites build and manufacture so much, but Papuans so little? The answer Diamond comes to is that much techological innovation, and the rise of the  West techologically and militarily, can be traced to something man cannot control: climate, terrain and geography. The Old World was blessed with crops easier to domesticate, so it farmed and built cities while the Indians of the New World remained hunter-gatherers. Eurasia had a west-east axis, so travel and exchange of ideas and tech was easier than crossing the different temperatures and climates of the New World and Africa with their north-south axis lines. Very eye-opening look into non-Western societies around the world. <br /> <br />As an addendum, I believe the great Victor Davis Hanson wrote Carnage and Culture as an alternative to GGS as to why the West has risen. I however, would recommend both books. I think they compliment one another well.
B000001EAQ|4.0|If any album was to fizz, it must be HTDAAB and not Pop. Pop and all the 90s albums are not only experimental, but innovative while still pure U2 rock and roll.  <br />It's unfortunate that the band that examines fame and rockstardom so much was the same band to cave into the demands and likes of Grammys and critics to make safe and LAME ATYCLB and further it with HTDAAB. Although Pop was dubbed as being a techno album, it was not. It was however, the best band in the world exploring the sounds of electronic music and mixing it with rock and roll- successfully. U2 sounds more true to form with Pop than with HTDAAB and more natural than ATYCLB. <br /> <br />Agreeably, as U2 have dubbed it themselves- the unfunished album- Pop seems just shy as being an album as 'complete' as the masterful Achtung Baby. Pop does, however, tell us that U2, at the time, evolved way past The Joshua Tree days. Pop blows up at you with attitude and musical skill that puts JT to shame technically. Pop resinates with funk and power, and it amazes at the ability for a rock and roll band  to play these 'techno' songs with only four guys as evident with the Pop Mart tour. <br /> <br />The 90s were: <br /> <br />Achtung Baby, the best album that reinvented the biggest band in the world <br />Zooropa, the album/experiment that wasnt supposed to an album <br />Passengers, the album/collaboration that U2 were afraid to put their name on <br />Pop, the album that wasn't finished  <br />The Best of 1990-2000, the songs that were safe  <br /> <br />Evident with the 1990s Best of CD, where the songs from Pop were different mixes than from the album, shows that the 90s were one amazinf remix. Its a shame that they included the songs from ATYCLB (2000) on this CD, because they dont reflect the sound of U2 in 90s at all. But no matter, Pop still seems like true to form U2 and an album I blasted from my stereo from 1997 and continue to do so. I wish I could say the same about HTDAAB.
0140157352|4.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to negotiate in a way that respects people and seeks to benefit both parties simultaneously. As a negotiating novice, this book was highly informative.  The book lays out many useful general principles about productive negotiations in a clear and well organized fashion. It is a short book (200 pages) and well worth the effort if you are at all interested in learning how to negotiate in a respectable fashion.
B000002KHH|4.0|This isn't my favorite album I own, but it's still a really good one. My favorite lyrical song of the whole album has to be War Pigs! The only song on here that I find average is the instumental Rat Salad. <br /> <br />Highlights: Iron Man, Electric Funeral, Hand of Doom.

It's more than worth it. <br /> <br />If you like this, check out 'Cryptonomicon' by Neal Stephenson.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to make an effective epic. It took a talented guy from downunder (Peter Jackson \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy)to demonstrate that taking a risk can pay off big time. Wolfgang Petersen's epic \\"Troy\\" although flawed, captures the epic flavor of Homer's tale with strong performances, visual effects that are truly stunning in their recreation of ancient Greece and a literate script. While \\"Troy' isn't a perfect epic, it battles successfully against monumental expectations and comes away bloodied but still standing.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a fine job as the proud and arrogant Achilles. I found no fault with his accent at all. After all, you have an international cast here with a variety of accents. When I last checked we were still pretty sure that the Greeks of the time didn't speak with English accents. Does it matter if his accent fits in? Not really as his performance more than makes up for that issue.  What matters here is whether or not the actor captured the flavor of the character. Pitt aquits himself quite well. Every bit his equal are Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and veteran Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lector). Sean Bean turns in an all too brief performance as Odysseus. The women characters do get short changed but that's not a surprise as this really focuses on the battles.  Peter O'Toole appears as King Priam and does a fine job in a limited role as well (although O'Toole hated working with Petersen so much he still hasn't seen the film). Diane Kruger turns heads as Helen of Troy. I've heard complaints about her performance and must say that she makes Helen a much more complex and real character than I thought possible.<br /><br />The script written by David Benioff isn't without its flaws. The film strays quite a bit from Homer's Iliad but when it does most of the time the changes work. Petersen's use of CGI expands the action rather than subtracting from it. In fact in one of the featurettes one of the CGI artists mentions that they had to convince Petersen to take some of the ships out the footage (compare the trailer to the finished product)as the way they were spread out it just wouldn't be believable.  While capturing the epic flavor of classic Hollywood films, the characters could have been a bit better developed than they were. Other than that, the dialogue provides witty entertainment particularly when Ageamemnon and Achilles trade barbed remarks.<br /><br />The disc looks exceptionally good with vivid colors and blacks darker than black coffee. The images sport exceptionally good clarity and sharpness. The anamorphic widescreen transfer looked like the better of the two particulary for a widescreen TV but both versions excel. The powerful battles for your attention with the intense visual sequences that Petersen has created.<br /><br />The extras include a number of very cool featurettes including \\"Troy: An Effects Odyssey\\", \\"Gallery of the God: A 3D animated guide to Greek myths and a really good featurette looking at the battle sequences. \\"From Ruins to Reality\\" also discusses the production design of the film and the challenges to recreating the past. This two disc set has both the feature film (spread over a dual layer single disc)with the special features located on the second disc of the film.

B0006399FS|2.0|Being that I am as old as U2 have been around (26) I have been a U2 fan since the Joshua Tree days and if I was older I would probably be a fan of theirs during their War days. However, I must say as much I love them, U2 didnt sell out in the 90s, but have sold out in the 2000s by regressing to an almost 80s adult contempary sound. With ATYCLB and HTDAAB, U2 have turned their backs on expanding their true sound and musical experimentation of thier 90s work, and most importanly, becoming better musicians.     Although Pop fizzled with critics, it showcased U2 at their most technically masterful and complex- a point where U2 had reached with their exploration of music and performance. In their explorations in the 90s culminating with Pop, U2 still found themselves going back to their true sounds, yet they were still changing the face of music as they had in the 80s and with Achtung Baby. No matter, through the 90s, laced with electro blurbs and pompous examination, U2 still sounded like U2.     In the 2000s, instead they have retreated to a safe and completely stripped down approach that was apparent with ATTYCLB, and overrated album that barely sounded like trademark U2 at all. Although both albums open with rocking and powerful first songs (Beautiful Day and Vertigo) what follows each is a much safer, and softer generic sound. With HTDAAB, at least U2 found room to rock and make some noise, but still dont seem to have the chutzpah to 'crank it up to 11' for fear of not making people happy. While Bono seems to croon more from his heart now than ever before, the lyrics and music pour from the soul, and to that extent HTDAAB is beautiful. Unfortunately, love ballads and emotional diddies are the sounds of an adult contemporary crowd and not the sounds of a new 2000s rock and roll band. But then again, with all the emo-rock out there and trite rock lyrics on the radios today, maybe U2 are more concerned with being on the airwaves than ever pushing the envelope again.The fact that U2 have mastered such a range of music since 1979 is impressive and is somewhat showcased on HTDAAB, yet falls completely short of being a new rock sound. Perhaps it is U2's fault for making promises with albums as they did with Pop (a dance album) and ATYCLB (a return to their 80s sound), but thankfully didnt do with Achtung Baby- the bands most successful lyrically and technically, and by far the best album. Or perhaps, it is because, as most anyone will admit, U2's trademark style is not nearly as technically skilled as other big bands, that might remain their crutch as the continue in the 2000s.     No matter, HTDAAB promises some great arena-rock tunes that will shine on their upcoming tour- something that no other band out there can even come close to matching. At their age and 26 years of accomplishment, U2 seem to have lost their inventiveness. Hopefully, the third 'really long title' album will be something new, but for now the world's biggest bands rely on the tried and true rules of rock and roll instead of making them.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|There have probably only been 3 or 4 movies I've ever seen in my life that even came close to making me laugh as hard as TEAM AMERICA. I literally laughed until my nose was running. The soundtrack of background music alone is worth the price of admission, the refreshing twist of skewering \\"political\\" actors is the icing on the cake.  If you need a good hard laugh, have a drink and go see this movie.  Be prepared to miss parts of it because you will be laughing too hard to hear.  Kudos to Stone and Parker...absolutely HILARIOUS.
B0000C8AQM|3.0|Although I wouldn't buy multiple cd's of the artists listed here, the collection they have is a good one. Mixes classics with heavier songs - reminiscent of how John Cusack creates a sound for Grosse Pointe Blank; Jack Black is in every piece. Only weakness: the No Vacancy pieces are a far cry from the good Adam Pascal music. If No Vacancy was on your hit or miss list, check out Adam's cd's (Civilian or Model Prisoner). Overall, nice choices that represent the film.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Truely masterly full of heart. Speaking the arty sense of 'reality', so it's not, but the movie just carry it enough to make it interesting but not over used. I couldnt help myself cry out loud \\"such a foolish irish\\" when that Irish guy spend his whole family's next month rent, about $500-$600 to bet on a $10 E.T. doll for his lil daughter. Very very surreal but then that's what movie's about, the stupidest thing done in the perfectest moment creates the most remarkable memory. It works, my heart pounds on whetehr is he gonna win that stupid doll or not.  <br />The older daughter's songs works miracuously too once she sings. Anyway, if you are looking for a heart warming movie this is the one, look no further.
B00000J7SS|4.0|This album is a long and intricate journey well worth the attention it demands of you. I had always liked In A. Silent Way, but never considered it an important album. My interest in Miles stops with the last albums he did with his second great group (Shorter/Hancock/Williams/Carter)I had never understood what all the fuss about this album was. It was only recently, after really getting into some of the great modernist/20th century composers I understood this albums appeal. In many ways it is directly artistically descended from things being done by Morton Feldman, Lou Harrison and Karlheinz Stockhausen (who miles actually cited as influence on pieces for subsequent albums) <br />It is made up of long, almost suite like tracks. There are keyboards and electric guitar, but what gives the album a timeless feel is the front horn line of alto sax, trumpet and bass clarinet. <br />The pieces do not have the standard tension/release brought on by solos or solos branching out from a stated melodic theme. In laymen's terms, the tension of the pieces are created by long rhythmic themes with soloist or groups of instruments coming and going without standard methods of cut off or reunion. <br />It is not easy album to \\"get\\" or even like right away, but it is worth exploring.
B0002S947K|5.0|As most people on here have noted, this is an excellent album and a great start for Ray Lamontagne.  He has an engaging voice, good lyrics, and interesting song structure.  I find it ridiculous that the people complaining about it say that it \\"has all been done before\\" or \\"this is no Van Morrison or Marvin Gaye\\".  Who cares.  Some moron claims he even knows what education level and clothing style go along with this album.  What the hell does that have to do with anything?  This guy writes heartfelt songs that have simple acoustic accompaniment.  If you like a little raspiness and some emotional songs then you'll like it.  I do.

B00006879E|5.0|I bought \\"Songs For Jane\\" out of curiosity long before their smash hit \\"This Love\\" raided the airwaves. I've got to say that this album surprised me because it's filled with amazing music and Maroon 5 quickly became one of my favourite bands. In my opinion, it's a mix of rock and pop and this album definetley opened me up to this genre of music. What's great about Maroon 5's debut album is that it's very catchy tunes are addictive and it's easy to sing along with the songs. The breakthrough artist of 2004 delivers one of the best albums of the year and make sure you don't miss this great collection of hits because it's definetley worth the listen.  <br /> <br />Best Tracks: This Love, She Will Be Loved, Tangled, Secret, Not Coming Home <br /> <br />a.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I just got this album about 20 mins ago which I ordered from this site (on a side not well done amazon, good service) and it is already one of my favourites. It normally takes me a few listens to an album before I can get into it but from the moment I pressed play on Laid to Rest I absolutely loved this album. It is a much more professional album than NAG & ATPB but just as good if not better, so far it seems to be slightly slower than ATPB but just as heavy! Raw and earsplitting the whole way and an excellent album from an extremely talented bunch of musicians. I can only expect more greatness to come from Lamb of God, in my opinion, the best metal album of 2004. Right up there with the greats like In Flames early stuff & (dare I say it) Pantera. GREAT JOB L.O.G.!!!

Just because Oprah had a show on it doesn't make it brilliant. <br /> <br />Even the episode of Sex & the City that this is based on concluded that relationships are not this simple.

B000001IPP|5.0|It seriously may be. Strangly, it came out the same year as nofx punk in drublic, and green day dookie. They all gave thanks to eachother to. and billy joe co-wrote the song radio with rancid. Kinda cool. But watever. If your not a green day fan(which i can understand) and your a punker, you'll still probebly love this cd. Nihilism is an incredible song. catchy, but very punk. Thats what this cd is. It's real punk, but somehow rancid made it catchy. Radio is possibly the best song on the cd. Sidekick, salvation, tenderloin and let's go are an incredible stream of perfect songs. Then there is as one, not bad but the chorus is so boring, which is the core of most rancid songs. I'm not going to say every song but i'll tell you that ballad of jimmy and john, gunshot, ghetto box, dope sick girl, and 7 years down will blow you away. this is rancid, before they met good charlotte. And they are PUNK!
B00005JN2Z|1.0|I rented this, against the better judgement of a few critics here who don't like the ending.  I have to agree 100%  The ending is unbelieveably predictable.  This makes it impossible to enjoy, and fills me with regret over the now wasted hour and a half.  They even do that bit where the Bad Guy gets shot (the audience is supposedto be relieved at this point) but it turns out to be miraculously a flesh wound (the audience is supposed to be shocked and re-frightened at this point) then the Good Guy and the Damsel in Distress narrowly escape aboard a subway (the audience is to be relieved once more) but the bad guy who has been oh I don't know SHOT IN THE NECK but nevermind that, he hops onto the back of the moving subway and chases the Good Guy and the D.I.D through the train until they have a shootout, empying their clips from about two feet apart (wow how exciting) and there is a dramatic pause (we're to be hoding our breath at this point) before the B.G. falls and makes a dippy little speech before finally keeling over.  Then the G.G. and the D.I.D. walk off together to the music for the closing credits.  Yes, it really is THAT bad.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I don't think anyone goes to a Will Ferrell movie expecting high comedy.  \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" is a crude and often silly movie.  However, if you take the time to look just a bit deeper, there are some pretty sly comments on the late 60's and early 70's when women were just entering the workforce and men were losing their minds.  Men could not conceive that women would not only take some jobs, but that there were women who would be better at their job than they were.<br /><br />No, this goofy comedy doesn't present these points in any kind of consistent and convincing way.  But hey, when women began working in newsrooms and everywhere else, what they faced every day was not all that intelligent, consistent, or convincing either.  There is a reason we have laws about hostile environments in the workplace.<br /><br />Will Farrell plays Ron Burgundy, the kind of local news anchor that existed when local news actually mattered.  He is a real celebrity in San Diego.  He has his news team buddies and these idiots rule the roost.  In comes Veronica Corningstone, played wonderfully by Christina Applegate (always undervalued in my book).  She is given the cat show types of stories until something happens and she gets a chance to actually read the local news.  This is a momentous occasion and, of course, she knocks it out of the park.<br /><br />Along the way Veronica and Ron develop a relationship.  She was particularly won over by his playing the Jazz Flute at a local club.  This is one of the better scenes in the movie.  Who remembers when playing the flute was actually something people, even men, did?  The 60s-70s was such a time.  And the wonderfully hideous shades of brown in their clothes bring back lots of awful memories for me.  A few more overwhelming greens would have made that image complete, but the brown sufficed.<br /><br />Anyway, the development of the relationship, its struggles and victories, is hardly the point of the movie.  Nor are its moments approaching intelligence.  The movie is a goofball comedy.  Just expect some rough language, and the kind of bawdy jokes that went on in every workplace during those times, and you will not be too shocked.  Vulgar, yes.  Obscene, no.<br /><br />Have fun.gence.  The movie is a goofball comedy.

0064407667|4.0|I am a 4th grade teacher in St. Paul, MN. I have just finished reading the first 2 books in this series to my class. Yes, I agree these books are sometimes morbid. But I have serious concerns about the people complaining about how Snicket defines words throughout his writing. Yes, adults would find this boring, but I assure you many children don't know the meanings of words in context. Many, in fact, keep reading and lose meaning because of it. I work in a school with over 50% of my students being ELL (English Language Learners). The way these books are written really helps them. The school library couldn't keep the books on the shelves and all my students wanted to borrow my copies of the books. Like I stated earlier, these books are morbid. But they are better than many video games, movies and even music lyrics out there. I have several students who are constantly talking about the movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre! You tell me, what's worse, these books are that movie? Children know more about what happens in the real world than many people think. We cannot keep them in a bubble for it is not real. Also, my students know theses books are fiction...not real. If it encourages them to read a book, so be it.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Wow. This film is simply brilliant. I saw the theatrical trailer for this movie in the theater, and I was not looking forward to it. And boy was I glad that I eventually was bored enough to go see it. This film is powerful and unforgettable. It achieves to grab your attention from the very beginning, and you never get bored throughout. Face it. We all know that it got horrible reviews in the box office. We also know that it stars Ashton Kutcher. But do not, I repeat-do not be fooled. Ashton Kutcher proves himself to be a worthy and well-rounded actor. And I believe you will find it fairly easy to simply forget about him acting stupid in other films.  <br />     First off, this film is fairly complex. There are constant flash-backs, and the simplicity of the film is lost within the first half-hour. The movie actually begins with a flash-forward, and the entire rest of the film is a series of devastating events that ultimately leads to the beginning of the movie. Anyone who is a fan of \\"Memento\\" should understand. This also is a drawn-out movie, which you may find watching it a couple times the very first day you buy it. But be warned-I was exhauseted after watching it. The chain of events has, in my opinion, a perfect ending as well. (By the way, the infinifilm DVD has a director's cut that does not live up to the theatrical edition, so miss out on that one.) But the movie does tend to get very graphic in some parts. But if you can get past that, you may finally have learned to not listen to what the critics tell you. <br />    But please-if you happen to be at Wal-Mart or something and you see the DVD on the rack, don't be hesitent to pick up a copy. The movie is simply mind-boggling, leaving you speachless. So if you're looking for a pop-corn movie, go rent Anchorman. But if you're looking for an experience that will stay with you for years, go pick up a copy of The Butterfly Effect.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I was excited when the guys in Dream Theater said they would be releasing a new cd just one year after their previous effort.  I purchased it on the day it was released and I was very excited.

And beyond the occasional song getting in my head, I remain so today.   <br />I will not compare this to previous albums.  I will take it on its own.  Quite honestly if this were a band I did not know, \\"As I Am\\" would not have convinced me to buy this cd.  I enjoy it, but not enough.  And as for the other tunes, I do enjoy \\"Endless Sacrifice.\\"  The opening slow guitar is very haunting and I dig it.  As for the rest of the album, Overall I dont have much to listen to.  \\"This Dying Soul\\" is sub par(James LaBrie's incredible voice should never be rapping).  It just goes nowhere.  \\"Vacant\\" was even a disappointment. Mr. Labrie sounds great but it also goes nowhere.  \\"In the Name Of God\\" is ok at best.  It is definelty a mroe melodic tune with an enjoyable chorus but it goes too long for no reason.  I can enjoy long songs but not if they are just long for the sake of adding more stuff.  With all this said, I have not wavered in my support for DT.  I still enjoy their other material and eagerly anticipate their next release.  Not everyone has to enjoy every realease of a band to enjoy them.  This one just happens to not connect with me as it might with others.
B0002X314C|5.0|I just love this album!!!! i don't own it yet because it isn't available in Finland until next week.But I have heard it several times on the internet,and it's one of the best albums ever. <br />Buy it!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is truly a work of art. From the first time I listened to it, it stayed in my CD player, and if it was changed, it was usually to a different player. This CD is, I'll say it again, truly fantastic from beginning to end, the only track I found skippable being \\"Treefingers\\". I've also found this CD extremely easy to take a walk in the snow listening to it, or just driving around. I don't know why, but there's a certain quality that makes it perfect for said ways of movement. Another thing, this album seems indescribable to me, so I'll shut up and let you listen.
0440238609|5.0|I am currently reading Northern Lights (The Golden Compass to the US Market) but I have just come back from London where I saw the stage production of the trilogy at the Royal National Theatre and have read the play numerous times so I am familiar with the HDM theology. Nicholas Wright, the author of the adaptations for RNT sums it up well. The plays and the book are not anti-religious, nor are they anti-god. They are anti clerical dogma. When spiritual beliefs are tied so much to earthly dogma, coming from man and not the numinous, beliefs get \\"hardened\\" and \\"dreary\\" and downright \\"untruthful.\\" His Dark Materials is a celebration of the numinous beyond earthly dogma. It is a critique of what we as a race make of spirituality. The Authority may represent G*d but rather more what we make of Him, and not whatever He may really be.     On that note, I think Phillip Pullman is a storytelling genius. The story is memorable; Pullman makes you feel emotional about the characters and their many experiences, and keeps the reader riveted. When I saw the play last week, I was amazed by the number of children in the audience, and how many of them stayed riveted for the entire 6 hours of action (The three books were split into two 3 hour plays.) There were no children talking loudly to their parents at any point in the whole theatre. This was not a visit to see A Chipmunk's Christmas Story, these were young children entranced by what they were seeing.    I highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone who has ever wondered if we've got it right when it comes to how we perceive G*d and organized religion. And to those who haven't, because these books will challenge what you believe and strengthen your own spirituality, if you allow it to. I also highly recommend the stage production at the Royal National Theatre on the south bank of the Thames in London, England. It is playing until mid April 2005, and it is the best epic piece of theatre I have ever seen. And while you'rethere, buy the script for the play. I don't think it is available anywhere else.    The bottom line is this: experience Pullman's world in any way you can because it is worth it. Unexamined and unexplored beliefs are as true as those explored and examined, but I know my experience with Lyra, Will and Pan has strengthened my own spirituality in ways that I never thought possible.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|this is such a great movie. yes the plot is dry and week. no the director is poking fun at the state of idaho for \\"you people that live there.\\" this movie is great cause the charactors are very funny. in that case u don't need a good plot cause the charactors make the plot. napoline is the charactor u don't expect  to find to be funny and whitty but he is. he is the geek in all of us who is not afraid. he has nothing to lose. thats what makes the movie so funny. i laughed for 45 straight minutes when i saw this and then went and paid 4 more times to see it in the theaters again and again. it is 100% worth the money to buy this movie. keep in mind people, this is a comedy movie, not somebody holding a grudge against a state. the dirctors are looking for laughs, not looking to piss people off. if people take comedy movies too serious then they shouldn't be watching comedy movies.
B000002AZ8|5.0|First off, I should say that I was 5 when Pearl Jam started to really take off and have come back to listen to them.  This was the first PJ album I bought, mainly because I had remembered my older sister playing Better Man and Nothingman and downloaded them.  I instantly fell in love with the entire mood of the album.  I can easily say that I like the album much more as a whole rather than the individuals songs.  The album's track listing doesn't lend itself to having each song be a universally loved and appealing track.  But when you listen to the entire album, you certainly appreciate it much more.   <br /> <br />My favorite song is easily Better Man, mainly because I love the simplicity involved. The lyrics are beautiful and its another example of being able to really feel what Eddie Vedder is emoting in his songs.  Another similar song to this is Nothingman, which guitarst Stone Gossard declared was his favorite PJ song in Guitar World Magazine. It's another simple ballad, but has the edge that so many artists lack when it comes to slower songs. <br /> <br />The heavy rock side of the album is fantastic as well.  Last Exit and Spin the Black Circle get the album going quick and keep you into it.  Not for You is gritty, raw, and great.  Corduroy is the only other song on the album that really lends itself to radio play, but its still a well written song.  The emotional Immortality is amazing. Bugs is a great little off-key session by Ed set to accordion. Satan's Bed is a gritty song as well, and it can take some time to get used to. Whipping is almost like Clash and PJ mixed. <br /> <br />Then there are the so called experimental tracks. These are the ones I usually skip when driving.  They arent bad, they don't interfere with the flow of the album, but they aren't for everyone.  These are Aye Davanita, Pry To, and the wicked  Stupid Mop. I still don't particularly like Tremor Christ. <br /> <br />I would recommend this album, but not for a first time PJ buyer. This should be your second or third PJ album. If you just want the four classics (Alive, Even Flow, Jeremy, Black), get Ten. If you want probably their best balanced album, get Vs. If you want my favorite PJ album, get Vitalogy. <br />
B000669GAI|5.0|If you like Pearl Jam and do not want to get all of their cds because you lack the money or if you love Pearl Jam but lack a cd burner to make your own compilation, this is for you :P I would say this is one of the greatest best of cds to ever come out and includes many of my favorite songs by them. Many of these songs are hard to find and are on singles that few have other than truly hardcore fans. I recommend this to anyone, especially at this price.
B0006399FS|1.0|From the beginning to the end, this album is nothing but 11 iPod commercials, implying just a big marketing propaganda that want us to buy every U2 soup, nevermind how bad the album itself is.     All this brianwashed attention to every new U2 release makes the band remaining as 4 men who don't have to work anymore to make all the money they want once again.     Let's face the truth: anyone could have done this album, because there're too much filler, sounds from previous albums, the same guitars and production, the same mixing, etc. Therefore, this isn't a new album, rather is a compilation from their recent outtakes, courtesy of All That You Can't Leave Behind.    The band has been roughly the same since 2000, that's ironic, because what made U2 Gods was their awesome ability to create a whole new world of music with every new U2 album, at least until Pop.    With this corporate product U2 shows they have aged badly. This hyped bomb goes just for the mindless teens. For worse, all that iPod publicity makes this bomb just something to throw away.    Like what's feeling most of U2 fans, I don't need this iPod soundtrack. I didn't buy it and I won't do it.    Listen to the 90's U2 instead.
B000000JO3|5.0|hey the cd kicks ass easily worth five stars and just for the record Thrice is not punk and it never was so some people need to shut there mouths.
B000002MUW|5.0|After the bad reviews from Erotica, everyone thought Madonna's career was over, but they were wrong, very wrong. In 1994 Madonna made her comeback with her R&B inspired, \\"Bedtime Stories\\". All the tracks are wonderful and tell a story that is perfect just before \\"Bedtime\\".  <br /> <br />1. Survival: This is a song that tells how Madonna has survived her career and how it is not all glamorous, but she will be \\"Living to Tell\\". The music is wonderful. You will hear a fire crackling and a wonderful piano tune.  <br /> <br />2. Secret: The best song on the CD. Madonna talks about how her baby has a secret and she is just finding out about it. The video tells us that transvestitism and love yourself for who you are, are the themes to this song.  <br /> <br />3. I'd Rather Be Your Lover: My least favorite song on the CD. This song a real R&B feel to it, and the vocals are decent here, but they could have been better.  <br /> <br />4 Don't Stop: A great R&B floor filler. This is the dance song that completes every Madonna CD. The song is great to dance to with that someone. You will never wanna stop!  <br /> <br />5. Inside of Me: A nice song dedicated to Madonna's Mother. She talks about how she misses her mother and even though she is gone, that her mother will always be inside of her. The only bad thing about this song is that Madonna puts a lot of deep breathing in the song, which does not fit in with a song about missing your late mother.  <br /> <br />6. Human Nature: Wooooh. Madonna's F-You song the public for insulting her sex-era. This song doest not have that much of an R&B feel to it, but it is still hot! This song officially closed the door to Madonna's sex-era.  <br /> <br />7. Forbidden Love: A gorgeous song with Babyface. This song has a beautiful beat w/a saxophone and other instruments. The song is talking about having an affair that is considered to be forbidden, but you just don't care, because you want and love the other person. <br /> <br />8. Love tried to Welcome Me: A more blues song talking about how a person has tried their hand at love, but they were not suitable enough when love welcomed them. Another beautiful song. <br /> <br />9. Sanctuary: A different kind of love song. Madonna is talking about how she wants to be merry in her flame's soul and how we don't need materialistic things, just love, which is our sanctuary.  <br /> <br />10. Bedtime Story: DOES NOT FIT IN, is the only thing that will come to mind when you hear this song. This is a revelation to what Madonna was going to explore next, techno. This song was written by Bjork. The song is really good, but it is meaning is questionable. Only Bjork really knows, if there was a meaning or not. <br /> <br />11. Take A Bow: The song that brought Madonna back to the top (at least in the U.S.). This song is about a man who keeps breaking Madonna's heart and taking her love for granted. This song is beautiful and has a lot of meaning in the lyrics. This is a great song to close out a wonderful album.  <br /> <br />This is probably most 2nd best album to date, after Erotica. The songs are great and this album shows Madonna will not be destroyed. <br />
B00069L0XG|5.0|These are two great action packed movies in my opinion the whole story on the umbrella corporation the t-virus and then add in hot milla n sienna in the 2nd one you cant get any better except for adding Nemisis these are two good movies and i think are done very well from all angles the 2nd is defintly a step up due to the bigger budget so the effects look better but they didnt add alot of cgi in this movie as much as in the first but after reading these reviews is what made me want to post one i dont understand how you people can sit there and call it a bad not directed well movie which i think it a bunch of crap i think anderson does a great job with it to me the movies are great and this is the first time ive heard anyone complain the first one was said to be the prequel to the video games the 2nd added in some of the scenes the gamers would recognize from the games even if you know nothing of the games you will still like the movies i cant wait for the 3rd and final movie which is suppose to  be more heavly related to the games
1881273156|5.0|I read this book when my husband and I were on the rocks and if anything it gave me patients.  It showed me that love isn't one sided.  I wanted to help my relationship so much that I didn't want to put it down.  A must read for married folks or those who just want to have a strong relationship with there partner.
044024157X|4.0|This book is one of John Grisham's best books. The plot is interesting although one flaw I would like to address is that he tries to open up too many issues within the book. At times the reader forgets the whole point of the book. But most of the time it was very entertaining and is a good read for anyone who likes thrillers.  <br /> <br />Another strong point of the book are the characters. Danny Padgitt, the rapist, part of a sleazy bootlegging family, is quite believable as you might find such characters in rural areas. Willie Traynor, a college dropout who persuades his rich aunt to loan  <br />him enough money to buy the local newspaper. Callie, the mild-mannered African American woman Willie befriends while in Missippi. And also a sleazy lawyer bent upon getting his client, Danny Padgitt out of jail. These kinds of characters make the book enjoyable because these are people you possibly know or can imagine existing.  <br /> <br />The plot addresses many different issues. Although many people say that some issues are irrelevant to the topic, the fact is his \\"page fillers\\" are quite interesting in itself. The Last Juror is not a hardcore courtroom book. Although some of the setting is in the courtroom, we don't see that much of it like we do in other Grisham books. Those of you looking for a hardcore book that has it's setting 70-80% in the courtroom are going to be disappointed. Although some of his books, namely, Skipping Christmas and Bleachers drift away from what Grisham does best, The Last Juror still has the Grisham signature on it and any fan looking for a good Grisham book should enjoy it immensely <br /> <br />The conclusion of book manages to be both expected and surprising at the same time, it doesn't end up to be a depressing book nor is it everybody-lives-happily-ever-after book. It has the right blend to make it satisfying to the reader after he has turned the last page. Overall, this Grisham book is one of his best books, it has a few loose strings, but other than that it was a very interesting book as it keeps you hooked on it through different methods.  <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|I bought this cd even though I never really listened to his music when he was alive.  I wanted to know why a lot of his fans were so sad when he died.  It's really grown on me, I like it more every time I listen to it.  Of course most of this album is depressing, but oh so beautiful in a tragic sort of way.  Every song is just so infused with what he was feeling and what caused him so much pain.  \\"A Fond Farewell\\" really stands out to me because it reminds me of a friend of mine who committed suicide.  Once again, this music is sad but beautiful.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|My teenage daughter purchased this lump of crap and played it for us tonight. After what seemed like hours of torture my reaction was: \\"Was the local dung seller out of product???\\". <br /> <br />There is nothing that remotely passes for humor in this *cough* movie. The characters are poorly written, the plot is more mundane than most recent \\"teen\\" movies and its only devotees seem to be the same group that find Ashlee Simpson talented. Well, it does have a redeeming factor: IT EVENTUALLY ENDS! The next time I want this amount of excitement, I'll watch my toenails grow. <br /> <br />Please, do yourself a favor, use a home-lobotomy kit on yourself before you buy this garbage....only then would it appear to be funny.
0671027387|5.0|This was my first Dan Brown novel. What I found interesting was the amount of researched information that he has included in his novel. Examples include the Delta Force, the guns that use snow/ice instead of bullets, etc. However, once you read more of his novels, I realized that the author assumes his readers to be too simplistic. Several places, I was able to guess what the next thing was going to be. Nevertheless, very easy to read and quite captivating.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a fantastic novel about the persistence and will of man.  It inspires one to believe in man, to believe in his mind, his strength, and his adaptability.  Yann Martel reveals the story of Piscine Molitor Patel with amazing clarity and eloquence, interweaving the many devices at his literary disposal.   <br /> The story is told in three parts: a history of Pi's life until the departure from India, his time at sea, and his arrival at an Infirmary in Mexico.  The story is told in first person, showing Pi as a highly intelligent Indian man capable of moments of brilliance also of and incredibly humorous sarcasm.  Though Martel is only telling another's story, it seems as though Pi writes it completely himself, Martel's character just feels that real. <br /> Martel creates this realness with both his word choice and figurative devices.  At any time Martel can burst into a paragraph of just similes, each creating such brilliant imagery that the reader cannot help but see the scene as the author intends.  He also uses extensive catalogues, also helping with imagery.  Flashbacks are also used, but they mostly appear in the section in which Pi is lost at sea (which is where most of the novel takes place).  Each one shows Pi's loss of the sense of time while he is at sea, events are jumbled in Pi's mind, and the author makes sure the reader notices.  Also of striking importance are the sections told from Martel's view during his time spent with Pi to write the novel.  The reader again sees Martel's ability as a writer, but also has the opportunity of seeing Pi as an adult.  Also of great importance are chapter lengths.  The chapter is not used to evenly divide the novel, but to divide ideas.  They vary in length from one that is two sentences to one that is twenty six pages.  Each serves a purpose and presents and idea. <br /> Martel's Life of Pi culminates into being one of the greatest survival stories ever told.  One that shows the true grit of survival at sea, but still with elegance and poise.  It is an inspiring story that invigorates the soul and should be read by anyone looking for good fiction.

B00005T7I1|4.0|This film is an over-the-top, glorious production filled with comic book color schemes, fantastic makeup effects, and superb costume design.  All the performances are either subdued and nuanced or grandiose and overblown.  There is no middle ground here with regards to characterization.  The good guys are nice and the bad guys are nuts!  The star of this film is Warren Beatty who is genuinely inspired here as Director, Producer, and leading man of this stellar creation.  For what it's worth this film won 3 Oscars back in 1990 for Best Art Direction(superb), Best Makeup(surreal), and Best Song(\\"Sooner or Later\\").  I recently saw this film, having only a faint memory of thoroughly enjoying it long ago, and it has aged surprisingly well.  There is the occasional, short-lived moment of a running joke that needs to be quickly discarded or it will get old; and some of the acting is so ridiculous at times as to strain suspension of disbelief; but for the most part this film is just plain fun.  That, and Madonna looks and acts absolutely scalding in a memorable supporting role.  This is a good movie with many scenes worth revisiting.  Recommended.
B00005JMCN|4.0|It's Ken Burns meets Frank Capra in the inspirational true story of Seabiscuit, the little horse who could. This inspirational tale follows a half-blind ex-boxer (Tobey Maguire), a mustang breaker (Chris Cooper) and a millionaire (Jeff Bridges) as they bring their knobby-kneed, undersized racehorse, Seabiscuit (played by a herd of horses), to win Horse of the Year honors in 1938. But the movie is not just about a racer; the horse's personal story of triumph over tragedy mirrors that of the American nation in that era. Based upon the book by Laura Hillenbrand.<br /><br />A great companion for this DVD is the 2007 Ruff[[ASIN:B000OCY7KI Ruffian]]ian movie.<br /><br />Staci Layne Wilson
B00006FDCD|5.0|In 1986, American horror novelist Stephen King released what was to become one of his most famous and critically acclaimed novels. The novel, simply called IT, spanned nearly a thousand pages in its first hardcover run. It had taken the author nearly four years to write, and had become an obsession. The subject of this work was the lives of seven friends who grew up in a small town in Maine called Derry, and the fateful summer of 1958 that bonded them to one another for the rest of their lives as they tried to survive a series of child murders.  <br /> <br />Three years later, director Tommy Lee Wallace received a screenplay for a TV mini-series based on this book. Never being much of a King fan himself, he took the script with ambivalent feelings. By the end of the first scene, he knew he wanted to make this production.  <br /> <br />The mini-series IT originally aired in the US on 18 November 1990. Split into two 90-minute parts across two nights, the mini-series effectively splices the interwoven narrative of the novel apart into two distinct Acts - the tale of childhood (90:05) and the tale of adulthood (89:35). In the first half, we meet the seven children and their adult counterparts - there is stuttering Bill Denbrough (Jonathan Brandis/Richard Thomas), whose younger brother George was one of the victims, porky fat boy Ben Hanscom (Brandon Crane/John Ritter) who has been forced to move to Derry after his father was killed in Korea, funny man Richard Tozier (Seth Green/Harry Anderson) whose less-than-funny comedic routines elicit the catch-cry `Beep-Beep, Ritchie' from his friends, the wheezing asthmatic Eddie Kaspbrak (Adam Faraizl/Dennis Christopher), the reserved Jewish disbeliever Stanley Uris (Ben Heller/Richard Masur), the beautiful poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks Beverly Marsh (Emily Perkins/Annette O'Toole), and the social outcast black kid Michael Hanlon (Marlon Taylor/Tim Reid). Together they are the Lucky Seven, or more appropriately, the Losers Club.  <br /> <br />As children, they are terrorized by a series of child murders in their small town, and a series of supernatural occurrences that the adults of the town are apparently blind to - a thing that sometimes manifests itself as a clown called Pennywise (Tim Curry), and other times as a facet of their darkest nightmares. Without a name to put to this thing, they simply call it the IT. As adults, when the murders begin again, each of them must decide whether to fulfil their promise to return to Derry to fight IT, and whether as adults they can achieve the luck and magic that saved them when they were kids.  <br /> <br />Is the mini-series better than the novel? No - but that is not really a fair question. Does it do justice to the novel? In some respects, yes. Tim Curry puts in one of the most memorable performances as the menacing clown Pennywise, that can change from jocular and amusing to brutal and terrifying in an instant. It is hard to read the book now and not picture Curry's performance in your head as you go. The mini-series also does a good job of capturing the nostalgia associated with childhood when you look back on it now.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the limitations of the mini-series format mean that IT misses out on a lot of what the novel contains, particularly in terms of King's commentary on what it means to be a child - your limitations counterbalanced with the gifts that you have in your youth that you steadily lose with time. The coming-of-age component of the novel really seems to have been skipped over in the mini-series, and it becomes more a tale of adventure, rather than a tale of innocence lost. In an era where audiences are very willing to accept 13-part series made for cable TV, it would be quite possible to split this book up over those 13 hours and make a far more comprehensive adaptation that captured those aspects. However, when we can now look back nostalgically on the 80s, a remake of IT for the new millenniumwould struggle to draw a crowd. Besides, who could you get to play Pennywise the Clown that would be any more schizophrenically menacing than Tim Curry?  <br /> <br />I hadn't sat down to watch this mini-series since the late 1990s, and was surprised at how much it held my attention all these years on. Some of the acting is a little camp and melodramatic, but that was the style of the era, and as such I can forgive these shortcomings. Ultimately, 14 years on from its first airing, this is still quite creepy, which is a rarity in adaptations from Stephen King novels, and I can guarantee that it will definitely scare the hell out of your kids.  <br />
B0002UXBD6|4.0|I like this album a lot. But for people new to Green Day, I think that some of their older songs are better, such as Basket Case, Brain Stew, and Minority. You can find those songs on the album International Superhits. Don't get me wrong. I like American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. But I think their old stuff is a little better.
B00005JN0T|2.0|Ahem. This movie would have made a pretty good summer flick except for one thing: the title. <br /> <br />If you're going to make a movie based on a book, at least do the decent thing and make sure it has at least more than one or two things in common with each other. <br /> <br />As soon as I walked out of the theater, I was immediately deafened by the outrageously loud noise that I later identified to be the sound of Isaac Asimov spinning in his grave. I was horrified to see that a movie based on a classic novel would turn out to be nothing more than a two hour long commercial for Converse, Audi, FedEx, Prudential, Mercedes, and Dos Equis. <br /> <br />This travesty has more product tie-ins than all three films in the Matrix trilogy. It was nothing more than an underhanded attempt to cash in on whatever's hip in modern pop culture by slapping a popular novel's title onto an amalgamation of everything that is cliched and overdone in today's film industry.  <br /> <br />An awesome plot is ruined by unnecessary explosions, moan-inducing one-liners (I mean, 'Converse, vintage 2004?!?!' What the hell is that?), cliched characters, and the ever-present and inane face of Will Smith, who apparently feels that it is necessary to produce a monolopy on all summer movies. <br /> <br />Yes, Will, Independence Day was a great movie, but I still haven't forgiven you for Wild, Wild, West and Willennium. <br /> <br />It's still a decent flick to rent on a Friday night. Explosions, killer robots, and a hot female lead certainly make for a fun time, but I just wish that they removed all references to Asimov and had instead titled it something like, 'When Robots Attack' <br /> <br />I'm still wondering how Alex Proyas could have gone from directing 'The Crow' to directing this piece of ass-embly line trash.
6304428928|5.0|I love this movie. Dustin Hoffman is superb. In 1988 this film won 4 Academy Awards - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay. The growing love and connection between the two brothers, who were separated through no fault of their own, is moving and touching. Also, to see the extraordinary abilities of an autistic savant is just amazing. In the film the music is outstanding and some of the scenery in the Western USA is just great. This is a movie that you can see again and again. The story is well developed and captivating.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Have you ever wondered what would happen if the weather just suddenly went out of control? The Day After Tomorrow is a depiction of what might happen if the weather were to spin out of control. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a famous climatologist, suggests a sudden climate change due to the effects of global warming. His many warnings to the President are constantly put aside, but they soon realize the mistake they made. <br /> If you've watched other films with Dennis Quaid, you'd expect his role to be quite similar in this movie, which would be the hero of the action packed film. Quaid stars as the main character in this film and most of the film is focused on him and his family. He stars as a climatologist, but the movie rarely ever focuses on it. Instead it's more about how Jack Hall is willing to risk his life to get his son out of the frozen city of New York. This shows a role more like that of a father rather than that of a climatologist. <br /> Roland Emmerich directs The Day After Tomorrow in a way similar to other movies he directed before such as Godzilla (1998) and Independence Day (1996). He concentrates on big global issues, like the testing of nuclear bombs, first contact with aliens and in this movie, the issue of global warming. Just like the previous movies he directs, The Day After Tomorrow has impressive eye-catching special effects which can grab your attention when you least expect it. The movie provides realistic special effects that immerse the audience in a believable setting. Probably the only disappointing part of the CGI animations would be the vicious wolves, which are so ruthless, it makes that particular scene rather far-fetched. Besides that, the movie's special effects are undoubtedly the most impressive aspect of the film. <br /> The film, however, speaks against the U.S. government quite a lot. The United States President (Perry King) can't seem to make a single decision about what to do with all the warnings he is receiving. Instead,he asks the vice president (Kenneth Welsh), who looks strikingly similar to Dick Cheney, to deal with it. He responds by continuously telling the president to ignore it all. This is, of course, a serious mistake and they soon learn the consequences of their actions. This might cause people to view the U.S. government as something like the bad guys of the film. It also makes one wonder what Emmerich's intentions were with the cast he chose. At present day, George Bush is responding quite similarly to the President in this film by saying that the issue of global warming is not a big deal at all and there are greater matters to be worrying about. Since the president of the movie acts in a suspiciously similar way, it may seem that Emmerich purposely chose specific actors to portray the U.S. government in a rather negative way. <br /> Through this film, Emmerich shows the destructive power of global warming, also to tell us not to be ignorant about global warming and to show that it is a real threat. In the movie, no one bothered to do anything until they finally saw what the consequences were. Everyone is affected by the storm and no one is spared. There are so many hidden messages, that it seems incredibly obvious that the movie's purpose is to raise awareness among the people. One such quote was said by Jack \\"Mr. President, if we don't act now it's going to be too late.\\" This quote like many others throughout the movie show that global warming can become a very big problem in the future. <br /> One thing lacking in The Day After Tomorrow is a complex plot. There is not much development in the story, so when the film ends, you might walk away feeling a bit unsatisfied. There are moments of suspense, that can keep you on your toes, but overall the plot is nothing to be impressed with. Emmerich's other movies have plots that develop much more effectively than The Day After Tomorrow, which means someone might end up seeing this movie for the special effects, rather thanthe story.  <br /> The Day After Tomorrow focuses very well on the current issue of global warming, making it a very good movie to watch. Along with the incredible special effects, the movie is entertaining, yet believable. With these strong points, the movie can make anyone wonder whether or not it is too late to stop global warming from becoming a reality. <br />
B00005QCYD|5.0|It's simply unbelievable the way computer tech has advanced. JP3 is even better than the first 2. The dinosaurs are more real and scary than ever. The raptors have evolved in color and intelligence. The T-rex is badder, but the spinosaurus is meaner.  <br /> <br />The spinosaurus is the newest dinosaur on the block, and although the size information and odds of a spino defeating a rex aren't quite accurate, it is one awesome dino! The pteranodons are great too, with an incredible chase seen in their giant bird cage. <br /> <br />JP3 is the best of the three movies, and I'm sure the fourth will be even better. Joe Johnston is a Spielberg clone.
B0002OERI0|5.0|There's a reason why this album is up for the top awards at the Grammys. It's good. Who cares about the politics involved. That's not the whole fricken album. Yes, that's part of it but if you Republican George Bush lovers would open your minds(which I know may be hard for you) and actually listen to the album instead of writing it off based on one song you may actually like it. There's much more than politics involved. If someone wants to explain to me how \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" or \\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams\\" is bashing the president or the government I'll listen. I find it bashing American culture in general as much as the government.  <br /> <br />Now I really enjoy all the songs on the album, but the tracks that stick out to me are:  American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Blvd. of Broken Dreams, St. Jimmy, and Wake Me Up When September ends. I like the lyrics of American Idiot and the general sound. When I first saw the video I thought \\"wow why haven't I gotten into Green Day sooner?\\" Then I heard Blvd. of Broken Dreams on the radio and decided I HAD to get the CD. Since many have heard the first two singles I'll describe my other favorites. Jesus of Suburbia is like a 5-in-1 song. All the parts are mid-fast tempo. St. Jimmy is a fast paced song(actually reminded me of some older blink 182 at first), and Wake Me Up When September Ends is a ballad. It hasn't left my CD player since. Now I can't compare the album to the \\"old Green Day\\" as some say, but their \\"new\\" sound or whatever is awesome. If you are a fan of punk pop/rock then I would highly suggest checking out the CD. Overall I'd give this album an \\"A\\" grade, and ranks as one of the best albums I've bought ever. Here's to Green Day to winning album of the year at the Grammys!!!
0064407667|4.0|I read this book at Borders while taking a break from reading textbooks, and found it refreshingly morbid, entertainingly dark, gleefully sarcastic, and ultimately optimistic despite its promises of inevitable woe.  Sure it's a tale about three siblings whose lives SUCK, but in the end their talents, intelligence, perserverence, and devotion to each other pull them through.  Personally, I think that's a great message, more hopeful than depressing.  Plus, I especially love the funny definitions Snicket gives for his SAT words.   <br /> <br />If you like reading, check at least one of the books out.  They're fun and child empowering for kids, and have plenty of amusing winks for parents/adults.  For fast readers, it should only take an hour or two to read, so no big loss.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The Stones have always had their own sound. Even when Keith Richards was borrowing heavily from his hero Chuck Berry. His unique style embelishes every stones record. The haunting atmospheric intro to Gimme Shelter shows Keiths genius. Let it Bleed is one of their finest and I highly recommend it to every fan of classic rock!!!
B00004U8JU|5.0|Jurassic Park is undoubtedly the best movie to come out of Hollywood. I say that not just because I'm a dino-fan. <br /> <br />The thing that makes JP the most special is that fact that Steven Spielberg Originaly was going to use robotics for the entire film. They moved pretty well for robots, but even Spielberg himself stated that they were \\"too jerky\\". Then, he was shown the power of the computer. He saw a computer-animated scene of a T-rex chasing some gallimimus. The movements were so smooth, so real, he decided that computers were the thing to use. <br /> <br />JP simply blows you away with the special-effects. Especially the scene where the T-rex catches a gallimimus. It's incredible the technology we have. <br /> <br />After seeing Jurassic Park (for the 900th time) I can say with confidence that it is the best movie ever. It doesn't concentrate on gore like a lot of horror movies, and the dinosaurs aren't evil monsters when they kill somebody. Jurassic Park is Steven Spielberg at his finest
B000002IQ9|4.0|In order not to rate two similar products, I will review both of them in these few lines. <br /> <br />The CD is a good compilation of the best of Phil Collins. It contains the real hits of his first recordings (In the Air Tonight, Sussudio, Another Day in Paradise,...)  plus some of his contributions to the film music (Against All Odds, Easy Lover,...). In fact it is too similar to the further compilation \\"Hits\\". <br /> <br />In order to get the real \\"live\\" punch it is strongly recommended to buy to video/DVD. The extra tracks are: Hand in Hand, Hang in Long Enough, Inside Out, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, The West Side, That's Just the Way It Is, Doesn't Anybody Stay Together Anymore?, Colours, and, Always. Colours and The West Side also include two tremendous drum duets with Chester Thompson, exactly in the same way they did in Genesis \\"Seconds Out\\" and their live performances. Hand in Hand is also a good starting tune for each of Phil's concerts. <br /> <br />But the fifth star is well deserved for a nearly 3-hour (!) concert. Amazing and powerful. Collins sings, plays the piano and shows that he has been one of the best drum players in the world, remembering his beginning in Genesis. The more than ten players band gives 110 %: \\"The Stars of Faith\\" wind quartet, the vocal support trio, Leland Sklar, Darryl Stuermer and Chester Thompson are of the most confidence to him and their performance is marvellous. <br /> <br />If you want to get the best of Phil, it's more or less to get this or \\"Hits\\", but if you really want one of \\"the best live concerts ever\\", go for the DVD. Phil Collins has never been so superb!
0767812166|5.0|I first saw this movie way back in 1985 and at that time I thought it was fantastic, better than ET (hugely overrated). <br /> <br />Well, time has not diminshed this feeling and after recently purchasing the DVD I can only say that it's still just as good.  <br /> <br />Jeff Bridges gives us a truly believable and touching performance, he was deservedly Oscar nominated and Karen Allen is simply gorgeous as the wide eyed widower who cannot quite believe what is happening to her. The two carry the film very well and the supporting cast especially Charles Martin Smith are also excellent.  <br /> <br />The movie succeeds on just about every level, emotionally it's truly touching and scenes such as the deer outside the diner and when Karen Allen describes the definition of love are real chokers.  <br /> <br />The gorgeous Arizona landscape looks sumptous and the filming overall is first rate, John Carpenter clearly demonstrates his mastery of filmmaking throughout every scene. Forget the fact that the special effects could have been better, hey this was 1984 and way before CGI overpowered us with overblown special effects. By contrast some movies made today are so full of totally unnecessary special effects that it's no longer clear whether what you are seeing is real or animated.  <br /> <br />This movie doesn't need to rely on this level of interference, it works on an emotional and human level.  <br /> <br />As a side note - some years ago my wife and I visited Meteor Crater near Winslow and we looked for the cafe where Jeff Bridges, Karen Allen and Charles Martin Smith played out the final scene but we couldn't find it, must have been created for the movie.  <br /> <br />Anyway, all in all simply fantastic and easily one of my personal favourites.
B000002UAX|3.0|This album has some fine music...but...its simply too long. And that takes away from the strong songs like REVOLUTION AND THE WONDERFUL DEAR PRUDENCE.    It would've been better to condense this album down to a single album to showcase the cream of both discs. Why this wasn't done I'll never know. But as it stands I can only give it 3 stars.
B00004WIDR|5.0|I don't believe what I'm hearing from the other reviews. One question, are you saying that A ship that big can't hold five tons of animal? Must be a pretty weak ship. <br /> <br />Anyway, JP2 is as good if not better than the original JP. It has some incredible scares, such as when the compy's head poppes out through the bushes. Using the same if not better state-of-the-art computer effects that made the first one a huge success, JP2 is an incredible story of survival, and a lesson is to be learned about greed. <br /> <br />JP2 has some differences in the dinosaurs though. The raptors have evolved from a dull brown into a freekish red with yellowish stripes. T-rex is more bluish grey now than brown. But even the texters of the skin have more depth than in the original. <br /> <br />JP2 is a must-see must-own movie, and it doesn't get enough credit. It's story line is involved, and it's one of those movies you have to see several times in order to fully grasp its power. Spielberg has done it again!
B00007FOMP|4.0|After 5 years of having repeatedly heard this album, I have come to a judgement. It is a truly hard thing to say, for WHAT'S GOING ON has been, over these years, one of my favourite LP; nevertheless I need to be true to myself and to all of the people reading this and wanting to buy the album. It is undisputedly a great album, worth buying. It is certainly an historic recording for it has broken with a joyful but easy and unuseful tradition in Soul Music to embrace a more mature and moral consciousness (Stevie Wonder will follow magnificently). Yet, despite what said, the lyrics are, if not banal, really elementary. I totally agree with Chris's review; he says that these lyrics could have been written by an 11 year old kid and it is rather sad to say that and it hurts me so bad (you could never imagine!), but it is SO true. All that has been said by Marvin in this work had already been said a thousand times better and less ingenuously by Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel and all the folk movement several years before. So, I understand that his brother had just come home from the infamous war of Vietnam and that he was upset and he wanted to say that all was wrong, it is wholly comprehensible and so true and so courageous of him. But, at the same time, I cannot justify his total lack of skills in communicating these painful feelings with an original and deep use of language. It has to be said, anyway, that what he is not able to express through a good use of poetry, he can magnificently express through a celestial modulation of his voice; a voice which is, despite all the so called \\"Soul Voices\\" (that are NOT), one of the FEW REAL soul voices ever existed. The music is also astonishing, using a lot of bongos and percussions never used before in Motown.  <br />To conclude, Marvin's problems are the same of Stevie's. When they produce social-consciuos album they are quite childish in the use of words but immensely creative with the use of music. As Iam Italian, I mean, a non-English native speaker, when I listen to foreign-speaking music I always have tent to pay a lot of attention to the music and less to the words. Usually I'm not so able to understand immediately what the singer says and I have to read the lyric. So, most of the times, firstly I base my judgements upon the music and the feeling an album can give to me, and only after upon what they say. And often I am really enthusiastic at the beginning and disappointed later. It is the exact contrary of what happens with italian artists. They are (better...were) really good in creating a poetic language and moving meanings, but they are poor in music and sounds, or better still, not original as Anglo-saxon music. But this is another topic. Sorry. <br />P.S. I gave 4 stars because it is still too painful for me to give 3 to WHAT'S GOING ON.
0399143904|4.0|This was my first Tom Clancy book, and the first book I have read in awhile.  I read this book off and on for quite some time, but when I really got into reading it regularly, I could barely put it down.  The descriptions of the characters were very good and made it feel like I really knew them.  It was suspenseful and made me sit on the edge of my seat.  This was one book where you really root for the good guys and wonder what the heck the bad guys are thinking.  The ending seemed too easy compared to some of the missions throughout the book.  I was expecting a more exciting ending, especially with the length of the book, and that is the reason for the 4 stars. I do, though, highly recommend reading this book.

It turns out the bus is going to a birthday party, and in the final page you can look for all the characters at the party, and try and spot the birthday girl. I'm looking for more books from this illustrator, because this one has been such a hit.
0345457684|3.0|It could be we just don't like mystery novels. At Inchoatus we have a very definite focus and agenda: we think that speculative fiction--when it's at its very best--is mythic, important, and touches on age-old archetypes. Mystery novels just aren't built to do that. They're insular, self-contained, self-centered affairs that live and breathe on what happened to a very, very small group of people. For example, it's very difficult to compare Altered Carbon to something like Red Mars. In Red Mars, the incidental death of some rich corporate guy wouldn't even register as a blip on something as dramatic and all-consuming as planet terraforming and revolution. But Morgan asks us to read an entire novel about it.     But it's not just that: even mystery novels can have something more to say for themselves. The movie Blade Runner was built as a mystery thriller but had very important things to say about awakening intelligence in androids and the meaning of the word \\"soul.\\" Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson is also somewhat of a mystery novel but also touches on very important themes of how people live and breathe in virtual environments and what information and language actually mean to those societies. Our take is that Altered Carbon is missing these things that flesh out the better works of Blade Runner and Snow Crash. Morgan--in this book, at least--just doesn't run that deep.     WHO SHOULD READ THIS    If you love detective novels in any sense--be it set in the past, present, or far-flung future--then you'll really like this book. If you enjoy your mystery novels with heavy doses of violence and sex, then you will love this novel. Fans of Philip K. Dick will especially find resonance in this book as will, to a lesser degree, fans of Neal Stephenson's earlier cyberpunk work and William Gibon's Neuromancer. Altered Carbon is darn near the twin sibling of Reynold's Chasm City so if that book did it for you so will this one. Not particularly striking since you can glean all ofthis from the snippets quoted on the book jacket but in this (rare) case the book jacket gets it right. While we submit that there is a lack of depth in a literary sense in this book it is the case that the concept of \\"sleeving\\" is interesting and people deeply invested in concepts of soul versus body will find quite a lot of satisfaction in the subtext. Beyond all of this, it is also very brisk completely self-contained, and reads quickly, which is a welcome respite from a great lot of tomes and chronicles we've had to deal with lately from the publication houses.      WHO SHOULD AVOID    If you hate mystery novels, most definitely pass. You absolutely must have an emotional stake in \\"whodunit\\" in order to enjoy this novel. That is an absolute requirement. If \\"whodunit\\" is a niggling detail to you and you'd rather explore some of the more philosophical concepts of living in the 25th century, you'd better check out a different author. Also, in a sense, this novel reads very much like it was intended from day one to be seen on the screen. We feel that it may be a far superior movie than a book. Yet reading things that seem more visual than imaginative can be irritating to a class of reader more in tune with, say, Ray Bradbury. If you're in that camp, this is another novel for you to avoid.     [...]
0790729628|4.0|Do you equally enjoy film noir and science fiction? If you do, you would probably enjoy Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner.\\" Set in 21st Century Los Angeles, \\"Blade Runner\\" is the story of a jaded, borderline depressive detective (played by Harrison Ford) who's been manipulated into hunting down a potentially dangerous series of 'replicants.' Replicants look human but aren't; nor are they robots. Rather, they are synthetic humanoids created in labs and virtually identical to human beings. Of course, as with all film noir detectives, Harrison Ford ends up learning far more about personal and societal corruption than he does about the case he is investigating. The film's visual style is stunning, especially considering that it was released in 1982; huge chunks of James Cameron's \\"Terminator\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\" series would have been impossible without \\"Blade Runner,\\" and the film also mightily influenced Japanese animation for over a decade. It was a welcome antidote to the \\"Star Wars\\" formula when it was released. <br /> <br />\\"Blade Runner\\" is a worthy addition to your collection if you are a noir or science-fiction fan. If these interests intersect, as they do with me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, \\"Blade Runner\\" was one of the first DVDs released in the 1990s. As such, there are no extras to speak of (though it includes subtitling and both widescreen/fullscreen versions), and it only contains Ridley Scott's \\"director's\\" cut of the movie, which is slightly different than the version shown in theaters in 1982. Due to extended behind-the-scenes legal problems, it's unlikely that we will see \\"Blade Runner\\" rereleased in a more extensive package anytime soon. Still, I would rather have \\"Blade Runner\\" in a no-frills package than not at all. It's proof that a science fiction film doesn't have to be written for an audience consisting entirely of 10 year old boys.
0385513755|1.0|Torture, plain & simple.  Inhuman, unholy, horrific torture.  This is one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to lay across my eyes.  As I writer I have personally made my publisher vow on the souls of his children to place a pistol between my eyes and shoot me at point blank range should I ever ever create something as monstrous as this \\"novel\\".  The writing is over-the-top melodrama, the plot unbelievably ridiculous.  I wanted to tear my eyes out of their sockets to relieve them of the cruelty I subjected them to by forcing them to look upon and process this pile of dingo dung.  For the love of all that is holy, stay away from this book.  You'll thank me for not reading it, I promise you. Oh! The humanity!
B0000D96NW|5.0|A barrage of guitar and drum tones and brutal riffs not seen since their 1994 debut \\"Burn My Eyes\\".  I've remained loyal to these guys since then and enjoyed parts of the albums in between, but this one was a pleasant surprise, starting off loud and continuing through a range of tone and emotion that shows how they have matured as musicians. <br /> <br />Essential moments: <br />4:39 on track 1, where an already crushing song gets a second wind with an amazing finish. <br />2:55 on track 2, defiance and aggressive riffing that demand to be played at the highest volume possible.  Only another few bars of the closing riff beating on my brain could have made this one better. <br />Track 3 is a blistering song with an awesome chorus proving there is always room for harmony vocals to flesh things out more. <br />Track 8 features hardcore riffage and great vocal tone, especially when Rob sings \\"in grace you'll be no more\\". <br />   <br />Check this album out if you haven't already! <br />

B00009W0U4|3.0|Irreversible (Gaspar Noe, 2002)<br /><br />The best thing about Irreveresible is watching this film and knowing Monica Bellucci would, a few months after its release, be playing Jesus' favorite hooker. There's a cruel irony to it that is obviously unintentional on Noe's part, but that resonates regardless.<br /><br />That said, there has been a huge amount of hype surrounding this movie since its debut a few years ago at Cannes. Quite simply, said hype is about as accurate as it was for Cidade de Deus; while there is one scene, very early in the film, that is, truly, the most violent thing I've seen in any mainstream cinema outside Takashi Miike, neither the violence in the rest of the film nor the infamous rape scene is nearly as harrowing as the media, and many other critics, have made it out to be. It's still not for the weak of stomach, by any means, but it's not something to go out of your way to avoid for those reasons, either.<br /><br />For that matter, there really isn't all that much violence in the rest of the film; most of it is contained within the rape scene. (This should not be surprising.) As for the rape scene itself, it is (mercifully) shorter, and far less brutal, than some filmed decades before (exploitation \\"classic\\" I Spit on Your Grave immediately comes to mind).<br /><br />With all that out of the way, how's the rest of the film? Not bad, but not all that great, either. The movie opens with two men, Marcus (Vincent Cassel, who played Gilles de Rais in the horrid Joan of Arc flick The Messenger) and Pierre (A Very Long Engagement's Albert Dupontel), running through a gay club looking for a man they know only as Le Tenia (The Tapeworm). The scene ends with Le Tenia's murder, and the rest of the film details the events leading up to it. Cassel, Dupontel, and Monica Bellucci all turn in good performances, and despite the fact that most of the movie was improvised (the original draft from which Noe shot was reportedly only three pages long), there are some very well-done parallels in the film that take excellent advantage of the reverse-time convention the film follows (and do make the rape scene more disturbing, when considered at length afterwards).<br /><br />The film's main problem is its camerawork. At the very beginning, the swirling handheld shots make for a good disorienting effect, but the cameraman simply didn't know when enough was enough; much of the film's ninety-minute length is shot in this same way, as if Noe handed the handheld to a person with extreme vertigo during much of the shooting. When your effort at disconcerting the viewers gets boring, you've gone too far. Also, it's obvious that some slip-ups were left in the film in order that the scenes would not have to be re-shot (Cassel, when his character is asked for his name, answers \\"Vincent-- whoops! Just kidding.\\", for example), giving the whole thing a rather amateur feel to it that one doesn't expect from a director so well-known after his first film (not to mention so well-backed; the list of producers for this movie as almost as long as the cast).<br /><br />One other thing, though. Special attention should be given to an excellent piece of comic relief provided by musician and performance artist Costes in the opening scene (he's listed in the credits as \\"fistman.\\" You'll know him as soon as he opens his mouth.) Costes is a funny, thoroughly twisted guy, and he shows it very well in this role. Those aware of Costes already shouldn't be put off by the film's subject matter, so if you're a fan, it's defintely worth watching-- the first twenty-five minutes, anyway.<br /><br />Not a film about which it's really possible to say \\"I liked it,\\" but I appreciate some of the deeper resonances of what Noe was trying to do. See it, as long as you're not put off by sex and violence, and judge for yourself. ** ½g), there are some very well-done parallels in the film that take excellent advantage of the reverse-time convention the film follows (and do make the rape scene more disturbing, when considered at length afterwards).  <br /> <br />The film's main problem is its camerawork.

B00005A0N5|5.0|I've been quite a fan of Nightwish for some time now, and have burned/owned all of their albums (I admit that I make copies, but only because of my town's lack of good CD stores). After a enjoying Nightwish's haunting music for nearly two years, I've decided that Oceanborn is arguably one of Nightwish's strongest albums, and was my favourite, surpassing even Century Child, until Once came along; that album, of course, outshines them all.<BR>This album takes a step away from the slightly 80's-style, opera-enhanced power metal of Angels Fall First and approaches gothic metal at times, especially in &quot;Devil and the Deep Dark Ocean&quot; and &quot;The Pharaoh Sails To Orion&quot;, where Wilska's growling vocals complement Tarja's powerfully operatic voice well. It's kind of a shame that they didn't do more than 2 tracks of dual vocals with Wilska. It's good, though, that Nightwish changes and develops their style instead of always sticking to the same formula and sound on every album.<BR>One thing that is constant about all of Nightwish's releases thus far is that there never seems to be an exhaustion of interesting twists in the music. Solos range from guitar to keyboard, and occasionally flute throughout this album. <BR>One such interesting twist, for example, is &quot;Moondance&quot;, one of Nightwish's only purely intrumental pieces. This track proves well that while Tarja Turunen is the star here, the rest of the band is just as strong and can stand on their own. Their performance is highly polished with a nice, clean sound refreshing to the ear, but with enough harshness to satisfy many a metalhead.<BR>In short, Nightwish remains one of my favourite metal bands of all time, and I hope that they will continue to make wonderful music for years to come.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have been a Star Wars fan for years and after years of having to watch the Trilogy on VHS or Television, it was nice to finally get the Trilogy on DVD, which in my opinion should've been released  on DVD when the Special Edition was released. I have watched the movies with and without the audio commentary.  It would've been nice to have the Trilogy as we all know them from their original releases on the DVD as well so we can see for ourselves what was changed, added, etc., but overall I'm happy with having the Trilogy on DVD.

B000001C6M|4.0|In recent years, Slayer has made a habit of putting out albums with the alluring promise of each successive release being a \\"return to their roots.\\" If that were the case, we'd certainly have more albums like this one and fewer like 'Diabolus In Musica.' Most fans regard 'Reign In Blood' as being Slayer's best album, and the quality of early releases like 'Show No Mercy' is often downplayed or neglected entirely. This is a shame, considering the fact that both the technicality of the song-writing and the tight musicianship seen here come together to produce some of Slayer's most solid material ever. <br /> <br />From the opening chords of 'Evil Has No Boundaries,' it's clear that Slayer is acting on its Judas Priest influences moreso than the various punk/hardcore bands that the band would later go on to cite as being hugely significant to its formative years. Over-the-top solos abound and it's difficult to beat the infectious twin guitar harmonies that typify tracks like 'Crionics.' Aside from Priest, the other most obvious influence here comes from the blues-derived \\"biker\\" metal of Motrhead (for a perfect example of this, listen to 'Metal Storm/Face The Slayer'). The nice thing about 'Show No Mercy' is that it manages to wear its British influences on its sleeve (no pun intended), while sounding distinctly American by way of California. <br /> <br />What truly differentiates Slayer from the multitude of other early thrash/speed metal bands from that area -- like Metallica or Exodus or Testament -- is the adherence to and gratuitous use of darker or perhaps more Satanic imagery. While some other contemporary bands might have flirted with this type of symbolism, Slayer took the avenue paved by Venom -- yet another British band -- and basked in the dark aura of inverted pentagrams and minotaurs and Hell itself. Although it's debatable as to how serious the band's devotion to all of this was in reality, the fact of the matter is that it gave the music a rather unholy feel to it, even at this somewhat larval stage in the band's development. Obviously, King et al reveled in it all. Tom Araya's vocals snarl and shriek in inhuman fluctuations, sounding both appropriate and somewhat sick both at the same time. There's not much that really has to be said about Dave Lombardo's drumming...the man's a legend. <br /> <br />For its sense of structure and its demonstration of musical competency, I will actually break with tradition and say \\"Show No Mercy\\" is Slayer's best album, beating out the fan favorite \\"Reign In Blood.\\" If you are for any reason interested in the historical foundations of extreme metal, this is the perfect introduction.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Everyone knows that Kanye can make some of the best beats around but nobody expected him to rap this well. West is in control as he guides the listener through his amazing personal odyseey. The new workout plan was hard to listen to and breathe in breathe wasn't consistent with the rest of the album. All of you hip hop heads who think this album is just pop are wrong. Kanye may not be as good as kweli but he's pretty close. Good luck on your next album Kanye!
B000000W5L|5.0|What I like most about this cd, is that it has combined the original double lp's into one cd.  I believe back in the 70's when I first bought this lp, the cost was a little higher because of the fact it had two records in it.  But now the cd cost the same (in average) as the other single Stones cd's. And the songs are just as great as the others.  Tumblin' Dice is one of my favorite Stones song. It's a great cd and a great deal.  You can hear more of the Stones for less.
0790729628|5.0|The unicorn scene is VERY important for the Director's Cut. The big argument in BR is whether or not Deckard is a Replicant, which also gets into, \\"what does it mean to be human?\\", the central question. The original version answers the question one way, Director's Cut seems to answer it the other way. I won't completely spoil it...the last scene explains the Unicorn scene.  By the way, if you read \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\", you'll get some interesting insites on BR. Like understanding the point of the \\"Do you like our owl?\\" narrative in the V-K scene.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie was amazing. I don't usually enjoy PG movies. Infact, I usually hate them. This movie surprised me, totally surpassed my expectations. Jon Heder was hillarious. It was one of those movies that left my brother and I rolling on the floor in laughter, and my parents scratching their heads asking us what the plot was. I can see how this movie would appeal to some and leave others in a state of disgust. To me and my friends, there are many quotes to be remembered. A movie to watch again and again, I reccomend you give it a try. Best movie of '04, and probably best DVD of '04-'05. If you have an odd taste in humor, I highly reccomend stopping by Blockbuster and renting it.
0316776963|3.0|The parts about his troubles growing up with imperfect speech and other difficulties were touching and illuminating, but, unlike \\"Holidays of Ice\\" and readings I'd heard on \\"The Late Show with David Letterman,\\" the only times I really laughed while reading this book were during the anecdotes about his sister Amy.  So I read \\"Wigfield\\" next.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Yes, it takes place in space, but it's not really sci-fi as I usually think about it. It's not about space or even really \\"the future\\" but just a well written, interesting story, about 8 people who are in the same ship for different reasons. It has humor, it has action and it has drama - what else do you want? <br /> <br />The extras are good, and not excessive.   <br /> <br />I have lent the set out to several people who had not watched the show when it aired, and they have enjoyed it.  <br />
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Let's be real...I won't even pretend that this is a great (heck, or even good) movie.  It's not.  What \\"Red Sonja\\" is, is wonderfully bad...and I love it.  \\"Red Sonja\\" will return to the newsstands in 2005, and in the meantime freshen up with all that is Red Sonja.
B000003TA4|1.0|This is without question the most overatted rock album of alltime. Incoherent aswell as annoying. Don't waste your money!!!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was very much positivly surprised. It is a fantastic and very funny coupling of 9 storys. <br />Hugh Grant made an excellent job as PM. In his older films I did not like him that much, but this time he completly convinced me (and that \\"relationship\\" with the American President was droll - nobody can ignore, that there`s a little bit of thruth in the real relationship between the actual PM and the actual President...) <br /> <br />Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson (and his boy) did a great job as usually. The story of Colin Firth (a good actor too!) was as delighting as all the other small plots. The \\"star\\" Billy Mack is the ultimate comedian touch in the movie - very much better than Rowan Atkinson! <br /> <br />And last but not least Keira Knightley: she is so wonderful and beautiful in that movie (She was gorgeous in POTC, but in LA she`s even better). And I liked her storyline very much with this \\"triangular relationship\\". <br /> <br />And for some maybe angry Americans: The USA weren`t dissed that much. It was only a small joke that Billy Bob Thornton-thing (but only a guy like him, who does not like George W., could have played THIS president). The USA still are a great country - this movie didn`t change this and the country`s credit...And do not forget: For other nations it is quite normal to be the \\"bad guys\\" in lots of movies: the arabians, the germans, the japanese...
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Many fans, like myself, have been waiting for MacGyver to be released on DVD for years.  Most of the shows on during the same time (mid 1980s) have already been released (Knight Rider, Magnum PI, etc). For those who don't know, MacGyver (played by Richard Dean Anderson) is a rugged government agent who works by improvising special trinkets and gadgets to get out of sticky situations (instead of using, say, guns). Part private-eye, part environmentalist, think of MacGyver as an \\"overgrown Boy Scout\\" and you have a pretty good idea of the character.  <br /> <br />The First Season was on TV in 1985 and although it had a slow start, the ratings soon took off.  In the first season, MacGyver travels all over the world and gets himself out of more than his fair share of trouble.  This show is a classic of the 1980s science/action genre (Knight Rider is another good example), and should be enjoyable to those who remember the series. Unfortunately, the special effects, music, and dialogue (not to mention Richard Dean Anderson's hair styles) may seem a bit campy and dated by today's standards. The computer-effects and digital camerawork that are commonplace in action-packed television shows today were not used in the mid 1980s. Still, the show was good fun and it's great it's finally on DVD!
0395925037|5.0|You may hate Hitler, but you can't ignore that he has played an important role in Western experience.  You cannot talk about the 20th century without talking about Hitler.  You can hate him, but you cannot ignore him.  Hitler redefined military history, literary discourse, philosophy, academic discussions, and even theology.  You may not want to give him credit because you may hate what he tried to do, but he is probably the greatest mover in history.  Hitler gave Germans a sense of pride.  Most Germans did not care about killing Jews -- it was in fact a side effect that many Germans tried to ignore or pretend did not really exist.  Often, Hitler is only seen vis-a-vis the Jews and that detracts from correctly understanding Hitler and his role in German society.  Reading the original document by Hitler is a step in the right direction to truly understand the mind of the evil genius.  It is important to go to the primary source in every case and develop your own opinions, rather than take others' words for truth.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I really did look forward to \\"Troy\\", Wolfgang Peterson's epic version of the Iliad.  Alas, there is some good, and some bad in the monumental production ($200 million) of the Greek vs. Trojan saga. Overall I was disappointed.<br /><br />Did I mention that it is huge?  There are vast numbers of computer generated soldiers, 1000 Greek warships, and gigantic fortifications of Troy, the city under siege.  Somehow I just don't think this is what Homer had in mind when he wrote the epic poem more than 3,000 years ago.  It all looks pretty, but the film has no soul.<br /><br />A buffed-out Brad Pitt plays the legendary Greek warrior Achilles, but somehow the ancient Rambo just doesn't fit his style.  He seems like a pufferfish trying to fill the big shoes of this historic giant.  Pitt is a superb actor, but I agree with the critics who've stated that he is miscast in the role.  The one fellow who does very well in this film is Eric Bana, who gives his portrayal of the Trojan hero Hector a real conscience.  Hector sees what is coming, but his stature among the Trojan nobility means duty comes first-whatever the cost.  The other characters such as Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) are again physically attractive and uninteresting at the same time.  Peter O'Toole's King Priam says 'It is the will of the Gods' an awful lot.<br /><br />The story is by now well known to just about anyone who can read.  Let's just say that the interaction between mortal and gods in the book are dispensed with in favor of man vs. man conflict.  The romance between Paris and Helen, which is what is supposed to have started the war in the first place, is largely shunted aside in favor of the huge battle scenes-there is virtually no chemistry between Bloom and Kruger.<br /><br />The battle scenes are well done, but after awhile one begins to wonder if that is all there is to this film (my wife did).  I expected great things from \\"Troy\\", but got a lot of swords, spears, shields and arrows.  Did I say this movie is huge?  2 stars.d arrows.  Did I say this movie is huge?   2 stars.
0316096199|4.0|Lucky by Alice Sebold is a very good and emotional book. It is about a girl (Alice) who was an 18 when year old college freshman, attending Syracuse University to study poetry. After a party Alice was walking back to her dorm when she was forced off a park path, pulled into a tunnel and then brutally raped. The rape not only changed Alices life, but the rest of her families life and the people she knew as well. After the rape Alice went to the hospital to get checked out and get evidence if she chose to go to trial. It turned out that Alice had been beat up pretty bad and because of that she decided to go to trial and prove that her rapist, Madison, guilty. Going to trial was not only to make Alice feel safer, but to keep Madison from doing it again. After going through two pre-trials Alice finally got to go to the real trial that would determine if Madison was guilty or not. The trial lasted a few days, and on the last day Alice was asked to testify. She was asked many hard and grousome questions about the rape that she did not want to answer. After the long excruciating pain of the trial Madison was found guilty and was sent to prison. <br /> <br />A few months after the trial Alice began to get her life back on track, but then another devistating event happened in her life. Alices best friend, Lila, was raped. After Lilas rape Alice went into a total meltdown mode and was not able to recover from it for many years. <br /> <br />Lucky is an excellent book. The way Alice Sebold wrote about her rape made you feel like you knew exactly what she was feeling. It is a very grousome book and will make you think about what is going on until the late hours of the night. Lucky is a book that really keeps you interested and wanting to read more. I recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense, and doesn't mind a very detailed, grousome book. It is a must read book!
B0000039LE|5.0|\\"Halloween\\", created by John Carpenter, is the earlier of the three transformed horror series (Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are the other two).  It features Donald Pleasance, a British actor who did quite a bit of stage work, and even spent a year in a German prison camp when he was in the Royal Air Corps during WW2.  He plays the mad doctor/hero, Sam Loomis, who dedicates 15 years to try to get inside the head of a child who brutally murdered his sister when he was six.  His shocking quotes were, \\"I met this 6-year old boy with the blackest eyes...the devil's eyes.\\" and, \\"I spend 8 years trying to reach him and another 7 trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply...evil.\\"<br /><br />Also featured is Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, Michael's (the killer's) sister, who is stalked by Michael himself.  But Loomis is hot on the trail, and tracks down Michael, only to see his unmasked face with Laurie.  He shoots Michael six times, once in the heart, and then the most climactic horror events ever begin.<br /><br />So see this movie if you are interested in a more realistic, classic series and you like the idea of a Halloween killer.  It's just great!
0316926345|5.0|On August 17, 1939, Waugh wrote in his diary, \\"I don't want to influence opinions, events, or expose humbug or anything of that kind. I don't want to be of service to anyone or anything. I simply want to do my work as an artist.\\" <br />Certainly nothing useful can be added to the abundant praise of Waugh's wonderful artistry in creating \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", nor  in Lindsey-Hogg's skill in bringing the novel faithfully to life on the screen.  But we may wonder if Waugh lived up to the intent stated in his diary because \\"Brideshead Revisited\\"  seems at first acquaintance to be an unabashed effort to present religious faith in a serious positive light without the skepticism so often found in modern fiction.  Waugh strives to reach his goal through the delineation of his characters of whom Charles Ryder is masterfully portrayed by Jeremy Irons. We find Charles a rather cold, diffident, unsympathetically remote agnostic, and largely a foil for bringing the other characters to life in illustration of Waugh's chief agendas. <br />Waugh's biographer, Christopher Sykes who knew Waugh personally, characterized him as something of a snob from middle class origins who looked up to the aristocracy, and looking down on the lower classes did not hesitate to make people feel ill at ease with regard to their origins through a clever form of bullying.  We see this depicted by Waugh's reveling in the social gaffes on the voyage, and in the hair-cutting incident with Hooper and Charles contemptuous treatment of  him, but curiously in the end Hooper appears to rise cheerfully above such harassments.  Does Waugh see Hooper as too stupid and insensitive to know that he has been insulted, or of such inner strength that he makes his assailants look shabby by comparison?  Waugh is said to have despised the man he modeled Rex Mottram on, characterizing Mottram as a fraud marrying Julia for advantage. But Mottram also is revealed as a pragmatic success in a society bound by the questionableprohibitions of Catholic doctrine regarding marriage and divorce.     <br />Biographer Sykes, a Roman Catholic himself, wrote that Brideshead Revisited. \\"is solely addressed to believing Catholics and admirers of the Catholic Church.  The general reader is rather left in the cold.\\"  This is certainly evident in the story's climax at Marchmain's deathbed scene where Charles first argues vehemently against a priest administering the last rites but suddenly undergoes a totally surprising conversion at the dying man's sign of acceptance. Whether Waugh brings this off successfully or not will depend of what the viewer/reader brings to the scene.  Certainly what Waugh has shown us to this point is what misery the strictures of organized religion can impose on the lives of its subjects through guilt and conditioning.  Sebastian drowning his remorse for his homosexuality in alcohol; Marchmain's alienation from his wife's obsessive conformity driving him to Paris and a loveless relationship with a mistress; Brideshead's mindless obedience condemning him to collecting matchboxes and a ridiculous marriage;  Julia's lapses from doctrine leaving her with a life of endless tormenting guilt summed up in her final remark to Charles as she sacrifices her final chance at happiness, \\"I am not quite bad enough to set up a rival good to God's\\".  All this and more leaves us with many questions as to what Waugh's intentions actually were as revealed in this masterpiece that is reality rather than fiction.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is definitely one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen.  Just a few corrections about what other people have said, the girl's name is Deb, not Mel.  She was also in Corrina Corrina and Andre, the one with the seal.  It is a good family movie because there is not swearing in it and it is just one of those movies where it is so wierd and stupid that you can't help but laugh.  Definitely a good movie to watch if you are feeling a little down in the dumps.
0784010501|5.0|At a time where Madonna was at the top, I thought it was very courageous of her to let you into her personal life even if it was such a \\"high life\\" a lot of us cannot understand what that must feel like but after seeing this my whole attidude towards the lady changed! It show's how a female star at the age of 32 has TOTAL control of her life not to mention a talent that far exceeds anything i've ever heard or seen! I have seen the entire concert and was left breathless at the end of it! Her opening rendition of \\"Express Yourself\\" is the best live performance I have ever seen and the song wasn't even one of my favorites! the costumes and the coriography is amazing (for its time) <br />The only thing I didn't get was what she was doing with Warren Beatty? Glad she got over that one quickly! <br />Highly recommend this. <br />What other artist do you know that has had the courage to do a similar thing?
B00000K3CR|5.0|Our only tiny complaint is no extras BUT other then that this is one of Tom Hanks great movies in his early years! Heart warming and  a must see. Penny Marshall gets our 2 thumbs up. Great stoyline nd just good feelings all around. Tender light adult themed moments with humor. Buy it new or used. Worth every penny. We've watched it about 8 times already especially with what's happening around the world :-( Enjoy.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The people who think this film sucks or are bored by it simply cannot recognize art. They should go rent XXX or Troy or maybe Bridget Jones or The Terminal.<br /><br />Lost in Translation is an excellent film that is beautiful, haunting, extremely well made, with excellent performances. If you don't like it - fine. If you think it's a bad movie, you probably just don't get it.
B00003CX9E|5.0|2 thumbs up! A+! BRAVO! Super duper uber great! We've been jonesing to watch this film for a very long time. WOW! It's the type of movie that makes you use your mind for once plus entertains to the Nth degree. This is true Americana Cinema at it's best. IMHO I would say the Greatest Film ever! There are enough no brainier movies out there to warrant a brain massage one in a while :-) Now we want one of those original 1 sheet posters! 1 sold on eBay recently for about $7,000 to $8,000!! Now back to the movie. Beautiful transfer and extras! We watched everything the same day. We're planning to watch this again once our Home Theater is finished! Do yourself a favor and get the movie now!! Good day.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As much as I wanted to love this movie, I couldn't. I was bored to death. Bob Harris(Bill Murray) and Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson) are two Americans in Tokyo. Bob is a movie star in town to shoot a whiskey commercial, while Charlotte is a young woman tagging along with her workaholic photographer husband(Giovanni Ribisi). They meet in the hotel bar and soon develop a surprising friendship. I must admit that the scenery in this movie is breathtaking. I waited and waited for this movie to pick up the pace and it never did. The soundtrack is so depressing. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson seem like they've both been drugged and forced to do this movie. The only time they come to life is when Bill Murray cheats on his wife and Scarlett comes to his room to ask him out to lunch while the other woman is still there. The following lunch is full of tension and quiet anger. The scenes where Murray is filming the whiskey commercials are also amusing. Overall this movie is just not that entertaining. I wish I had rented it before I bought it. I hope this review has been helpful to you.
B000005RT8|5.0|Now if you ask me, and a lot of folks interested in sequel and prequels do now and again, this here 1980 release called McCartney II ain't really a sequel to the 1970 release called McCartney. In fact, I would go ahead on and concede that it was a sequel if Sir Paul had, in 1990, released a disc called McCartney III and then in 2000 a disc called McCartney IV. Then I pretty much would have had to concede in the face of staggering evidence to the contrary, but as an ornery contrition myself, and not one to shrink from the illogical pestering of the folks who can't count in sequence... then I will stand firm on my argument that this here disc, despite the name, is a stand-alone record from 1980 that needs to be judged as it is... not as an appendage to that record what came out a decade prior. <br /> <br />The most memorable single from this album is \\"Coming Up\\" and I guess that it strikes me as memorable because Paul (and Linda) did a pretty interesting video back then to accompany the music. Paul pretty much acted every part and then they spliced all the parts together to create the illusion that Paul was a whole bunch of different people on stage together at the same time playing all the different musical parts and such... interesting. <br /> <br />However, this CD ain't a video.... It's an audio.... So the video they done made is neither here nor there. The audio is good and represents Paul's continuing steps away from his past and towards his inexplicable and unavoidable future. What with jail time in Japan for marijuana possession (what kind of dolt would attempt to get through Narita with drugs in their possession?) and the demise of his second group, McCartney was not quite ready to start experimenting with Michael, but was quite finished with Denny. This was, as it were, a transition type period for McCartney and we got to see what he was transitioning from and to. <br /> <br />What he done give us is an album that is not his best, but is fairly good if you ask me. It also pretty well captures the feel of the 1980 Pop Music world with flowery tunes for suburban Caucasians. I like it even though I ain't never been no suburban Caucasian and don't typically go in for \\"flowery\\"
B0000541AM|4.0|An incredibly dated, but compelling, stylish, and well done drama that has become a huge \\"cult flick\\" - whatever that means.  I prefer to call it a \\"classic,\\" and trust me, the sound bites from this thing - (\\"Can you dig it?!?\\" \\"Hey Warriors - come out and PLAY-AY!\\" etc...) are CLASSIC.  In all fairness, the acting, dialogue, and drama in the movie are pretty good and there are some great, coreographed fight scenes that are among the best I've ever seen. The plot moves along at a fast pace and some good suspense is developed.  <br /> <br />\\"The Warriors\\" certainly looks a little dated now, and the costumes and themes of the gangs stretch credibility (I mean, a gang that rides roller skates? A gang of bad-a$$ mimes?  What's up with that?!?).  However, \\"The Warriors\\" probably wasn't near as out of touch with the times in which it was released (1979), than people think today.  It certainly hearkens back to a kinder, gentler age(?) when NYC street gangs like the Savage Nomads, Jolly Stompers, and Black Spades actually squared off toe to toe and FOUGHT eachother like MEN, with bats, knives, chains, and anything else they could get their hands on - instead of shooting into a crowd in the dark from 40 yards before turning tail and running away... <br /> <br />Based on the Sol Yurick book of the same name, itself, loosely based on the Classic, Xenophon's Anabasis.  Fans of the movie would be very interested in checking out the incredibly-hard-to-find, infamous documentary, \\"80 Blocks from Tiffany's;\\" a gritty chroncile of NYC gangs and street life released the same year.
B0006399FS|5.0|despite the fact that the most transcendental song on the new U2--that would be \\"miracle drug\\"--uses (to a T) the same chord progression as \\"with or without you\\", this is a very very solid effort by a magical band.  you have to listen to \\"how to\\" a mess of times before you get it--but that's the sitch with the most lasting, as it were, albums.  how dare the nitpickers (like this unmitigated oaf right after me!) nitpick. so so so many other bands, songs, records sound \\"small\\" after you audition this disc:  U2 aim high, dare things (and sentiments) others would never, and write and perform great art about the human condition.  \\"vertigo\\" is not even close to being the best track here.  this record is anthemic in a NOT instantly accessible way.  ok: now for something more important:  people with good taste need to support indie bands like these--ok?:  Sun Kil Moon, The Black Watch, The Caseworker, The Sugarplastic.  Bobalooey is over and out!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I don't know why Dreamworks even bother to release this DVD. They have no experience with foreign anime DVD releases and no idea about the anime fans' expectation. It almost seems like they trashed this major anime release on purpose to downplay it's glory, considering GITS is one of the most successful anime franchise in the states. Just the horrible cover design makes the purchase a hard decision. To make it worse, the sub is worse than the the fan sub I've seen, and there is no english dub. It should've done by other major anime DVD publishing studios like Geneon with their standard features - 2 sub tracks and Jap/Eng 5.1 Dolby/DTS audio.    Seriously, I rather buy a pirated copy from ebay which is more likely to be better subbed and with better cover art at a lower price and it's region free.    Dreamworks, I hate you. You've committed a crime, and it's unforgiveable...
0385510438|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  I get bogged down in the legal details of many of Grisham's books; this one got rid of all of that and just focused on the characters.  It was a nailbiter without being too scary, and it kept me up late reading it.  I recommend it.
B000002J09|5.0|All I can say is buy this album now, I have never heard anything like it. PURE GENIUS!!!
B0001XAPX8|5.0|Based on the novel by Phillip Roth, this is a special film, exploring issues of race, hypocrisy, relationships and the tragedy of the human condition.<br /><br />Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a classics professor at an eastern Ivy League college. During his tenure as Dean of the school, he brought the college from a mediocre one to one of excellence. In the politics of academia, where bureaucracy can be so entrenched, change is the enemy, thus Coleman Silk's efforts towards excellence, inevitably makes a few enemies.<br /><br />In the late nineties, during the Clinton administration, the atmosphere of so-called political correctness hovered like a spectre, censorship reigned supreme, and as one of the characters at the end of the film states, \\"People have become so dumb, but they all have an opinion.\\" Professor Silk makes the mistake of calling two conspicuously absent students \\"spooks\\", in the definitive context of absence or invisibility, not in the 50's slang for black American. In fact, he never met these students, but his words are taken as racial slurs because the students are black Americans. (This proves to be a great irony as the film progresses) This is an interesting example of censorship at the time, as in so many cases, the person or people crying racism or explicit sex or whatever the issue, more often than not, is taken out of context, turning it into something other than what it actually means. Out of principle, and because, out of fear, no one supports him, he is forced to resign just before his retirement. To add insult to injury, Silk's wife dies in his arms from a heart attack on that very day.<br /><br />Enter Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Siniese) the \\"writer in hiding\\" and narrator of the tale. The two men forge a bond that is both interesting and touching. The scene where they dance `cheek to cheek' on the porch over a sentimental song was a work of pure theatrical genius. There is no question that both these fine actors are at the top of their art form. It is here that Silk confesses that he is involved with a thirty-four year old woman. Enter Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful working class girl with a legion of personal issues: sexually abused as a child; a battered wife from a psychotic husband, (Ed Harris) and two dead children due to an accident that is explained in the film but remains vague. The relationship between Silk and Farley is an unusual one as there is a vast age difference and both are so different socially and otherwise. But they connect and have an obvious need for one another, which causes the people around them to gossip, threat and make efforts to destroy them. Coleman Silk has one of the better lines in the film, in order to justify this relationship:<br /><br />\\"She's not my first love, nor my greatest love, but she's my last love.\\"<br /><br />This film is about many things: the evil of prejudice and racism; the ignorance, hypocrisy and oppression of censorship; the mysteries of attraction and love between people; it is about fear and our need for revenge; it is about making choices and having to live with those choices.<br /><br />This is a special film and a wonderful story, intriguing and confronting but ultimately a tragedy in every sense.f their art form. It is here that Silk confesses that he is involved with a thirty-four year old woman. Enter Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful working class girl with a legion of personal issues: sexually abused as a child; a battered wife from a psychotic husband, (Ed Harris) and two dead children due to an accident that is explained in the film but remains vague. The relationship between Silk and Farley is an unusual one as there is a vast age difference and both are so different socially and otherwise. But they connect and have an obvious need for one another, which causes the people around them to gossip, threat and make efforts to destroy them. Coleman Silk has one of the better lines in the film, in order to justify this relationship:  <br /> <br />\\"She's not my first love, nor my greatest love, but she's my last love.\\"  <br /> <br />This film is about many things: the evil of prejudice and racism; the ignorance, hypocrisy and oppression of censorship; the mysteries of attraction and love between people; it is about fear and our need for revenge; it is about making choices and having to live with those choices.  <br /> <br />This is a special film and a wonderful story, intriguing and confronting but ultimately a tragedy in every sense.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|3.0|When I was young and full of angst this album meant something, not anymore.
B00000IP2L|3.0|There's no denying that Zakk Wylde is one hell of a guitarist, and I've loved other BLS albums, such as The Blessed Hellride and Hangover Music, Vol. VI, but this one just left me unsatisfied. The guitar is great, no doubt, but the songs just don't stick with me. The sound is not great on some tracks, and sometimes Wylde's voice is drowned out by the music. With the exception of Bored To Tears and T.A.Z., none of the songs really stick with me after I listen to the album. No doubt that it's a good album, but just not up to par for BLS.
B0002Y4T92|3.0|High Points: <br />\\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" with Buddy Guy (!),  <br />\\"Constant Sorrow\\" with Tyminski and R. Block,   <br />\\"Oklahoma Borderline\\" with V. Gill,  <br />\\"Copperline\\" and \\"Steamroller\\" with J. Taylor,  <br />\\"Jingo\\" Carlos Santana,  <br />All of JJ Johnson's drumming with Doyle Bramhall.  <br />JJ Cale cuing a Clapton solo by calling \\"Hey Clapton.\\"- So irreverent! I love it! <br />John Mayer <br /> <br />Drawbacks:  <br />Joe Walsh - sloppy drunk and `shTupid!\\" <br />John Mayer - yes. <br />And ...Clapton. <br /> <br />Short and sweet synopsis: <br />Eric Clapton appears in almost every set - \\"Clapti\\"fying otherwise fresh and dynamic performances. A more effective format would have been to have a short Derek and the Dominoes reunion show and then have old `slohand' sit back with a margarita and enjoy the other bands without crashing their sets. <br /> <br />Long, Drawn-out, opinionated review: <br />After my own personal 30 year love affair with Rock and Blues guitar, my amazement with Clapton's fame and recognition only grows. Only in America can a fluffy Brit-Blues-wannabe so blatantly plagiarize the primal genius born exclusively of a tradition of hardship and 3rd class citizenry. How Clapton gets BB,  Buddy, and the constant host of remaining originals to keep coming back to lend their hard-won credibility to his preppie whitebread bullsh*t plastic cutout version of their magic that elevators everywhere have piped indelibly into ears too stupid and tasteless to know better - I will never know. <br />Let's face it... some of these guys are getting old. Perhaps they simply need the money. It's kind of sad.  <br /> <br />The show begins with Clapton rocking powerfully with classic \\"Cocaine\\" - complete with a gaggle of tasty chocolate backup beauties. The audience is enamored. Follow-up numbers bring out the likes of Jimmy Vaughn. Clapton remains to host. <br /> <br />Hubert Sumlin - clearly playing a loner axe - appears on stage cold and dusty, but instead of laying back and letting the master heat up and kick it, Clapton (still there) simply cannot restrain himself from coming to the heroic guitar rescue and almost completely washes Sumlin off the stage.  <br /> <br />Don't worry, it picks up... Putting Clapton in his place solidly, Buddy Guy masterfully played the audience and rose above as a clear and soaring talent. Cutting perfectly into a rapid-fire lick trade with Clapton which left the Englishman blushing and seeking the coda, Guy reminds everyone where the Blues came from. <br /> <br />Also holding the mojo just inches out of Clapton's shaky reach was Santana. Like a first year Spanish student accepting English directions to the bathroom in a Barcelona soccer stadium, Clapton vanely \\"Sals\\"ified his canned, ripped-off style into Santana's churning rumba space rock. Patiently - yet at his whim, Carlos steps in and squashes Clapton's wimpy squawk with singing PRS tone. His delivery is deft and classic rock star cool. <br /> <br />College jock on a good acid trip? - I never realized what a great sound John Mayer has! No doubt that this guy has an awesome Hendrix vibe! I also never realized what a retard he looks like when he plays, though! Alright, I'll admit it... he's a better player than I is, but I'll make a bet with you... If you can watch this without thinking about what kind of bus this kid rode to school, you are probably not paying attention anyway. Personally, I found his presentation too cocky, overly emotive and distracting to enjoy with so many other great young players on the bill(ie Doyle Bramhall and Johnny Lang). I have to end by saying that Mayer is a Damn good player though and this DVD does a great job of showcasing his undeniable talent (don't watch though, just listen). <br /> <br />In a brief yet prominently staged interview sequence, Clapton states \\"Nothing beats sitting around on an equal footing with 3 or 4 other musicians, and not have anyone be the boss.\\" - at his own show where he is walking onto everyone's stage to be the guest of honor. A bit contrived, I feel. <br /> <br />Disc 1 is certainly very entertaining. And as much of lout as he is, Clapton is at least decent enough to have arranged the event and not completely sack everyone's performance. I just can't get past the narcissism though. Why can he not just sit there in a box seat like the royalty that he really thinks he is and just allow the talent to perform their sets unencumbered? No... he absolutely has to play! -As if he started the underground railroad by himself. Doesn't he ever get tired of hearing himself play? I guess that I do. <br /> <br />It's a 2 DVD set. I will add comments for Disc 2 later. <br />Hope that BB didn't scratch Clapton's Rover on the way to the car wash.  <br />
B0002EXH40|1.0|I love this album. My original copy of Youthanasia got scratched, so I bought this remixed and remastered version. I'm very dissapointed.  <br />Yes, the songs are on this, but they don't sound as raw as the original. Vocals are hollow, and the snare drum sounds as a cheap sample. The mix is very muddy in the lows.  <br /> <br />And because I'm so used to the original this sounds soooo wrong. It makes me hate the songs. No, I will never listen to this again. <br /> <br />I'd buy the original. <br /> <br />- Haico
B00023B1LC|4.0|Matt Damon stars as a specially designed $30 government agent whose purpose is secret and must go and eliminate targets.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity is a really cool movie because it's based on a tense and action-packed storyline. It's not like other movies with a plethora of action that looks phony and obviously made up. This movie is really interesting to watch because it starts out by grabbing your attention and then your attention is grabbed for the rest of the movie. The characters in this movie all do a great job of acting. Madd Damon is realistic and so is Chris Cooper, who acts as the aggravated CIA chief who wants to hunt down Bourne. This movie has a lot of action and spying in it, and you should watch it if you haven't.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I was totally let down by this movie, the previews show the funniest parts of the movie, the only funny parts! <br />It had it's moments but they were short lived. <br />A HUGE disappointment over all, I'm glad I bought it on sale..
B0001AP12G|5.0|as far as beats and rap goes. his production skills are unparrallel and he is one of the best fresh artists in a long time. i cannot wait for his next album. this worth the $1.04 i paid at allofmp3
B00005JNBQ|4.0|What can I say? Reviewers who say this movie has no plot are right. This movie lives or dies depending upon whether or not you like the characters. What you see is what you get. If you think Napoleon is funny, then you'll like this movie. If you like dry, subtle comedy based on the actions and mannerisms of the key characters rather than some contrived situations they find themselves in, then you'll like this movie.<br /><br />And it takes a few minutes to get into the groove. But once you get it (if you do) then you're hooked.<br /><br />So if you need to be force-fed comedy (like TV sit coms) then you probably won't like this movie.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Ok, this was a big Hollywood epic that had over the top acting, over the top action, and lots of tanned A-list actors. I loved every minute (and there are quite a few minutes) of it. It isn't the best telling of the story of Troy, but it is worth watching. Pitt, Bana and Bloom all walk around with their bare chests tanned, waxed, and buffed but they reminded me of all the old Charlton Heston epics such as Ben Hur and El Cid. I enjoyed the movie and thought it did as good a job with the story as the recent Helen of Troy mini-series that ran on TV. You can not get a better villain than Brian Cox (who has carved a nice villain spot in movies such as X2 and the Bourne Supremacy and who gave audiences their first taste of Hannibal Lector in Manhunter). He does a great job at being just nasty. Peter O'Toole (who looked extremely old in this movie and who has said he hated it) is always great to watch on the screen and I wish they would have done more with his character. The movie has holes in it and they take liberties with the story, namely with Pitt's Achilles character, but it is nothing that took away from the overall movie. The movie starts with war and it ends with war. The DVD is also loaded to the max with special features that make up for any part of the movie that might let you down. Pitt gets annoying at times, but Bana does a great job at playing his counter part Prince Hector. If they missed cast anyone, it would be Bloom. He comes off too weak for the role of Paris and you really got to wonder why they just didn't throw him off the wall when the Greek army first showed up. You also have to wonder why they cast Bloom knowing that he would be using a bow and everyone would compare it to Lord of the Rings. Diane Kruger is good as Helen but she really is just a trophy in the movie and they never take the time to explain her character (like the mini series did). Overall, I would say that Troy stands up to other epics such as Gladiator and Braveheart and blows other recent retellings of classics, such as the horrible King Arthur adaptation, out of the water. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a big epic story with huge stars in the tradition of classic Hollywood.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Well, it's not your typical movie, and not your typical comedy to boot.  I don't think I've seen a PG film in quite some time.  Nothing in this movie is serious, and the characters don't really evoke much emotion.   <br /> <br />But it's somewhat quirky and there are some funny moments.   <br /> <br />I will say the dance for Pedro is classic and I was surprised the director let the character \\"come out of his shell\\" so to speak. <br /> <br />Rent it to see if it's your type of movie.   ome will join the cult, others will spit on it, but it is what it is.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Ok, I LOVE Star Wars. I'm a huge fan. I even like the new films, despite Jar Jar not dying yet.     Remember the \\"yub yub\\" song at the end of ROTJ? I used to jump up and down and sing with the Ewoks when I was a kid. GONE! I put that DVD in first, and though GREATLY surprised, I could deal with most of the changes. But when I got to that ending, I was like, \\"What the...?!?\\" Now the song is cut out, so my nostalgic childhood memory of it is all I have.    And I know, nobody told me to buy the new DVD set, nobody put a gun to my head and said \\"buy it!\\"    But the commercials lie! They say own the original! That's what I actually thought I was buying. I put my order in advance on Amazon when I saw the commercial. Maybe the die-hard fans who searched online news sites or whatever knew it was the edited version, but I just went by the commercial, which said, \\"Finally own the original.\\"     Now as a reasonable person, if the commercials had stated, \\"Own the new-and-improved digitized version,\\" I could not complain about this DVD at all, because it is pretty good. But the commercials said \\"original.\\" That is misleading. Can anyone just admit that plain fact that the commercials were intentionally misleading? I would have returned it but Amazon was gonna charge me shipping!    My feeling is, isn't there enough storage space on a DVD to include the special edition AND the original, untouched version? How many movies are out there where you have the option to watch the original theatrical release or the director's cut on the same disc? For the price, it's really inexcuseable that it's not included.    Lucas, please just add a \\"Original Theatrical Release\\" track like a normal person, I don't care if it's digitally remastered or not.
B00025ETIW|4.0|this is the best sounding raw punk rock/emo music ive heard... it is so raw it almost seems like this is a live album.  <br /> <br />The energy the boys have is tremendous and knows no boundaries. Catchy tunes and dark yet hilarious lyrics. They are so creative too. They actually managed to give every song a unique character, like different scenes and short movies in the album.  <br /> <br />The guitars are powerfully energetic and so raw sounding its like you have them in your living room when u turn them on. The vocalist just blows you away with an attitude that is undeniable, undying, unstoppable and right in your face. <br /> <br />Flaws? There isnt such a thing to these boys. The little mistakes in their solos and riffs portray an attitude, an 'i dont care' attitude. This album is a must get for any punk rock lover and music enthusiast. Simply artistic. 4 stars for talent over effort. Their journey probably has just begun.
0385504209|5.0|This is Dan Brown's best book and the first that deviates from the formula used in his first three books.  Mr. Brown's writing style has also hit its stride as he has reinvented the pulp.<br /><br />Robert Langdon is back (see Angels & Demons).  But this time he is not hired to solve anything.  But he is asked to look at a crime scene in the hopes that he will incriminate himself.  From that point he is a fugitive for most of the book, thus adding the sense of urgency usually present in Dan Brown's books.<br /><br />The main story concerns a secret society known as the Priory of Scion which is rumored to have a collection of evidence that proves the Roman Catholic Church has been lying since the beginning.  Langdon manages to escape at the beginning with the help of a cryptographer who happens to be related to the murder victim.<br /><br />The rest of the book moves at a furious pace using classic pulp techniques of cliff hangers and withholding revelations to the reader.  The questions are not all answered until literally the final page (although you may guess many of them).<br /><br />Readers need to remember that this is a work of fiction and that many of the \\"facts\\" are untrue.  Some are but there is much that is not.  Many books have since been published that point these out in detail.  Two examples I will cite, Langdon claims the Church has wiped out all references linking the goddess Venus with physical love, a lone exception being the term venereal disease.  What about that anatomy every junior high student learns about called the venus mons or mound of venus?  At another point Langdon talks about how there is so much rumor about the Knights Templar that finding the truth is impossible.  In the same breath he gives a very detailed history of their formation, actions, fall, and escape.<br /><br />Many readers will not care about such details.  Those that do should just remember that this is a work of fiction.  Ultimately both should be able to enjoy this fast-paced adventure.  Truly entertaining.this fast-paced adventure.  Truly entertaining.
B000002UAX|1.0|Why do people fuss over this dated pop group. Michael Jackson's THRILLER blows every Beatles album away as true pop music genius. Only music arty farty music critics continue to ramble on about their music. For the need of something to say.
B000089RVX|4.0|I loved this album. At first I thought all the songs sorta sounded the same but once I listened to it a few times I realized how wrong I was. I mean, the songs go from hard rock to soft ballads and no matter what kind of song it is Evanescence pulls it off. The writing, vocals, and instrumentals are great. My favourite song on the album would have to be \\"My last Breath.\\" The only thing I would change is I would make the album longer. Maybe add like, one more song on it or something. I highly recommend getting this album, you won't be disapointed.

B00005MAM2|4.0|Akira is often lauded as the definitive anime film. It is quite a spectacle to behold, and the movie definitely deserves the hype. <br /> <br />This anime is primarily a cyberpunk morality tale. It is also a brilliant, bleak version of the future that takes viewers on a slick, violent, and mind-bending ride. Akira's philosophical undertones rival those of the Matrix and echo those of 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br /> <br />(Spoilers below) <br /> <br />The story is primarily about a gang of teenager bikers that live in Neo Tokyo, 2019. Akira begins with a brief look into the life of Tetsuo, a 15-year-old underdog who is constantly in need of the help of his friends (the other gang members). His foil is the loud, brash Kaneda, the gang member who drives the now-infamous red motorcycle. Neo Tokyo is in a state of political unrest, and the government is also involved with several experiments that exploit the powers of skilled psychic children. One of these children was Akira, a boy that razed Neo Tokyo over 30 years ago. Tetsuo crashes into one of these psychic children during a motorcycle chase, thus awakening his own latent abilities.  <br /> <br />Tetsuo is temporarily kidnapped by the government where his powers are tested and forced into existence. The movie later insinuates that Tetsuo is entering the next stage of humanity; he is an evolved, powerful telepath. However, the movie also alludes to the fact that the government used various techniques to draw out these powers (from the other children, a strange group of withered telepaths) and then exploited them as weapons. Tetsuo himself is a poor candidate to host such abilities, we soon learn, as he begins to lash out at the world that once forced him to be weak. <br /> <br />Akira is about existence, the abuse of power, and the fallible nature of humanity. These themes are addressed under a veneer of fast, violent action and futuristic battles. Although the manga most likely features better characterzation than themovie, Akira is still a moving, worthwhile film. Tetsuo's descent into madness is reminiscent of Gollum's internal battle with the Ring (as portrayed in Peter Jackson's the Lord of the Rings). To compare the two films would be a stretch, but both feature important lessons about absolute power. <br /> <br />For lovers of anime, Akira is an entertaining, beautifully animated film that is sure to please. For fans of science fiction and philosophical movies, Akira will also be a good choice. <br /> <br />Even so, Akira is not perfect. It is dark, violent, and often disturbing. The confusing plot takes several viewings to comprehend fully.  <br /> <br />Overall, Akira is a finely executed work that deserves its place in the varied timeline of film and anime history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0001CCXY8|1.0|Cannibal Corpse offers nothing for America. A lot of stuff is straight from America, and Cannibal Corpse is the worst music I've ever heard. They look like a bunch of dudes stuck in the 80's.....25 years ago....They Suck. Their drummer can pound out some stuff, but the singer! Give me a break. How can you say he has goood lyrics....there AREN'T ANY LYRICS!!! When I feel like getting down witht he devil, I'll stick to my Slipknot and Fear Factory!  <br /> <br /> <br />Because this band sucks so much...and I saw so many reviews supporting this looser band, it inspired me to write my very first review! Aren't we all happy!
B00006LLNU|5.0|I have to say that first I wasn't very sure if I would like this cd because I read some good and bad reviews for this cd. I will make your decision  easier so you don't have to see a lot of reviews because basically they're all the same. <br /> <br />1) Positive reviews: This are the reviews of people that really apreciate this kind of music (like me) and that consider it beautiful and a way of going to \\"another place\\" and be really in peace.  <br />2) Negative reviews: These are the reviews of people that say that this CD is absolutely boring and that is just some random sounds and a horrible voice and all that stuff.... <br /> <br />Here is the thing, this Cd can be BEAUTIFUL for some people and BORING for other people, I think this is strongly related to the atittude that the listener has for the music. If you are of the people that put this CD on an expects that the songs reach to fabolus climaxes inmediately your wrong, because this kind of music is really slow, mellow, you have to have a possitive atittude while listenting to this and just close your eyes and star really FELLING the music. This is a perfect cd when you are going to sleep and you want to escape from your ordinary life and have a moment of peace, also when you feel confused or alone and you want to hear some good music (the one that really delights your ears) and have a momment of reflexion. <br /> <br />If you are cobard and you don't want to really fell this CD like I did I just can say you that your are getting away of one of the most beatiful things that life offers, the good music.
6304936303|5.0|This film is an action classic.  Willis plays a great character (on par with the main character in Bad Santa, but with a gun and a bit more hung over).  Wayans is at his most enjoyable, and though the plot is simple, it makes for a great action movie.      Willis sells the movie with great one liners, and Scott does nice job filming the action.  I know a black and white detective duo is passe in films, but if you like this genre of film, The Last Boyscout will deliver.  It's well worth the twelve bucks.      Despite the bashing this film takes in Amazon's official review of this film, it is very entertaining.  It is a simple and stupid action flic, yes, but to say it hates women and promotes voilence and profanity in teens is a bit harsh.  I suppose you could argue those things about this film, but then you must denounce the entire genre of action films.  It is no better or worse than any action driven, big budget, Hollywood picture.  That review would hold more water if this was a PG film; if it's rated R, it seems a bit naive to critique its violence.    This is a fun film, worthy of a watch.  I haven't seen this film in years, and I just bought it.  I'm eager for it to arrive in the mail and will surely watch it several times.  It ain't Shakespeare, but if you're a Willis fan and you've missed this one, pick it up.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|So what have we here? Well, as a 5 star selection of Neil Young tracks there's little to fault this album - every one is top notch and together they cover a very fair cross-section of his often complex wanderings between folk, country and hard-rock.    Job well done then? Well not really. First off the selection itself is too limited, with only four tracks covering the last 25 years and with none after 1992. The man's had his ups & downs but his career is much broader than represented here and his post 1977 work includes a much larger number of truly excellent tracks than this compilation, with its heavy weighting to pre-1977, suggests. Odd... not least because, with only a small number of genuine single/album \\"hits\\" to his name, it's not as though there's any particular reason to limit it in this way through a \\"Greatest Hits\\" title.    Secondly, its sequencing, while strictly chronological, is bizarre. Do people who want to be introduced to an artist (as those at who it's directed at will be) really want to start off with \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" - two excellent but distinctly similar and lengthy hard rock work-outs. Sitting here as its first two tracks, they provide a less than helpful 20 minute opening for someone who probably only knows \\"Heart of Gold\\" and maybe a couple of other of Neil Young's more MOR outings.     Finally, 11 of the 16 tracks are already available on the only other sensible retrospective currently available, the excellent two CD \\"Decade\\" from 1977, which provides a much more comprehensive & interesting overview of the first 10 years of his 30 year plus career. Result? If \\"Decade\\" is the only Neil Young album you already own then you're paying a lot for only a few tracks more and if you buy this album first and then buy \\"Decade\\", as new recruits may well do... well, you're starting to understand the problem.     Someone needs to get on top of it because it's increasingly clear that Neil Young, who undoubtedly exerts rigidcontrol over his releases, seems to have \\"missed the point\\" when it comes to overviews of his career. As a previous reviewer said, why didn't he give the whole lot to Rhino and let them get on with producing a more comprehensive and better sequenced effort. A 30 track double CD would have done it, leaving both his fans and his new recruits much, much happier. Brilliant though it is, \\"Greatest Hits\\" makes the chances of this even more remote, which is a great shame because his best work covers much more than what's on offer here and, as such, deserves much better treatment. A case of too little, too late?
0767834739|5.0|This movie should get more credit than it's getting.  I thought it was better than the first in many ways.  It's a solid action flick.  So what if they deviated from the video game a bit.  There were a lot of references for fans to pick up on.  Good entertainment.
0385512104|5.0|Was lent the book by a london friend and read it in one day!  Such a beautiful story (despite the dead dog).  Because it's told in the first person, the reader really gets a sense of how the mind of the narrator works, learns to sympathize with him, and eventually comes to accept his bahavior as quite acceptable given his circumstances.  A great lesson to learn.
B00005QG9J|4.0|ok so i bet your wondering why i gave it 4 stars if this is there worst cd.  its there worst cd if you are comparing it to fungus amongus, but this is not fungus amongus so stop complaining, it is a great effort from a band i started listening to when i was in 7th grade.  and since then they have not disappointed me.  they have lost the nu-metal scene and it can be a good or bad thing.  i like the cover and art work on this cd, it shows that they put alot of time in making this cd.  no i dont think that mtv ruined this band but i do believe mtv made incubus a little softer and more radio-friendly but thats wat mtv does to every band that gets played on that station.  i bought this cd the day it came out and never regretted it so do yourself a favor and buy this cd already, its been almost 4 years what r you waiting for?!
0517147688|5.0|I highly recommend Jane Austen's delightful writing to one and all. Each one of her, unfortunately too few, novels are true classics in every sense of the word. She is witty and very readable. Her novels are deliciously addictive and you will enjoy rereading them over and over.<br /><br />I purchased this edition for my 17 y/o daughter so that I could keep MY own copy of this book available for myself...I am so envious! This is a lovely, expensive-looking book which sells for an amazingly low price. There are cheaper hardback copies but the extra $4.00 for this one is very much worth 3 times that small amount. The leather binding and original artwork make this an excellent bargain.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I really got into Radiohead shortly after buying O.K. Computer and listening to it 10 times a day. I felt I should buy their latest album, just to get me back up to speed and see if they deviated much from the kick-arse music they were so brilliant at creating on O.K.. They haven't, they've only gotten better. As a listener, you shouldn't have to play any specific tracks. This album, like all their others, is meant to be played straight from track 1 to 14, because the lyrics(more like poetry I'd agree)tell one big story, as do the mind-blowing instruments performed by the rest of the band. Radiohead has managed to do what most bands before our time haven't in a long while: remove themselves from a genre and build one of their own. Brilliant stuff. 5 stars.
0156029065|3.0|As a fan of historical fiction I really like the first 25 chapters,  especialy the alternative history of Emperor Ferdericks demise and the sacking of Constantinople. However after Baudolino leaves Armenia and enters the unknown land it turns in a fantasy book ala The Lord of The Rings. In the end the book returns to historical fiction for a great ending. However my struggle to get through the fantasy sections was as hard as Baudolino's search for the Kingdom of Prester John.

1401300901|1.0|I suspected that Cecilia might be the daughter of Bertie Ahern - and when I had finished the book I was almost sure.  I know that at present every attractive young Irish woman seems to have had a novel published, but surely if she was an unknown this badly written, immature rubbish would have been sent back with a 'thanks & don't give up the day job' reject slip?  The subject is a serious one - but I feel this young woman has no idea of the reality of the situation.  The heroine - whose name I've already forgotten is supposedly 30, has been married for 10 years and has just lost her husband after caring for him over a period of sickness.  She comes across more like a twenty year old who's just split up with her boyfriend.  Such a dire event would change a woman forever in ways I don't think the young author can even begin to comprehend, and she would surely feel anger and betrayal as well as straightforward grief.  Certainly it wouldn't be something which could be cured by a few letters from beyond the grave and a spot of karoake!  I kept forgetting that she and her friends were in their late twenties/early thirties - they seemed much more like teenagers. The writing style is also dire and it surprises me that this was ever accepted for publication.  All in all a disgrace that this was published and it is a decidedly sub-standard piece of work and certainly not worth what I paid for it.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Coming on like a cross between Opeth and Dream Theater with a Middle Eastern twist, Orphaned Land's \\"Mabool\\" is brilliant. If you like progressive metal at all, and the (infrequent) death metal vocals won;t scare you away, this is a must-buy.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie moved me on an inner level I hadnt experienced before. I felt my heart sinking in my chest as I watched 4 lives spiral out of control and all the while all you can do is observe and suffer with these poor souls. A lonely widow and her son and her son's girlfriend and his bestfriend are the main characters. All of which have reasonable ambition and go about to achieve these goals they desperately wish to attain and with disasterous results. The movie attacks the nature of addiction head on, not only peering into the lives of junkies but average citizens whom are heavily addicted to casual things such as delicious, fattening food, TV, the American dream, and hope and happiness. At the end of the film I felt very disturbed which only goes to prove how powerful this movie conveys its message. Director Darren Aronofsky's talent is excellent and the film is shot in great, creative ways straying completely away from traditional filming techniques. Aronofsky utilizes split screen, awkward camera angles and gritty tight facial shots to perfection. Ellen Bustyn delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen, watching her character completely fall apart was the most painful to see. She should have won an award for her part, one of the best actresses ever. These two people and their talents are the two most apparent great aspects of the movie and the supporting cast and crew dont stumble on their duties either. The sound is excellent, great use of audio working hand in hand with the visuals to serve up a completely disturbing sensory feast. Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly each turn in some of the best performances I've seen from each of them. Marlon Wayans in particular played his part with excellence, a far cry from the dim witted stoner parts he usually shrugs off on lesser films. This is definitley one of the best anti drug films I've ever seen, the only movie I've seen that is even competitive in the least is Traffic. Anyways, a highly reccomended film and a landmark piece of art.
B000002U82|1.0|A dominant album of sophisticated licks and hooks. But wait? If I remember upon my last intimate hearing it really voracoisly sucked. Why? Yes I'm being overtly critical but the master of psche (syd) is all but gone and his presence is unheard on this album...WHISH YOU WERE HERE...
B00005O5CM|4.0|Watching this film after twelve months of Film Studies AS forced me to take a critical approach to Legally Blonde. All together, the film is pretty damn good, especially if you want to relax and watch a real Girl Power movie!  <br />Reese Witherspoon makes a fantastic Elle Woods. I can't imagine anyone who would play the part better. Personally, I think she is one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood, with her acting range impressive and each character played with prescision and individuality. Just look at her portrayal of Elle Woods, a bubbly homecoming queen, delta nu and Bel Air socialite in comparison to her acting in, say, The Importance of Being Earnest or Cruel Intentions. She is an inspirational actress, and it is not due to her capability that I am not giving this film the full five. <br />Okay, the film is absolutly hillarious and I adore Jennifer Coolidge as Paulette Bonafonte. They make such a great duo, and you can see them feeding off each other as the film progresses. I cherised the idea of Elle as the mentor to older Paulette, showing her the way of life she should have and helping her to regain herself - it showed the depth of Elle's character (in a less obvious way than her law school success)and her desire to pass on her 'knowledge' to those who need it.  <br />However, there are things about the film that I felt jarred me a little bit: <br />1#  I feel that maybe Raquel Welch could have been more convincing in the part of Chutney's mother, Mrs. Windham Vandermark. She was okay, but I wasn't quite convinced. <br />2#  I don't know why, but something about the female Law teacher in the Salon... you know that scene? Something about it didn't quite fit. <br />Other than that, there's really not many points I can pick with the film. So it's predictable, obviously 'staged' at times and over the top, but hey! That's all the fun, isn't it? It is a great film, not an absolute masterpeice, but it will definatly always remain a part of my collection.<br />Oh, but unless you already have, don't bother watching the sequal. It's like a completley different film... it's really quite bad.  <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|The first time George Lucas made changes to the \\"original\\" Episodes IIII, V, and VI, well, fine. That move could be explained as fixing the flaws and faults of the movies that arguably came out ahead of their own time, when the cinematic technology was not quite able to properly present His vision of an epic struggle between Good and Evil. For the record, this reviewer, unlike some diehard purists, liked the changes except the face-off between Han Solo and Greedo in \\"A New Hope\\" and perhaps the musical score at the very end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\".     Having said all this, the changes made for the DVD Trilogy Edition seem to have been done for the sake of making more changes, not to mention making mockery of His proclamation that the 1997 Special Editions are \\"the definitive vision\\". Indeed, this latest whatever is analygous with people who undergo cosmetic surgeries as a matter of obsession and addiction. Also, it is as though Lord Lucas is actually ashamed of having cast Clive Revill as the Emperor in \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and Sabestian Shaw as the elderly Anakin Skywalker in \\"The Return of the Jedi\\" and so on and so forth. Defenders of Lord Lucas might say that He made these switches for the sake of \\"continuity\\" between the Original and Prequel Trilogies, not to mention perfection. So What? These movies already lack in it anyway.   Exhibit A: While Anakin has aged considerably between I and II (note the casting change from Jake Lloyd to what's-his name!) Padme has not aged one bit (maybe she was frozen in carbonite during all that time!).   Exhibit B: In II, Owen Lars evidently has had possession of C-3PO for quite awhile by the time he first meets Anakin. In IIII, though, he has no clue whatsoever who/what he is (maybe he had all his memories from II wiped out!).    It is sincerely hoped that, as the movies that were originally filmed in B&W are now routinely available in both Original and Colourised Versions, the Original Trilogy would continue to be available in ALL THREE versions: Original, Special, and the most recent Special - Special Editions. Now that would be a fantastical service to any and all who even casually care about this one-of-a-kind space saga.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I think this is one of the most influencing albums on todays hip-hop generation. Why you ask? In a time where hip-hop is controlled by 2 line verses and no talent rapper, its nice to see an artist come out with a different approach besides, hoes, guns, and drugs. Rating this album, I'd give it all 5 stars just because theres finally a neo soul artists being played on MTV. Hopefully this opens the door for other soul artists like Talib Kweli, Common, Mos Def, The Roots, and Jill scott(ETC) to be played on TRL <br />*13*

B00001NFCY|3.0|This cd has sold eleven MILLION copies.  Isn't that absolutely disgusting?  This is just my personal opinion, but I hardly think this album deserves that kind of success.  I mean don't get me wrong, I think this is a GOOD cd, but it is certainly nothing incredible.<br /><br />On \\"My Own Prison\\", everything was simply superb.  Every musical aspect, ESPECIALLY Tremonti's guitar, was fantastic and worthy of the kind of praise it got.  But unfortunately, \\"Human Clay\\" shows a regressive step musically and artistically for Creed.  This SHOULD'VE been a `sophmore slump', but I guess, based on album sales, generic poo is what the world prefers.<br /><br />The first problem is Scott Stapp, who he sounds like he's trying to inflict some sort of Maynard James Keenan-ish mysticism to his vocals, which is alright, but it isn't nearly as effective here as he seems to think.  Musically, the rest of this album is worthlessly generic, using repeated power chords and bashing loudness to hide an obvious lack of originality.  It all FEELS too similarly boring and fake that at one point you'll just wish the album was six tracks long instead of 11.  And yes, `Arms Wide Open' is something that bores me to tears nowadays.<br /><br />I'd say the best tracks here are `Beautiful' and `Say I'.  These are the only two tracks that take the `new' aspects(Maynard style vocals, more power chords) and create utterly fantastic songs.  Other tracks that tickle my fancy are `What If' and 'Faceless Man', but really, they're not all they could be.<br /><br />But in all, this album is definitely NOT all it's cracked up to be.  A few good songs isn't enough for 4 stars.  If there was any justice in this world, that 11 million albums sold would belong to Fuel or the Foo Fighters something timeless, rather than generic poo.  2.5 stars.  But I don't know why I'm writing this, since even *I* own this album, as well as everyone else on the planet.<br /><br />Wow.  This is my shortest review. :-)

B00000DFSK|5.0|Perhaps I am slightly biased as far as this album goes; it was my very first U2 CD, not even mine, borrowed from my mum's CD case at the tender age of twelve. Eventually I just burned the CD for my own and it was a great introduction to some of U2's best work. This CD taught me the best things about U2, and I am now an avid fan with five CDs and counting.<br /><br />I have the two-disk version, but I never really warmed up to the B-sides. I'm not sure why. The first disk is unquestionably the better of the two, and to break it down more, the first seven songs are the best of the whole CD. Pride, New Year's Day, With or Without You, Sunday Bloody Sunday, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and Where The Streets Have No Name are the some of U2's best work of the 1980's, in my opinion.<br /><br />With or Without You is quite possibly my favorite song ever; not favorite U2 song, favorite song. I think it is muscially perfect, a masterpiece. I fall in love with the guitar part at the beginning of Where the Streets Have no Name every time I listen to it. Some of these songs are simply the best ever written.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this CD because I think it is a definitive statement on the U2 of the 1980's - it condenses their best work of that decade into one brilliant, awesome, must-have CD.

B00028HBKM|1.0|By far the worst movie I've ever seen.  It has nothing going for it except that it made tons of money.  Good for Mel.  Do I think it was anti-semetic?  No.  I'm Jewish, but I wasn't offended.  You can only be offended by something or someone you respect as an authority or someone who you perceive is better than you.  But I will tell you this:  Christians believe Christ died for our sins.  After seeing this movie I can tell you that if Christ did die for our sins he wasn't a volunteer.  They had to drag his [...] up that hill--kicking and screaming.
B0000DZ3DR|4.0|This is a wonderful duet album between ex-Byrd Gene Clark and ex-Textone Carla Olson. The many highlights include Clark's haunting \\"Gypsy Rider\\" and his interpretation of the Flying Burrito Brothers' \\"Hot Burrito # 1\\".  <br />I think Clark's version of \\"Hot Burrito\\" equals the Burritos. I also enjoyed the cover of John Fogerty's \\"Almost Saturday Night\\" by the duo. It's not something I would think Clark would cover, but it works.  <br />Olson also contributes fine numbers such as \\"The Drifter\\" and \\"Every Angel in Heaven.\\" Overall, just a great album for folk, folk-rock, and country fans. Even the bonus tracks are great, including their fantastic cover of Phil Ochs' \\"Changes\\" and several demos cut to get a record deal. Sadly, Clark passed away before another album could be made. Fans of Clark and the Byrds shouldn't miss this!
B00066N8JS|5.0|I bought both the DVD Audio and the SACD versions.  TDS in 5.1 is probably the best use of surround sound I have ever heard.  Trent just sends sounds FLYING around your head.  You really get a better understanding of the album listening to it in surround - it's like he is there in the room with you, explaining every nuance of the album.<br />Great stuff!  You don't know TDS until you have heard this version.

B000002A3T|5.0|I'll be the first to say that Roger Waters was a magnificent song writer/producer/musician, but did everyone forget about David Gilmour?  It WAS David who came on with Floyd and gave the band a MUCH needed boost after the downfall of Syd Barret.  No matter what anyone says, I credit Gilmour with the turn that Floyd took after Piper.  A Saucerful of Changes, aptly titled by the way, was a nice change in a new direction, and Gilmour had a lot to do with it.  I think that it was unfortunate that he had to play second fiddle to Waters, because DG is obviously a great songwriter and musician.  He is able to show that on this album.  I fault him a little in trying to make this a \\"solo\\" album instead of a Floyd album, I just think that he ignored Floyd's sound and just tried to run with what he had in his head.  It turned out to be a good thing fortunately, as this is one of the best Floyd albums.  It has a very laid back sound, however it is more positive than Waters' \\"solo\\" albums.  I think DG has aged a little better than RW, you can tell in his vocals.  I like the fact that this album reflects the time it was released, but it is still noticeably Pink Floyd.  If you liked More's melodic stance, and you are open to new sounds and techniques, I think you will like this album.  It is very moody and relaxing.  It is also more a representation of Pink Floyd since Waters wasn't present.  Having said that, I think that if they wanted to get together and work on something new, it would be exciting... hopefully we will get something soon.
B00007LTIA|4.0|i purchased this rhino remaster recently and the only major flaw was that you could not listen to the whole original version without changing cds. the sound is the most stunning feature as it was always muddy sounding even on the lp. Revealing Science and The Ritual are the best of the four originals. Rick Wakeman is the highlight of this set, his exquisite mellotron passages and non-bombastic moog (unlike ELP)are some of the best of the entire genre. i saw them perform in quadraphonic at the Boston Garden on this tour. they opened with the entire Close To The Edge album, then all four sides of Topographic, then encored with Roundabout. this record was trashed by critics when released and they were accused of going too far. maybe they did? still, not an easy listen for someone who is just getting into Yes. it is a milestone of prog rock.
B000003S5H|5.0|Ever wanted to feel like you're in one of those cool, ultra-hip volkswagen ads or an IKEA ad without all the attached consumer retail garbage? Well, this is the soundtrack. More songs have come off this group's collection of songs into commercials than any I can think of...and there's a reason. Air is a group that makes you feel GOOD. Whether you're driving around town doing errands, or lying in a blissed-out daze at home Air can supply the soundtrack. It's a rare blend of electro-pop-funk-trancy-jazz that you can sit and just listen to...or read with as a background noise. Perfect for Shag parties. You get what I'm trying to tell you?
B00005U1YO|5.0|The last track, The Test with the ever beautiful vocals of Richard Ashcroft, blew me away. It's one of their best tracks ever and a reason to buy the cd. The same for opener Come With Us, the perfect soundtrack for every ADHD-patient, never heard beats like that before and wasn't it that what used to characterize the Chems? It Began In Africa and the bassline of Denmark are potential clubhits too, there isn't one single bad track on the album... My Elastic Eye sounds a bit simplistic but is still nice, Hoops is magnificent (like Denmark, a song driven by its bassline with a great sample of Blur), Galaxy Bounce reminds a lot of Exit Planet Dust's Song To The Siren while This State We're In is the (much better) equivalent of Surrender's Dream On. <br /> <br />So don't believe the bad reviews about the Chems being stuck in there succes-formula and blabla no this cd blew me away, if you like them don't think twice, you can buy it with your eyes closed.  <br />While Exit Planet Dust remains their best to date, Come With Us is better than Dig Your Own Hole and Surrender.
B000002KDX|4.0|For me there aren't really any standout tracks on this album - but this is no bad thing, because every single song is excellent, well, perhaps not \\"Pigeon Song\\", but even that one can raise a few smiles if you're in the right mood. I generally think of the big hits as being overplayed, but in the context of the whole album they fit right in and I'm never tempted to skip them. If I had to pick a favourite track I guess I'd go for \\"Riverside\\"...but don't hold me to that.<br /><br />It's quite amazing that the three individual members could all contribute significant compositions while still in their very early 20s. This skill would slowly dissipate over the years (beginning with Dan Peek) with later albums (with a few exceptions) being quite patchy affairs but this and the follow-ups \\"Homecoming\\" and \\"Hat Trick\\" are three of the best folk/rock albums ever made.
068987474X|1.0|Don't waste your money on this book.  Steve Carter and Julia Sokol's \\"He's Scared, She's Scared : Understanding the Hidden Fears That Sabotage Your Relationships\\" is a much more rewarding read.  It acknowledges that women can be \\"just not that into\\" men, too.  And it goes further into tackling why.
B00005NGAK|5.0|All I can say is that if there is anyone who doesn't love this show after seeing it than we don't live on the same planet. This show inspired me to take Irish dancing. Now I've worked my way up to going to the world championships next year! In other words, it's a masterpeice. Personally I would give this 10 stars. There just is no comparison.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first have to say that I loved this album from the first time I listened to it. It was forward, emotional, and kept me listening for more. Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is a refreshing change of pace from the pop and rock we commonly hear on the radio. Topics that are taboo have been hit on hard, ranging from prison rape to coming back from the dead. I highly recommend it to anyone with an open mind and a love for music.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I recently viewed this movie with the aid of Blockbuster Video; thank the blessed Lord I did not buy it first.  As a grad student in history, I can respect the apparent desire of the director to make an \\"historical\\" rendition of the Trojan War, rather than a mythical one.  However---despite the archaeological discovery of Heinrich Schliemann (who found the actual site of Troy in Anatolia)---the story is inextricably founded upon Homer's epics.  To apply them half-heartedly in some regards and violate them in others is absolutely unacceptable.  The movie would have been far better if it had not been consumed in a secularist (or even dogmatically atheist) campaign to demythologize an intrinsically mythological story.  Even basic, non-supernatural aspects, such as the survivals or deaths of certain characters, are altered.  The director (Petersen) has Menelaus die at the hand of Hector, whereas Homer had him die long after the sack of Troy and his return to Sparta.  Petersen also allows Paris to escape with Helen.  Helen, in the Illiad, is recaptured by Menelaus at the burning of Troy and returns with him to his polis; Paris dies in the true story.  Furthermore, Agamemnon, in the \\"new version\\" is killed by Briseis.  In the \\"old\\" (or real) story, he is murdered, upon his return home, by his queen Clytemnestra and her lover.  Perhaps the most galling thing, already mentioned, is the constant desacralization of the story.  Petersen spins the noble Homeric story of vindictive gods and tragic men into a crass, hedonistic, vulgar, brutal farce.    My compliments to Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana for attempts to salvage the film.  They, along the time and effort of the CGI artists, are the only reason I did not give this movie the begrudged one star.
B000077VR3|5.0|Is what this film is.  I saw it twice when it first came out. Normally, I don't care for musicals, in fact can't stand most of them, because hey, all of sudden everyone breaks into song - how often does that happen in real life?  But this movie makes you forget about that.  The story of Christian, a pennliess writer falling in love with Satine, a courtesan/performer in a doomed romance, will touch your heart. Funny, beautiful, sad, and spectacular.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|This movie will appeal or not based on your taste and what you're looking for.  This film is indeed \\"based\\" on Homer's ILIAD, but far from faithful to it.  The cinematography is lucious, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.) are likewise very pretty to look at, as are most of the folks in this film.  \\"Troy\\" is very much a standard Hollywood sword-and-sandal epic: the sets (and everything else) look to have been designed with more of an eye to how they would look on-screen than historical accuracy.  I thought the acting was decent/good.  If there's a problem, it's the script and what the director wanted, not the actors.  This is pure Hollywood, not Homer, not Shakespeare or even PBS or the History Channel.    Presumably due to a desire to make \\"Troy\\" accessible to everyday, uninformed and perhaps homophobic audiences, any overt reference to classical sexuality is omitted (though plenty of skin is shown in traditional Hollywood peepshow fashion), modern U.S. speech and sensibility is expressed throughout (there is no reflection of ancient Greek or Trojan culture other than costuming), and the whole movie feels informed mostly by STAR WARS & recent mythic fantasy blockbuster films: \\"May the gods (not Force) be with you\\", the CGI triremes (boats) look much like swarming spaceships do, Orlando Bloom (Paris), who played Legolas in \\"Lord of the Rings\\", gets to play Super Archer again and there's even a special sword.  Also, apparently, it's the Trojans, not Greeks who use Greek Fire.  This film is highly superficial and it's \\"depth\\" is in the interpretation of motives of the ILIAD's characters (the most interesting part to me) but this is not developed; the focus is on action, not drama.  Expect to see a spendid and gaudy Hollywood extravaganza with big battles, glamorized violence (though all the jump cuts made me dizzy--after all in Hollywood editing is everything and the best way to tease and almost show nudity without quite doing so) with lots of CGI effects.  \\"Troy\\" does not have the gritty realism shown in say \\"Master & Commander\\".  Additionally, the music played during the batte scenes makes it clear that war, killing and dying is a romantic business indeed--almost as romantic as making love to a beautiful lady and equally as necessary.
B00000I4XR|5.0|Jaws is a classic seaworthy tale of a dangerous man-eating predator. It' set on Amity Island in the summertime. Tourists are repeatedly attacked by the monster until chief Brody must hunt him down. <br /> <br />Jaws has spectacular effects for that time. Even though the shark is mechanical, it throws a sense of terror into you whenever it opens its gargantuan mouth. Especially when he jumps out of the water and onto the boat! <br /> <br />If they ever make a remake of Jaws with computer special effects, I will personally diss the heck out of them. As much as I absolutely love computer effects, you can't replace the horrifying shark named Jaws.
B000002RXS|5.0|This is a great recording.  The guy from Ireland not only has a bad ear, but mixed up his facts.  Gedda did not say Callas sounded like she had potatoes in her mouth, but rather someone early on in her career when she perfromed La Giaconda said that.  Her wobble was also not in the bottom, but the top.  Anyone knows that.  Why people like this are allowed to comment is beyond me.  Carmen does NOT lie in a high tessitura thus it is perfect for Callas even if her very top was not good by '64 because she did not have to use it in Carmen.  Listen for the expression.  She is the MASTER of this.  She can move people like no one else can, even if you think the voice is not the most beautiful.  Ugly is pretty harsh and uncalled for.  Let's hear you get up and sing it and we will see what ugly is Mr. Ireland.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|The reason I bought this album is because I saw an edited AMV of a movie using Nightwish's FantasMic off of Wishmaster and fell in love instantly.  Me being a fan of Evanescence (which, by the way, Nightwish is nothing like, but just as good), I instantly fell in love with the female vocals in front of heavy guitar with awesome instruments in the backround.  I went out to the store and bought Century Child.  I listened, liked, and took a break from Nightwish for a while.  I went back after deciding I needed to broaden my musical tastes and got Once, I listened, I OBSESSED, and now I just can't get over how much I love this album.  Every song is wonderfully orchestrated and composed, especially the beautiful mostly instrumental track Ghost Love Score.  Nemo was the acutal reason I got the album, as I heard the song on a demo version on a website, and I instantly fell in love with Nightwish all over again.  Nemo and Ghost Love Score make me almost cry when listening to them, because of the beauty of the piano and the backround choral vocals, respectively.  My personal favorites on this album are Nemo, Ghost Love Score, Dark Chest of Wonders, and Wish I Had An Angel, but don't get me wrong, I absolutely love every track on the CD.  A composer like Tuomas, who can create a song as beautiful and touching as Ghost Love Score, definately deserves recognition for their work as a composer, and Tuomas plays the piano beautifully.  It's a shame Nightwish isn't recognized in the U.S.  They're near the top of the charts in Europe, but if you ask someone here if they know Nightwish, they usually will end up saying, \\"Who?\\"  I recently sent a music friend of mine Nemo off of Once via e-mail, and he IMed me later and asked me to send more and that they were an incredible band... just like everyone else I know who has heard their music.  Every time I give or send someone a Nightwish song, they ask for more.  The power in their music really speaks to you if you take the oppurtunity tolisten.  All in all, I recommend all of Nightwish's previous works and Once as well... it's all excellent!
0385513755|5.0|I can see why Dan Brown is one of the BEST writers to have come along.  The Da Vinci Code had me from the first page to the end.  Marvelous story line!  The book inspired me to do my own research into the Priory of Sion, Knights Templar and the early days of Christianity.  What an eye opener!  Through my research I have found a freedom I have never felt before in my life!
0385336942|3.0|I though there was too much introspection and remorse in this.  The story has interest, but I don't really think the author was able to make this as interesting as I would like.  More action would have helped.  Less mysticism as well.  But, what do I know!
0767805712|3.0|I like this film because, i think the story is very good. I like the part of the film where Jerome swims whith his brother as far as they can and the loser is the one who is scared,[...]. The world of Gattaca looks like South Africa (before 1990's)or the United States, (before 1770's)the blacks could not work with the whites. It's a racist System, it's a crime against mankind. In Gattaca life is easy for \\"the perfect persons\\", they can become doctors, astronauts but for the \\"invalids\\" life is very hard they must sweep or clean the building of Gattaca.
B0002X314C|4.0|John Legend's debut CD is nothing short of extraordinary. I don't even have to skip songs because the CD flows THAT good. The lyrics are tight, his voice is pure, AND he plays the piano...what more do you want? Please support some real talent for once.
0553573403|5.0|This book is not your typical fantasy fare. There's no orphaned boy with a hidden past, no princess in jepoardy. no great 'item of power', and no evil foozle to defeat.<br /><br />A game of thrones is almost more of a medieval soap opera with all the convoluted betrayals, double dealings, and plots going on. What's most surprising is that the author actually kept his story devices contained within this one book. The author hinted at something happening, and it happened two chapters later, not 3 books and 700+ pages later. (I'm looking at you, Mr. Robert Jordan).<br /><br />The only downside to the book is that the family lineages and complex plot threads can be cumbersome to sort out. And for a fantasy novel there's very little 'magic' involved, the tone is more historical than sword and sorcery.<br /><br />Regardless, the book moves at a wonderfull clip, has wonderful complex charactersations (with depth and layers), and really gives fantasy novels a good shaking up.
B00006879E|2.0|Once you get beyond the two single hits, this album is a mediocre collection of forgettable songs.  I've listened to the CD three times and have found no improvement with time.  Don't waste your money, download the singles and forget the rest.
B00003CXAA|5.0|These movies are hands down the best movies ever made period. I like a wide variety of movies from all sorts of comedies, old classic movies, to westerns, a very very wide range of different style of horror movies but out of each category and each film that comes out of each category I cant think of a movie that can even begin to compare to it. All three films take you through three generations of life, and you become attached to the characters so easily which makes the films even better. A lot of people think the third installment of this trilogy is not as good as the first two but I'd have to disagree. Pacino's preformance in III was spectacular and the story came to a great but extremily depressing ending. Which makes you think more about the movie and what exactly was going on through Michael's (Pacino's) head. The quality of the dvd I thought was outstanding, but I admit it could have been better but, what are you gunna do? I mean these movies are so great it doesnt matter, they are still cleaned up pretty good, better than a lot of the movies on dvd. As long as its wide screen, it has an excellent picture & sound its good enough for me and this collection deffinately has all of that. As for Part two being put onto two seperate discs, I think that was done so that people, such as my self could sit there for four and a half hours & watch part one & then half of part 2 then take a break before finishing up the rest of the films. Which I personally think is a great idea.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|Not every movie is made to be great art. Some films are made to be escapes from the world for a little while. This is one of those pictures. <br />I watched this movie (unrated DVD edition) with moderate expectations and was blown away by the charcaters and the story flow. I really enjoyed it (though I have only watched it once so far) and plan to enjoy it again. <br /> <br />Note that there is a lot of nudity in this picture so it is not family friendly but if you can see it and enjoy silly movies then this one is for you.
0156027321|4.0|I surely hope that the sales of worthy reads are not predicated - in any way - by reviews that are so transparently daft. Wasn't the point being made that in an age of empiricism and dogged adherence to reason, the idea of God was (like Pi's ordeal) unlikely, to say the least? Wasn't it also FAIRLY obvious that to most whose religion is science and the evidence of one's eyes the only witness to truth, God could not exist nor could Pi have lived aboard a lifeboat with a tiger and other tasty animals? Wasn't the author defying reason and testifying to the truth of things unseen? It seemed like it to me. Maybe the catholicism of Pi's faith unsettled some. Maybe it wasn't dogged, intolerant and evangelical enough. Maybe I missed the point of this gentle (yeah, I get the irony) narrative.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I first saw and heard Gavin DeGraw when his video for \\"Follow Through\\" first came out.  I loved the song and the fact that here was this young guy playing the piano IN the video.  So, for months, I would hear the song on the radio and finally had enough and had to find out who this guy was.  Once I did...I have never gone back.  I immediately went out and bought \\"Chariot-Stripped\\" and now I have a copy on my computer, one in my CD player and one in my system in my living room.  Gavin really impresses me and I am going to see him in a few days and am SOOOO excited!!!!!!  The talent of this man is truly amazing and I really could go on and on, but I am sure if you are a fan already...then you know how great he is.  Writing his own songs and playing his own music...inviting us in for a more intimate look with \\"Stripped\\"...what an awesome gift!  We love you Gavin!
B000002I2M|4.0|I feel a little ungrateful giving this less than 5*. Because it has always been inspirational to me. But to look at it from a non-Doors eye, I see a couple of flaws. 1. Morrison's voice gets a little to coarse in some songs. 2. The arrangements aren't as clever as on other albums.<br />I believe that Morrison may have been emotionally absent through the making of this album. The other members are amazing in the talent departement, but seem to need a mentor to draw out their inspiration. The post-Morrison albums show this. Though, I believe Krieger to be the best asset on this album performance-wise (except for some superfluous overlays). Not that the quality of this album can be compared to those later two, just in principal I think they were even now starting to miss Morrison's enthusiasm. But, regardless of Morrison's (alleged by me) absence in the day in day out process, there is absolutely no problem with his presence of personality when it came time for him to sing these recorded moments. Yes, his vocal box is shot to bits, but his charisma is ever-present. A strong performance by him, emotionally, for these moments that actually did make the cut.<br />\\"Changeling\\". An effective groove, but understaffed in the detail department. Some execution problems, I believe. It loses its way toward the end. But there are good moments by Krieger and Morrison. The groove for the opening number of minutes is its success, for me.<br />\\"Love Her Madly\\". I wonder about the time frame of this and Riders On The Storm's recording in relation to the rest of the album. Morrison's singing is excedingly more proficient on these two than on the rest of the album. And the arrangements, at very least on Manzarek's part, are as keyed-in as per the five albums before. Love Her Madly is often deemed as 'just a hit single'. But, the sycopation on the electric piano is too accomplished to have been dreamt up by a run-of-the-mill rock band keyboardist. I get the impression that this and Riders were worked on quite a while before the others, when Morrison was more 'there' and 'into it'.<br />For \\"Been Down So Long\\", I feel there's one too many guitar track overlays. But I love the lead guitar track, especially in the solos.<br />\\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" is not supposed to be especially Doorsian. They keep it simple and they do a good clean job of it. I find it hard to be objective now, but at the time Morrison's impression of an electric gutar was totally convincing. And spilling the beans via cracking his voice was was masterful. I do love the harsh-reality lyrics of this song. Great imagery for the modern suburban dullery. (Just this moment, it's reminding me of the film Taxi Driver, in that sense).<br />\\"L.A Woman\\". This is an amazingly catchy song. Krieger's guitaring is perfect. A highlight. And there's no doubting the groove of this tune. But, Manzarek's forte has always been to integrate intricacy and detail into the songs. Here, even though he is in keeping with the groove, there's no brain-candy. In Morrison Hotel, his organ work was simple, but it was deliberate and tight. Here, I believe he wasn't 'in the zone' creatively. And Densmore's drumming is akin to a click-track through the song's verses. He does get a bit creative toward the end, though. But, I also don't think he was 'in the zone' either.<br />\\"L'America\\". I like this song in ways. I've gotten plenty of good listenings done. Morrison's singing isn't too bad. But, it is dis-jointed. The fact that this wasn't a spontaneous creation, but rather a commisioned one, isn't surprising to me. (Incase you don't know it, was written especially for a film, and wasn't used).<br />\\"Hyacinth House\\" has a deep sadness to it. It was an early favourite for me. But, I think Morrison's voice is  a little too coarse. The choice of baritone register though, is perfect.<br />\\"Crawling King Snake\\". I don't find too many Doors fans praising this one. But I will. At least on some points. This is my favouriteDensmore piece. On any album, I mean. Though there may be a couple other songs to consider. He must have been feeling pretty 'on' this day. And Krieger's emphasis rhythmic track is spot on. They nailed the rhythm. Manzareks keyboard on this song stands out as one of my favourite elements on this album. It's not outrageously difficult, but it hypnotizes me everytime. As perfect a keyboard application to a blues piece I've heard. One major problem for this song- Morrison's vocal track is recorded way too loud in relation to the other instruments. One of the guitar tracks I also find swamps out the piano work. The production on the album overall is lacking. But it's homemade, so I'm not too critical. But, the volume level on the voice does take this song down a couple of notches for me.<br />\\"The W.A.S.P\\". The most uninteresting song-title the Doors have penned, in my opinion. This is cute, I won't deny that. But depth of texture is my favourite musical quality of this band. So, I don't get deep pleasure from it.<br />\\"Riders On The Storm\\". Firstly, the soundscaping is brilliant. Having the thunder and rain throughout was something that could have been dismissed as stupid, before the fact. But, now everyone has hind-sight I don't think it can be denied that the soundscaping kills any potential not to get caught up in its mood. Morrison's vocals aren't challenged at all by the range, but he is obviously in better form than in most other songs on the album. Krieger's guitar is eerie. It haunted me the first time I heard it, and it still does. And the slight distortion on the smooth keyboard taps straight into my head.<br />To think, they opened with Break On Through, and ended with Riders On The Storm. That's a pretty consistent career these guys have produced.. Though there may be a couple other songs to consider. He must have been feeling pretty 'on' this day.

B000002MP2|2.0|Yes, I know, pop-punk has become a very annoying fad over the last few years.  And as much as I hate to admit it, I LOVED this album when I was a kid!  Those songs \\"Basket Case\\", \\"She\\", and \\"Longview\\" were pure, head banging, singalong joy!  I used to think that nothing could possibly be more fun than listening to Green Day.  I must have been an INCREDIBLY stupid kid to think something like that.  Either that or just ignorant.  Because when I listen to this album nearly 10 years later, it makes me realize just how $hitty this band were and still are.      There is no musical ability or songwriting talent of any kind in this band.  They use the exact same distortion on every song.  They use it to cover up the bland riffs that wouldn't be able to carry the tune if they weren't over-distorted.  Every song sounds alike.  Sure, \\"Basket Case\\" and \\"Long View\\" were fun tracks when I was 9 or 10, but they sound really pathetic now.    Not only that, but when the 21st century began, a wave of soundalike Green Day imatators started popping up, and have completely taken over the pop charts.  Any album that influences so many crappy bands can't be any good.    Don't waste your money on this CD.  There are only two reasons to buy this CD  1==If you want to waste your money, and  2==If you're a ten year old kid in 1994 who wants to look \\"cool\\".  This band just isn't good at all.  Its unsophisticated music for unsophisticated listeners.  Its kid's stuff, really.  Sounds really dated.
B0000057C5|5.0|The first Rammstein album I purchased was Mutter - I'd heard Feuer Frei on the radio and liked the pace and guttoral sound of the music/lyrics. The album didn't disappoint, although a few of the songs took a while to grow on me. Not so Sehnsucht - I enjoyed this from start to finish, the techno sound mixed in with heavy guitars was just my kind of music; thumping, full-on industrial. Some people say the lyrics are sick in some of the Rammstein music, but I couldn't give a damn! I don't even understand the words - it's the sound that matters to me. I have all their CDs now - I just wish I could wipe my memory and rediscover them!! Now I'm on the lookout for other German industrial/metal - I just think the German language lends itself well to pounding, aggressive music.
B00005OM5L|3.0|I put this on my Santa List after reading these reviews, and have to say I am sorely disappointed. I find it very hard to understand why so many 5stars on this one. The music is great, and wished I had just got the CD instead. The DVD, the visual part, is not very provocative. The outdoor concert is fine, but the lighting not so good. Clapton plays great, but not much in the way of enthusiasm. Much of the time he looks like he's overly concentrating on what he's doing (which he is doing wonderfully) or someone in the band is in the wrong key, or something just isn't working right - he often looks a bit annoyed. The camera angle cuts, like so many of these DVD concerts are so fricking fast you have no time to consume them. Like I say, it's a great concert, for the music, just not the visual quality I want in a DVD production.
0440237688|5.0|I pre-read this before I turned it over to my 11 y.o. I am seriously impressed with what passes for \\"Young Adult\\" literature these days. It reminds me of Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" or more aptly Ayn Rand's \\"Anthem\\". This book ranks right up there with these lofty tomes. I am still amazed at what a wonderful \\"Young Adult\\" book this was.

B000001E18|5.0|U2 have always been a strong, passionate band with a lot of strong, passionate songs, and they certainly contributed to the soundtrack of my youth, especially junior high & high school. But despite such great songs as \\"New Year's Day,\\" \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love),\\" \\"With Or Without You,\\" and all the rest, I just hadn't liked them *enough* to wanna buy their albums. Maybe it's because Bono & the boys have a tendency to wear their political opinions on their sleeves, which I've always found to be a slight turn-off. Nonetheless, I can listen to their stuff on the radio just fine, and it's very cool that they're still rocking 25 years after they first started.However, one of my few forays into buying U2's music is this outstanding album from 1993, \\"Zooropa.\\" Although I do acknowledge the great songs that are on other U2 discs like \\"Boy,\\" \\"War,\\" \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and all the others, \\"Zooropa\\" was the first U2 album to blow me away so completely that I simply HAD to go out and buy it. Recorded inbetween tours, with no real intention of making an actual album, U2 went into the studio with industrial producer Flood and avant-garde keyboard wiz Brian Eno to work on some experimental tracks. The sessions went so well in fact, that a mere two months later, the band had completed a bold, daring, brand-new album unlike anything else they had ever done before, both musically and production-wise. \\"Zooropa,\\" in my opinion, is the most exciting, adventurous album U2 have ever done (with \\"Pop\\" a close second, though that's another review). The band practically re-write their sound with this one, serving up a platter that mixes the group's rock sensibilities with techno, industrial, and even art rock. And it works magnificently. I love all of these songs, from the space rock of the title track to the experimental \\"Numb\\" (with guitarist The Edge taking the mike in a monotone vocal performance that fits perfectly with the song's vibe), from the giddiness of \\"Lemon\\" to the beauty of \\"Stay (Far Away So Close),\\" from the industrial toughness of \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\" to the perfect pop-rock of \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others.\\" And, for the big finish, lead singer Bono steps aside to let country legend Johnny Cash sing the final song, \\"The Wanderer,\\" before the album finally gives way to siren sound effects & stops. Now how cool is that? WAY cool.I guess I'm what you'd call a \\"twisted\\" U2 admirer, as my two favorite U2 albums---\\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\"---are the two albums that most fans say they like the least. Well, luckily for them, U2 went back to their \\"classic\\" sound with 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" I joke to my friends that maybe when Bono & company recorded \\"Zooropa,\\" they thought to themselves, \\"Let's make a U2 album that Alan will like.\\" And I do like \\"Zooropa.\\" A whole lot.on\\" to the beauty of \\"Stay (Far Away So Close),\\" from the industrial toughness of \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\" to the perfect pop-rock of \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others.\\" And, for the big finish, lead singer Bono steps aside to let country legend Johnny Cash sing the final song, \\"The Wanderer,\\" before the album finally gives way to siren sound effects & stops.

0312335164|4.0|Ive read both Angels &amp; Demons and The Davinci Code, and I didnt find this story as well written as the other two but still a great story none the less. It wasnt all that long, finished it all in one day, and loved it. If you liked the others you'll like this one too. Id like to see Dan Brown make a second one including the same characters as well with Susan and David like hes done with Robert Langdon.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Collateral' was like a t.v. show not a big budget movie, no wardrobe changes as all takes place in one night.  In the Jan.-Feb. 2005 issue of 'Scholastic Instructor,' a bit of trivia about this movie is the amount paid ($7,827) to the Harrison School in L.A. just for using the exterior in this movie.  Seems to me that is public domain, if they did not go inside.  And to beat all, it was filmed at night.  What was there to see to earn this type of money?  Perhaps the director or producer had been a student there at one time or another.  You can see why there were no 'extras' and Tom had only one outfit. I did like Tom Cruise's white hair and spiffy gray suit. Nice for a change.    Jamie Foxx was funny as the unwilling accomplice/cab driver.  A taxi driver needs only one uniform, no changes for him either.  Now I understand why so many 'American' movies are filmed in Canada!
B00004T8RK|5.0|It is easy to tell why some may find this record below what they are used to from PJ.  The fact is this that Binaural is an excellent album that shows where Pearl Jam has been and is going.  The range of songs capitlized the band's skill and commitment to rock&roll.  The album rocks out from the beginning and then soars through deep, rocking, slow and acoustic songs. The variety is excellent. Some of the highlight tracks are Breakerfall, Gods Dice, Evacuation, Light Years, Nothing As it Seems, Thin Air, Of a Girl, Grievance, Insignificance, Rival, Sleight of Hand, Soon Forget, Parting Way.... that's right! ALL OF THEM! This album is a must have if you are consider yourself a fan of music.
B00003CXCT|1.0|k.....R.....A.....P.  Don not buy this.  Oh by the way since i am writing this reveiw, I have the right to change it and add things to it.  I might add some cool special effects in a couple of years if amazon allows you to, like change the color of the word from black to rainbow colored.  I might add a voice reading of jango fett of this review.  I might even change one of the letters, maybe a capitol C instead of that lower case k. Anyways do not buy this, the changes to these movies subtract from the movie.  It would be like beethoven resurrecting from his grave today, and saying I think i'm going to add some electric guitar solos into all my work.  <br />  <br />Do not buy the star wars trilogy on dvd, get the original on vhs.  If you keep buying these special editions they are just going to keep pumping out special editions of this Trilogy.  The 50th anniversay of this movie, they will probabley do another special edition.  I think they are going to CGI replace mark hammil with Michael J. Fox or Ralph Machio.  And Star Wars 3000.  I heard they are changing the plot, something like in ROTJ instead of the light saber scene at the end Darth Vader challenges Luke to a POD Race.  SO take a stand and do not purchase these until they are released in the original format. Thank You for your time.
0767805712|4.0|The actors play their role well, act well. The decors are too modern, not enough diversified. The colors are often dark but hot too. We feel that the ambiance is \\"cold\\" when characters look into one another's eyes and the ubiforms are the same, they are black.  <br />The music is sweet, lively, and gives more action and life in the film. The story is not bad, it represents well the differences between the people in some countries in the world. The beginning is a little long but the end is fascinating. The scenes where the two brothers do a stupid game in the ocean is beautiful. Gattaca is maybe the future of the world and it is scary
0440180295|5.0|It is my undying hope that this book will be read in High School English classes in the near future.  It is extremely well-written and very accessible both for reading and discussion.  It touches on important subjects such as war, time, family, and mental illness (supposed I guess!).   <br /> <br />Everytime I read this book I am reminded why Vonnegut has deserved all the praise he has recieved...he tells stories in uniquely intriguing ways.  While this book might seem random and confusing, it really simply tells the story of a man tramatized by war. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most interesting thing about the book though is the introduction, in which the reader is given a glance into the author's mind.  What an honor and how enlightening!  Every aspiring author should read this first chapter and understand that their struggles and hopes are legitimate!
B00008A7QK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites - if not THE favorite album in my collection. I remember seeing a picture of Marc Bolan in the early 80's and thought to myself, man, this guy looks wild - I've got to hear what his music is like. Thus began my odyssey to get my hands on anything associated with Marc Bolan.<br /><br />This album was the starting point - and it's a true gem. From the opening track, the hypnotic, sultry \\"Mambo Sun\\" to bombasitc guitars and violins on the closer \\"Rip Off\\", it's the perfect album - the centerpiece of UK Glam rock in the 70's.<br /><br />Tony Visconti's involvement here brings the album full circle. The mix of Bolan's poems set to music mingled with Tony's production and orchestral arrangements are captured perfectly in \\"Cosmic Dancer,\\" my favorite track on the album.<br /><br />There's not a bad song here. If you're curious and want to know more about Marc Bolan and his band, T.Rex, look no further than this album.
0767817478|1.0|This was one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to walk out of and/or demand my money back. Toho had finally killed off their monster, however, this stinkeroo offended them so bad that they had to bring the real 'G' back to get the offensive taste out of their collective mouths.<br /><br />It would not have been so bad had it not been for the whole \\"baby godzillas\\" sequence.  I can think of a dozen other things these talentless hacks could have shown us to fill in the time.<br /><br />Let's hope that Toho doesn't ever forget about this.
B000244FDW|5.0|I encountered this BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice in the early 1980s when it first aired on PBS and was immediately enchanted by its beauty. The A&E release from the 90s, while not without its merits, just couldn't compare.  <br /> <br />The A&E's version does seem to do a better job in introducing this classic by catering to the taste of the contemporary audience, while this 1980s version seems more faithful in attempting to reconstruct the Regency world so masterfully depicted by Austen. The leisurely-paced story-telling here will require patience, but that patience is amply rewarded by the richness of portrayal from a superbly talented cast. At the risk of repeating many thoughtful and perceptive comments here, I just want to say that the casting director deserves huge kudos: Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennett! The direction, a source of complaints for some, does seem to rely on techniques of television than film. You will see extreme close-ups of characters--including many nuanced expressions of these fine actors. To me, this is a plus. <br /> <br />Contrary to some reviewers' complaints on the low production values, I actually love the spare setting of homes. The interior lighting is deftly handled--a warm yellow-orange palette glows in daylight scenes and enhances the sense of domestic intimacy. I'm no expert in Regency music, but I love the scoring of the entire series, from the theme song to every scrap of melodies played over to complement the scenes or as interludes. The small chamber ensemble style, led by woodwind instruments, is in harmony with other aspects of production details. A fully-orchestrated technique, while rich-sounding, would have been totally off the mark. In short, this is an adaptation to treasure! <br /> <br />Now, if only BBC would release the VHS/DVD version of its equally superb 1970s adaptation of Jane Eyre, starring the incomparable pairing of Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston! Sigh.
B000001Y16|4.0|Makaveli, Tupac Shakur's alter ego, was hot. This is a great album. Songs like 'Bomb First','Hail Mary' and 'Life of An Outlaw' set this album off. The only song on here that I really dont like is 'Just Like Daddy.' The rest of the album is hot (as always). Tupac was the greatest artist of my generation. He was a poet. RIP.
B00006M183|3.0|Ten, VS, and Vitalogy are definetly their best.  No Code is the cd that made me stop buying anything Pearl Jam, and buying Riot Act was my attempt to become the PJ fan that I once was.  I didn't think this album was that great when I bought it, but I admit, it does grow on you.   <br /> <br />However, I believe that it has grown on me simply because I have grown up.  I grew out of the hardcore alternative, and so did PJ.  Sad, but true.  The vocals do seem a little weary, but overall it's good music.  Nothing on this cd will make me pause in the middle of a supermarket like \\"Better Man\\" or \\"Elderly Woman behind a counter (etc)\\" but I'm glad I bought it.   <br /> <br />
B000002L9J|5.0|It's a damn shame The Smiths ever broke up. And its even more of a shame that one of the greatest bands of all time hardly get any recognition outside of their relatively small circle of devoted fans. 'The Queen Is Dead' is one of the best albums of alltimes. It's easily on my top 10 ten list. It's also the best album by this wonderful, prolific, too short-lived group. Ever song on this album is wonderful. This was The Smiths at their very very best. For those people who are new to The Smiths, this is the album to start with. It's their most upbeat piece of work. One reason I love this album so much is that, unlike many Smiths songs (and solo Morrissey especially) every song is \\"sing along\\" which sounds kind of stupid, but listen to this album and tell me if you're not soon singing along with EVERY song as if you, yourself, had written them. Today at work I was singing 'Cemetary Gates' and 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others' Needless to say, my coworkers thought i was crazed. Anyway......I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!! Buy it, download it, WHATEVER....JUST LISTEN TO IT.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|The idea is that aliens make first contact by sending technical schematics to the sleeping, dreaming minds of boys.  The boys, Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, use the information, along with their computer, to build a home-made space ship from scrap.  If you like the idea you'll love the movie.  It's done with respect for science enthusiasts and sci-fi fans, and really captures the spirit, like some of Heinlein's books, Have Spacesuit - Will Travel, etc.
B00003CXDV|1.0|Hated it.  Every minute of it.  I've tried watching it three times because my older brother actually bought it, but I've fallen asleep every time.  Rent Napoleon Dynamite if you actually want to laugh.
B00009V7P8|2.0|The hysterical reviews of this album I've seen here make me think that many people deeply believe in the old saying \\"still waters run deep\\".  This lugubrious album is indeed rather still, but that stillness in no way masks a depth of content. <br /> <br />There is nothing challenging in any way about this album, so it will undoubtedly be a big hit, especially among septuagenarians and those who enjoy vanilla ice cream, tidy desks, and uninteresting, routine lovemaking in the missionary position. <br /> <br />If you enjoy recreational valium usage, this album is for you!  Mellow out, put on your fuzzy slippers, and be comforted by the aural complacence herein.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|A few weeks after seeing this movie, I still found myself thinking about a few things. Certainly, the sweet curve of Brad's bare body stretched on fur bedding is one. But the other is the ambiguous center of the film. Any center, a moral center, an emotional center... for the love of Zeus what is this movie trying to say!?<br /><br />Because it's like this: we all know the Trojans lose. If you make them out to be fine folk, then the innocent goodly people of the world lose and the warring [...] win. We don't like it when the good people lose, but if there's a lesson in all this, perhaps we can abide it. The only place I could see a lesson coming from is Agamemnon and how his unjust war led to his demise. But if that's what the movie wanted to be about, it would not have had Achilles at its epicenter. The most effective thing the director could have done would have been to make Aga honorable and kind: a man who thought he was fighting a good fight. That would have produced an allegory both timely and typically Hollywood. But, no.<br /><br />We get the antean Achilles as... I can't quite call him a hero, regardless of what Odysseus has to say about it. Because this Achilles is not the man I remember. This is not the man I read about. And the more I thought about it, the more this seemed like the center of the film: The men as they were and not as they have been remembered.<br /><br />Anyone who has read Homer will remember that those stories were as much about the gods as about the warriors. Wars were viewed on high from Olympus and gods moved men like pawns. Achilles was a great warrior because he was dipped in invulnerability. His heel was a weakness because that's where his mother held him as she plunged him in the water. Athena, Hera, and Apollo all had their hands in the happenings at Troy. And this entire aspect of divine intervention is missing from the film.<br /><br />My only conclusion is that we were meant to see these men of legend as men, nonetheless. We were meant to understand them as humans with personal problems. Achilles was a tortured soul, fighting for a man he hated beacuse it seemed to be his only purpose. (I will say that his fighting was unlike any I have ever seen. It was neither japanese style fighting, nor fencing. But a unique sword and shield style that I was quite pleased to see.) But it is in this same character of Achilles that the decanonization falters. He was a reluctant warrior. And in an effort to humanize him, we were presented with a man who recognized his own mortality. He feared death in some way, feared being forgotten even more. And while that fear is still and always very real, his solution no longer strikes the chord it once did. There used to be no higher cause than glory in battle. And glory meant wanton slaughter and destruction. Achilles' desire to be remembered seems very real, I empathize; but, his choice to kill innocents no longer carries the kind of honor it once did. By making his character real, all the weight of his decisions is on his shoulders. And where the great mythic hero once was stands a brutal slayer not nearly so noble. He chose to kill Trojans because it offered the best opportunity to be remembered. And as good as he was at it, the choice seems bankrupt. There are no good intentions, and he knew it. Better to be a scythe in a god's hands than that.<br /><br />I'm harsh on this Achilles the Everyman. It seems like an impossible task to write him both with grandeur and reality. It's complicated. And he did try to make up for it in the end.<br /><br />All this time, I have been looking for an explanation for the vague sense of confusion I had when I left the theater. I believe this is it. I want to accept Achilles as presented, as the great man that I'm told he was, but a river of Trojan blood is not a measure of greatness.humans with personal problems.

B0006399FS|4.0|U2 continues where it left off on \\"All That You Cant Leave Behind\\" but \\"Atomic Bomb\\" is more guitar oriented. This may be Edge's best guitar performance. This recording is a collection of up tempo rockers, mid tempo songs and ballads. Themes include war, peace, social justice, confusion, mortality and faith. U2's lyrics continue to be relevant and inspirational and address issues in the world we live in. In my opinion this is one of U2's top four recordings and i do recommend it.  <br />   <br />
B00005JMUL|4.0|This is not a movie about Santa Claus but a metaphor for belief in God.  Santa was hardly the merry person seen in just about every other Christmas movie ever made.  He didn't even look like Santa.  He looked more like an old testament prophet in a red suit.   <br /> <br />The North Pole was one of the weirdest places I've ever seen depicted.  It was a far cry from Rudolph's North Pole where the elves sang all the time.  Why all the disembodied recordings?  Was there no money left over for original Christmas music?  Didn't look like Heaven either.  It made me think more of the Catholic Limbo, somewhere between life and death.  If I were one of those kids, I'd want to get out of there quick.  Even 3-D didn't help. <br /> <br />Not that movie wasn't fun.  The kids were all good.  The boy and girl heroes were born leaders.  The obnoxious kid with the glasses really made me laugh.  Billy, the sad kid, was suitably mysterious.  Wonder what was in his package?  The scene where they served the hot chocolate was my favorite. <br /> <br />All in all, a good movie I'd like to see again.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002H33|5.0|There is no competition for this album, which was put out by arguably the best heavy rock band of all time. There is no comparison. This cd ranges from the well-liked, and much longed for heavy metal screaming from the speakers into your ears, to the more quiet breakdown/solos in the songs. Unlike most cds, where there are a few songs that are popular and well liked, every song on this cd is amazing. The intricates of the cd, and just all of the composition put into this cd makes it amazing. I would doubt that there is a single person who owns this cd, and would disagree with me. This is the best cd put out by Metallica, and their last with Cliff. RIP.  <br />      If you are looking for an amazing heavy rock cd, then don't look any further. This cd is the baddest, heaviest, and best cd out there. Trust me. I own the cd, and also i have burned many copies of it, because once people hear it they are constantly asking for a copy. The solos, and especially the instrumental song, number 7, Orion, are all perfectly played, while sounding simply like a free solo. Just listen to the samples and you will agree with me, and many others.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I sat down to watch this film prepared to not like it. From what I had seen, it didn't strike me as amusing. But about 10 minutes into it, I started laughing, and I didn't stop. And, suprisingly, I started liking the characters, who really have almost zero charisma.  <br /> <br />It's not the kind of film for everyone. It does take a certain kind of appreciation for dry, slow humor. It also helps if you remember highschool and how awkward things could be. Borrow this film from a friend first (or rent it). As for me, I'm buying myself a copy.
B000001DTM|5.0|There are few (if an any) bands in the last 20 years who have had the impact that U2 has. Even in an era dominated by lip-sinking pop stars, they continue to be a major force in mainstream music. But they wouldn't have made it even close to this far if it weren't for Atchung Baby. While the world saw U2's brilliance with the earthshaking classic The Joshua Tree, U2's second decade was disrupted by the immergence of a genre that would dominate the rock n' roll world during the early nineties; grunge. However, proving once again that they could maintain stardom under any circumstances. Not only that, but Atchung Baby is truly a great album. They have consistently been one of the greatest rock bands in the world, no matter what. And equally important is their mainstream success. Their albums sell because they are always great. That's a rare feat in this day and age. All hail U2; prophets of rock.
0375713751|2.0|I read this book when a co-worker and friend of mine, a working mom whose husband is a SAHD, suggested I read it (I was pregnant at the time).  Apparently, a well-meaning friend of her had given it to her. My friend had issues with the book, but she thought maybe I'd like it.<br /><br />Well, I didn't HATE it. It was a quick and easy read, maybe good beach reading. But I got tired of the narrator's whining real fast. I couldn't understand why she felt the need to constantly compare herself to these so-called supermoms who had the time to slave over treats for the kiddies' bake sales, or who spent every hour of their days (apparently) doing things to make their homes and families \\"perfect.\\" Ugh. Me, I tune those people out. So I guess I was very frustrated with the narrator, Kate, for NOT tuning these people out, and for not tuning the media out. I mean, honestly, the best thing moms can do is stop trying to act like good moms in the eyes of anyone except our own kids!<br /><br />Plus, the ending (which I'll try not to spoil, though I've seen a couple of reviews that have--be forewarned!) is both unrealistic and a cop-out. Not because those types of things don't happen--but usually, anytime people make huge lifestyle changes, they sit down and work out the ramifications of them with their spouses; they have discussions with their confidants to get ideas as to whether something will work.<br /><br />Rather, in the style of a novice writer who has written a funny story but can't think of a decent ending, this book just *BOOM* ends. It's all very thrown-together-at-the-last-minute, not calculated or thought out.
1592400876|3.0|It's a great title. But no one should be this concerned with grammar. It is more important to write in a clear way and the title depends more on punctutaion that most other writing.
B00004S875|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I don't actually own the SACD version of this album (and I don't believe the first reviewer did either). <br /> <br />Now that we got that out the way.  I'm a huge Billy Joel fan and this one of my favorite albums by him (Nylon Curtain still gets my #1 slot).  But that's not why I'm writing this.  I wanted to inform any of you out there that for the absolute best surround-sound job I've heard of Billy's work is The Essential Video Collection. <br /> <br />Even though you only get the greatest video hits (including some surprises), you get a phenominal surround sound mix of everything on here.  I don't have any idea why the SACD of \\"An Innocent Man\\" is only done in stereo.  The video contains all of the videos off that album remixed in true surround. <br /> <br />The video/audio that stands out in my mind the most was \\"Pressure\\".  During the solo break, you will hear instruments omitted from the album release and panned all around your ears.  It's pretty amazing, and of course, I would love if they did an entire SACD Surround for \\"The Nylon Curtain\\".  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like SACD (or DVD-Audio for that matter) is really going to catch on as much as some of us audiophiles had hoped. <br /> <br />The Essential Video Collection is not to be taken as a greatest hits collection of early stuff (It has \\"Piano Man\\", not the video version but the live one from Yankee Stadium).  It does not have any selections off of \\"The Stranger\\", but yet it has footage from \\"Turnstiles\\".  It doesn't matter, the DVD is great and having the surround sound only adds more appeal. <br /> <br />The DVD is a must-have for every fan.  Pick one up as soon as you can.
B000002HJR|4.0|plain and simple this album rocks....if you like pantera, sabbath or other kinds of \\"stoner rock\\" than you will like this...awesome guitar riffs, great vocals and cool songs all around...only reason it doesn't get a 5/5 is because it is not terribly original, but if you like any of the bands mentioned above, you will dig this release
0887306667|4.0|I would heartily recommend the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing to any marketing professional who is looking to get a little insight into how to more effectively market your company.  It's got some great points to make and performs that task admirably. <br /> <br />If I had any complaint, it is that the book is really showing its age by 2005.  Reading through some of the laws, in which they hold up certain companies as model practitioners, I can't help but be struck by the fact that these companies DON'T EXIST anymore - or if they do, they certainly don't have the same stature that Trout and Ries afford them in the book.  I mean, seriously, holding up Commodore as a successful computer company is almost laughable in this day and age.  In the same manner, a company like DHL Worldwide is presented as having a firm lock on international overnight shipping that FedEx's own marketing campaign can't break.  In 2005, I think I'd rate DHL as a distant third behind both FedEx and UPS. <br /> <br />It's not that the Laws are bad - in fact, I think they are, for the most part, excellent.  Just be ready for a few chuckles (unintentional on the author's part, I'm sure) as you read through their examples of companies that utilize their \\"Immutable Laws\\" and yet no longer hold any position of dominance in the market...
B0000VCZKM|3.0|Well, I think this is a really swell movie. Albert Finney and Carol Burnett crack me up, Aileen Quinn is exactly what Annie should be, and Sandy is perfect.    But WHY OH WHY is this not being offered in a widescreen format? I have yet to see all of \\"It's a Hard Knock Life\\" and I know those girls are knocking themselves out offscreen. I've seen this movie on three different media. All were pan and scan, and all three showed different parts of the picture! The worst was a VHS release. (...)     I don't know which is more frustrating about this anniversary dvd, the fact that it doesn't offer widescreen, or the fact that the dvd menu and the special features show the movie clips in widescreen, teasing me with those brief glimpses.    There is no reason that dvd manufacturers shouldn't at least OFFER a widescreen version. Let's get with the 21st century already!
6304698682|3.0|I did read some (but not many) of his reviews.  (I think he's about 15).  He called this movie \\"better than 'Unforgiven'.\\"  (Where do these people come from?)  This movie is like a rehash of \\"High Plains Drifter\\" with an embarrassing rip-off of Shane at the end.  We get it, Clint, the otherwordly (possibly a ghost) avenger who helps the victims of the west.  A well-done rehash for sure with Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, western veteran John Russell, and assorted other interesting faces.  Thanks for moving onto \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Bridges of Madison County\\", \\"Mystic River\\" and so many more.  (Did one of your women inspire you?).  There were mystical episodes of Clint's old TV show \\"Rawhide\\".  Maybe that's why we had so many \\"mystical\\" avengers.  Stick with William Munny.  And ignore MIKE 2922 every time.
078681859X|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my 15-year-old nephew.  I got it home and meant to read just the first chapter (so I could talk about it with him when he opened it).... but I got so caught up in it that I had to go buy him another book so I could finish this myself! <br /> <br />The opening scene, told from the perspective of the djinni, grabbed me right away.  The character, being summoned by a new master, is trying to figure out what special effects to add to his apparition to impress this new magician with his great powers...only to find himself facing an 11-year-old boy when he finally materializes.  The struggle between the djinni, who is trying to get the upper-hand, and the boy--Nathaniel--who is dealing with magic that is perhaps a bit out of his league, goes on throughout the book. <br /> <br />The author's style is unique--in part, through the use of footnotes for the djinni to give his insights into what is happening.  While the story may be compared to Harry Potter because a main character is a young boy who does magic, its really a very different story.  Magic is out in the open in The Amulet's London.  In fact, the magicians control the government and 'protect' the commoners.  A substory (that plays a bigger role in the sequel) is that of a Resistance group that objects to the magicians' rule.  There are themes in the book that will appeal to older readers but the story can still be appreciated by younger folks. <br /> <br />The book is sold in the young readers/young adult section of the bookstore but the story is entertaining for all ages.  As an adult I fully enjoyed this book and went right out after I finished to buy the sequel, The Golem's Eye (also a great read)! <br /> <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I bet that those people who gave this album 1 star have never heard this album. Vol. 3 is really amazing, there's not one bad song on it.  <br />Prelude: Amazing way to start off the album, I love it <br />Blister Exists: Good solid Slipknot song with amazing drumming, nice and hard, great song in all. <br />Three Nil: Another solid song, I love this one too. <br />Duality: I don't like this song. It is good but it's not real slipknot, it's nothing like the previous 2 tracks on the album. This is MTV slipknot, not the real Slipknot. <br />Opium of the People: Pretty good song, I like it but it could have been improved a little. <br />Circle: Really good acoustic song. It shows how much this band has matured in 5 years, they were playing 'surfacing' and now they've matured to play songs like Circle.  <br />Welcome: Good song, really loud and really good. <br />Vermilion: This is the best song on the album. Great guitar playing, great vocals, great drumming, it's all here. <br />Pulse of the Maggots: Another great song. I love the lyrics and the overall theme of the song, this one's really great. <br />Before I forget: my favorite song on the album. Loud, meaningful, melodic, it's really good. <br />Vermilion Pt. 2: Great acoustic song, I really like it. The album couldn't do without this one. <br />Nameless: my 2nd favorite, intense and loud in the verses then the chorus shows how corey can go from screaming to singing in a second, it's reall good. <br />Virus of life: weakest song on the album but still good. It's very slow and the lyrics aren't great, but there's some good drumming here and I like it. <br />Danger-Keep away: No song could have ended the album any better. Yes it's quiet but it has some amazing vocals, keyboards, guitars, everything is here. This completes the genius of this album, I love this song. <br /> <br />There you go, it's one of the best albums out this year, go get it.
B00005JM1F|4.0|I didn't see this movie when it came out in the theaters as I thought the movie looked pretty stupid.  Then I saw Dodgeball and that was my first introduction to Vince Vaughn.  I liked his \\"Bill Murryesque\\" portrayal in that movie so I decided to see what else he was in.  A friend recommended Old School and with low expectations for the movie, I rented it.  I watched it first by myself and giggled most of the way through.  Then later, my husband and I watched it and this time I liked it even better.  I liked the fact that even though these guys on the surface seemed to be jerks, underneath they were actually pretty nice guys.  A great example of that in the movie is when Beanie is alone with a coed in his room at the \\"frat\\" house and she comes on to him.  You can tell he is torn, but ultimately, tells her \\"I can't, I'm married.\\" I just love that scene and Vaughn is brilliant with it.  YOu can see that even as he is turning her down that he wishes he could be that kind of guy who would cheat on his wife.  FOr all his blustering about how miserable wife and kids are, he is actually a sweet dad, and a loyal husband.  It is this type of little nuance that saves this movie from being just another stupid bad boy comedy.   <br /> <br />The big laughs are there as well.  OF course the famous streaking scene is hilarious, but I had seen most of that in trailers so it wasn't a surprise.  The scene in the van when they pick up their recruits is another hilarious part. But there are many more funny little lines here and there that to me make up the best parts of the movie.  For example, when Will Ferrell is describing his weekend plans of going to home depot etc, to the college kids, I just crack up.  The gentle way Vaughn is with his son and baby and then \\"ear muffs\\" them and swears etc, is great.  And the birthday party scene with Beanie yelling at a pledge who took the headpiece off of his costume because it would upset the kids while he is dressed up as clown and is chainsmoking and drinking.  I could go on but I will stop now and just go watch it again! <br /> <br />ALot of people have complained about the ending and I disagree.  I liked the way they took the tests etc and beat the dean.  The dance scene in the gym makes the whole last third of them movie worth it.   <br /> <br />The performances are all very good although I don't really think that this sort of comedy is Luke Wilson's forte.  He was ok as a straight guy, but I don't really think he could play a funny part.  Will Ferrell was very good, but his ending bothered me.  I kept hoping he would pull out of his alcoholic ways at the end.  If I really think about that, it is sort of depressing.  Vaughn was the fantastic,especially compared to the laid back performance he gave in Dodgeball.  I hope his upcoming films will not disappoint.  As for this movie, buy it, kick back and don't be embarassed to laugh at the non-pc, sexist, silly, sometimes vulgar, but essentially sweet nature of the movie
0767805712|4.0|I love the film. The story is very intelligent because it's a story about genoism (a strange form of racism). It's in a near future, so the technology is rather more advanced than ours. It's spectacular ! But sometimes it's quite difficult to understand... It's complex. But finally, it's a good film. A very good film !
1577311523|2.0|The Power of Now is delusional escapism with lots of mumbo-jumbo to shore it up. If you loathe yourself or your other self, as the author claims to have at one time, then try living solely in the joyous Present, or Now, devoid of connections to the past or future. And that means turning off the analytical mind and avoiding virtually all emotions, which arise due to misguided thinking. When the author had his epiphany concerning the Now, he sat around on park benches for two years contemplating the grandeur of trees, and such. How nice for him, but probably not believable.<br /><br />The entire book gives new meaning to the \\"ignorance is bliss\\" maxim. There is no profundity in stating repeatedly that actions and thoughts occur in the present. What is utterly simplistic is to dismiss their context and ramifications. The idea that people will develop fears or anxieties in contemplating the past or imaging the future is exaggerated. Growing up does involve learning to cope with those realities. Suggesting the blissful acceptance of \\"what is\\" seems no more than happy ignorance.<br /><br />The author makes no effort to explain the basis of his depiction of people having a true self and a discordant self that thinks and emotes. He proposes that the true self \\"watch\\" the thinking self and thereby transcend that limiting behavior. One wonders if any thought is involved in the watching. It all seems like trite psychobabble or Freudian distortion. Though two hundred pages long, the book endlessly repeats its nonsensical contentions and could easily be reduced to no more than ten pages.<br /><br />The author finds much of society dysfunctional. He might get no argument there. It's hard to see those withdrawn to an inner, true self, contemplating pure \\"Being\\" doing much about it. Thankfully many understand that society is a work in progress that requires much effort and thought in dealing with realities and that is very messy.<br /><br />This is an easy-way-out book. Operating in a state of delusional nirvana is self-centered, fairy-tale stuff. We should be talking about getting smarter, citizen empowerment, ecological sustainability, reining in corporations, and the like. Living in the escapist Now/Me world is just pathetic.perating in a state of delusional nirvana is self-centered, fairy-tale stuff.

B00004YA66|5.0|I had not seen any advance publicity on this movie.  I'm not even sure how I happened to come to watch it the first time.  I just remember how engrossed I became in the movie as the unusual plot unfolded.  There is a sort of science fiction aspect that is handled fairly well and adds to the impact of the movie.  Due to the presence of northern lights, a ham radio is able to travel through time to connect a son and his deceased father.  They come to understand just who they are talking to over the radio and the family history starts going through some radical changes.  The way things change and the suspense involving new twists to the story keep the interest level high through out the movie.  Just when you think the movie is coming to an end, it veers off in a new direction. <br /> <br />This is one of those movies that will appeal to most age groups and was one that my (then) 11-year old son and I enjoyed together.  I liked the use of the 1969 World Series as a backdrop and point of reference in the movie.  If you haven't seen this movie then you have been missing out on a real treat.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Great period costumes, great musical score, and who can ever resist the story of someone (or in this case, 3 someones and a some-horse) being down and out and coming back to triumph? <br /> <br />Every member of the cast is steller.  Tobey Maguire, my favorite, as Red Pollard (jockey), brings the perfect blend of bookish, literature-quoting, damaged vulnerability and angry street-wise smartmouth. William Macy, with that unique staccato delivery of his, cracked me up everytime he was on screen as the sound-effect happy announcer.  <br /> <br />I echo those reviewers who expressed the opinion that the movie starts out slowly and builds interest as it progresses; no matter, so did Star Wars. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the extras of the dvd, all of which are interesting and relevant, including a bit of back history about Seabiscuit himself and another on making the film.  (Tobey Maguire as Pollard was sometimes just sitting on a stepladder rather than a real horse in more than one shot!) <br /> <br />One thing I have to say about this film: It piqued my interest enough to do a little research as to what became of everyone, the owner, trainer and jockey as well as the horse, after winning their ultimate.  I was somewhat puzzled and disappointed as to why there was no footnote added to the film telling of their fates.  Well, now I know why.  After all that pulling together as a team, they all drifted apart.  Red Pollard slid down the sucess ladder until the point where he was actually just hotwalking racehorses; Seabiscuit himself was put out to stud, but dropped dead of a heart attack at the age of 14, not even middle aged for a horse.  I'm really happy those associated with the film chose to end it on such an upbeat and hopeful and positive note, even if it didn't accurately portray their fates.  Full-on accuracy would never be so entertaining.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I went to see this version of the film in the theatre and was blown away.  I loved the original, but this version is so much better.  A lot of the deleted scenes that were on the first DVD have just been \\"sewn into\\" the new version, but they have added more info connecting events to the Sparrow book and it flows much better in this version.  Things make more sense.  The only gripe I had is that they changed the first song (when Donnie is riding his bike home after sleep walking in the opening scene) from Echo and the Bunnymen's \\"Killing Moon\\" to some dopey INXS song \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\". (I'm a HUGE INXS fan, but the song just is so wrong for that scene) Except for that, this is the superior DVD to own if you loved this movie
0767834739|3.0|I liked the first \\"Resident Evil\\" better.  I liked the way it opened and the entire idea of people having to go back into the Hive to find out what happened and look for survivors.  There is something to be said for the inherent tension in having to keep going forward when you should be turning around and getting the hell out of Dodge as quick as possible.  \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" is about the getting the hell out of Dodge, or in this case Raccoon City, but there is a major problem in terms of the as quick as possible part, especially given that the city is about to be nuked.<br /><br />The Umbrella Corporation decided to reopen the Hive, which allows the T-virus to escape and turn the inhabitants of Raccoon City into zombies.  I might be slow when it comes to modern science, but I really fail to see the practical applications or economic potential of the T-virus given that it is not really regeneration human cells.  Now the nuke option is making a lot of sense, which is bad news for Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically created ultimate fighting machine, who is trying to lead a group of survivors through the zombies to safety.  But since this movie is based on a video game, things get worse.  The Umbrella Corporation sends Nemesis, a killing machine that may or may not be a genetically mutated version of Alice's boyfriend, Matt, from the previous film.  Apparently shooting people before nuking them is in the best interest of the corporation.  Go figure.<br /><br />Alice at least has some decent allies this time around, with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a demoted cop who is pretty good given that she has no genetic enhancements, and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), who leads what is left of an elite tactical team.  Weather reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) is as close as we get to the damsel in distress with this group, and she is not stupid.  The group has a glimmer of hope in that there is a scientist, Dr. Asher (Jared Harris), who created the T-virus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the \\"easy\\" through zombie town.  All they have to do is rescue his daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), who was left behind.  So this is the \\"Resident Evil\\" equivalent of trying to get out of zombie town with one hand tied behind your back.<br /><br />I understand that there are a lot of things in \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" that are lifted from the various \\"Resident Evil\\" video games, but all of that is lost on me.  I am sure that this adds another dimension of enjoyment to the film, just like when I watch a \\"Spider-Man\\" movie and talk about what shots are taken from which cover by which artist.  A lot of this stuff is explained in the various commentary tracks, so there is ample opportunity to play catch-up, but it would all work a lot better if you have actually seen the video games.  The bad news is that the sequel seems much more like a video game as the survivors fight zombies, and then they fight mutant creatures, and then they fight the Umbrella Corp., and then they go through the whole cycle again.<br /><br />Taking the movie out of the Hive and up to the streets works against the tension and the terror, even when you throw in the zombie strippers (yeah, it sounds like a good idea, but it really is not).  I think the characters are more interesting this time, mainly because their collective competence level is a lot higher than the first film, but this is yet another film that turns the lights down low and edits like crazy to achieve its effects.  I am so sick and tired of movies resorting to that approach instead of just letting us see what is going on.  But this is a movie that really does not have much respect for the intelligence of its audience, all of whom would know to shot zombies wearing body armor in the head.  At least the movie makes the videogames look really good in comparison, so there is that.  You just have to be into playing the games.irus and is wired into the city security system so that he can help them take the \\"easy\\" through zombie town.

B00005NWM3|3.0|\\"Silver Side Up\\" was Nickelback's first commercially successful album. Most of the popularity was caused by the strength of the hit \\"How You Remind Me\\", and this is a very good song. It was definitely overplayed by mainstream radio stations and such, and became a pop hit as a result. Despite that, it's a good song though. The two other singles \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Too Bad\\" are also very good songs as well, well-written and about serious subjects. \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" is a darker song, but it's quite good (my favorite on this CD). \\"Just For\\" is also a song written against domestic violence, it's another good song. Closer \\"Good Times Gone\\" is good too, the slide guitar stands out, and it's solid. These 6 songs are definitely worth listening to; they're all good. <br /> <br />Now here's the problem. Songs 6 through 9 are forgettable; well actually they're not good. I haven't listened to any of these songs in about 2 years. So the CD is short to begin with, and nearly half of it is weak. In my opinion, Nickelback's other 3 CD's are all definitely better than this one, as whole CDs. So my final rating for this one is 6/10, they get a point for every good song. I'd still recommend it if you're a fan of Nickelback, but their other stuff is better.
B0006419J6|4.0|Ok, so I was one of the ones that assumed this movie was based on an Asimov book. I was wrong, but the movie did not disappoint. There have been two sci fi movies that I have enjoyed in the last few years (since BladeRunner) and this is one of them (the other is Minority Report). I thought the three laws were an interesting play on logic. I spent some time after the movie thinking through how a machine with artifical intelligence could \\"evolve\\" into a higher understanding of the meaning of those laws.  <br />Ladies, you'll be glad to know that Will Smith was buffed in this movie (probably residual from the Ali movie he did).
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I am not here to attempt to explain this film. There's no way to do so, really; even with the most thorough, scene-by-scene, clear as mud analysis, you'll still be trying to figure it out for days after you first see it. It was meant to be left up to interpretation. If you're looking at reviews to decide whether or not to get the thing, just rent it first. Cheaper. Or borrow it from a friend (free), because you're bound to have a few who own it. Believe me, once you've seen it, you'll be SURE you want to purchase it. (Unless you dislike it, in which case I can't help you.)<br /><br />Instead I am typing this in order to urge you to disregard the  one-star review (dated 11/17/04) by \\"Lance Christian\\". He says, and I quote, \\"Donnie Darko is just a total attack on religon esp. Christianity,right-wing politics and any form of morality that one might decide to uphold.All of this propoganda is coated with a science-fiction sub-plot of time travel,so as to not make it TOO apparent.\\" First of all, study your punctuation. Secondly, please know what you're talking about before you open your mouth. This movie is not an attack on religion. It's quite the opposite. Anyone with any sort of an open mind can see this clearly; if you want proof, kindly refer to the deleted scenes of this DVD. The third one is an extended version of the first sequence between Donnie and Frank. Listen to the commentary on this. It clearly states that Donnie Darko is a movie about DIVINE INTERVENTION. I think Richard Kelly, the creator, is a bit more knowledgeable on the subject than some random, utterly ignorant \\"little windbag\\".
B00000GUZP|3.0|Koo Koo is notable as Debbie's formal coming out party in 1981, while Blondie was still together. The music sounds the way the cover looks---kind of grey, steely, cold, funky, industrial and urban. One thing I like alot about the tracks is the raw mix that really lets you hear Debbie's unprocessed voice. Sometimes TOO unprocessed, but preferable to some of the Mike Chapman productions that bury her in reverb and under a wall of sound. The songs are catchy but not in the same way as Blondie songs are catchy. I never quite \\"buy\\" Debbie as a funky vocalist, she simply sounds too white to completely pull it off. But the songs are entertaining anyway. \\"The Jam Was Moving\\" is the best thing on the album, and \\"Under Arrest\\" and \\"Inner City Spillover\\" are great fun. It could be argued that Debbie sounds a bit lacklustre here, but then you could say the same thing about the last two Blondie albums too. Sometimes her deadpan comes uncomfortably close to apathy, and other times it adds ironic distance, which was always a big part of her trademark. Is she bored here? We'll never know. Surely, she was coming from a more cerebral place than on the Blondie outtings--she is trying to impress the critics that she is more than just pop fluff, it seems. And the resulting joylessness somewhat scars \\"Koo-Koo\\". On later solo efforts, Debbie warmed up and got more emotional but less vital.  The cover art by Giger boosts the general credibility factor here but the album never completely gets off the ground. Still, it's an interesting little detour  that will no doubt be of interest to any fan.
B000002UAU|1.0|Come on, the greatest album in the history of rock? I think not! This was an arty farty experimental pop album at best. At worst it is over extravagance that doesn't know what it's trying to be. The Beatles are the most pampered and over indulged pop group in all of popular music history. Were they talented? YES. Are they overrated? Most certainly, and none more so than this album. Revolver is worthy of being in the top 10 of any poll. But this album never should be. When I am 64 indeed...
B00006879E|3.0|First off, anyone who would call \\"she will be loved\\" a 'deep song' has absolutely no credibility to judge music... it's probably the worst song on the album, possibly tied with \\"this love.\\" What horrible picks for a band's first two singles! <br />  <br />This album is a generic mindless pop record with moments of potential, but those moments are quickly destroyed by the lack of musicianship within the band. Whenever they build up to something that could culminate to a solo by either their organist/pianist or lead guitarist (both instruments very capable of sounding killer in a song such as Sunday morning), they instead just go back to the chorus of the song and let that lead singer of theirs (who, by the way, should NEVER be compared the great Jay Kay of Jamiroquai) sing yet another chorus with his inane lyrics.  <br /> <br />Do not spend money on this album. Maroon five have been given enough money by 13-16 year old girls for them to live extremely happy lives... so don't feel like they are a band in need of you buying this album... they aren't. Burn the album if you really want to get a hold of it, but what you've heard on the radio should be a good clue-in as to what you are going to get with the album.  <br /> <br />Hey maroon five... Maybe next times if you guys don't put out a lame record you might begin to get some respect from the music world instead of wallowing in the lifeless pop scene. I could only hope that someone from your band gets to read this... I'm not the only one who feels this way.

B00066VUPM|5.0|Although Coldplay take center stage when it comes to gentle rock, Travis have always offered an earthier, folkier approach to warm rock lullabies.  They can be bittersweet, on \\"Flowers in the Window,\\" optimistic, such as on \\"Sing,\\" or sorrowful, on \\"Why Does It Always Rain on Me.\\"  The earlier material is a little weak, but the latter makes up for it.  Here you'll find tracks about love like \\"Side\\" and current politics like \\"The Beautiful Occupation.\\"  Travis are an underrated band with strong melodies and, by listening to this collection, a great catalogue.
B000002UAR|5.0|If there is one Beatles album worthy of all the acclaim and fuss. Revolver is the ONE. 14 tracks by a group at their peak and not a weak song on the album. Over half this album is alltime great status. Songs like ELEANOR RIGBY, TAXMAN, GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE & OF COURSE, TOMMOROW NEVER KNOWS are the cream of the Beatles. They never got near this album again. This is the one that is truly worthy of 5 stars...
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Country maven turned international success boasts on this collection of early twang and late radio blockbusters.  Her hits are chronicled from line-dancing favorite \\"Any Man of Mine\\" to mega hits like \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" and the over-produced \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good.\\"  All the favorites are here, making this a celebration of upbeat numbers and schmaltz.  New tracks keep the sales going, like the collaboration with Mark McGrath \\"Party for Two.\\"
B000002UB3|3.0|Could get away with this album being considered a classic, even masterpiece in some peoples eyes. Once again the artistic praise afforded to this group is overdone. This album contains 3 fine songs COME TOGETHER, SOMETHING & HERE COMES THE SUN. The rest is bland filler, by a group well past its prime, and no longer functioning as a proper group.
B000696PWC|5.0|The diva of effervescent pop is back, yet again, to prove her reign as the ultimate dance queen.  Madonna might be pop queen, but when it comes down to sultry vocals with electronic beats, no one can do bubblegum like Kylie.  Her show-pony status makes her hits more accessible.  This collection starts with \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" and ends with the Scissor Sisters-penned \\"I Believe in You.\\"  Stellar dance numbers include \\"On a Night Like This,\\" \\"Come Into My World\\" and the airy \\"Confide In Me.\\"  Also includes \\"Did It Again\\" and \\"Put Yourself in My Place,\\" but disregards \\"Some Kind Of Bliss.\\"  This is a treat for all you with joyful feet.
B00005MP58|3.0|There is a passionate following for this series.  You may read that this series brought Jane Austen into the 21st century.  This series inspired the \\"Bridget Jones\\" movies.  However, I have to agree with reviewers who say that the two are a certain kind of animal, and they're different from Jane Austen's book.     The 1980 BBC adaptation is more faithful to the book by Jane Austen than the others, both in character and plot.  It's also more comical and lighthearted than the other versions, but that's because it doesn't present any character as a cartoon or caricature (e.g., compare Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins here to their 1995 miniseries counterparts).  A caricature, to me, is like a lump of lead: throw it in water and it sinks.     I find the relationships between the characters develop naturally.  The plain settings allow this development to come forth, like really good theatre.  Our reward is that we see the characters interacting in a world that has particular conventions.  Some of these conventions are difficult to explain to today's audiences, who get off on movies...like \\"Titanic.\\"  Certainly, Fay Weldon crafted a couple of new scenes and there are some minor logical errors, but she's kept the dialogue, aired it out with discretion without twisting it.  Today's audiences tend to expect actors to show a good deal of emotion.  I think that Darcy's \\"stiffness,\\" as portrayed by David Rintoul, is right on key.  It's a function both of his pride and social standing, and makes for positive change as the series progresses.         Elizabeth Garvie is very beautiful to look at as Elizabeth, but what sets her above other actresses in the role is her intelligence and curiosity about the world.  Her eyes are beautiful because they are open.  She is prejudiced against Darcy because he sleights her, he has contrived to separate Jane from Bingley, and is dislikeable, not because, for example, she is smugly superior to a likeable man.  Her discoveries of what a scoundrel Wickham is, and of Darcy's actions on behalf of her sister's honor, lead her (and the audience) to change judgment.    Today's audiences tend to dislike her narration (but the book was originally narrated, no?) and to impose a modern standard of sex appeal.  (However, if there's a woman out there like          Garvie's Elizabeth, I'd certainly like to meet her...before I'm 35.)    The other actors get into the meat of their parts, but I'll only recognize a few here.  Barbara Shelley is a warm and attractive Aunt Gardiner, the aunt you wish you had to warn you against evil.  Moray Watson is Mr. Bennet, a man of intelligence who suffers a wife-become-frivolous, and has a close bond with Elizabeth, despite being hemmed in by silly daughters.  Judy Parfitt is a pompous and caustic Lady de Bourgh ripe for shaking by Elizabeth at the end.  Sabina Franklyn (Jane) is beautiful and straightforward: though acquaintances of mine find her not voluptuous enough, I don't think that's a problem.                      The actress who plays Charlotte Lucas is plain, but not at all unhandsome and emphasizes the practicality of the character.    The thing about pre-circa-1985 BBC dramas is you can watch them and imagine grand settings around the basic integrity of the characters and plot, without having so many bucks and pounds poured in for eye candy, or to do the work of the imagination.  And that's what reading the book is about anyway, coming up with one's own pictures.    The 1995 series has strengths as entertainment.  Consider, however, that Jane Austen may have written a story for characters that are different from the ones that you see.  If you've already decided you prefer the 1995 series to the 1980 series, I probably won't convince you that the 1980 one is better.  Go ahead, clear your head of television, and let the book be your guide!
B0006284JQ|3.0|Isn't it too early for Britney Spears to have a greatest hits collection?  I guess once you have enough hits to fill a CD then you are entitled to one, and here she does.  This collections includes al the hits from \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to the Bobby Brown cover \\"My Prerogative,\\" which doesn't sound all that bad.  The play list is shrewdly not chronological, which would make the record sound tumultuous on hits.  Basically, now all you have to do is get this and never mind the other fluffers.  It is weird that the faux-conservative girl from Louisiana, who got famous singing \\"Sometimes\\" on a beach, would later release \\"Toxic.\\"  However, all of us caught ourselves humming to a Britney song before.  So succumb to the catchiness and admire it as kitsch.

To the reviewer who would like to see the 5-part Michael      Jayston and Sorcha Cusack \\"Jane Eyre\\" (1973) on DVD, I'll second that. The BBC hit a sweet spot in the 70s.  Any idea who owns the rights to distribute?  As the 1980 Pride and Prejudice went to DVD with stiff competition from the 1995 version, it doesn't seem impossible that Jayston/Cusack's \\"Jane Eyre\\" could go there too.
B0001O3YD0|1.0|This was possibly the worst movie I have ever rented for a dollar. The title should have been 'escape from the velociraptors'. oh, but wait. The raptors can fly too and have hammerheads?! On a desert planet? No way! Try very, very boring. copyright 2000? That's a shame. I'd rather watch 'The lathe of heaven' on dvd with a hot dog up my can for bad low budget sci-fi entertainment. Vin Diesel's worst movie ever.

B0002Z0EYA|4.0|This film is from the german director Wolfgang Petersen, the director of the great film The Boat.  This film isn't near to how good the another is, but it is still a good film.   <br />It is long, that's true, but it is entertaining enough and it does not feel too long. The battle scenes are maybe not the most entertainig ones, since the historical facts are a little limitating.  I would give three stars to this film, but its anti-belic message worths to me at last a whole star. They present battles in a very human way, not like in Gladiator and less like in Master and Commander.  The director respectfully mantains his anti-belic message.  Is something admirable in a film about a war, and specially in an american film. <br /> <br />Apart from that, the best of the movie is the development of Achilles' and Hector's characters, specially Hector's.  The work of both actors is very good also.  And the development of the relationships between Hector and Paris, between both brothers and their father, Hector and his wife, Aquilles and Briseis. <br /> <br />The weak parts are the development of the relationships between Achilles and Patroclus, and Paris and Helen.  Considering this last relationship is the one which produces the war, it is extremely little developed, both characters sharing little screen toghether.  One just don't belive Paris risks all he risks for her.  One don't see how they fall in love.   <br />And Achilles and Pathroclus, they share two scenes toghether.  This relation is very poorly developed too.  One don't understand that \\"the only man who can controle Achilles is Patroclus\\" as the film says.  Neither do one understands that Achilles is so upset because of what happens to Patroclus.  If they would have make him Achilles lover, it would have been more understandable.  Or, at last, they could have developed much more this relationship as they presented it.   <br /> <br />Anyway, it is a good film, I do recommend it.
0380789035|5.0|Some fantasies are impossible to classify, and are almost impossible to review.  \\"American Gods\\" is one of them.  Zelazny's \\"Lord of Light\\" is a story of a 'gods versus gods' war, and so is this book.  But in Gaiman's book, everyone is either a god, an unusually decent American, a serial killer disguised as a decent American, or a wife who returns from the dead.  The only gods who don't show up are Big J and his only begotten Son.  My favorite characters are the Egyptian deities who run a funeral home in Cairo---that's Illinois, not Egypt, even though one of them likes to snack off bits of organ meat from his customers.<br /><br />All the way through \\"American Gods\\" I kept asking myself, 'what could possibly be a happy ending for this book?'  All gods require believers and sacrifice in order to exist.  The gods we imported to America with us are hungry, cranky, and old.  The new gods (one is thinly disguised as Bill Gates) are afraid that their life-spans are going to be very short.  Who still believes in the railroad god?<br /><br />Gods die, the very old ones who lose all of their followers.  Why does Gaiman include their stories?  Well, it certainly lends to the dark atmospherics of his book.  I think he also wanted to show how these gods and their worshippers came to this land:  some as traders; some in chains; some as warriors and hunters.  Here, he says, here is how we ended up elbow-to-elbow with Odin and Ibis-headed gods, gods of the internet, and gods of the land.  No wonder Armageddon is inevitable.<br /><br />Or is it?  Can an ex-con named Shadow, his dead wife, and some of his very odd friends stave off the final confrontation?  Follow Gaiman to an eerie motel in the navel of America and celebrate (or mourn) the twilight of at least one god.  Follow him to San Francisco and witness the violent demise of the Queen of Sheba.  With this book, Gaiman has turned himself into the William Least Heat Moon of America's fantasy highways.
B000733JY4|4.0|This is some of Moore's earliest published work, but I've somehow missed it until now. The setting is Britain near the end of the 20th century (as seen from a grim, antidemocratic present when Margaret Thatcher was in power), a future in which a limited nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the Soviets has made much of the planet uninhabitable and a fascist takeover of Orwellian proportions has rid the UK of \\"undesirables.\\" One man, a survivor of medical experimentation in a concentration camp, is getting even with those who shot him full of drugs and hormones. This revenge-seeker, known only as \\"V,\\" is not a superhero but he's a lot more on top of things than his enemies. Sixteen-year-old Evey, who botches her first desperate attempt at prostitution, becomes a fixture in V's life, and finally his heir. The plot, though, is complex and subtle, much more dependent on the text than the art, with deeply developed characters and a good deal to say about the nature of freedom and making an excellent case for anarchy (which is not the same as chaos). It doesn't move as well as _Watchmen,_ but it's certainly worth a careful read.
B0000636UN|3.0|I have been a big fan of Sheryl Crow's for years.  I have to agree that The Globe Sessions is one of her best albums.  C'mon C'mon does have some decent tunes, but it is not her usual style.  Too \\"pop-ish\\".  I think \\"It's So Easy\\" (sung w/Don Henley) is one of best songs on the album, but the rest of the songs don't impress me as much as her previous albums.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I get this movie. I think it's hilarious. It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I will make it my mission to watch it every Sunday, right after Revenge of the Nerds, and right before Trading Places, my other two favorite comedies. 1) Do I care about MTV's endorsement of it, financial support, or whatever? No, I don't care. 2) Do I like this movie because my friends do? No, the majority of them haven't even seen it. 3) Do I like this movie to fit in or because I'm in search of some sort of hipster points or art-movie cred'? No, I'm 27 years old, and I've known all my life that a ton of things that are funny to me aren't funny to others. Besides, I find EVERYTHING funny, including many commercials, so I'm easily pleased, I guess.  I think the idea of a lion and a tiger merging to become one animal called a Liger is damn funny. 4) Do I care about whether this movie is an honest depiction of growing up in Idaho? No, but I could totally relate to the stereotypes portrayed in it. IN CONCLUSION: A lot of the criticism levelled at this movie on this site assumes that people spend their time heralding weird films because it's cool and somehow gains you status points. Get over yourselves. You're just frustrated with your inability to find this movie worthwhile. Oh well. Go watch something else.
B000053V7Q|5.0|This is the best Elvis movie yet, because it is real, about Elvis. It shows him exactly the way he was, humble, modest, funny, and a great performer.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|As the credits note at the end, this film is based on the Epic Story . What is probably most noteworthy about the film is that it is retold in a \\"modern\\" way, and is done to suit the milieu of here and now. That is what this kind of story is all about; it's not the exact story that counts, it is the essence of the story that counts. It helps if you include the translations of the classic lines, but people who are pedants for the textual original have to know that the feeling and the point of this story is one from a thoroughly oral tradition, so it is quite appropos that a version of this kind should appear. <br />Yes, it has lessons; yes it has points to make, but the greatness of films like this one, is that it is immensely  entertaining. <br />I was especially  impressed with Eric Bana... from Stand up comic, to playing Chopper Reid on film, Bana has been surprising in his ability to play diverse  roles. <br />Plus, the diverse characters who support the central leads are amazing. Peter O'toole is superb in this role. <br />In addition, the loss of the gods as a story telling  device says a lot about  the current society rather than the society of the time of TROY.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|I really liked this movie a lot for awhile.  It was really kind of unique for awhile there.  Then, when the ending turned out to be the ultimate CHEESY FORMULA PIECE OF GARBAGE, I nearly put my foot through the TV.  All of a sudden Tom Cruise is leaping onto moving subway trains after having been shot in the face.  Oh, and the hero saves the day at the last second and gets the girl.  Oh, and the hero also handcuffed a cop to a car wreck a little earlier, but nevermind I guess.  Gee, sure was lucky it was one of those cops with no hand-to-hand skills whatsoever, just so the hero could take him down with a move from professional fake wrestling.  That's OK, I hear a lot of cops are not totally on their guard after finding a dead body in the trunk.  Oh, and don't forget that Tom Cruise, after blasting about 15 heavily armed people with pinpoint accuracy in a crowded bar and escaping as neat as you please, he's unable to hit the hero from 2 feet away firing about 12 shots.  Oh, and... and theres a lot of other BS.  Do yourself a favor, rent Big Trouble in Little China... if you're going to rent cheese, you might as well get a few laughs.
B000679N96|4.0|I'll start this out by saying that this would be a five-star review if it had included \\"Killing An Arab,\\" but since that topic has been thoroughly exhausted, I'll move on. <br /> <br />The sound quality of this set is a marked improvement over the original releases, and it's nice to have remastered versions of the non-album singles \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train.\\" True, they were on the 2000 greatest hits album, but why not take advantage of another four years of remastering technology? As long as they didn't take up valuable real estate on the CD that could have been used for other tracks, then I see no harm done in presenting all of these songs in one place. <br /> <br />And yes, it's true that they included a few of the Easy Cure demos but not all of them, but it's not so odd given the nature of these expanded albums (to the reviewer below me, \\"See The Children\\" is a great one!). We have to face up to the fact that these deluxe editions walk a fine line between having to cater to the hardcore crowd that own the bootlegs as well as to the casual listener. I know it's unfathomable to those of us in the former crowd as to why the latter always slags albums for having \\"too many songs they don't know,\\" but such is the case. Some bands go ahead and release everything warts and all, some hold back. Robert is known to be notoriously picky so is it any wonder The Cure fall into the second category? <br /> <br />Besides, once you start putting on one or two tracks from known bootlegs, the die-hards always come out of the woodwork to complain about what's missing. The Kinks just put out a three-disc edition of their Village Green Preservation Society album that contained the mono and stereo versions of the released album, the alternate mixes from the scrapped album, the mono and stereo versions of all the singles, b-sides and rare tracks of the era. Do you know what most reviews revolve around? The fact that they left off two tracks from a bootleg that'sbeen available for years. Almost 60 songs and everyone complained about two missing ones that they already own. We live in an imperfect world and must sometimes roll with the punches. This set is well-balanced, though I'm sure we could have done with only two different versions of \\"10.15 Saturday Night.\\" <br /> <br />And to the same reviewer bemoaning the omission of \\"I'm A Cult Hero\\" and \\"I Dig You,\\" remember that those tracks were recorded after Matthieu Hartley was fired and with Simon Gallup on bass. They may have featured Porl Thompson on guitar (back for that one single from the Easy Cure days), but they were not Easy Cure songs. They were released after the Seventeen Seconds album, so don't give up hope on their future release either on the expanded editions of Seventeen Seconds or Faith. I'd put money on the former given the somber mood of the latter. <br /> <br />Still, in an atmosphere where even Disney is releasing their racier cartoons with disclaimers about the nature of their inception, The Cure should have included \\"Killing An Arab\\" on this set with the story behind it (based as it was on \\"The Stranger\\" by Albert Camus).
B00005JMYI|5.0|i love this movie, there were so many classic scenes and lines. (...)i wont give too much away but there were some classic lines and several celebrity cameos, definately one of will ferrells best.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|In the matrix, nothing is real. The pain you feel, should you encounter such sense, is all in your head. Being \\"the one,\\" neo should fully understand this. I mean, he did rise from the dead in the first film. Didn't he know this? <br /> <br />So why is it that he gets his ass handed to him time and time again, especially in \\"Revolutions.\\" To get to the point, \\"Reloaded\\" fails to adhere to the rules set in the first film. This review won't drone on like much of the dialogue in said film. I'll simply end with saying that this film is a truly awful addition to a movie that changed the face of science fiction. The filmmakers should have spent extra time working on a logically sound script before shooting their wad so fast.
B000001C6M|5.0|this is one of slayers better albums, i didnt particularly like SEASONS IN THE ABYSS because of Tom's mediocre vocals, though most of the songs would have been really good had he sounded more like he did on REIGN IN BLOOD. anyway, this cd sounds almost exactly like Metallica's debut KILL EM ALL. its got some good riffs, pretty good vocals and driving drum beats. Tom doesnt sound quite as death metal-ish on this, and the vocal production sounds kind of weird, but overall a great debut from Slayer
B00009TB5G|5.0|Including the extra scenes, this movie totals a hefty playing time 3 hours and 43 minutes.  Having seen the movie without the extra scenes, I can fully say that these extra scenes pull the movie together like you wouldn't expect.<br /><br />I absolutely guarantee that you will say to yourself: \\"I can't believe that scene was deleted!  That explains everything!\\"<br /><br />Get this movie over the non extended edition, you won't be disappointed.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|I got caught in the hype of a movie that I saw no previews of. I see why. The movie is slow, and since people tell you it's a comedy you feel obligated to laugh at the dull humor. It's like I spent the whole time, sitting an anticipating a laugh I would never get. It was so rediculous I began laughing at things to stay awake. I rented it for $.99 and I regret it. I couldn't even finish the movie, which is something that rarely happens. Save your money and your time.
0767805712|5.0|Welcome to Gattaca is a very good movie with very good actors (like Uma Thurman). The story is very nice and we want to know the end of the movie from the beginning. There are no special effects like the other science-fiction movies but it's nevertheless a very nice movie. You must have this movie ! <br />I think that it's the best science fiction movie of the year 1997.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Don't let the title mislead you, Collateral is an excellent movie. The acting is superb, and it is a very well thought out action movie. The only downside of the widescreen addition is that those annoying black bars cuts your actual viewing size in half, where as other widescreen movies give you three quarters of the screen. The special features are also repetitive. The movie doesn't have enough substance to watch more than once, so I recommend it as a good rental. Save your $15 and something else.
B000002UAU|3.0|I give this Beatles classic 3 STARS because I love 3 tracks on the album. The first track \\"SGT PEPPER\\" rocks. \\"Getting Better\\" has a helluva sound to it. \\"And A Day In The Life\\", IS THE MOST INSANE THING I ever heard.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I'm glad I rented this movie, and didn't buy it. It had it's moments, but it wasn't enough to make me watch the special features, let alone watch the movie twice. I have to say I was glad when the movie ended, so that I could watch something else. I rarely leave movies unfinished, but this was a very tedious movie. The visual and sound effects might have made it an excellent theatrical experience, but watching it on a 19\\" with stereo speakers left a lot to be desired.
0767834739|4.0|This film is good but overdone. It could've had a simpler plot and it would've been stronger. The monster baddie is cool and kinda reminds me of the leader of the orcs in Lord Of The Rings (THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING) This could've been a horror classic especially with the Laura Croft type female superheroes. Nevertheless, its worth watching...
1400032717|5.0|My fellow reviewers have done a fine job of giving you an idea of what this book is about. What I'm here to tell you is that people who have described Mark Haddon's masterpiece as a children's book are way, way off the mark (no pun intended). <br />Sure, children and anyone who has English as a second language will have a fairly easy time reading it as far as grammar and vocabulary are concerned - that's because of who the narrator is. However, make no mistake: this book is meant for all of us. <br />Highly reccomended.
B000002OX7|5.0|All I can say is this is an amazing album, the reviewer below me says it all. This album is up there with rocks greatest. GET IT!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|We all know how great the show is. Yada yada. So let's focus on the DVD specifics: <br />* commentary audio tracks are available only for a few episodes and they are hmmm... OK. The actors mostly say things like \\"your hair looks great\\" and \\"I look terrible in these clothes\\". The commentaries by the writers are slightly better. So... no soup for the commentaries. <br />* However... the commentaries in the subtitles are FANTASTIC. They are available for all episodes. Sometimes you have to pause to be able to read everything. It is the equivalent of a master degree in Seinfeldology. I had never seen this feature used in a DVD before and I hope this gets adopted as an industry standard with the same attention to detail. <br />* The documentaries are well worth the price of the DVD. <br />* The menus are well designed and fun. <br />* Deleted scenes and blooper reels are good and plentiful. <br />* All in all, it is clear that a lot of effort and attention was put into this product. Congratulation to the studio for not just trying to resell us the episodes but instead adding enough information to make the entire Seinfeld experience fresh and interesting all over again.
B0002CHIJW|4.0|This film should inspire all who have been victimized in this world.  Of course I am joking.  At last a film with absolutely no redeeming qualities to it.  This is a revenge film.   It is graphically violent and is quite sadistic.  Don't expect to see any high budget gore.  This is a true brutally violent movie.  After a woman is gang raped by several men, she decides to take the law into her own hands and deal out her revenge.  The rape scene is long and drawn out and is quite brutal.  Rarely do movie rape scenes get this brutal.  It actually gives a sense of reality in its brutality that is rare in film.  Real rape is extremely violent and this film does nothing to cover it up.  Not that that's a redeeming quality.  There is nothing to like about this film unless your sick but that is why its actually good.  There is no feeling sorry when she enacts her revenge on these men.  There is absolutely no warmth in this film. No heros.  This film is completely cold from beginning to end.  The bath tub scene is the highlight of the film.  Before Miss Bobbet there was I Spit on Your Grave.  Its not one of the most entertaining films.  Don't expect to be entertained.  Expect to be left with an empty feeling after watching this one.
B00004W55E|5.0|Rachelle Ferrell continues to mesmorize.  Her voice is amazing, her lyrics have depth, and her spirit is boundless.  She has truly put out another great album.  I have every one, and try my best to see her each time she performs in the Atlanta area!  I just wish that the masses would lift her to the level she deserves.  My only complaint is that she makes us wait TOO LONG!  I can hardly wait for the next project.  I expect the best!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Yeah, Take Me Out rocks.  As do all tracks on this self-titled debut.  That being said, all of the songs invoke a devestatingly diverse range of musical range...which is truly singular in today's mundane \\"alternative rock\\" world.<br /><br />Matinee, Darts of Pleasure, & Tell Her Tonight come to mind as my fav stand out tracks.  Not unlike The Killers  debut CD, it's a sublime guilty pleasure effort that can't help but put you in a good mood.
B000001FOS|5.0|I was estatic when I hear Joe Lyn Turner and Yngwie were hooking up. My favorite singer and my favorite guitarist. The album is a milestone, and to me, exactly what I had hoped for from Yngwie, though with some flaws. It's on this album where the songs ruled, and the solos accentuated. I just love the dreamy atmosphere of the album. Especially songs like \\"How Long,\\" \\"Dreamin\\"  and \\"Deja Vu.\\" \\"Now it the Time\\" turns into a fun, pop song. Krakatoa is a jam. But \\"Crystal Ball\\" was the overlooked hit of the80's. A bluesy, beautiful song with beautiful vocals and one of the best melodies ever. Actually, Yngwie's guitar on this record seems a little too raw. I think it had to do with his accident that injured his hand. But still, I wish Yngwie had stayed in this mode. His guitar work gets more polished as the years go on, but his \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" direction of his music doesn't appeal to me as much. Still, he's the greatest, and I enjoy most all his albums. An absolute wonder on the guitar.
B00005JN2Z|1.0|This is a real sleeper. Literally. One of the worst \\"hitman\\" type flicks ever created. One of the worst movies of the year, and probably the worst flick Kidman's ex ever made.<br /><br />It's no wonder it came and went in a week in the local cinemas. Pick up \\"The Replacement Killers\\" or \\"The Big Hit\\" - even \\"Grosse Point Blank\\" (or all three!), but don't get this bomb. Save the money.

B00005JKN9|4.0|Martin Scorsese's film about the struggle for supremacy between Native white American and Irish immigrant gangs at the 19th-century New York slum district of Five Points give an authentic, fascinating but at times bleary, even oddly (for Scorsese) \\"Hollywoodish\\" feel to this big-budget project.  The costumes and sets (the latter built in Italy) are mightily impressive, and some of the period details make for riveting viewing.  The film starts with Irish American Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) as a boy, witnessing the killing of his father by Bill the Butcher (Day Lewis).  The story gains momentum with him making his way back as an adult to take revenge on Bill the Butcher incognito, who is oblivious of his identity.  Scorsese takes some liberty with history and changes the name of \\"Bill the Butcher\\" to William Cutting.  The real Bill the Butcher never lived in Five Points nor ever could (Five Points was reserved for immigrants), nor did he die in 1862.      Daniel Day Lewis's acting is inspired, and DiCaprio and Diaz both act well enough to acquaint themselves beside him.  However, it is doubtless that it's Day Lewis's portrayal of the bigoted, dandyish \\"Bill the Butcher\\" which holds the day.  Scorsese's ambitious script starts like a familiar revenge story, but gradually interweaves history as it delves into the milieu and feel of the 19th-century lower-class New York, from the amateur fire departments to \\"Boss\\" Tweed to the climactic showdown between the two in the amidst the New York Draft Riots of 1863, making an entrancing parallel viewing about a forgotten segment of New Yorkian life.  With a fairly predictable storyline, Scorsese's eye for detail is mostly unerring, always bringing our attention back to period concerns and preoccupations.  The cinematography is outstanding.  In the final analysis, Gangs of New York may not be Scorsese's best, but for the money it's still a colorful, visually lauable effort at depicting the seamy underbelly of one city with its social rivalries and political tensions.
B00028HBL6|5.0|Gripping. Visual. Important. The Passion of The Christ made the crucifiction of Christ and what He did for all of us seem more real. I felt like I was there 2000 years ago when it happened and it really brought home how much Jesus suffered for my sins. Jesus went kicking and screaming? I don't think so! Jesus did not want this because He knew He was going to suffer, but He also knew that this needed to be done to save all of us in the world who cannot control themselves enough to get through one hour without sinning. There was no other way. No one could have made Christ do this. He had legions of angels at His disposal; He truely laid down his life because He knew it was the only way to reconsile us to the Father. He is my Savior and I cannot stand for anyone to belittle what He did. He died for you. It is up to you whether or not you choose to accept that.

6303614493|3.0|I just rented this tape to watch with my kids, and found myself grateful that they tend to talk through movies. The language is not appropriate for a children's movie - and some of the profanity is not subtle (e.g. a ghost loudly proclaiming that \\"the b--ch is back\\"). <br /> <br />Eric Idle is a nice touch, some of the interactions between father and daughter are well-done, _but_ the evil character is drawn with absolutely no subtlety, the screams of ghost-spotters become tedious, and the aggression and (implied) violent deaths are not appropriate for small children. <br /> <br />I suspect many of my objections are the filmmakers' attempt to \\"spice up\\" the movie for a teen audience, but they certainly remove a large pool of potential viewers; I wouldn't expose a child less than about 10 to the language (by then they'll have heard it from their classmates, and parents will have had a chance to train them not to use it). <br /> <br />Hate to sound like a prig (I always swore I would be a \\"cool\\" mom) - BUT, kids can be sharp-eared little parrots, and I don't feel like having MY kids call me a b--ch any earlier than they likely will (around 12, I suspect).
B00008H2LB|2.0|Take the following lyrics into consideration:<br /><br />\\"Just give me myself back\\"<br /><br />\\"Let me take back my life... the very worst part of you is me\\"<br /><br />\\"And now you've become a part of me... I've let myself become you\\"<br /><br />\\"All I want to do is be more like me and be less like you\\"<br /><br />Notice how they're all basically saying the same thing? Think the're all from the same song? Well, they're not. Each of them is from a completely different song on Meteora. This theme of wanting to be more individualistic dominates the vast majority of the songs on Meteora, which is extremely ironic, because LP now sounds less like themselves and more like Korn and Limp Bizkit than ever before. On Hybrid Theory, nearly every song was good in some way. Sadly, the same cannot be said of Meteora. I feel like Linkin Park, once the only living proof that rap/rock could be good, has lost what made it unique and is now trying to be more like other rap/rock bands, all of whom suck very badly. Most of the songs here, including the album's first single, sound like the notes were picked at random out of a hat, and are insults to Linkin Park. However, there are some exceptions:<br /><br />Easier to Run - Most songs have boring verses and a rockin' chorus. This is one of many LP songs that works the other way around; the verses (\\"If I could stand up and take the blame I would, if I could take all my shame to the grave...\\") are extraordinary enough to more than make up for the crappy chorus.<br /><br />Breaking the Habit - Listening to the tracks in numerical order, this is the first song that is truly good and different from the rest. I have to wonder if this is a coincidence, given the song's title.<br /><br />From the Inside - Not the best on the album, but solid, with the singing and rapping truly blended instead of alternated. Could have used a little polishing and a totally different refrain.<br /><br />Session - Without lyrics or heavy industrial grinding, this has only the beat going for it - and it is a good one, about on par with Cure for the Itch.<br /><br />Numb - A rocking, epic, emotional powerhouse of a song. Should have been the first single; instead, it became the third, accompanied by a music video that joins Crawling as the only two LP music videos that are as good as the songs behind them.industrial grinding, this has only the beat going for it - and it is a good one, about on par with Cure for the Itch.  <br /> <br />Numb - A rocking, epic, emotional powerhouse of a song.

B0006A9FMI|3.0|It pains me to give this DVD 3 stars, because the movie just might be the most amazing anime of all time.  However, the DVD is just awful and certainly warrants the reduction in its rating.  First off, there is no English dub.  This is normally no huge problem for me, since I tend to watch anime in Japanese with English subtitles.  However, the subtitles on this DVD, as others have pointed out in their reviews, seem to be closed captioning subtitles.  They include stuff like \\"[Sound of gunshots]\\" which really distracts from the movie.  I'm baffled as to why they chose to do this.  It's simply ridiculous.  That being said, if you're a Ghost in the Shell fan, you need to see this DVD regardless of its crap quality.  The movie itself is nothing less than brilliant.
B00005JMYI|4.0|This movie was great, it was weird, but very funny! A must for Will Ferrell fans. A+++ <br />
B00005JMXX|1.0|Wow.  I just don't know where to start with this one.  One of the worst movies of all time?  Perhaps.  You know that feeling when you know the movie your watching is so bad you should just cut your losses and stop in the middle, but instead make the unfortunate mistake of continuing till the end?  Well, if not, this movie is for you.  I have not been so dissappointed since Godsend, which I also felt cheated after watching.  Please, I beg of you, spare yourself and turn back now!  The plot is beyond pitiful, the special-effects (which are the main reason I gave this movie a go) are so in-your-face fake that they are rendered silly, and the acting is simply atrocious.  (...) if I didn't suspect he already has been.  The biggest problem here is the lack of human touch.  By that I mean the characters in the movie seem more like robots than humans.  In the wake of the biggest tradgedy in human history, we seem to see no hints of anyone coping with trauma, panic, or grief.  Instead, everyone appear to be calm and collected, going about business as usual as the world as they know it comes crashing down around them.  It really is quite insulting to anyone who has experienced a tradgedy in their lives.  I'm not sure if its the horrible writing or acting at fault here, but I suspect its a combination of the two.  Not only that, but we never ever see any one of what would have been millions upon millions of dead bodies.  Apparently, its entertaining to fake kill millions of innocent people as long as we never actually see any of the corpses.  Sickening.  Im so fed up of big-budget hollywood movie makers taking important scientific theories and completly butchering them into nothing more than another vehicle for the painfully over-used \\"tradgedy cause father to reunite with son\\" story.  This trite trivilization of such a horrible disaster is really sickening, especially in the wake of the recent catastrophies in lower asia.  I suppose if you want a shallow and unrealistic lookat a horrible disaster, without any regard to realism, thought, or emotion, this may be your cup of tea.  But if you have any respect for good movies or the scientific concepts \\"dealt\\" with here, I implore you to stay away from this pathetic excuse for a movie.  Absolutly disgraceful.
B00004VVND|1.0|Westworld is one of the most boring films I've ever seen.  Can anyone explain how someone without any directorial experience got chosen to shoot this low-budget film?  The story is totally stupid and completely lacks novelty even for the 1970s era, and the acting is so laughable -- probably everyone on the set was high on drugs or something.  This is one of the most boring films ever made, and Yul's performance really does not do his name justice: just stare, shoot, and walk.  Westworld sux big time!  The sequel Futureworld actually has a better story but is equally poorly produced.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Since so many celebrities feel the need to share their poorly informed pacifistic views with the rest of the world, I thought it was about bloody time some celebs used their powers for the opposite purpose. Though most seem to see this movie as lampooning both the doves and hawks, I thought it was pretty clear that Matt and Trey very much supported the war on terrorism. From their description of pre-war Iraq to the speech at the end, they make it clear that yes, the war could have been handled better, and no, Iraq isn't a flowering paradise now that we've stepped in, but overall we're still the good guys and Iraq is still better off now than it was before. And amidst all this highbrow political humor, there's a generous serving of slapstick and bathroom humor to balance things out. At some points, I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes. And, of course, there's the ruthless mockery of action movies, which probably made Jerry Bruckheimer cry. I do have to take off a star, though, because many scenes feel as if they were simply copies, rather than parodies, of bad action movies.<br /><br />Highbrow, lowbrow, it's all good.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Still the Daredevil I read in Marvel Comics wouldn't leave someone to die in front of a subway train, but the Director's Cut of this movie is a much better movied than the theatrical version. <br /> <br />As more and more comic book movies come to the theatre, there seems to be more investments made in actually making decent films from them.  Daredevil was a good theatrical film, and the director's cut is in better.  That you can pick it up for $14.99 (at this date) is well worth it. <br /> <br />The 30 minutes of extra footage develops a relationship between Matt Murdoch and Foggy Nelson, and it develops the character of Foggy Nelson; and every superhero is only truly as great as the man or woman under the mask.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I haven't seen this DVD yet because as of the time I wrote this review it wasn't out yet, but I know the extras include an audio commentary with writer/director Richard Kelly and Kevin Smith, a production diary of the film with optional commentary by director of photography Steven Poster, a storyboard-to-screen featurettes, They Made Me Do It Too - The Cult of Donnie Darko featurettes, and #1 Fan: A Darkomentary.<br /><br />However, I have seen the actually movie when it was in theaters and I own the DVD of Donnie Darko. Some people don't think the Director's Cut adds much, but I think it adds a whole lot. It's a lot easier to understand than the original cut and it flows so much better with most of the deleted scenes from the Donnie Darko DVD included plus splices of the Philosophy of Time Travel and a few changed songs.<br /><br />For those of you who know nothing about this movie I can't tell you anything about it =P It's a movie that you can't summarize other than saying that it's deep and awesome. It starts out with a boy being saved from an airplane engine falling into his room and killing him by a 6 foot tall bunny rabbit named \\"Frank\\" who tells him that the world will end in 28 days. See? It sounds hokey, but trust me, it's not. The cast is impressive with Patrick Swayze, Jake Gyllenhall, James Duval, and Mary McDonnell. It's written and directed by newcomer Richard Kelly, who has also written the upcoming film Domino.<br /><br />The dialogue in this film is smart and intriguing. The acting is spot-on, and you can't even tell that it was made low-budget. The Director's Cut gives you more of a feeling that every single scene matters, and it does. It has these beautiful scenes that were cut for the sake of having it under 2 hrs, but they add so much to the overall feeling of the plot including information about Donnie's medication, a scene about Watership Down, and some other scenes I'm not at liberty to spoil. If you're trying to figure out which one you should get, get this one! Some people argue that they don't like how he changed the songs, but it's his vision and he put in the songs that he couldn't afford to put in before, it really doesn't change the plot.u should get, get this one!

B000268QB2|5.0|There have been a lot of new British bands coming out within the last few years, including Travis, Coldplay, Snow Patrol and Keane, to name a few. I never really bought the first three on that list and while I think they are all very good bands, none struck me as doing something truly meaningful. <br />The first time I heard Keane, I must say, I felt that way too. Then I bought the album for my girlfriend because I knew she liked a song or two that had been released here in Britain.  <br /> <br />Within days I had totally backtracked my view, and I fully believe Keane to be the best new British band of the last 8 or so years. Coldplay are all a bit melodramatic for me, Snow Patrol a little inconsistent, Travis a little too clean and Radiohead a little too far up their own arses. <br /> <br />Keane don't look nearly as good as they sound, and perhaps that had put me off before I had heard their music... truth is, they look like Coldplay and all those other bands... typical English middle class schoolboy types. But y'know, their music (if you sit back and let it) seeps into your unconscious and once this has happened you find a passion growing for this band, a passion that makes you smile when you heard one of their truly moving songs off this awesome debut. I find myself musing about their virtues when others would prefer to group them with all those other British bands. Perhaps it's unfair to group all those British bands together in the first place (something I am inherently guilty of). <br />I urge anyone to listen to this if you love music at all... this blows 90% of the rock music coming out of America (and Britain) out of the water. You'll find the vocals will start to feel more grandiose, more epic and more emotional after a few listens. Then you'll heard little eccentricities in the music... and then you'll remember that all this noise was created with only a piano and drums (and possibly a few other thing in the studio). If you see them live though, you'll be amazed that they can pull this music off so convincingly with just the drums, piano and vocals... it's something of a miracle, and Keane, who in my eyes are lining up for \\"Britains' best band\\" title, succeed on every level.
B00005JN0T|4.0|The title of my review contains the three laws required to make an entertaining Sci-fi adventure film.  A film with this exact formula that immediately leaps to mind is \\"Total Recall.\\"  As with that film the action sequences in \\"I, Robot\\" are thoughtfully produced and numerous, the special effects are excellent and extensive, and the one-liners are frequent and humerous.  Will Smith has obviously been hitting the weight room in perperation for his new Action Hero status, and his charming demeanor is still present throughout.  While there are scenes that are ridiculously violent to the point where any mere human could not simply stagger away through the aftermath of destruction, a severe concussion being the least of his injuries, this is Science Fiction, after all.  I have to admit that I went in expecting this movie to be average, at best.  I've read many reviews, both here and from professional critics, panning this film as a grandiose bomb.  I disagree.  This is an entertaining film with a flashy production value and an altogether charismatic leading man.  The fact that this film was directed by Alex Proyas (\\"The Crow\\" and \\"Dark City\\") never entered into my decision to watch it.  However, I enjoyed \\"The Crow,\\" and \\"Dark City\\" is easily one of the most underrated Science Fiction films of all time.  It wasn't until the ending credits were unveiled did I know he had directed this film, as well.  Had I known I never would have hesitated to see it.  Remember the three laws: action, special effects, and one-liners.  All are necessary in creating an entertaining Science Fiction film; and all are present here.  Recommended.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The Movies:<br /><br />Being a geek it's hard to imagine any greater super-hybrid of all facets of geek culture. Music, films, videogames, cyberpunk philosophy, comics, and anime are all inspiration for and the parts that make up this world we know as The Matrix. Personally I think the concept as a whole fell flat of what I hoped it could be, but you must admit, from any standpoint therein these films are a triumph though perhaps not a masterpiece.<br /><br />When the first movie came out I was a senior in high school and was really only beginning to explore different film styles and music and whatnot on my own. To be able to point to one set of ideas and say \\"hey, yeah, thats sort of what I was thinking\\" is a very cool thing. The first movie is, was, and will continue to be a classic in every sense of the word. Period. Love it or hate it it's now a part of our culture, and not without good reason.<br /><br />As for Reloaded and Revolutions, well...ok they're good movies. Both are actually bordering on great movies given the aspects of them, but neither of them seem to gel into the subversive cultural juggernaut that the original one. Maybe its because of the amount of time between Matrix and Reloaded, or maybe its that they never planned and mapped out a trilogy and therefore suffer from sequelitis. Nonetheless, back to back they are some intense and moving films if not quite what they could/should/would have been.<br /><br />The animatrix is the thread that ties (or attempts to) all the ideas together and really works as an introduction for newbies to the movies, re-introduction for those that saw the first in the theaters so long ago, and to fill in the blanks between them all. Especially Flight of the Osiris and Kid's Story which actually have a huge bearing on the second and third films.<br /><br />The Box Set:<br /><br />10 discs? Really? At first it seemed ludicrous and the height of hubris. 3 movies, 10 discs...well then I thought the Extended Editions of LOTR add up to 12 so thats not actually too bad. If you bought all the movies individually stop reading now. There's no point in buying this set unless you are TRULY hardcore and need the handful of new goodies injected in this bundle of shovelware. For those like me, who waited to buy any of the DVDs until a set like this came out, HUZZAH! 3 very good movies, the Animatrix, and a $#*& ton of extras for 50 or 60 bucks? What's not to like?<br /><br />And the box is oh so pretty, is it not? This set goes along with the LOTR and Star Wars box sets for most essential in my book, though still I'll likely watch Matrix and Animatrix more than anything else.

0671027344|5.0|This book was impossible to put down, in fact I read it front to back in one sitting. It's only flaw is it's length - too short! The characters were beautifully real and likeable. I also enjoyed the story thoroughly.  <br />Basically, this is a classic coming of age story about Charlie, a freshman in high school with little to no social skills who, upon his English teacher's suggestion begins participating in life. He soon makes friends and is introduced to a world of sex, drugs, homosexuality, and his own personal struggle which he is unconventionally open to. A very good read - one you could pick up and start over at any time. I loved it.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Will Smith is easily the most charismatic man in Hollywood today. Everyone loves him. If we were going to have one celebrity run for President, he would be the best choice. I mean, Will Smith is the guy. He has shined through in so many big-budget block-busters in the past, it almost seems like he can make anything work. It's just too bad that up until now, he has been trapped in sequel Hell (\\"Bad Movie Boys 2\\" and \\"Men In Bad Movies 2\\" are ones that come to mind). \\"I, Robot,\\" however, is a nice return to fresh form for Smith. It embraces all of the cliches that we've seen in other sci-fi/action movies, but makes it all seem so new and exciting. Smith plays Detective Spooner, caught in the year 2035 where robots and humans live in perfect harmony. The robots serve as servants to the human beings. Seemingly loyal, no one can find a kink in these magnificent machines -- which by the way, are gloriously designed, nice to see something besides \\"Terminator\\" clones -- except for, of course, you guessed it, Spooner. He is overly paranoid of these robots, and when the inventor of them is splattered all over the lobby of USR (if you can't guess what it stands for, stop reading) headquarters, Spooner instantly suspects a shady, \\"unique\\" robot by the name of Sonny of committing murder. The catch here is that according to the three robot laws, a robot basically cannot harm a human being. And thus, the set-up. The movie moves at a breakneck speed and it's really tough to tell what's coming up next. The action scenes are stunning, as the pace never really lets up. This is one of the few movies in it's genre that keeps the audience guessing. Will Smith is great in his role, and definitely pulls out all the stops with the character. It's nice to see him in such a well-made movie again. Reminds me of the glory days of the first \\"Men In Black\\" and \\"Independence Day,\\" movies that defined popcorn entertainment. Again, a lot of the movie has been done to death in other films, but this does well enough with the material that all is forgiven. The only real flaw I can find is that some key plot-points are difficult to catch, and unless you're watching it at home, where you can rewind, you're likely to get left in the dust. But overall, it's a great movie, with a timeless theme that I think everyone watching can appreciate. It's not the biggest brain-teaser or the most original movie, but it definitely satisfies anyone hungry for some good solid entertainment.oes well enough with the material that all is forgiven.

158799190X|1.0|This book could be summarised into about 5 pages.  In fact, the author did so (in 2 pages), in an article published for \\"The Daily Reckoning\\".  I learned very little more from the book than was in that article.  The rest is mostly tangents and filler (sometimes interesting, but not what I bought the book for).
B0000VD04M|5.0|I finally got around to seeing this movie recently and found it quite remarkable. Perhaps Tim Burton's most conventional movie ever, this biopic explores the life of B-movie director Ed Wood, who, according to conventional wisdom, is the worst filmmaker ever. An oddball prone to dressing in womens' clothing, Wood is fertile ground for the always-interesting Johnny Depp, who endows his character with great enthusiasm and likeability in spite of his eccentricity. Depp's, though, is only one of many stellar performances: Martin Landau, of course, as Dracula star Bela Lugosi; not to mention Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, and many more. Landau won a deserved Oscar for his effort as the pathetic one-time star, which is alternatingly funny and poignant. The scene where he \\"fights\\" the octopus has got to be one of the most riotous ever filmed. One also senses cutting satire behind the story: when Landau's character enters rehab, he remarks that he is the first celebrity to do so, and his comment about there being no such thing as bad press is especially meaningful when a hotel heiress becomes famous for taped romantic escapades. Also, the movie evokes a time when even bad films were made by passionate filmmakers, instead of in corporate boardrooms. Burton keeps the material interesting and resists the urge to go over the top, and the result is the perfect biopic.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Movie: **1/2  DVD Quality: *****  DVD Extras: ***<br /><br />Stripped down to its bare bones, \\"Swordfish\\" is simply another caper/heist movie in which an ex-con trying to go straight (Hugh Jackman) is pressured into doing a job for a powerful underworld figure (John Travolta) and finds himself enmeshed in double-dealing and intrigue.  You've seen variations on this plot dozens of times before, in movies that are sometimes better and often worse than this one.  The specific problem with \\"Swordfish\\" is that the filmmakers knew they had nothing special going on in terms of the script, and so they decided to throw in some special effects (involving first a massive explosion and later a airborne bus) that \\"hadn't been done before\\" ... at least, that's how the filmmakers themselves explain it in the \\"Making of\\" documentary included on the DVD!  And sure enough, these contrivances end up making the movie seem, well ... contrived.  Certainly the effects detract from the actors, which is a shame because Jackman and leading lady Halle Berry (both of whom bare their very attractive chests) actually give strong performances, as does Don Cheadle in a throwaway supporting role.  These three come off much better than does top-billed John Travolta, who here looks very puffy and turns in a rather hammy performance as the suave criminal mastermind.<br /><br />Technically, the DVD is actually superb in terms of video and audio quality.  The DVD extras, which would normally be a welcome bonus, in this case detract from the enjoyment of the film because, as noted earlier, the filmmakers tend to reveal a little bit more than they intended to about the film's structural weaknesses.  \\"Swordfish\\" is one of those movies that is best enjoyed if you don't analyze it too much afterwards.
B00005JMXX|3.0|\\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" the surprisingly successful disaster flick from director Roland Emmerich, serves as pretty much mindless entertainment. I mean, there are so many points in this movie where you have to wonder if they lost pages in the script, or if the writers have actually experienced the mildest winter at all. But then again, I think it's safe to say that any movie that comes out between May and August is meant strictly for entertainment. And in that way, this movie works. It's a story about global warming. You see, the pollution our Earth is subjected to is creating a greenhouse effect, melting the polar ice caps, which in turns floods the closest land -- of which New York seems to be the primary victim, with Canada being wiped out completely (?) -- where the water level reaches unimaginable heights, and, (in)conveiniently freezes, creating a new ice age. The movie centers around a father and son who are in totally different places at the time of disaster. The son (I forget names in this movie), played by \\"Spider-man\\" understudy Jake Gyllenhaal, is trapped in a New York City library with some of his friends and a crowd of lucky people who are waiting out the storm. His father, played by Dennis Quaid, the scientist who saw it all coming, and thus, is filling in for Jeff Goldblum, heads to New York with two of his headstrong buddies to save his son. There are a few little subplots thrown in between, but they are so half-hearted and under-developed that they have no meaning. They could have easily trimmed 30 minutes off of this movie and received the same effect. The characters are downright dumb, with a hobo and his dog being the intellectual standouts. But then again, we didn't come here to see good acting, did we? Nope. The special effects and the action sequences are where the money's at, and this movie makes good on it's promise. All of the special effects are accomplished well, even if they play out better on the big screen. This is definitely a good movie to show off your new system with. Even if there are some parts that are impossible to believe, such as when Quaid and Co. are travelling through the storm, they obviously can't see the road or where they're going, or anything for that matter, but don't crash (for a while anyways). In real life, they would have made it about 500 yards before landing in a ditch or getting stuck in the snow, or worse, taking a wrong turn into the woods. But anyways, it's still a fun movie, with some shades of political satire -- The President is dumb and useless (and dies very easily), while the Vice President is still dumb, but obviously the man in charge. One of the few minor plots that actually works. Overall, it's an entertaining little romp, if you just detach your brain. If you liked \\"Independence Day,\\" or God forbid, \\"Godzilla\\" (I actually did), this one will be right up your alley. Just don't take it too seriously.movie to show off your new system with.

0064409422|5.0|C.S. Lewis' \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". I remember in fifth grade at school, this was a book that everyone read at some point. Even if they didn't particularly like reading, they liked this. That definitely says something about this classic childrens fantasy. <br /> <br />It's the midst World War II, and children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (brothers and sisters, the four of them) are sent to a country house until the air raids pass. It's a big house, with many rooms and draughty corridors to explore. It is while exploring that Lucy discovers a wardrobe, a very special wardrobe. Inside she finds another world, Narnia, a world full of talking animals, fauns, giants. Sadly, it is always winter and never Christmas, thanks to the White Witch Jadis, Queen of Narnia. But there is hope for Narnia, for the arrival of humans fufils a prophecy. Soon Aslan the lion, Narnia's savior, will return, and the White Witch will be queen of now more. The White Witch knows this, and has a trick and a traitor up her sleeve... <br /> <br />Scattered throughout the book are charming illustrations. When I was a kid, I thought these were great. They were like a little reward for reading through. They fit the story like a glove and evoke the era they were written in well. In this collector's edition, all of these pictures are coloured in, which I would have enjoyed all the more if this had come out when I was younger. As for the colours? Well, everything is the colour I suspected it was, more or less. <br /> <br />The writing style is great. C.S Lewis' narration comes across as a grandfather telling a story to his grandchild - warm, friendly, and explaining anything that he feels you might not understand. Even though the book is rather thin, you get a real feel for Narnia and its creatures, and the joys, the dangers and triumphs its inhabitants experience. <br /> <br />C.S Lewis was a devoted christian, and his beliefs shine through in this book, through the whole of the chronicles of Narnia in fact. The story can be taken as allegory. There are many parallels between Aslan and Jesus. Both are saviors of their worlds, both are killed and raised again for the sake of anothers sin. The White Witch with her addictive turkish delight is like the temptations of this world, which can lead unsuspecting people astray. Always an accomplishment to have a book that works well on a couple of levels. <br /> <br />Though \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" isn't the first chronologically (and is numbered 2 in the \\"reading order\\"), whenever I read the chronicles of Narnia, I always read it first, rather than \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (\\"#1\\" in the series). \\"The Lion\\" was written first, and reading it first you get that sense of wonder, that anything can happen. If you read it second, then you know who everyone is, you know the world, and \\"The Lion\\" doesn't have as many surprises in my opinion. Reading \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" later, as a belated prequel and series of explanations (which it was originally), rather than an official beginning, I enjoyed it a lot more.  <br /> <br />A great fantasy, a great book for kids, and a fair allegory.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|For those who bought the Strokes' first album \\"Is This It\\" and enjoyed it, \\"Room on Fire\\" is a perfect sophomore follow-up. For those that aren't as familiar with the band, their musical imspriations range from Velvet Underground to Guns N Roses (see \\"End has no End\\"). Most of their songs are catchy riffs with great lyrics (often sarcastic, humorous, or story-telling), while some are explode at you and others gently rock you. Songs to check out are 'Reptilia' - driving with lots of energy, 'Under Control' - a slower song, with my favorite line: \\"We were young, darling, for now but not for long...\\"), and 'I Can't Win' - gets better as it goes, with another great line: \\"Some nights come up empty-handed, yes I'll take that...\\" <br /> <br />Overall the Strokes have two great albums, which I highly recommend. The riffs are catchy and the lyrics are great. If you can catch them performing live, they're even better (the energy just grows during the show).
B00005JKL8|4.0|If you're about as sharp as a bowling ball this movie will probably make you want to join the US armed forces. That's also exactly why this movie is so fun.  It wasn't even really a 'war' movie, in a sense, but more like an MTV video that happened to have soldiers, pilots, jets, tanks, etc.   <br />  The plot is not very deep, but there are some good things under the surface, such as the main character's struggle to find a path, in more ways than one, including personal.   <br />  The scenery in this movie is really great, and so is the sound design.  Some of the extra features include different footage with different music, so it has a slightly different feel.  I think stuff like that is great.  The acting is good, too, if at times a hint shallow.   <br />  If you don't take this too seriously, which you're not supposed to, you will really enjoy rooting for the good guys in this movie.  Have fun.

B00012QM8G|5.0|As someone who is not European or Jewish, I will leave comments and criticisms about certain facts or depictions in this movie for someone who \\"knows the territory\\" better. As an involved movie-watcher, though, there can be no doubt about the picture itself: Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST is, and perhaps always will be, a remarkable testament to a brave man, one who found it in his heart to take all the money he had made during WWII and use it to try to save hundreds of Jews from mass extinction at the hands of the evil Nazis.    You wouldn't know that Oskar Schindler would become such a revered man in history the way he is in the early stages of the war. He is rich, he is a womanizer, and he is only concerned with making money. That's why he sets up his munitions factory in the first place: to make money for himself, to profit from the war. It is only later, when the Jews who work for him are to be sent to Auschwitz, does he do something truly selfless and heroic: he uses his charm and knack for bribery to try to save the Jews who had worked for him from inevitable extermination. One of Spielberg's great achievements in SCHINDLER'S LIST is not necessarily that he sticks with Schindler and shows him going through his change of heart---in fact, his change of heart is comparably sudden, as depicted in this film---but that he does it so subtly. Schindler sees and hears terrible things, but Spielberg and screenwriter Steve Zaillian (adapting from a book by Thomas Keneally) never try to beat it into our heads or over-sentimentalize things (as Spielberg is wont to do in some of his movies) with extraneous voiceovers or any such cheap devices. Spielberg trusts the material, as well as his lead actor, Liam Neeson, to basically tell itself, to make its properly sobering effect on the viewer without the need for slobbering hysterics.     In fact, I am tempted to say that SCHINDLER'S LIST is not necessarily just about Schindler himself. Schindler's story is typical \\"triumph-of-the-human-spirit\\" stuff; what makes this movie special is that Spielberg is attempting to honestly portray the experience of being a Jew in the hell that was the Holocaust---how friends can turn on other friends all in the name of survival, how neighbors can suddenly become enemies, how people can lose their sanity and become heartless murderers...and even how one man can rise above the madness and do a heroic deed, as Schindler did. In trying to encompass as much as possible of the Jewish experience during this terrible time in history, Spielberg has created a film that is probably one of the most complete, all-embracing portraits of the effect on personal lives of the Holocaust that I've seen or read (although I don't claim to be an expert on the subject, by any means).    That, and it is as invigoratingly dramatic a movie as you could want from one that runs for a little over 3 hrs. Spielberg retains some of his instincts as an entertainer, and he also has the brilliant editor Michael Kahn on hand to make sure that this movie is always paced judiciously---this movie never drags. And he coaxes a great, charismatic, authoritative performance out of Neeson, one that helps you realize how he was able to get his way during the war (and why many women probably found him attractive, hehe). Ben Kingsley is no less impressive as his loyal accountant Itzhak Stern. And Ralph Fiennes, as the evil Nazi Amon Goeth, gives a surprisingly fascinating performance; Fiennes never downplays his character's baseness, but neither does he overdo it either---there's always something convincingly human (if nothing necessarily redeemable) to this monster.     SCHINDLER'S LIST is not a perfect movie, but perhaps perfection is too much to ask for for such an ambitious work. I must admit, though, that I occasionally winced at some of the film's more heavy-handed gestures. The worst offender is a scene towards the end, when Schindler starts to sob about how he felt he didn't do enough while Stern blatantly extols the virtue of his act. Spielberg cannot resist trying to milk tears from his audience at that point, and the result strikes me as false and perhaps a bit out of character for the normally stoic (at least on the outside) Schindler. And, to be hypercritical, I suppose I would have preferred John Williams' score to be a little less obviously solemn all the time, as beautifully as Itzhak Perlman performs the impassioned violin solos. (Spielberg rationed the use of an underscore in his 1998 SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, an approach that might have worked here, too.)    There is so much to honestly praise about this movie, though, that those faults hardly matter. SCHINDLER'S LIST is a motion picture that does full justice to such a harrowing subject and a remarkable act of bravery. This is a must-see if I've ever seen one (and believe me, I rarely say that about a lot movies).
B00005QIPH|5.0|If you haven't listened to the Strokes yet, what are you waiting for? \\"Is This It\\" is a wonderful first album, with catchy tunes and sly lyrics, it's not too heavy or too light or too trippy. I've heard them on Leno, Letterman, and Conan, I've heard the NFL use their songs during pre-game, and I've even heard them playing in several clothing stores. They're everywhere! <br /> <br />Ok, why should you buy this? The title track is slow but listening to Julian sing \\"I just lied to get to your apartment\\" brings a smile to anyone's face. By the time you get to Barely Legal and Someday, you're tapping your feet and you're into the groove. The best song on here is probably \\"Last Nite\\" which is what hooked me. <br /> <br />If you can get the imported copy of \\"Is This It\\", do it! New York City Cops is definitely the 2nd best song on the album, but was left off of the US version because it was being released around Sept. 11th and the Strokes didn't want to offend or confuse anyone with the song (it's really about a story Julian's aunt told him from the 60's). But either way, \\"Is This It\\" is a great album, and you should get it if you don't already own it!

In this case, Dreamworks has failed to issue a recall, and instead tried to pass off this quite glaring mistake as a feature. I can only imagine that they had not a single person testing this product, as even a casual viewing would've revealed this. <br />Incindentally, this might be my all-time favourite movie, but I'm still not keeping this awful DVD.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I really like Waits' music, but I'm not a big fan of his latest albums. This, however, is THE BEST album he ever recorded. I love it.     If you like music that's got an edge, music with a heart and soul, buy this CD.    (...)
B00064MW6K|1.0|This movie is terrible. <br /> <br />For those of you who are comic book fans, this \\"Catwoman\\" is not based on the character of Selina Kyle, it is a totally different Catwoman which has nothing to do with the one from the Batman comics. <br /> <br />The acting by Halle is mediocre. She is nothing but a pretty face. Another example is her poor attempt to play Storm. That role was fit more for an Angela Basset strong type. This movie is just a way to showcase her in tight leather. If it's Halle's hot body you wish to see, get Swordfish.
B00005JMYI|3.0|Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a 1970's chauvinist anchorman. The old boy newsroom antics are on full display. Crude jokes and sexual overtones are the norm.<br /><br />When Ron Burgundy misses his anchor time slot Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is thrust into action. She is the first female anchor to see the airway. Ratings go through the roof. Ron is let go. What will he do?<br /><br />This uncut DVD is sometimes over the top excessive language. This movie is vintage Will Ferrell. The script could be more polished. The writing tries to squeeze to many jokes into conversations.  The movie does not flow well. Will Ferrell can improvise with the best of them (SNL), but sometimes restraint works too. He is an enormous talent and will squeeze his way into the comedic hearts of America.<br /><br />\\"Old School\\" and \\"Elf\\" are destined to be Will Ferrell classics.<br /><br />Have you noticed! In Hollywood circles, if you are the lead, hot actor, bring in your actor friends for some cameos. If you follow Adam Sandler's movies you know what I mean. Ride the pony!
B00001U03Q|4.0|I can't stand the first two songs, but after that, the album is fantastic.  Blue Eyes Blue is a little better than the first song, so I guess it's bearable, but I can't stand the first song.  Having said that, the rest of the CD is awesome, especially if your new to Clapton.  Longtime fans will complain about what's been left off, but they can't fit all of his songs on one disc.  This CD has great blues songs like My Father's Eyes and Tears in Heaven, rockers like Pretending and Bad Love, and of course Layla.  If you're a longtime fan, you may be disappointed in what's not there, but this is great for new fans.
0061008079|5.0|For whatever the reason, A Woman of Substance by Barbara Taylor Bradford, was one of those books which always eluded me.  Trying to read it on three separate occasions I never got any further  than 200 pages.  But this year when my online a book list decided to read this, I was determined to persevere or as Emma Harte, the heroine of the book said at the end, \\"To endure\\" till I finished the last page.  And finish it I did and found myself falling in love with not only the characters portrayed in this book but with the areas of England Ms. Bradford describes as well.<br /><br />There are books we all read who give us characters we will never forget.  Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Father Ralph and Meggie from The Thorn Birds, Ari Ben Canaan and Kitty from Exodus.  And to this list I now add the name Emma Harte.<br /><br />A Woman of Substance is a grand book told over close to six decades and also introduces us to the Yorkshire area of England as well as the cities of Leeds and London.  And as if that wasn't enough we come to know dear friends of Emma's like Blackie and the Kallinski family as well as enemies and rivals from the Fairley family.  We also come to know Emmas brothers Frank and Winston and her children and grandchildren.<br /><br />Emma, through great business acumen and the will to succeed, rises from a maid in a wealthy home to own a multimillion dollar enterprise.  She does this to reap revenge on her former employer and his son, two men who have little understanding of their actions and the consequences.  As Emma becomes more and more successful she finds herself marrying several men but only one does she love with all her heart.<br /><br />If you enjoyed books like The Tea Rose by Jennifer Donnelly and As the Crow Flies by Jeffrey Archer, I highly suggest you read this oldie and keeper of a book.  I now look forward to read the next book in this series Hold That Dream and the rest including the newest one, Unexpected Blessing, which was just published.<br />.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The story lines were incredible and it's a movie that gives hope. The cast line-up was also great! Definitely something to watch over and over again.
0767805712|3.0|I think it's a interesting actual subject, which makes you think about man and his nature. When the science is badly used, it could be wrong for humanity and also dangerous for the future. This movie talks about discrimination and it shows the world could be better without the differents between \\"valid\\"(is a perfect person) and \\"invalid\\"(is a person who has got a problem) human beings. My moral for this movie is \\"If you want, you can do it\\" because Gattaca talks about Willpower.
B000005RU2|5.0|Over the past couple of months I've been on a nostaligic binge, purchasing music that I listened to in the late 60's and early seventies.  I guess I was growing in need of a change from listening to the jazz and blues that has occupied my listening landscape over the last several years, which is amazing music in and off itslef, but even more so given the vacuousness of the musical repetoir in rock that has existed since the mid to late 1970's.<br /><br />Earlier today, I was sitting at the computer doing a search on Amazon and band specific sites to see what was out there and what would jar my memory back to a period in music history that, in my opinion, remains as perhaps the most fertile and creative for that enourmouns genre of music that is loosely refered to as, \\"rock\\".  I came across Deep Purple's  \\"Made in Japan\\".  When I was 12 or 13, I asked for this record for Christmas, and (most likely to my mother's regret), I got it.  Now at 45, I listen to it again with all of the youthful enthusiasm that I first listened to it over 30 years ago.  As one responder on this site mentioned, there are classic rock live albums that simply must be in any serious collectors' and/or fan's library - and this is definately one of them.  It has the best of their material, the best of the musicians, and the most incredible performances that were to ever grace the group.  It is evident from the first note that they were totally into what they were doing and they had the creative and youthful energy to let it fly. The remastering also breathes new life into the music, particularly that it is on CD.<br /><br />I have to add though, as a caution against blurring the lines of distiction between one style of music from another, that listening to Made in Japan, or other music from that era does not remind me of what some have referred to as \\"heavy metal\\".  On the contrary,  It is not heavy metal, it is classic \\"hard rock\\" from the early 1970's.  Heavy metal was not just a decade away, it was a culture, a lifestyle, an aesthetic away from all of the glorious music that now only exists as memories, allbeit on \\"vinyl\\": Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Grand Funk Railroad, Jimi Hendrix, Procul Harem, Robin Trower, Ten Years After, The Faces, The Who, Uriah Heep, The Band, Stephen Stills, CSNY, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Little Feat, Cream, Derek and the Dominos, The Allamn Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jefferson Airplane, The Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Grateful Dead, Steppenwolf, Janis Joplin, Traffic, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Neil Young, Mountain, and the coutless others.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|You either love it or hate it... you get it or you don't.  There isn't much middle ground here.  The most disturbing thing I found with the movie was that it felt like it was from several time periods all at once.  It had an early 80s feel, but there were computers.  Delightfully strange.
0385504209|4.0|I came to Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE having recently read three other modern novels (Updike's THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, Crichton's PREY, and Uris' OHARA'S CHOICE), none of which was particularly captivating.  Updike, while perhaps attempting a parody, achieves the ridiculous while losing the humor. Crichton merely rewrote his earlier novel THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN while changing nothing but the cast of characters.  Uris' characters remain as conflicted at the end of his novel as they were at its beginning.  A fourth modern novel that I struggled through a little longer ago, Naslund's AHAB'S WIFE, is so full of red herrings as well as characters endowed with neither reality nor purpose that it rates no further notice at all. My point here is that I came to THE DA VINCI CODE with a jaundiced eye, expecting yet another literary failure and even wondering why I was bothering to read anything written after the early 20th century.<br /><br />I was in for a wonderful surprise.  Mixing real, historical secret societies with fictional characters and plot, Brown pilots the reader down a veritable race course of a book.  The action, intrigue, and mystery gallop at breakneck speed from beginning to end.  Religious symbolism is artfully interwoven throughout the plot, and the heavy debt that Christian mythology owes to Pagan beliefs is brought to light in skillful narrative and dialogue.<br /><br />Yet, for all of its originality and captivating action, the book is not entirely new.  Several scenarios and bits of dialogue here and there are derivative of the Indiana Jones movies starring Harrison Ford.  I am thoroughly convinced that author Brown watched INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE quite a few times before beginning to write THE DA VINCI CODE.  Numerous parallels exist between Brown's Robert Langdon, a Harvard academician specializing in symbology, and Indiana Jones, an academic archeologist.  Once they have been drawn from their classrooms into the field, however, both Langdon and Jones give James Bond a run for his money in the \\"action hero department.\\"<br /><br />One other character in the novel may be derivative.  At least, he constantly reminds me of a character whom I met some time ago in another film.  In the novel, the character is Silas, an albino monk and a fervent believer in the Opus Dei, a reactionary Catholic cult.  Brother Silas is continually flagellating himself, the mutilation and pain being self-administered punishments for his sins (such as multiple murders, but then I don't want to give away the plot by describing his grievous transgressions in too much detail here).  Silas reminds me very much of another monk who also flagellates himself for his sins in THE NAME OF THE ROSE, a spell-binding murder mystery set in the time of the Holy Inquisition.  As in THE DA VINCI CODE, extreme religious belief and murder intertwine to form the plot, and it is not stretching the point too far to suggest that Brown may have also been influenced by THE NAME OF THE ROSE, though whether in its book or its movie version is impossible to tell.<br /><br />That the influence of other works on Brown's novel can readily be seen is not a grievous weakness by any means.  Certainly the bulk of Brown's work appears to be refreshingly original, and THE DA VINCI CODE goes far to restore my faith in modern fiction.  If we can imagine mixing Indiana Jones with James Bond while throwing in a goodly measure of truly fascinating church history, religious fanaticism, and worldly scheming, we will have created a pretty accurate description of THE DA VINCI CODE.  To describe a book as a \\"page turner\\" has become trite through unwarranted overuse, but in Dan Brown's novel, it is highly accurate.  I've already begun to read his other novels based solely upon my delight with this one, and that is perhaps the highest recommendation I can make for partaking of his creative and imaginative stories.Langdon and Jones give James Bond a run for his money in the \\"action hero department.\\" <br /> <br />One other character in the novel may be derivative.

B000002IRL|5.0|When Overkill ditched their guitarist Bobby Gustafson in 1990, many predicted the end for Thrash's most enduring band. Few guitarists in the genre have ever been able to match his chops and technique, and for many fans, his playing provided much of the band's personality. Fans were concerned Overkill without Gustafson would have been like Black Sabbath without Tony Iommi. <br /> <br />They needn't have worried. `Horrorscope' turned out to be Overkill's most mature and most consistent release of their career to that point. The new guitar duo of Merritt Gant and Rob Cannavino proved to be a match even for a guitarist as good as Gustafson, and helped revitalise the band.  <br /> <br />\\"Coma\\" starts with a haunting acoustic intro, before letting loose with a full on double kick drum and power chord typhoon. Immediately obvious- two guitars are heavier than one. Where DD Verni had often had to sacrifice a little of the bottom end to fill the vacant mid ranges now sat a second guitar. While studio trickery meant the rhythm guitar never dropped out during solos on previous Overkill albums, two guitars proved to be far more versatile, flexible and heavier. <br /> <br />Overkill's unique character remained intact through the vocals of Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth. While Blitz is not the best vocalist ever, he's one of the most distinctive, and probably the most versatile to ever front a Thrash Metal band. From soaring pseudo-Operatics on \\"Coma\\" to the pessimistic wailing of \\"Soulitude\\", Blitz covers a whole range of emotions, from rage to frustration, to bare faced aggression, sometimes within the space of a few lines. <br /> <br />Gustafson was hardly missed in the song writing department either. The band wrote riffs by the bucketload, with songs like \\"Blood Money\\" and \\"Thanx For Nothin'\\" featuring some of the best ever. There are a few slower, brooding songs with a feel similar to \\"Playing With Spiders/Skullcrusher\\" from previous album `The Years Of Decay', although the focus is more on an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness than just playing slow to hit low frequencies. The grinding bass-led intro to the title track is an unstoppable juggernaut, creating a theme the rest of the song to build off without ever lifting the tempo above lumbering. \\"New Machine\\" features a closing passage which creates robotic, automaton imagery like a scene from the movie \\"Metropolis\\". <br /> <br />While Overkill had always dealt with dark themes, the lyrics here had none of the camp silliness of older songs like \\"Hello From The Gutter\\", \\"Brainfade\\" and \\"Hammerhead\\". Instead, the lyrics on `Horrorscope' pertain to living with a sense of hopelessness or helplessness, and the inevitability and finality of death. The closing couplet of \\"Nice Day... For A Funeral\\" and \\"Soulitude\\" reach the depths of sombre introspection. The songs deal in turn with death (\\"Yeah, the last of sunshine/Oh, ya know, for what it's worth/Nice day for a funeral\\") and it's aftermath (\\"I remember here/Thought it was a dream/I never thought I'd come to this). While it may seem like a depressing way to finish an album, it is highly thought provoking. <br /> <br />Showing a maturity which only comes through self-confidence, `Horrorscope' wasn't exactly what fans were expecting, but few were disappointed by it. Overkill showed up more famous peers like Metallica, Megadeth and even Exodus, by shifting their focus without compromising their principles.
B000667FNI|5.0|I was just looking this one over in a CD Plus and basically the first disc was the regular album, with no mention of whether or not it had been remastered.  The second disc was a DVD with the album in 5.1 surround sound that also included some interviews with the band.  There was no mention of how long these interviews are on the back of the CD.  I didn't want to take a chance on it, so I ordered the remastered version of American Beauty which includes some extra live tracks.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mel Gibson has sunk to a new low on this one folks. You think he made this movie because he is so passionate about religion? No, he made it because his hitler wannabe father hates Jews and told Mel to make this film. Plus, all Mel cares about is the money..[...]    Do you think Jews in the time of Christ had ANY say or ANY power as to sway the Romans to kill Jesus? No...

B0002X314C|5.0|Finally, a male artist that can sing more than just booty shakin and video hoes.  This is a breath of fresh air!  All tracks are laced with a laid back grooves, mellow, and unpretentious attitude from a singer/songwriter that not only knows he can sing, but doesn't beat it over your head. <br /> <br />He takes on his ride of 14 tracks with a slow and subtle prelude and easily slides into his first track, \\"Let's Get Lifted\\".  (If your not slow, that's a double meaning.)  The hit song, \\"Used To Love You\\", which is a flip on a love gone sour theme, and I just LOVE that hook!: HOLLA! <br /> <br />I could go into detail about every song but that wouldn't give it enough credit. My favorites are, \\"She Don't Have To Know\\", a twist on the down low cheaters out there, \\"I Can Change\\", \\"Stay With You\\", and the family sung and inspiring,\\"It Don't Have To Change.\\"  This man comes from a close knit and sangin family! <br /> <br />I highly reccommend this album for anyone who wants something different in the already cookie cutter r&b music field. It takes an artist with a vision to be different to spark a legend. I believe that John Legend has started his. Look for big thangs from him! <br /> <br />Peace and Blessings <br /> <br />Norris
0767834739|4.0|As far as shlocky zombie films go the R.E. franchise is my favorite. I did perfer the first one. <br />As a &quot;Torontoian&quot; I have to say it was fun to watch if a bit hard to suspend disbelief I found that I had to keep telling myself &quot;that's not Toronto City all It's Racoon City City Hall... or that's not the CN Tower in the background, pretend it's not there.&quot;<br />I think that dispite what the reviewer said the visuals were well done, I enjoyed the fact that &quot;real&quot; effects were used where it was not ablsoutly nessisary to use CGI ie. Milla Jovovich's (Alice) stunt double running down the side of city hall and Milla doing the last 60 feet herself, this was all done in real time and not on a blue/green screen nor CG. <br />If you expect Citizen Kane from this movie then perhaps you aught to rethink you choice in Genre. It's a *Bleeping* horror/action/sci-fi flick for goodnessakes not high art. <br />The DVD special features are fantastic also 3 comentaries, the one with Milla, Sienna, and Oded kept me chuckling Milla has a fantastic sense of humor. Outakes: funny. 20 deleted/exended scenes, and featurettes galore about everything you could want to know about the making of and behind the scenes of Resident Evil: Apocalypse.<br />Can't wait for Resident Evil 3: (Project: Alice(?))
B00005A1PR|5.0|I can listen to this CD from the beginning to the end without having to skip a song! It flows just like her voice. I even enjoy listening to the tributes she give to the musical legends. Her music is inspiring and I hope she continues!    I LOVE you India!

B000022TSH|5.0|First of all, it is hard not to just rave about how great this movie is. Discussions of its finer points aside, you are really missing something if you don't go out and see this movie. It is not a martial arts movie. It is a flawless, polished gem of a film- a rare treasure of unequaled technical mastery, unrivaled performances by both Nicholson and Dunaway, and screenwriting excellece of course too.   Chinatown is arguably the greatest movie ever made. But to understand this, and thus to understand why you really should watch it, it is perhaps useful to understand where it fits. Chinatown is certainly not the most \\"important\\" film, as it is essentially a rehashing of the film noir genre, but it terms of absolute and unequivocal success as BOTH a work of art and entertainment, Chinatown is without rival. Critics may have written much more about other movies of the period, and certainly for instance \\"Taxi Driver\\" is more of a cultural monument, but nothing can touch the staggering richness of this film. It still hits me like a locomotive every time I see it.
B000002H6C|4.0|Metallica returns after their two masterpieces, \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and Master of Puppets\\" with an album that is even more complex than anything they have ever done before. Even though there are only nine songs, this album is still really long, being released at the time on two tapes. The songs, except for two, are all over six minutes with two over nine minutes. <br />The albums starts out with \\"Blackened\\" a song about how we are destroying the Earth. It starts out with a harmonized guitar solo that sounds like bagpipes, giving the image of a guy in a kilt playing the bagpipes at a funeral for Earth itself. There is a great (and very complex) riff, an awesome solo, and impressive drumming by Ulrich (even though he is an @$$hole). \\"...And Justice for All\\" is probably the best song of the album and one of the best songs Metallica has ever done. It has three (3) incredible riffs and a solo in the middle that is impossible not to air guitar to. \\"To Live is to Die\\" is an almost instrumental (there are a few lines at the end that Cliff Burton wrote). This is a great song, especially for people who cannot get enough of Hetfield's riffs, and it is the last song that Cliff Burton wrote before his untimely death. Throughout the song it is possible to visualize a person going through life, and by time the classic guitar hits at the end, one can image a fresh grave, grass around it swaying in the wind, with the person that the song was about just being buried there. \\"Dyers Eve\\" has nothing to do with death, instead about parents that supress anything the child tries to do. I have to respect Hetfield, because the riffs are lightning fast, but because of the procduction, it is nowhere near as good as \\"Battery\\" or \\"Fight fire With Fire,\\" even though Hammett still has an awesome solo. The songs in between (3-7) all suffer from the albums terrible production. <br />In fact, the entire album sufferes from this problem, which some may not notice, but it really hurts the album for me. Kirk Hammett's guitar buzzes thinly, especially in the solos, while the drums click more than pound. The rhythym guitar is so deep it almost comes out as deep as a bass guitar, and Newsted's bass guitar can't be heard at all. Even the vocals suffer, although not as much. Hetfield sounds like a steriotypical metal singer, with more of a bark than the trademark growl which sounded really good with \\"Master\\" and \\"Ride.\\" <br />The first time I listened to this I almost threw it away, because the sound was so terrible, and I always force myself to listen to an album several times before giving up on it. It wasn't until after a month that I gave it a second chace and was able to find some good stuff in it. At first I wondered how this could have been so popular, with the terrible sound and all that. But then again, it is the perfect music for angry male teenagers who want to rebel. The music is loud and pounding and the lyrics are just the feeling that many of them would have. In fact, look at the lyrics in the liner notes, they are some of the most depressing ones I have ever heard. I understand that Hetfield was going through a hard time with the death of his good friend, and actually the lyrics are really good (especially \\"One,\\" \\"Eye of the Beholder,\\" and \\"...And Justice For All\\"), it's just that it gives people who hate Metallica fuel to condemn them as a shallow heavy metal band, when they were (not are anymore, but they were) an amazing and talented band. But listen to these sections from the song \\"Harvester of Sorrow,\\" \\"Anger, Misery, You'll suffer unto me\\" and \\"Distributor of Pain, your loss is my gain,\\" these are so hopeless and disheartened, it fails to get me any enjoyment out of them, but they seem tailor-made to appeal to pissed off teenagers. The same applies for \\"Dyers Eve\\" which are about terrible moms and dads of course are going to appeal to those fans since the majority of them are mad at their parents. <br />All that being said, this still has some good stuff on it. I can easily recommend it to any heavy or progressive metal fan. Buy it for \\"Blackened\\" or the title track alone. Even though there were two songs that I liked, there was potential for nearly all of them to be so good, especially Hammett's solos, but because of the terrible production, they don't live up to how good they could be. Since it is not dierctly Metallica's fault for the production, I still give this four stars.  <br />P.S. IF ANY RECORD PEOPLE ARE READING THIS, PLEASE REMASTER THIS AND RELEASE IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I, ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER FANS, WILL BUY THIS THE DAY THAT IT COMES OUT.
0312263120|1.0|The plot is unrealistic. Characters are 2-D. And don't even get me started on the technological inaccuracies, let just say there are LOTS of them. <br />If you have read other Dan Brown books before you will see it's the same dang formula. How many books can he write about professors and super-smart-super-hot chicks? Does every book have to have a crippled genius and an assasin with a disability? <br />You can tell which one of the good guys is the bad guy after reading 10 pages. <br />In other words, the only reason to read this book is if you read other Dan Brown's books and know your computers pretty well.

B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection was released in 1990 and housed Madonna's best hits from 1982 to 1990. Some of the songs were also re-done on this collection and all were re-mastered with Q-Sound, to bring out the best sound at the time. <br /> <br />1. Holiday: This is the immortal Madonna song. It will never die. It has been performed at every tour and by far one of her greatest. The version here is about two-minutes shorter than the original.  <br /> <br />2. Lucky Star: This was another hit more the early Madonna. The version included here is not as good as the original. The vocals were done differently.  <br /> <br />3. Borderline: This song is okay, not one of my favs. This version is the same as the original.  <br /> <br />4. Like A Virgin: The song that made Madonna known. This is a rather good song, despite Madonna's high-pitched vocals. This version is shorter than the original.  <br /> <br />5. Material Girl: The name that would follow Madonna for the rest of her career. This song is one of my favs and I love this version. The quality is better and it has a better sound.  <br /> <br />6. Crazy For You: A Shorter version of the classic song from the Vision Quest Movie. This song marked Madonna's first original ballad.  <br /> <br />7. Into The Groove: The classic dance tune from the Queen. All I have to say is that this version sucks compared to the original. The original can be found on the Angel single. Go For It. <br /> <br />8. Live To Tell: The song that opened the door to the emotional balladeer we know today. This song is about 45 seconds shorter than the original. I prefer the original.  <br /> <br />9. Papa Don't Preach: The 80's hit that turned some heads when Madonna voiced her opinion about abortion. <br /> <br />10. Open Your Heart: The classic pop tune. This song is one of my favs.  <br /> <br />11. La Isla Bonita: One of my favs. This was Madonna's first stab at Musica de Latina. This version is almost the same as the original but about 10 secondsshorter.  <br /> <br />12. Like A Prayer: The birth of the controversial Madonna we know (and LOVE) began here. This song (video for the song) turned many heads. This song is beautiful. I love it. It is a combination of religion/sacrilegious/and dance.  <br /> <br />13. Express Yourself: This song that, believe or not, made Madonna a sex symbol. This is a great girl power song. One of Madonna's best.~!~ <br /> <br />14. Cherish: The cheeky-pop tune that had no hesitation in topping the charts. A classic. <br /> <br />15. Vogue: Two Words: A CLASSIC. This is most likely Madonna's biggest World Hit. It is great and you can never get tired of it. The best song on this collection. <br /> <br />16. Justify My Love: This first new song to make it this collection. This song officially began Madonna's most infamous era in her career, her sex-era. This song is wonderful. It is sensual and intimate, while still being sexy and hot. <br /> <br />17. Rescue Me; The second new song from The I.C. This song is full of power and energy and shows Madonna can sing and sing with power! <br /> <br />This collection should be in every home. It is wonderful and keeps selling more copies everyday!! <br />
B000000OUJ|5.0|As has been said over and over again by many other reviewers, I feel this is the best Wu-Tang album, solo or as a group, period.   <br /> <br />GZA is the best lyricist of the group.  He has a great delivery and writes great lyrics.   <br /> <br />It also has the best atmosphere in creating what the Wu-Tang wanted to be about: kung-fu vintage clips; Rza's razorsharp beats; great lyrics and great songs. <br /> <br />This is the best album that the Wu-Tang ever dropped, so it's surprising that it is generally overlooked.
B00000K0DV|4.0|When I first read the reviews about \\"The New York Ripper\\" it definitely sounded like a movie that the avid gore hound should check out. Well I couldn't find it anywhere. So I decided to buy it.     While I don't believe it is Lucio fulci's best movie I did find it to be pretty good. It is nothing like his other films with zombies and other creatures from the depths of hell. \\"The New York Ripper\\" deals with a maniacal psychopath that slices and dices his way through The Big Apple. Of course being a Fulci film you can expect the usual terrible acting and horrible dubbing, which always makes me laugh, and yes the killer quacks like a duck but the killing scenes are in typical Fulci fashion (GORY!) A woman getting gutted, a broken bottle shoved into the forbidden area, a nice straight blade through a helpless victims eyeball and nipple, and an impressive head shot at the end of the film.     You've heard all the other reviews. The film is seedy, it is misogynistic, violent, brutal and there's plenty of T&A to satifsy fans of the flesh. I found it to be well worth adding to my collection. If you haven't seen a Fulci film before may I suggest \\"Zombie\\", \\"The Beyond\\" or \\"City of the Living Dead\\". If you have seen Fulci films before check out \\"The New York Ripper\\". All in all not a bad murder mystery.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I watched this film over the holidays and turned it off after twenty minutes as being to stupid for words, ( particularly Hyde being a CGI hulk and the Q-section of the church ).  But I turned my brain off and gave it another go, and it was mildly enjoyable.   Thin on plot, logic, and writing, it at least had action, humor and some good effects.  While no discernable challenge, Hugh played his part well.  Kate ( fitted out with a sleek new nose and hood ornaments since last I saw her ) looked great. <br />  The films biggest weakness was the contrived deus ex machina ending ( perhaps not exactly the right term since the amazing coincidence showed up half way into the picture ).   <br />  Other than that is was fun.   <br />  One thing I did like was the depiction of the wretch.  I have noted some other reviews complaining that he was drawn sympatheticall, was literate, etc, in contravention of their favorite Frankenstien films.  If they had bothered to read the book they would have found he was intelligent, sympathetic, literate ( learned to read from the bible as the film showed ) and only acted as he did because of the rejection he suffered due to his ugliness.  If you want to complain about someone not following the cannon complain about the hulk-Hyde.  Hyde was smaller than jeckel, weaker and younger, just bad to the bone,  not a freakish hulk.   <br />  I wish people would read.
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|How many more bull#@%$ DVD's do we need to see before you bring out the 2 live DVD's??  Come on already!! Talk about milking it for what it is worth!!
B00005JMAH|2.0|Bring back the previous director.  Not nearly as good as the previous movies.  I thought the story line was confusing even though I read the book.  If you had not read the book you would have been totally confused.  The scenes seemed to be choppy and out of sequence and didn't make a lot of sense.  I am a true Harry Potter fan but I was very disappointed after waiting so long for it's release.  I hope Ms. Rowling will take control and see that this doesn't happen again.
B000000WA4|5.0|27 Tracks all 100% <br />BUY THIS ALBUM, AND LISTEN TO IT LOTS AND LOTS.
B00005JMX6|4.0|I was both surprised and let down by \\"The Girl Next Door.\\" Surprised because I thought that it had a great ending that made the whole movie quite enjoyable, but dissapointed in how long it took to get there and how much of an open mind one would have to have to get there. The movie has this whole \\"She's All That\\" blended with \\"Risky Business\\" feel to it. The movie definitely has a feel good story to it and at the end you'll be extremely pleased that you put aside a very \\"stretched\\" plot to get there. Granted, the idea of a revered student class president falling for a former porn star is sketchy at best. But watching him go to such lengths to keep her (including going to an Adult Film Convention in Las Vegas and shooting a porn movie in his high school during prom), along with a couple of other moments, make his love for her more unbelieveable than believable. The actor who play's \\"Kelly\\" clearly steals the show by the way, he reminds me of the actor Johnny Knoxville wishes he could be. It's a feel good film that high-school/early college ages will appreciate, but older crowds will find little more than impressive and worthy eye-candy in Cuthbert.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|LOVE IT OR HATE IT??    IN MY CASE: HATE IT!!    ONE HOUR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK, NOT TO MENTION THE $20.
0385335482|5.0|I am not big into writing reviews on books (since I'm not the most eloquent at sharing my thoughts via writing), but I just wanted to say that this is the funniest book I've ever read.  I have NEVER laughed out loud at book (especially while on the subway).  It's like one of those rare moments when you're home alone, watching something on TV that makes you laugh out loud and then you feel kind of strange because you're by yourself (if that makes sense).  I found myself laughing, not giggling, but laughing at this book.  Definitely worth reading!
B0000BWVCM|4.0|this movie is really good - not cheesy and it does not have adult entertainment in it!
B000669GAI|5.0|First things first, this is a great collection of songs. The hard core fans already know enough about these songs so I am not dirrecting my review towards them. I strongly recommend it to anybody who ever heard a pearl jam song on the radio and liked it, but felt intimidated by their sometimes expansive and unpopy catalog. The two cds here contain a sampling of pearl jams most accessable music. I personally was happy to see many of my favorite less often heard songs such as light years and state of love and trust make the albumn along side many pj staples such as jeremy betterman, yada yada yada. So do yourself a favor grab this album at an increadible price and if you like what you hear maybe you'll want to check out some of their other records too...
B000001FS3|4.0|U2 are no Beatles, but this is as good as they ever got. With Or Without You & I Still Haven't Found What I AM LOOKING FOR. Are instant classics. After this album they went into serious decline and lost the basic quality and strong songwriting this album represents. Bono is also a very annoying charactor, and despite his charitable facade, strikes me as very egotistical and money greedy!
B00005UKKF|1.0|Las Vegas, the elephant's graveyard for untalented singers.  The place that made Wayne Newton a STAR!!  Britney definitely belongs in Las Vegas where she can get her next quickie marriage and try to belt out a song to the old drunks.  A perfect audience for the woman who can't carry a note.
B000002UAU|5.0|We will still be talking about this album and listening to it in awe a 1,000 years from now. This is the APEX of popular music. Its finest hour. Forget what they say about Revolver, Abbey Road and all the other outstanding Beatles albums. This is their MASTERPIECE, and is as good as popular music will ever get. And, \\"A Day In The Life\\" IS THE MOST AMAZING POP SONG EVER RECORDED.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|first off, music isn't meant to be classified.  grunge was a fashion movement, and had little to do with specific music.  It was just the fact they were all poor, and had to wear 50 cent dickies flannels from the goodwill, or wherever cheap shirts come from in Seattle.  Therefore, pearl jam, alice, soundgarden, nirvana, the meat puppets...etc were all grunge. <br /> <br />if you haven't heard most of these pj songs, then you never went to any of their bootleg pages, and you don't have alot of live boots they sell, cuz some of these songs are pj live classics.  <br />Look for \\"yellow ledbetter\\" on disc 2.  If you see em live, there's a decent chance you'll hear it, and its one of my favorite pj songs.  \\"Dirty Frank\\" is another real good one.    <br /> <br />its got some covers.  \\"last kiss\\" is a great cover of a great old eerie rock song.  Pj is famous for renditions of others' songs.  I saw em tag floyd's classic \\"brick in the wall\\" on the end of daughter awhile back.  Anywhoo, obtain this album, along with their studio releases.  They try to collect as many live boots as you can.  each one will have a different daughter tag, (some repeat) but then you can have pj for weeks. <br />
B00000DHZJ|5.0|If you want the cream of Hendrix's career, this is the best album for you. It has everything from his first classic hit \\"Hey Joe\\" to his historic rendition of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" at Woodstock 1969. Greatest hits packages usually dis-appoint. But this is one of the rare exceptions. If you really enjoy this album though, I would suggest you at least get \\"Are YOU Experienced\\" TOO. As that album is a seminal ROCK CLASSIC! In its own right.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is one of those few works that can truly be said to transcend their genre.  Although the \\"comic\\" format may at first be off-putting to those not familiar with it, in reality, the plot and writing are better than many novels I've read, and the characters are varied and deep.  I would unhesitatingly recommend this work to anyone, especially those who view comics as something for children and collectors only; this book will change your mind.
B000001DTM|1.0|This album is very overatted. The Joshua Tree is the best thing this Irish 4-piece ever put out. This is over-produced and annoying.
079284131X|4.0|Yep, this is the original movie that started the (now ridiculous) franchise! The story opens with serial killer and all around creepazoid, Charles Lee \\"Chucky\\" Ray (Brad Dourif) being shot by a cop (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store. With his dying breath, Charles asks the great voodoo gods to allow his soul to enter a doll's body. Sometime later, a mom (Catherine Hicks) buys the doll from a homeless guy in an alley. Chucky soon befriends her son and begins weaving his evil web of terror and revenge. Though I can't take CHILD'S PLAY completely seriously, it does have it's creepy charms. Chucky is at his best when seen running by in the background or when we see a tiny plastic hand turn a doorknob. He doesn't fair as well in close-ups. After all, he's just not that scary! Like the Zuni warrior doll in TRILOGY OF TERROR, Chucky becomes downright silly when over-exposed! That's why the sequels are such a joke. Thankfully, Tom Holland used restraint and didn't have Chucky in every frame of this one or it would have been a disaster! Anyway, CP is a good, cheesy spooker with atmosphere and humor. Worth owning...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Awesome CD. Vermilion simply the best track out there. Go out and buy it, it's not money wasted.
0792164903|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish. If you are a Depphead like myself, you should definitely watch this one. The horseman was purely terrifying, with the sharpened teeth and plainly crazed-looking face. Christina Ricci was great as the love interest, and of course Johnny was brilliant as usual. While being frightening, the movie also had some delightful Depp-ish humor slipped into it. Tim Burton did a fabulous job bringing this greusome ghost tale to life. The sets were terrifying. This movie is great...just don't watch it alone, or at least not in the dark.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've always been a metal fan ranging from pink floyd and rush all the way to marilyn manson, pantera, and so forth.  For some strange reason I had never heard of Tool until my brother inlaw and friends turned me on to them.  I picked up Lateralus as it was the newest album at the time and it changed my opinion on music as a whole.  I've listened to Lateralus hundreds of times while at work or traveling with my wife and this album continues to give me goose bumps when listening to it.  I continued to enjoy Lateralus and wanted to check out some of Tool's previous albums, I bought Undertow by recommendation by another friend and was impressed but not as satisfied as with Lateralus.  I then heard Aenima, which is my 2nd favorite Tool album, and it was awesome but just didn't impact me the same as Lateralus.  For anyone who hasn't been a Tool fan from the beginning its really hard to find a better album then Lateralus.  This is one of the best albums out there, don't pass it up.
1400032717|5.0|I listened to the audiobook on CD, and absolutely loved it. What an original and interesting story. It made me laugh out loud. One of my all time favorites.
B000084T18|1.0|dont buy this album...rap music is horrible and 50 so is 50 cent,,i mean, he cant rap and he thinks he all-that all because vanilla ice made him famous, but 50 cent is not a pimp and he is a loser
B00005JNBQ|5.0|From the instant he unpacked his action-figure wrapped in twine from out of his Trapper Keeper and threw it out the bus window to dangle along for the ride, I knew I was going to like Napoleon Dynamite.      I rented this movie at home and watched it with my old and haggard and saddle-bag-thighed ex-wife, who was also poor in her dealings with money.  She laughed, but AT Napoleon, in a kind of dumb-founded way that was always wondering what he was going to do next.  I laughed too, but because I've always rooted for the misfit, for the underdog, for the loner.  For the secret, naive-moron that we all are deep-down.  Whether it was drawing expertly-shaded pictures of the beautiful Trisha or giving a report on the exploits of our \\"underwater ally\\" (Nessie), I felt like I endured a million hours of junior high and high school with him sitting in the back of the class.    I'm a professional firefighter, and I brought the DVD into work the next day.  Before we watched it, I was concerned that it would have too much \\"dork appeal\\" for a bunch of alpha-male men-of action.  But it soon dawned on me, as the room exploded in laughter again and again, that Napoleon was not so much a dork as he was a little boy who never really grew up.  And almost every man can remember what it was like to be 8 years old.      The smarmy \\"Summer Wheatley\\" and her unctuous boyfriend looked like real people I went to school with.  That guy could've been a blonde version of Sherwin Adams from my class of 1993.  It was not difficult to want to see them fall from grace, especially at the hands of the dynamic and well-coiffed Pedro.      The dance scene climax gave me chills to watch, because it reminds us that even the awkward, even the graceless, even the silly or stupid or ugly can do something well.  Can do something to admire, even to the point of being envious of it.    This is a sweet, funny, unconventional film made by unorthodox people who poured their brains and heart into it.  You will laugh your head off at this movie, or it will miss you completely.  Like \\"Bottle Rocket\\", you cannot explain what is funny about it.  Kudos to Jack White for allowing them the use of the White Stripes song \\"I think we're going to be friends\\".     Oh, keep watching after the credits, there's about 5 additional minutes of movie left.  And one of the funniest parts of the movie: Kip's song.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is a really great album by The beatles...The only weak song on here is \\"What Goes On\\"..but Nowhere man,Norwegian Wood,You Wont See me,Michelle,In My Life,Think for yourself,The Word,Girl and Im Looking Through You are masterpieces <br /> <br />I reccomend this for any classic rock fan GO BUY IT!!
1592400876|5.0|EATS, SHOOTS & LEAVES <br /> by LYNNE TRUSS <br /> <br />- A BOOK REVIEW by K Vethiveloo (KVVeloo)  <br /> <br />I do not know how many of you had the opportunity to read the book titled: \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" by Lynne Truss. <br />It is listed as the Runaway #1 British Bestseller.  <br />  <br />The catchy title beguiles one's expectation.  My first reaction was one of curiosity but when I went through the blurb, I found it was merely a book on punctuation.  As I dropped it, I was muttering under my breath, \\"I had enough of it in primary and secondary school\\".  I still recall vividly the popular book on grammar with which I grew up in school.  It was called \\"A General Certificate English Course\\" by Lancelot Oliphant.   <br />  <br />To re-learn punctuation at this age was an admission of doubt in one's use of the English Language.  One may ask why now- when no one has ever pulled me up for wrong usage of punctuations. Neither have I found fault with others. A friend of mine, who must be excused for his poetic licence, took exception recently with one of my colleagues for reformatting his email message with proper punctuation marks.  Indeed, many of us do not intentionally question the appropriateness of our punctuation marks in our written language.  We assume we are correct.  It simply flows. <br />  <br />There is, however, much to punctuation. Take for example the title of the book: Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\".  Does it refer to a Texas cowboy who enters a shady saloon, takes his bite, shoots the bartender and blows the smoke of his gun and leaves nonchalantly?  Could the title be more appropriately refer to a panda that Eats shoots and leaves?  One of the classical examples of the mischief that punctuation can create is shown in the following sentence which, I think, has appeared often in the internet. <br />     <br />        A woman, without her man, is nothing. <br />        A woman: without her, man is nothing. <br />  <br />Lynne Truss \\"teaches\\" correct punctuation in a novel way- like telling a story spiced with humour.  I wish I had her book instead of the dry and staid grammar books of the old days. The book takes on all - the comma, the apostrophe, the semi colon, the colon, the dash, and the inverted commas and so on.   <br /> <br />In her own witty manner she deplores that with the advent of emails and text messages punctuation may well have to retire.  She might well be right.  I had an email message recently and I thought it was from a CIA agent who probably thought that I was his colleague. It appeared like a coded message.  I could not decipher what this friend of mine was trying to say. He took exception when I pointed out that he should write good English- not rufree@4:-).  <br />  <br />Well, those who have not read the book, please do so. It is enjoyable reading and most of all serves as a welcome revision. It might bring back poignant memories of one's school days. With that, I leave you one of the following sentences from the book to crack you head on: <br />  <br />                    \\"The tap water is safe to drink in tea and coffee, however, we recommend using bottled water for drinking, it can be purchased very cheaply in the nearby shops.\\" <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B000059XUO|5.0|Although this movie has a few moments where I always close my eyes because of the senseless mayhem and violence, I still rate this one   with five stars. Why? O'Barr's brutal and romantic story has been put to life with lots of respect and imagination. The characters are as real as they can be in a comic-to-film.
6305609721|5.0|\\"The Voyage Home\\" was the fourth of the Star Trek films and hit the movie screens in 1986. It focuses on the crew of the original series, commanded by James Kirk, and ties up a few loose ends from the previous two films.  <br /> <br />The film opens in 2286, three months having passed since the end of \\"The Search of Spock\\", with the approach of a strange probe - apparently on a course to Earth. The first Starfleet vessel to encounter it is the USS Saratoga - unfortunately, the energy signal being transmitted by the probe leaves the Saratoga powerless and drifting in space. Affecting every starship and starbase it meets in the same way, it finally reaches Earth. Settling into orbit, it directs its signals towards the planet's oceans - which are promptly ionised, leading to raging storms around the planet.   <br /> <br />Having stolen - and subsequently destroyed - the Enterprise, visited an off-limits planet and commandeered a Klingon Bird of Prey, Kirk and his crew are on Vulcan preparing to return to Earth. In preparation for the trip, they have carried out a few minor alterations to their captured ship. Fully expecting to be court-martialed when they arrive at Earth, McCoy has also renamed it the HMS Bounty. They only hear about the probe's approach and its effects en-route, however. Spock - whose rehabilitation is not yet complete - analyses the probe's signals and believes the language to be that of humpback whales. Unfortunately, given that the species is extinct in the 23rd Century, there can be no response. This leaves the crew with only one option : they must travel back in time to a period to when humpback whales weren't extinct, capture at least one of them and return with it (or then) to the 23rd Century. Using the 'slingshot' method they discovered during their famous 5-year mission, Kirk and his crew travel to the late 20th century. There, they decide to target two whales living in captivity in San Francisco. Naturally, there are complications... <br /><br />Directed by Leonard Nimoy, \\"The Voyage Home\\" also saw Nicholas Meyer (director of \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" and \\"The Undiscovered Country\\") contribute to the screenplay. Meyer - whose involvement in a Star Trek movie is practically a guarantee - initially wanted the bulk of the action to take place in Paris, rather then San Francisco. Nevertheless, despite the odd 'serious' point - most obviously, the damage caused by humans hunting the humpback to extinction - this is still a very funny movie. The comments on, and the attempts to use, the period's vernacular are sure to raise a smile, while the interplay between Kirk, Spock and McCoy has rarely been bettered.
0780622553|5.0|Truely one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time. Beautifully brought to life by the entire cast. What can I say, everything is perfect. Top director, superb camera work, great lighting, good actors. If you haven't seen this movie before and you like new ways of looking at the adventure/sci-fi genre with a philosophical twist, this one is for you. You need to have this in your collection. You won't get bored, not even after watching it for the 12th time.
B00015TOCY|1.0|Boy was I shocked.  This cd is terrible.  I've heard better garage bands in my life.  I purchased this cd based on the reviews here, but I won't be doing that again.   <br />I was first introduced to Brian Eno's \\"Thursday Afternoon\\" in the early to mid 80's \\"Hearts of Space\\" program with Anna Turner and Steven Hill.  Through the years I've purchased his Ambient series and the Apollo Cd, and was more than satisfied with all of them. (I still play the Thursday Afternoon Cd quite regularly and rank that Cd as the epitome of what ambient music should be.) <br />I will listen to, and I am always looking for, ANY kind of music, from any era or from any country, just to get out of the tedium of what's popular. How someone can mention Sgt. Pepper, or the White Album with this Cd, as two reviewers did, is absurd.  Go listen to Mike Oldfield for a bit of the odd and experimental.  As for stream of consciousness, or \\"free-associative lyrics\\", as another reviewer mentions, go read James Joyce or Virginia Woolf. <br />In the context of \\"when\\" the songs were written, mid 70's, then perhaps I am a bit harsh with my comments.  And if the prior reviews were written contemporaneously, then perhaps I'll forgive them too; but I don't think that is the case.  <br />The bottom line here is, did I enjoy this Cd, and the answer is a very emphatic no. I decline to give anyone credit for their experimental attempts, or failures as I see it.
0446677450|3.0|As mentioned in many of the other reviews, the book advises to buy income-generating assets instead of expense-incurring liabilities. However, everyone has a different life path. Making money is important but spending wisely and giving wisely are also necessary. Unlike what the author said in the book, professional experience can both be enjoyable and financially rewarding. And his hint of owning real estate and/or small business can be a very difficult and risky approach to wealth for most people.
0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest writers to live, in my opinon. And The Bell Jar captures her disturbing brilliance perfectly.

6300271145|4.0|Set in 1959 Paris and based on the life of the great jazz pianist Bud Powell this outstanding labour of love tells the story of the relationship between a great but self -destructive jazz musician , Dale Turner ,and a young French devotee who tries in vain to save him from his own worst excesses . <br />The brilliant saxophonist Dexter Gordon plays Turner and while obviously not a trained actor turns this to his ,and the movie's advantage ,with a performance which sees him inhabit the role rather than merely playing it .A shambling bear like man Turner come as across as one for whom music is his life and his mistress ,and  as a man prepared to pay the ultimate price for his devotion to his muse  <br />This is Tavernier's tribute to jazz and its geniuses .Over half the movie is given over to the music which is always at the very least good , at at times positively Olympian .It is also a wonderful evocation of the  life of a bye-gone era and a moving human drama  <br /> <br />In all conscience I am unable to recommend this movie to non jazz fans as they will probably find it too slow and self -indulgent for their tastes  .To jazz lovers -and those willing to give the slighly left-field movie a go ,prepare to be intrigued ,moved and absorbed . <br />Simply wonderful but maybe a tad specialised for some tastes
B000002B30|4.0|It always amazes me at times, about a longevity and a cult of any singer that still continues to influence, and conjure up so much in the way of music and the music industry. Yet out of all of those who really have done it, there are very few that are still recording today. None of those few really definitely can sum that up the easiest way possible than Bruce Springsteen. Throughout his career he has had some highs and lows, but also has managed to stay true to himself, with selling out in anyway possible. Ironically when it does come to hits collections out there, even the boss does have a adequate collection to boot.<br /><br />Bruce Springstten's 1995 Greatest Hits record is a compilation that features 18 tracks that reflect upon Bruce's high points in his career. Yet, with all that, there are just so many down to Earth songs that really reflect about America and in his own words including such great songs as Born In The U.S.A., the Oscar-winning Streets Of Philadelphia, Glory Days, the breakthrough 70's track Born To Run, and other great classics.<br /><br />The album does reflect well about the high points of Bruce, but with so many advantages, there are a few disadvanyages with this collection. The album does overshadow his first two albums, Greetings From Asbury Park and The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle, as well as other great songs from his career including I'm On Fire, One Step Up, Tunnel Of Love and his true Rock N' Roll classic Rosalita. However, the album includes a short lived reunion with the E Street Band on tracks like This Hard Land, the Jerry McGuire track Secret Garden, and Murder Incorporated, a unreleased song from the 80's that made its release on this hits collection.<br /><br />Honestly, for Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits record, it is a good collection, but I really suggest the 2003 Essential Bruce Sprinsteen. It is a much better collection, that really reflects the career of \\"The Boss\\". Yet, with so many artists who sell out, and act like they are just manufactured tools of the industry out, Bruce Springstten still remains true as a icon today.<br /><br />Cover: A<br /><br />Compilation: B<br /><br />Remastering: B-<br /><br />Overall: B-sell out, and act like they are just manufactured tools of the industry out, Bruce Springstten still remains true as a icon today. <br /> <br />Cover: A <br /> <br />Compilation: B <br /> <br />Remastering: B- <br /> <br />Overall: B-
B000002WCJ|5.0|**(Do not even attempt to call Helloween as a \\"hair metal\\" band, because they are not, and never were to begin with.  Helloween = POWER METAL, and definitely are not pathetic 80's Pop Metal.  Get the facts straight before you make claims that are not true)** <br /> <br />Without Helloween, Power Metal would not exist. <br /> <br />Helloween is probably the first Power Metal band ever.  The \\"Helloween EP\\" tape came out in 1983 or 1984.  Some people say that MAIDEN was the first Power Metal band.  Not true, because MAIDEN did not get into all-out Power Metal until 1985 or 1986.  So because of that, Helloween is the first Power Metal band ever. <br /> <br />Helloween and SCORPIONS helped start all European Rock and Metal music.  Where do you think all the European Rock and Metal bands came from, or got their inspirations from?  (Especially all the Power Metal bands).  I can think of at least 10 European Power Metal bands that sound very similar to this one CD. <br /> <br />This CD is the 2nd Part of the \\"Keeper\\" CDs from the band. <br /> <br />This CD did have a more Pop-feel to it than their earlier CDs did, but the singing is still outstanding and so is the guitar playing. <br /> <br />Just like with another German band called Freedom Call (who by the way, sounds almost exactly like early Helloween anyways), this music style is basically \\"Happy Metal.\\"  Music to make you feel good, and has a fun-feel to it. <br /> <br />\\"Keeper Part 2\\" is Kai Hansen's last CD with the band for good. <br /> <br />Kai Hansen broke away from the band right after this CD, and started his own band called:  Gamma-Ray.  He even gives his declaration wanting to break away from Helloween in the song \\"I Want Out\\" on this CD. <br /> <br />The odd thing about it is, many Gamma-Ray songs that Kai Hansen will later on record for many Gamma-Ray CDs will sound very similar to the songs on this one CD.  Go figure? <br /> <br />I saw the one review on here that said that the \\"Keeper\\" title song has aSpiritual context to it.  I agree, it does.  It does remind me of Jesus defeating the lying snake of a devil, and Him getting the Keys of Authority out of the devil's claws.  That might not be what the guys in the band intended for the song to say, but it sure comes across that way. <br /> <br />Not a bad song on the entire CD. <br /> <br /> <br />You can not go wrong with \\"Keeper Parts 1 and 2\\" CDs at all, if you like outstanding Rock or Metal music, and if you want to know the root of ALL European Power Metal, and the root of ALL Power Metal in general. <br /> <br /> <br />If you get the \\"Keeper Part 2\\" CD, also make sure you get \\"Keeper Part 1\\" CD as well.  Both CDs are outstanding awesome Power Metal from the first Power Metal band ever. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like what you hear from Helloween here, also check out: <br /> <br />Freedom Call - \\"Live Invasion\\" 2 CD set, all Gamma-Ray CDs, all Sonta Arctica CDs, all Stratovarius CDs, all Rhapsody CDs, all Blind_GuardiaN CDs, and many other Power Metal bands. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|4.0|And it's actually 3 and a half, I'm just rounding up. I think this movie good, nothing special, Tom Cruise is awesome as a bad guy and Jamie Foxx is a perfect pick for a good guy, but the movie is just corny and drags on too long. It's interesting, and the performances are great, but it's too long, corny and way over-hyped. It's a good movie if you just want to relax, so I'm reommending it, but hardly.
B0006Z2LH4|1.0|The first Cube film is good, despite some cheesy acting, it is a good simple film. Then came a long the abomination Cube 2 Hypercube... then the movie Cube Zero, and the creator promises a better film than Hypercube. It's not a better film, and it is super boring. It feels like a sci-fi channel original movie, and the acting if horrible. It's worse than acting in Farscape.. well it's close... please, for people that like the original, do not view this film. Just keep liking the original and do not watch this movie.
B0000AQS6U|5.0|This double album is great. It goes from her 60s hits up to the terrific \\"Different Kind Of Love Song\\" The live cd was taken from her Miami concert in 2003, recorded in front of more than 15,000 persons. She sings really good (excellent)live, and I could prove it when I went to the first of three SOLD OUT concerts in Mexico City...she was joined by more than 50,000 persons. I think Cher is the best female singer of our times...and I really hope  that someone at Warner Records can read this: Its a shame that WB doesnt give a decent worldwide publicity campaign  to Chers work. I guess they prefer wasting money with other singers like the \\"M\\" [...], and really its not worth...any way, cher will always be the Real Diva.
B0000013GT|5.0|OUTKAST'S ATLiens is one of the most experimental, explosive and moving albums in Hip Hop history. I know a couple of people put off by the video for \\"Elevators\\" but you could not deny that the song was dope.  Outkast now is house hold name, but in 94 Outkast was very underated.  First time i listen to the album complete i almost cried.  The music is so beautiful, but the words are so heartfelt.  The last two songs are unlike anything i had herd at the time, and still holds 10 years later.  This made Outkast more than just a Hip Hop act they were something more, It also led the way for the classic \\"Aquimini.\\" A+
0451525884|5.0|I've read Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding several times, and my favourite part in it is when Bridget meets Mark Darcy for the first time and mentions: 'it struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party'. She talks about Mr Darcy a lot, and it made me even more curious, so I decided to read the novel.<br />I haven't been disappointed at all.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I've heard some bad stuff about this movie. The couples aren't given that much screen time etc. But I was surprised, when I sat & watched it, with the wind howling outside, and found myself really enjoying it, and laughing along.<br /><br />Apart from each couple's separate storylines, the movie is also a spot-the-celebrity kinda thing, and there's some surprising cameos in there. Some of the more recognisable cast include: Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Kris Marshall, Martin Freeman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Laura Linney, Junior Simpson, Alan Rickman, Ant McPartlin, Declan Donnelly, Billy Bob Thornton (playing an almost spot-on US president!), Michael Parkinson, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer (for her one-minute cameo, she received a reported £200,000), Nancy Sorrell, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards.<br /><br />My favourite character in all of this was Martin Freeman for definite. I'd only seen him before in the UK show, The Office, but he actually looked really cute in this! His hair was a bit messed up, and he got his kit off! It's amazing, cos he's filming what looks like a very bad porn movie, and they're faking all the positions etc, and him & the girl get together by the end of the movie! The girl also appears topless, which is no doubt to make the guys watch it. Martin is terrific in this movie though.<br /><br />I got quite soppy at the wedding scene with a very blonde and very skinny (b*tch) Keira Knightley. That scene was so romantic and I think I went all gooey inside!<br /><br />The whole scenes between Colin Firth and L&uacute;cia Moniz, are hilarious! There's quite a few subtitles, but they're so funny! The lake that L&uacute;cia and Colin are \\"swimming\\" in was actually only 18-inches deep and they had to kneel around and pretend to be in deeper water. It was also over-run by mosquitoes and Colin Firth was badly bitten and his elbow swelled up to the size of an avocado, requiring medical attention. This scene is the funniest:<br /><br />[Aurelia jumps into the lake with hardly any clothes on to save Jamie's book]<br />Jamie: Oh God, she's in. And now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.<br />[takes off his sweater]<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] [...]. It's cold.<br />[Jamie falls in]<br />Jamie: [...]. It's freezing! [...]<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] This stuff better be good.<br />Jamie: It's not worth it you know, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] I don't want to drown saving some [...] my grandmother could have written.<br />Jamie: Just stop, stop.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?<br />Jamie: I really must do copies.<br />[beat]<br />Jamie: You know, there'd better not be eels in here. I can't stand eels.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] Try not to disturb the eels.<br />Jamie: [screams in shock because of the eels] Oh God, what the hell is that?<br /><br />Hugh Grant plays virtually the same character he did in Bridget Jones (except he's the prime minister), including calling Margaret Thatcher a \\"saucy minx\\", and making some little jokes about the person before him, having a scary wife, and horrible children.<br /><br />When David arrives at No. 10 Downing Street, his tie changes 11 times between shots when meeting Natalie. Apparently, Hugh Grant had changed his tie after a post-lunch nap and no one noticed at first. They decided to \\"play with it\\" and went all out and changed the tie 11 times just for the heck of it.<br /><br />I've seen quite a few reviews, that complain about the ending, but so what if the ending is left hanging? It's the exact same way as life, nothing ever ends perfectly, nor are all the loose ends tied up.<br /><br />What could be done with this movie, is make little spin-offs, and see what happened with all the characters. Of course, then they'd probably be a pile of trash. But there are some of the characters I would like to follow up.<br /><br />Despite the greatness of the movie, it does have its flaws. Why are almost all the women servants or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film! And the more ambition they tend to show (sexual or work-wise), the more villainous they seem. This movie has a very old-fashioned view of the sexes. Why are there no gay couples? With so many couples present, it could have been easily done.<br /><br />I doubt many guys would like to see this movie, and would probably moan right the way through - and not in the way you would like, believe me! This is an outright girly movie, something to spend time cuddled up to your duvet/cuddly toy, with hot chocolate, or having a girly afternoon with your mates. Make your guy watch on the promise of something else later.s or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film!

B0002OERI0|2.0|I've never been compelled to write a review on Amazon until I started reading some of these reviews for American Idiot.  Ok I listened to the cd 3 times, I gave it a fair chance.  But cmon people, I swear I heard 4 power chords the whole album.  Even Tre Cool falls way short on this effort.  Thats the only talent Green day had going for them.  No song sticks out on this album, it all sounds like what we expect from the modern pop rock movement.  Over produced, dull sounding garbage.  Thank you

B0000E5NPZ|5.0|I read the novel well over thirty years ago, in Europe, when I was fifteen, but did not get to watch the movie until tonight. I wanted to see it for a sit-down stroll through memory lane, and never expected to be touched by the story and its morale. You see, when I first read the novel, I did not care about it; I was then a fifteen-year old who was dealing with a much harsher existence than the seventeen-year old Cecile's (marvelously portrayed by Jean Seberg), who had the freedom and the money to drive her own car, to smoke, to dance, and hobnob between Paris and the French Riviera with her soft-hearted, caring, and still a child-at-heart, dad. Thus her poor little rich girl's woes, primarily consisting of keeping her dad's love to herself, was boring as well as infuriating. I realize now that I got to read the novel again to reexperience the characters in the manner originally presented by Francoise Sagan.  From the film version I watched tonight, I did not get the sense that it's >>>an accurate account of the empty, amoral, flamboyant and insensitive life in the French \\"high-life\\" during the late 50's/early 60's.<<<<  The core of the story is a father (debonair David Niven) and teenage daughter (beautiful imp, Jean Seberg), who lead charming lives and have the good fortune of being each other's friend and confidante. I can't recall a reference as to the manner of the mother's death (re-reading the novel ought to help in that), but neither the father nor the daughter seem to mourn her loss. However one may easily surmise that the father's affectionate and  tolerant treatment of his daughter is his way of filling the void of a mother in her life. Although a charming and prolific playboy, he always makes sure that his daughter knows she is number one in his heart, and Cecile never feels threatened by any of his short-lived paramours.    So, on that fateful summer, father and daughter land on the French Riviera for their customary fun-filled R & R. But then a dark cloud appears on Cecile's sunny skies: Anne (portrayed by Deborah Kerr), beautiful, intelligent, elegant, a successful career woman willing to leave her profession (she is a respected fashion designer) to be a perfect wife and astute stepmother; much to Cecile's chagrin her father falls for Anne's charms, pops the question and Anne answers in the affirmative. Overcome by jealousy and the fear of losing her careless butterfly lifestyle, Cecile hatches a diabolic plot to prevent their marriage from occurring. And unfortunately, she succeeds, with tragic consequences.    The morale, of course, is: don't mess with Fate! On the other hand, Cecile, having faced her darker side, builds a wall around her heart to keep herself from feeling pain and sorrow, yet as you watch the closing scene, you will understand that the wall is transparent, letting us look into Cecile's soul as she sits in front of her mirror, taking off her make-up with cream, and by now the scene has reverted to black/silver/white...tears are running down her cheeks... and, ah, tristesse.... bonjur, and bonnuit, always.    The cinematography is superb, the opening and closing scenes are various shades of gray and silver, and then as the story flashes back the French Riviera comes alive in glorious colors, Jean Seberg is just beautiful,her portrayal of Cecile deserving of respect, David Niven sophisticated in an easy-going, warm-hearted way, Deborah Kerr's Anne is perfection, and Juliette Greco, playing herself as the night club singer crooning Bonjour Tristesse in her unique style, a real treat. Be prepared to be surprised at how much you will feel touched, and enjoy.    PS: French author Francoise Sagan, had made international headlines when she was a teenager with her first novel, \\"Bonjour Tristesse\\". Her background was privileged, a la her heroine, Cecile's; born Francoise Quoirez to a wealthy family in Cajarc in southwestern France, Sagan - who took her pseudonym from a character in Marcel Proust's \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" - was educated in private and convent schools at home and in Switzerland. She wrote \\"Bonjour Tristesse\\" (\\"Hello Sadness\\") in 1953 while on a summer holiday from her studies at the Sorbonne. Sagan, then 18, completed the manuscript in just six weeks.  Interesting to note how the world has changed, since then... upon its release in 1954, Bonjour Tristesse created a furor in France. Some critics scorned it as a tale of \\"passionless hedonism\\" and Sagan was called immoral and was marked as symbolizing a generation of bored and blas young adults. They could not have been more wrong....
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember was a great book to read I really enjoyed it. But I did think that it was a little boring at the beginning. For about the first one or two chapters it was just basically describing everyone and everything and it just got a little hard to keep reading, but I got through it and when I read the rest of the book I was amazed. I thought it was a awesome story with great plot twists and a great ending. I'm not going to tell you what happens in the end, but I can say that it was happy, and sad at the same time. But I think that it is a very, very good book to read and espcially if you are a person who enjoys reading romance novels. Well, I overall I really liked this book, and there were really no real bad points in the book that I disliked, other than the beginning. The book was a little different from the movie. I will say that I liked the movie a little better because I think that it was somewhat easier to follow. So I think that people should defenetly read this book, it was great and god bless!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|After sitting thru this pathetic waste of time and film, I was left wondering how much Coppola paid the academy to give his kid an award. Anyone raving about this slice of nothing is pretending to have some higher level of understanding than the rest of us, or is a friend of the Coppola's. Get real. The most incredible thing about this movie is that I actually watched the whole thing. Course I listened to the Academy and figured for sure something would happen eventually so bored as I was, I sat, I watched, and I waited. But then the credits were rolling and I was just staring at the screen in disbelief. \\"That's it?!?!!??\\" Let me save you some time folks, here's the spoiler: Unhappy married man in hotel, unhappy married girl in hotel. They meet, hang out, become friends, talk, have a few drinks, and even do karaoke!, and then he goes home. WOW! Let's give it an award!? Anyone could have written this lame script. This snorefest lacked any shred of imagination (no wonder Sofia was so surprised that she won) and is an insult to the nominees that lost. If it wasn't written by a Coppola, it wouldn't have made the nominee list. In fact, it probably would never have been filmed at all. My advice, skip it. It's more interesting to watch paint dry.

0321213351|5.0|Refactoring To Patterns brings together the Patterns movement, and the practice of Refactoring commonplace in the Agile community. Whereas the original Gang of Four book told us what patterns were, what sort of problems they solved, and how the code might be structured, Refactoring To Patterns illustrates how, why and when to introduce patterns into an existing codebase. <br /> <br />The opening chapters cover the background, introducing both refactoring and design patterns, and the context in which the book was written. This gives the reader a clear overview of what is involved in Refactoring to Patterns, and paves the way for the refactoring catalogue which makes up the bulk of the book. <br /> <br />The catalogue is divided into chapters based on the type of change required --- is this a refactoring to simplify code, generalize code, or increase encapsulation and protection? Each chapter has an introduction which gives an overview of the refactorings contained within that chapter, followed by the refactorings themselves. These introductions clearly illustrate the principles and choices which would lead one to follow the refactorings that follow. <br /> <br />Each refactoring starts with a brief one sentence summary, and before and after structure diagrams with reference to the structure diagrams for the relevant pattern in the Design Patterns book. The sections that follow then cover the Motivation for using this refactoring, step-by-step Mechanics, and a worked Example, relating back to the steps given for the Mechanics. Finally, some of the refactorings finish with Variations on the same theme. The examples are all pulled from a small sample of projects, which are introduced at the beginning of the catalogue section, and help illuminate the instructions given in the Mechanics section. The mechanics themselves are generally clear, and broken down into small steps --- sometimes smaller steps than I might take in practice, but I think this is probably wise, as large steps can easily confuse. Finally, the Motivation sections do a good job of explaining why one would choose to do a particular refactoring, and any pitfalls to doing so --- the \\"Benefits and Liabilities\\" tables provide a useful summary. <br /> <br />This book is well written, easy to read, and genuinely useful. It has helped me put some of the refactorings I do into a larger context, and given me insight into how I can integrate patterns with existing code, rather than designing them in up front. As John Brant and Don Roberts highlight in their Afterword, this is a book to study, the real benefit comes not from knowing the mechanics, but by understanding the motivation, and the process, so that one may apply the same thinking to other scenarios not covered by this book. If you are serious about software development, buy this book, inwardly digest it, and keep it by your side. <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.
B00000F169|5.0|There have been so many bad science fiction spoofs - you must see this movie to appreciate what the genre is supposed to be! Sure, the production is cheap and the screenplay would never win any awards, but the characterizations are just hilarious.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|As a person who was a child of the late 70s and early 80s, I'm seriously getting sick of the use of nostalgia to generate \\"buzz\\" in current pop culture entertainment. <br />The same goes for this movie. <br />Supposedly this film is set in present day, but the backdrop is right out of the early '80s. Napoleon's brother uses a computer which looks like an original Apple, yet he is chatting with babes on the Internet. That scene and many others like it are par for the course here. <br />Yeah, I realize this film is absurb and I realize it asks you to suspend reality. Yet, it tries so hard to be a genuine reflection of high school life.  <br />If being a mean and hateful person - along with consistently lying - was part of your high school experience, well I guess this movie fits you to a T.
B00000F169|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters (with the \\"Hardware Wars\\" short) and couldn't stop laughing.  The burgeoning genius of Carpenter and O'Bannon is unsullied by big budgets full of perfect special effects and surround sound.  The very crudity of the props, special effects, and visuals makes you think maybe you could have made this film (if only you were that imaginative).  Though some may criticize the acting, it fits perfectly in the period, and anyway, comedy (dark or otherwise) is all about timing, not emotional nuance...(\\"one day they'll see these tapes and then they'll be sorry!...)  Granted, it helps to have grown up in during the development of the modern science fiction space opera, but if my 13-year old son can like it, so can you!

B0006399FS|2.0|My first concert ever was U2 during the Unforgettable Fire tour and I've bought all their music.  Unfortunatley, \\"How to...\\" rates as one of their more inconistent efforts.  The uptempo numbers-Vertigo, Crumbs, All Because of You, City of Blinding Light--are pretty good.  Musically, some of the tracks sound too similar and the slow numbers are just unbearable.  Are they out of ideas?  Lyrically, this has to be their worst showing.  Some of the words literally make me wince.....\\"her face matched her psychology.\\"  What does that mean?  Maybe their next release (which will be in 2010 or so) can raise the bar again.

0767834739|1.0|Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a gargantuan bomb of a movie and why do you ask is beacause it is just plain horrible. Bad writing, acting and the action set pieces are mind numbingly crappy and non exciting. This sequel takes place right after the original in the desolate town of Racoon City where the virus has spread even more and the inhabitants become zombies. Just like the first one this suffers but the first one was a notch better in my mind. Starring Mill Jovovich (Resident Evil, The Fifth Element), Oded Fehr (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns), Mike Epps (Next Friday, Friday After Next), Jared Harris (I Shot Andy Warhol, Igby Goes Down) and Alan Tudyk (28 Days, Tv's Firefly). I hated everything about this movie and the Nemesis creature was laugh out loud funny. This bored the hell out of me. I gotta say this goes down the line for being so retarded like Van Helsing was. The chick who played Jill Valentine and the others sprouted some awful dialouge. \\"im good but not that good\\" please. For die hard fans of Resident Evil but beware, these people dont know how to make a good movie if it bit them in the ass. I don't really care what other's say..hey, at least I got some taste. This movie is for no-brainers. <br />
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|What I have to say has probably been said more or less in countless other reviews.  Nevertheless, I felt compelled to write this review for two reasons:  <br /> <br />(1)After seeing the film in theatres for the first time, I was extremely dissappointed.  I entered the theatre expecting \\"The Illiad\\", but instead got a two hour story called \\"Troy.\\"  Having not read \\"The Illiad\\", I was almost embittered by the dissappointment, believing it was another insipid Hollywood production.  Eventually my elitist rage subsided and, upon its release on DVD on Jan. 4th, I decided to reconsider the movie's worth and view it again.  My feelings of contempt converted into appreciation of the storyline and the craft needed to create an epic story.  I began to appreciate the film from many different angles because I did not view it through the perspective of someone who is under the delusion that he has read and understood Homer's \\"The Illiad.\\"  \\"Troy\\" was a story, not an attempted translation of Homer's epic poem into film.  For me, it was the first time I ever considered seeing a film I despised again, and to have gone out of a second viewing with a fresh appreciation of the story seemed quite extraordinary. <br /> <br />(2)My father, who had actually read the tomb written by Homer, wrote off the film prior to having ever seen it.  I tried to express to  him that the film (or any film, for that matter) that presumed to encapsulate an epic story such as the Illiad within a 2-3 hour time frame would be superficial at best, confused and murky at worst.  But he remained convinced that the film \\"Troy\\" was not worth seeing because it paled into comparison to the \\"Illiad.\\" The question I never asked him, and that should be asked by anyone responding to a criticism like this is: where does the comparison to Illiad come from?  The producers of the movie claim only that it was \\"inspired\\" by The Illiad. Why compare a movie to a story that, while serving as a source of inspiration, is independent from the kind of story the director (wolfgang peterson) wanted to tell?  Can we not value \\"Troy\\" in its own right? <br /> <br />If you have read the Illiad, watch Troy with a blank slate.  If you have not read the Illiad, watch Troy from the perspective of someone who has not read the Illiad and does not pretend to understand its signficance.  If you can do neither, then this movie will be a dissappointment, whether you are familiar or unfamiliar with Homer's Illiad.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I was very hyped about this movie in the months before it came out.  I love Brad Pitt--not only is he easy on the eyes, he's a really good actor who usually does smart, good movies.  Orlando Bloom is awfully pretty and really good at the overly heroic idiot (Pirates of the Caribbean, anyone?) and I thought that would be perfect for Paris, who is the idol of idiot worshippers.   <br />  Haha boy was I disappointed.  At first I was VERY upset about how they took the story of the Iliad and smashed it against an expensive wall so it shattered to millions of tiny, irreparable pieces.  No gods?  What?  How?!  Hell, I did an essay comaparing the gods' petty tiffs with the reality of deaths of their mortal counterparts.  The Iliad (and Troy) is simply deeply hampered without the gods.  And with a budget like they had, they could have done the gods and done them well.  Instead we get an extremely buff and tan Achilles pounding the theme of glory and immortality of the mortal through legend and whatnot throughout the entire freaking film.  Perhaps this was made for the intellectually challenged, but those of us with a brain really got sick of it.  God!  Subtlety people!  It exists, and is really quite amazing when done correctly.   <br />  Anyway, lets forget that the classic story of the Iliad even exists.  Lets look at this seperatly as just a movie.   <br />  I still say it sucked.  Brad Pitt's acting was subpar at best (why, Brad Pitt, why?  I respected you!) and Achille's storyline with Briseis was cornball central.  Oh!  She taught the big strong man how to feel!  It was completely fake.  And while we're talking about fake, lets move on to Paris and Helen.  Paris is a douchebag.  Helen should hate him.  Paris is NO reason to go into a ten year war.   <br />  OMG and the ending . . . what a horror that was.  It was so cheesy.  The movie overall was just so stupid over and over and over.  And come on, Hollywood.  Patroclus was not Achilles cousin and you know it.   <br/>  If I had it my way, The Iliad and The Odessey would both be made into huge, epic films with three parts each so you can really get the majority of the storyline.  There would be gods, Paris would be hated by everyone, and Achilles would be shown for the ass that he really is.  The Iliad was supposed to be about Achilles wrath.  Troy ended up being a very weak movie and had me laughing.  I don't think your supposed to laugh at epic dramas.
B0002V7ODI|1.0|Quite simply, one of the worst movies I have ever had the unfortunate luck to sit through.  There are always loyal fans for every possible movie, however, this is so bad, that for those of us just looking for a good casual movie to view on a lazy Saturday night I felt compelled to write this to keep people from wasting time they can never get back.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie caught my attention for so many reasons. Critical acclaim, comparisons to Rushmore, and the fact that it's quirky and offbeat. Who can resist the promise of respite from the juggernaut of drek crushing the minds and souls of the multiplex patrons?     What a complete disappointment. Other than the opening credits sequence, this movie has not a one redeeming quality. I hate to paint broad brushstrokes and subject people to simple labels, but I simply can't help myself here. This move is liked only by people who take delight in being different and counter-cultural JUST BECAUSE. The reason why I can say this is that I used to be like that.    But then I grew up. Just because it's \\"not Hollywood,\\" does not make a movie de facto good. This movie is a textbook example of that principle. The diaglogue is inane, the characters are underdeveloped, and every joke--every joke--falls flatter than a Euclidean plane. When you have to try this hard to be clever, you aren't.    The irony is that Napoleon and his buddies wear a constant expression of boredom and ennui. Ostensibly, this is a result of their environment. More realistically however, it only reflects the sentiments of the audience. Avoid, avoid, avoid.
0441003257|5.0|This book was recommended to me by another Douglas Adams fan, and it certainly continues beautifully in the Hitchhiker's tradition. I was in the in the middle of two books at the time, but once I read the first page of Good Omens the others collected dust.    Gaiman and Pratchett may share Adams's talent for fusing comedy and philosophy in a sci-fi/fantasy setting, but they have their own distinctive style.  They poke fun at everything from ancient prophesies to everyday annoyances, throwing in song lyrics and wordplay, and leaving you snorting out loud.  You'll want to read it more than once to make sure you caught all the in-jokes. The book is often pigeonholed as simply making fun of the Bible (which it does), but it has its own message of positive humanism and infinite possibility.    The duo's greatest accomplishment though, were the book's unlikely heroes: Crowley, the demon with common sense who's a softie deep down, and Aziraphale, the angel with a decided lack of arrogance, love of books, and distaste for righteous smiting. These two friends both like Earth, each other, the humans, and the whales a lot more than either of their Sides would deem proper.  So they've decided to thwart the real evil: the impending destruction of the world for the sake of the cosmic chess game.     This book is truly a favorite of mine, and all I can say is I hope Neil and Terry write together again soon.  Until then, I'm off to check out their separate works.
B00069L0XG|5.0|now for some of you who went to the movie theater and saw this it maybe kinda confusing first of watch the first second they are making a third that will tie everything in but anyways this one was sweet and had way better action than the first i recommed getting this to add to your collections of horror movies (The Blob a classic ohh yea)
B000001F5F|5.0|It's a shame--and puzzling--that U2 doesn't release more proper live albums, preferring to put them on tape and DVD (Zoo TV tour, POPmart tour, ATYCLB Boston and Ireland shows).  Then again, Blood Red Sky is not really a proper live album, far from it.<br /><br />Note that this album is a sonic tapestry of songs from three different shows, including the 1983 Red Rocks show captured on the tape Under a Blood Red Sky (that show is pretty much complete).<br /><br />As for what is here, it sounds excellent.  There is a the usual cleanup and a couple of flub-corrections (mis-cues, remixing, etc) but that is typical of most any band (though it's sometimes unfortunate to mess with the original tapes).  The result is an excellent beginning-to-end album.  It clocks in at under 40 minutes though (remember, this is a vinyl album), and the show, and indeed this era, is begging for a longer, complete set.  The version of Sunday Bloody Sunday is famous and thundering ('this is NOT a rebel song'), and the closer, 40, is classic.  It's all good--the versions of 11 O'Clock Tick Tock and Electric Co have tremendous energy.  Again, the sound is excellent, very well produced.<br /><br />All in all, this is a classic live album from the time.  I'd also recommend picking up a bootleg from this era, even earlier (not difficult, with U2 being one of the most bootlegged bands, rightly so).  The energy and emotion in the songs still comes across strong over 20 years later.  The youngsters playing on this album would go on to remain relevant in rock well into the next millenium, no small feat.<br /><br />In this day of iTunes and digital speed, I don't know if U2 would bother with a full on re-release of this disc (extended or complete) but either way, they should bring out more of the live shows they're known so well for.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Okay, this guy right under my review (I think) doesn't really know what he's talking about, first off.  11th Hour is an amazing song, and Lamb of God is not death metal.  The guy listens to P.O.D., 311, and Creed.  Come on now.<br /><br />Anyway, this cd is amazing, and much more politically driven than As the Palaces Burn.  Whilst AtPB focused much more on individual and internal issues, this cd is more much dedicated to bringing down the evil in this country, Mr. Bush.  As far as music goes, it's very good, and rather similar to AtPB, but probably more intense.  Blythe's vocals are pummeling and throaty like ever, but this time around he's moved in another dimension, higher-pitched screaming.<br /><br />All in all, this CD is amazing, and highly recommended for those who enjoy the likes of Unearth, Mastodon, God Forbid, etc.
B0000AMRJC|2.0|I love the Godfather series, as well as Goodfellas, but this movie just didn't seem to have anything other than violence (I had similar feelings about Goodfellas, but not quite as intense).  The sound track sounds like something that you would hear in an adult film.  If you are watching it for violence only, this is your flick!  Other than that, not much good to say.  Maybe all my friends hyped it up just a little too much.  It was a let down.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Yes, Opeth has always been a sad band.  Yes, they've previously made that difinitive in their previous lyrics.  Yes, they're embracing that on their new concept album, Damnation.  Though Opeth is more or less a concept band, I feel inclined to call this a concept album.  Not only are the intense death metal features missing from this new cd, but the growling is absent also.  In fact, any intensity whatsoever is gone from this one. <br />Instead, this CD is riddled with soft, acoustic harmonies, and wonderful singing vocals. <br />My dad, one who is familiar with Opeth from my CDs laying all around the house, has even been shown this by myself.  He's a fan of Cream, Allman Bros., etc., and he really likes it.  This cd not only opens a new dimension of a fanbase for Opeth, but perhaps it'll influence more to listen to the rest of their music, if they can give it a try.
B00005JMAH|2.0|Cute but getting played, flat, mediocre plot, wait for cable if possible.  But if you can never have too many movies in your library the extras are worth it.
B00005NGZX|4.0|This CD is very good, but there are a few minor things setting it back from being a true masterpiece. <br />First off, the recording is wonderful.  Far better than those of Converge's previous efforts.  The songs are still extremely chaotic and brutal.  Unfortunately, there are one or two songs a bit lagging in tempo, kind of making this cd non non-stop brutality, which I confide in for Converge.  The lyrics are great, the incredibly high-pitched screaming is good, too.  A lot of octave work is used in the guitars, which is never a bad thing.  Makes me remember when Dillinger Escape Plan use to be good... <br />Anyway check out this cd if you're a fan of... anything 'hard,' I guess.
B00067BBSC|4.0|This is an excellent deal. You get the full TOTO live concert in digital color and sound- one of the best live shows I've seen on DVD. The playing as one might expect is absolutely stellar. Then you get the CD ( slightly shorter than the DVD but great listening for the car!)as a bonus, all for a knockdown price. Some have criticized the medley approach, but it works well within a concert context moving from one tune into another. Many of the tunes are played in almost their entirety while others are truncated but obvious enough to give the fans a real taste. How else are you going to draw from so much excellent material in one concert?<br /><br />The reservation?....the DVD extra behind the scenes of \\"through The Looking Glass \\" tour. It seems it was an excuse for some middle aged men to use profanity and to moon the camera....high jinks that I, for one could have done without. Why not do a real behind the scenes? - conversations and information about their music, their instruments - because they are obviously extreme talents, still at the top of their game. That's the reason they lose a star. I already have teenagers...I don't need to watch 50 year olds acting like it!! Anyway buy this set for the excellent DVD concert and CD and enjoy Rock at its best.
B0002XDODU|4.0|I bought this CD with some trepidation because I didn't care so much for Mutter; I found it to be fairly derivative of older bands (Led Zep comes to mind). <br /> <br />I've always thought that Herzelied was their best album: it's so raw and Til's vocals are really powerful. Reise, Reise definitely brings back the power that Herzelied evoked (Mein Teil & Moskau are fine examples), but at the same demonstrates a lot more sophistication in songs such as Amerika. In fact, it's pretty clear that the band is aware that they've achieved a kind of international cult status. <br /> <br />Very polished and clearly shows a lot of hard work. <br /> <br />Buy it: you won't be disappointed.
0316776963|5.0|This book was the funniest I've read in years! In fact, I actually laughed out loud for several minutes quite a few times. What made it so good for me was I could really relate to his family and their quirks, having grown up in dysfunction myself. Although, some things in the book touch on difficult subjects it never gets too dark, only more humorous. The chapter Big Boy was one I still think about and chuckle, but my favorite parts of the book involved his sister Amy and brother \\"Rooster\\". <br /> <br />I feel sorry for people who gave this book negative reviews based on their homophobia.  I can understand some being squeamish about the subject, and I don't judge them for that, but Sedaris never gets explicit. I don't get in this day and age the outrage over an author mentioning their boyfriend or dealing with prejudicial remarks while growing up which is the extent of the homosexuality in this book. <br /> <br />I wish there were more books as hysterical as this one. I recommend it for everyone with a sense of humor and an open mind.
B000646MNE|5.0|what a bunch of bible-pounding nonsense from reviewer \\"ben franklin\\"!! haven't you ever watched a show that you liked simply because it entertained you, it was funny? why such high moral standards? get off your high horse and get a grip: it's just a damn tv show, and a good one at that. it was real and hilarious, and it wasn't afraid to poke fun at how ridiculous its characters could be sometimes. tv shows are supposed to entertain you, not change your life. if that's what your looking for, you need to get your butt up off the couch.
B00000294R|5.0|He was way too ill.  <br /> <br />Cop this album now..
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm not a huge Zep fan, in fact, I still have doubts concerning the moral integrity of the band (check the songwriting credits on their first album). But as a musical ensemble, this was one amazingly talented bunch who took their music very seriously. Sure, the bombast is there and so is Page's notorious sloppiness, but the urgency and soulfulness of this band just shines through. Bonham's power and dexterity and Jones' multi-instrument virtuosity just blew me away, while Plant's ability to wail in tune impressed me. I'm only talking about te 1970 Albert Hall performance, mind you. No special effects or self-important poses or long, boring stadium crowd shots here, just rock and roll played very seriously and professionally. Buy this, you won't regret it.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|Hugh Grant falls for a girl with a large bottom -- fat girls around the world can now feel better about themselves. <br /> <br />Right... this movie tries hard to be uplifting, but in the end it is simply insufferable. <br /> <br />Nowhere near as good as \\"About a Boy\\" -- easily Hugh Grant's best film -- or even \\"Notting Hill.\\" <br /> <br />Pass on this load of hooey.
B0000214F0|4.0|This movie was very shocking the first time I watched it, and I could not come to any conclusions.  I think that it requires a second viewing to adjust to the naked brutality which is present in almost the entire film, but it will be worth it.<br /><br />On second viewing, I found it to be a very realistic approach to potraying Ceasar-Era Rome.  It wasn't civilized; it wasn't Athens.  It was Rome, filled with political intrigue, deceit and Emperors with near dictatorial power.  I've read Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars, and the potrayals of both Tiberius and Gaius Caligula are accurate.  Tiberius did keep a harem of young boys and girls to indulge his perverse sexual fantasies, he did have a building full of copulating couples, this was all accurate in the film, and I think the gritty way it was made in the film is correct; you are meant to be shocked and perhaps outraged at his behavior.<br /><br />The same goes for the Title character, Caligula.  If Tiberius was bad, Caligula was worse.  From killing Tiberius to violating bride and groom at a wedding to having people killed at his whim, he was certainly outrageous.  His over-the-top performance in this film was truly...fun...to watch, and the same goes with the rest of the cast, the acting is simply superb.<br /><br />One gripe is that the sex scenes added post-production by the new financier, Bob Guccione, are gratuitous and seem slightly out of place. Overall though, the movie is a enjoyable romp through the seedy underbelly of the live of Rome's most infamous Caesar.
0807261785|4.0|If you don't know it, I'll let you in on a secret: Tim Curry should be the hands down winner of any/all audio book reading awards.  From the way he \\"reads\\" Mr. Poe's coughing fits, to the way he intrepts Sonny's blurting noises, Tim Curry *makes* this audio story.   <br /> <br />Believe me - if you listen to this story read by Tim Curry and then see the movie with Jim Carrey, you'll wish there was a combination of the two: Tim Curry's voice and cadence coming out of the physical Jim Carrey. <br /> <br />As for the story itself, we tried reading this book when my daughter was about 6 or 7, but had to give up because she found it too sad & disturbing.  Now, at age 9, she finds the gothic nature interesting and is better able to read into the unfortunate events - even finding humor appropriately.  On the other hand, my 3 year old came w/us to see the movie and had problems with some of the scary moments, but from what she could understand, she seemed to enjoy the story.    <br /> <br />I would recommend this audio book for children over the age of 8 or 9, and adults. We enjoyed listening as a family.
B00005ASGG|5.0|One night years ago I ate out with two of my best friends at my favorite restaurant.  When I got home there was a Lee Marvin double feature on TCM, so I watched THE BIG HEAT and THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.  Both for the first time then I went to sleep.  Ever since then I've considered that to be the best night of my life...I'm easy to please.<br /><br />James Stewart plays Ransom Stoddard a young lawyer on his way out to Shinbone, but before he even gets there the most vicious criminal in the area, Liberty Valance, robs his stage.  Liberty beats Ransom and leaves him for dead.<br /><br />Ransom is taken under the wing of the Ericson family and their daughter, Hollie (played by the always beautiful Vera Miles), instantly takes a liking to Ransom.  Much to the chagrin of local good tough guy Tom Doniphan.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away any more of the plot, unlike the back of the DVD which gives away the ending!  I will say that this is not your average shoot-'em up like TOMBSTONE or RIO BRAVO there is a lot of character and story development here and it pays off.<br /><br />If you like Westerns or just enjoy good solid films then you have no excuse not to buy this DVD.  Just look at the cast:  John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, James Stewart, Lee Van Cleef, John Carradine, Edmond O'Brien, Strother Martin, Andy Devine, Woody Strode and Denver Pyle (Uncle Jessie!) all directed by John Ford with costumes by Edith Head!  I'm getting light-headed just thinking about it.<br /><br />D: John Ford (THE SEARCHERS, MISTER ROBERTS)<br /><br />Tom Doniphan - John Wayne (THE SEARCHERS, STAGECOACH)<br /><br />Ransom Stoddard - James Stewart (REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO)<br /><br />Hallie Stoddard - Vera Miles (PSYCHO, THE SEARCHERS)<br /><br />Liberty Valance - Lee Marvin (THE BIG HEAT, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK)<br /><br />Dutton Peabody - Edmond O'Brien (WHITE HEAT, THE WILD BUNCH)<br /><br />Marshal Link Appleyard - Andy Devine (STAGECOACH, LONESOME)<br /><br />Maj.

B0000640VN|2.0|How did Leopold come to know so much about Puccini's La Boheme  which was finished in 1896 and premiered in 1900 when he time-traveled straight from 1876 to the present?  This nagging question ruined my enjoyment of the chick flick.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles is a legend of 20th Century American music. Genius Loves Company showcases his remarkable talent in a dozen duets with an impressive array of guest artists drawn from every genre of American music from Country, to R&B, to Pop, to Blues, to Rock. From Natalie Cole, Elton John, Gladys Knight, and B.B. King, to Johnny Mathis, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, and James Taylor, Genius Loves Company is a unique CD album that will prove to be a \\"must\\" for the legions of Ray Charles fans, as well as an essential addition to academic American Music History collections.
6305127689|2.0|Yes, this film deserves credit for the technical work on the flying scenes.  I won't repeat all the reasons for not having much respect for the film (they're all here) but for those of you with sharp eyes:  Watch over Cruise's left shoulder when he's flying.  That brass wheel is a tool used to separate the main beam from the catapult when disassembling the ejection seat.  (Strike 1!)  Also - the &quot;MiG-28&quot; (AKA an American-built Northrop F-5 Tiger) has two guns, yes, but they're in the nose. (Strike 2!) Finally, anyone that reckless wouldn't be trusted with a government vehicle, never mind a fighter aircraft.  (Strike 3!)  So... its a fun movie in a comic-book sort of way, but don't take it seriously, it will only make one's head hurt.
1881273156|4.0|I liked this book a lot, and learned a lot. Dr. Chapman shows that there are different ways to love someone, and that we all respond differently to different appraoches. Sounds simple, but it's effectively told through stories from his counseling practice. I hope to put the lessons of this book into practice.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Now I am a big matrix fan, so naturally I jumped at an idea of a box set of the Matrix trilogy even though I already have all of the 3 Matrix DVDs. I must also say that I study philosophy in my free time and in college so my eyes got as wide as saucers when I heard that Ken Wilber and Dr. Cornel West were doing the commentaries on the 3 main disks. Being the friends of the Wichowskies, they are the closest you are going to get to the actual interpretations of the Matrix saga. <br /> <br />I admit that even though I am well versed in philosophy, it was straining to figure out what the Matrix was getting at. The first Matrix movie was a piece of cake, but the last two eluded me. As a result, the last two didn't seem as good as the first one. Of course, that was until I watched the Wilber and West commentarties on the last two disks. They explain the Matrix in such depth and wisdom that it is impossible not to love the trilogy. I have to warn you that you must have an above average knowledge of philosophy and religion in order to recognize the people that Wilber and West cite. It is well worth it and needless to say, I appreciate the last two movies as much if not more than the first Matrix.
B00008J4P5|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I was blown away by its sound. It reminded me of so many classic rock bands that I have enjoyed in the past. Ranging from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin, it made you think of the woodstock generation. However, after listening to this album more and more, I realized that Jack White still had his very own signature sound that can not be compared with other bands such as the Hives, Strokes,Vines,etc. He manages to write catchy songs that are sure to be radio hits and still has an amzing live sound as well. Songs such as Seven Nation Army, Black Math and Hypnotise flat out kick ass, while songs such as, Ball and Biscuit and In the Cold, Cold Night are blusey. Overall, this album should be praised by fans who enjoy originality and the classic rock of the past. A good addtion to your music collection.
B000059XUO|5.0|First, this movie may be the epitomy of good versus evil. The fact that Edgar Allen Poe's legendary morbid \\"The Raven\\" is referrenced in the script, and the overall mood,only makes this movie more a dark classic. It also successfuly removes the ability one may have to carelessly peg the hero simply a vigilante. As Brandon Lee's final movie, you can truly see his conditioning as an established, seasoned actor and his heart and soul poured into a role that is emotionally charged in itself. His death is a tragedy that we will be reminded of every time we see this movie more than any other he has made. The script is truly great at times (mediocore at others, and the ridiculous amount of bullets he has in one clip is absolutely absurd only overshadowed by the revolver with nearly 12 rounds...) The performances of the entire cast is superb. I never even knew about the comic book, but this movie is inspiring to do research. (I do hope that Top Dollars sister is not a regular because that would be a shame... she was about as entertaining as a hot brick) You can truly feel the love that Eric Draven and Shelly felt for each other. And you ultimately feel the riveting pain of their demise. You feel a shiver for each one of T Birds gang that \\"gets whats coming to them\\" at the hands of Eric. You almost shed a tear in that cemetery when he lays against Shellys tombstone and says he's coming home. Every time I am outside and see a crow, I will always remember the movie and the words spoken in the intro. Surprisingly, the crow has always been linked to the dead and their path of ascending. This is a great great movie that you need in your collection alongside the first two Batman movies, and The Goodfellas, and the other classics of our time. Make it happen...
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard Cold Play a couple years ago when their first hit \\"Yellow\\" was playing everywhere. At the time I was not listening or very interested with this band's approach. However, when I went to college, I heard \\"Clocks\\" and loved the piano piece along with the lyrics. After I owned the album and listened to its content, I found that I loved nearly every song that it contained. The songs that really stuck with me however were not the radio hits but the other tracks you never get a chance to hear. \\"Politik\\" for starters is an absolutely beautiful song to listen to, especially in the shower. \\"Green Eyes\\" is another very special song to listen to, along with the underrated \\"Warning Sign\\". I must say this is one of the few albums out there that I enjoy listening to the whole way through, along with \\"Parachutes\\" and Radiohead's material. The only thing that confuses me is when people compare this band to Radiohead, as if they are even close to being alike. Well anyways, this band is worth a listen if you want to hear something refreshing and relaxing.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|Outstanding, breaktaking, incredible 5.1 stereo, beautful costumes, wonderful musical actors is only part of the wonders of this \\"That's Entertainment\\" Trilogy.  I'll give you a brief but moving review of each film and the segment that i enjoyed the best.  Part 1:  \\"Show Boat\\" excerpt.  The color is vibrent, the sound is outstanding and they play all the best parts that i love the most.  Part 2:  You stepped out of a dream sequence.  It starts off with narration from Debbie Reynolds showing costuming then flashing to pictures of different MGM women in time to this music.  This number ends with the screen enlarging and playing the production number from Ziefield Follies of 1941 with Tony Martin singing \\"You stepped out of a dream.\\"  Part 3: The Ester Williams sequence.  What more can you say about this water beauty with a musical orchestrational number that all of a sudden opens up all stereo channels with this bellowing bass lows.  Like i said these numbers are just my favorites that i can play over and over again but this whole set is wonderful and if you have 5.1 or THX sound system you'll hear what i mean.  Now That's Entertainment!!!!
B00000I14Z|5.0|This is a great five star album. Mingus deserved as much fame as Miles Davis did, not that he was the main voice of the band but his compositions were very strong. He had a very Ellington-ish approach to composing. \\"Ah Um\\" has some of Minguses finest tunes esp the minor keyed ballad \\"Goodbye Pork pie hat\\". Mingus himself takes few solos, still when you are playing walking bass lines, you are making it up as you go along. So it's like you're soloing and at the same time you're just backing up the horns.  Horace Parlan, Mingus, and Dannie Richmond are a very fine Rhythmn section. This is just great jazz, I don;t have too many words to explain it. It is definitley in the post-bop category.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman and Batman Returns rocked solid and Batman Forever and Batman & Robin ah, they're crap. This one should be the best yet! The first time I saw a prievew for it ah, it was ok. But when I saw a 2nd I was freaken excited! But my main question is... WHO WILL BE THE VILLAIN? IT BETTER BE JOKER OR ELSE I'M GONNA CRY(I'm joking)!!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a great concert that celebrates the life of the \\"quiet one\\" that is George Harrison. A gathering of some of the greatest musicians of our time who absolutely loved George. It's a truely moving tribute to one of the greatest musicians of all time. <br /> <br />Even if you don't like the Beatles, the gathering of so many of musicians is certainly an awesome site.
B0006399FS|5.0|Simply the best.  This is an argument against buying songs as individual files because this album is so beautifully put together and strong.  There are no weak parts at all.
078401213X|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing Pi after experiencing Requiem for a Dream, one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, it was quickly apparent that Pi just isn't in the same league. Although the cinematography was beautiful, the plot was pathetic. What a shame. <br />
B00064YTMU|4.0|i mean this is hollywood people... are you entertained or not? i liked this movie...tom cruise is either getting better as an actor or its the right role for him... i think its michael mann directing him thats really the secret to his great acting in this film... mann knows how to bring out the best in an actor... like a great coach can see talent then let it run... the movie kept my interest and i was entertained!  good work hollywood
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Not as great as advertised but still above average. <br /> <br />US Championship <br />Big Show vs. John Cena <br />Cena's popularity garuanteed this one.  Good start, slow middle but a good ending got the crowd going. <br /> <br />Fatal Four-Way for the Tag Team Championship <br />RVD & Booker T vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz <br />This actually was pretty good.  These matches always have a fast pace and the ending was great.  <br /> <br />Chris Jericho vs. Christian <br />This one had a good storyline and a somewhat surprise in the end.  Good technical match.  Jericho and Christian need to be higher on the card. <br /> <br />Evolution vs. Rock'n'Sock Connection <br />Great match!  Nice to see Foley and The Rock doing their thing.  No slow spots and the chemistry between Rock and Flair is priceless.  Bit of a surprise ending here too. <br /> <br />Stacy Kiebler & Miss Jackie vs. Torrie Wilson & Sable <br />All 4 women are absolutely gorgeous but this match is absolutely pathetic and crappy.  Garbage. <br /> <br />Cruiserweight Open <br />Too many names to list but a great if not rushed match. <br /> <br />Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as special ref <br />Lots of hype for nothing.  Both men tanked this on purpose and the crowd let em have it!  They were leaving that night and just embarassed themselves. <br /> <br />WWE Women's Championship <br />Victoria vs. Molly Holly <br />Good match.  Better than the usual women's fare.  Almost WM standards and a good ending.   <br /> <br />WWE Championship <br />Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle <br />Finally Eddie gets his due.  Great technical match and a classic ending.  Should not have been before this match... <br /> <br />Undertaker vs. Kane <br />Taker's intro was just like the old days except for his appearance.  It really isn't that bad but when you hype the \\"return\\" of the deadman it better be just that.  Ok match but ending wasn't that good. <br /> <br />Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship <br />Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit <br />What else can you say?!  This is what Wrestlemania main events are all about.  Fantastic performance by all 3 with the right man going over in this one.
B000002MUN|5.0|It is so shocking that Tom Petty's greatest album was released in 93. I used to feel that Full Moon Fever was by far his best. But then i Bought Wildflowers. I listened to it all the way through and i was blown away. but i still wasnt convinced. So i listened to it again and again and again. Each time i gained more and more respect for the cd, and him. i know own all but 5 of his cds and he is pretty much all i listen too. The best songs off of Wildflowers are Wildflowers, You Wreck Me, and my favorite song by Tom Petty Crawling Back to You. and all of the songs flow together brilliantly. 5 stars for this one way to go Petty.
630522577X|5.0|What ever happen to the days when high quality movies were also really fun (Singing in the Rain, Some Like it Hot, The West Side Story)? Please, Hollywood, make more movies like this! This is my second favorite musical (after West Side Story).This movie had top production, great songs, and great acting (especially Rex Harrison). Recently movies like Moulin Rouge! And Chicago has given musicals an awakening. However, we need more! Directors can turn to movies like this and the ones I mentioned above for inspiration, because these movies were created to give the best entertainment for a short period (while doing it with a lot of style). Moreover, they are still cherished today, so there is an audience out there for these types of films. Watch \\"My Fair Lady\\" for the intelligence and style that was put into movies a while ago. I really recommend it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is by far the best WWII documentary I have ever seen. I'm in the middle of my 3rd viewing (since 1991). <br /> <br />Laurence Olivier's mesmerizing narration along with the first rate selection of material makes for an experience you will never forget. <br /> <br />Of the thoughts I've pondered by watching this series, these standout: <br />1) Never think, \\"Surely nobody could be that evil.\\" There is no abomination imagined that human beings will not do to one another.  <br /> <br />2) Humanity never learns. Lethargy, apathy, appeasement---these mindsets left unchecked in free nations almost always creates a power void, and given such an opportunity, despots take full advantage. <br /> <br />3) I am so thankful that I was born after the war. It's beyond me how that generation survived not only the war, but the tens years of economic depression that preceeded it. <br /> <br />Buy it! You will not be disappointed. <br />
B00005JN4O|5.0|I was surprised how much I loved it. It was a very subtle film, yet the quietness of it is what I found appealing. It was directed with a sense of what I could imagine how Barrie viewed things in his life. Visually the movie is very beautiful with top-notch production.  Moreover, I'm glad the director avoided being too sentimental with the material. Instead, the movie develops with emotional scenes that carry real value in the characters and the audience. This is definitely one of the best pictures I've seen recently (if not the best of the year). I also have to applaud Johnny Depp, giving a quiet performance that was very wonderful. I'm hoping it does well with the Academy Awards (a nomination for \\"Best Picture\\" with recognition towards director Marc Forster, and actor Johnny Depp). It's a visually treat and satisfies. I will not hesitate to buy it when it is released on DVD.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Until the buzz surrounding THE POLAR EXPRESS started about six months ago, I had never heard of the children's book the movie is based upon. Therefore, I had never read the book when I watched the movie. I just want to get that out in the open to begin with.<br /><br />I enjoyed THE POLAR EXPRESS. It's an entertaining movie with a lot of profound themes that, though dressed up in the finest that humanism has to offer, are really deeply religious in nature. Nevertheless, even if one is unable to extrapolate those spiritual nuances, the movie offers enough visual eye candy and action to make it worth watching and, despite the film's criticism, it is destined to become a Christmas classic.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the adventures that arrive at a young boy's house on Christmas Eve. The boy is never given a name and is listed in the credits as Hero Boy. The Hero Boy is at a critical time in his life: he is on the verge of adolescence and is having serious doubts about the existence of Santa Claus. He lies in his bed on Christmas Eve listening for the sound of reindeer bells. However, instead of bells his ears are greeted by a sound unexpected, that of a train whistle. As he looks out the window and opens the front door, he is greeted by a splendid engine pulling a train called The Polar Express. He's invited aboard by the Conductor. At first he hesitates, but then chooses to ride. And thus begins a somewhat harrowing journey that takes the boy from the top of the moving train, across a frozen lake, and all the way to the top of the world at the North Pole.<br /><br />The animation in THE POLAR EXPRESS is at times amazingly realistic. There are times in the movie where one cannot tell at all that this is a cartoon. Non-living objects are the ones that are consistently most brilliant. There are times when it is clear that the characters are cartoons and not actors, but almost all of the inanimate objects from presents, to hot chocolate, to the engine of The Polar Express itself look completely real. When presented in the moments when the human characters appear least &#34;real&#34; it is as though we are watching some strange world akin to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.<br /><br />There are several moments in the movie where the main characters partake in dangerous situations that should in no way ever be attempted in real life. Younger children might find these scenes frightening. However, in the tale the film tells, the adventures are needed. Every hero lives a life of adventure full of danger and the life lived to the fullest is one in which danger cannot be avoided.<br /><br />I did finally read the book by Chris Van Allsburg a few days after seeing the film. The book is full of incredible illustrations but is also very short (32 pages). I felt that the filmmakers did a wonderful job of expanding upon the pages of Van Allsburg's writing and illustrations. I felt that the film also did a great job of staying true to the spirit of the book, presenting the message of the book in a way that gives it even more meaning, depth, and interpretaion.<br /><br />The children's book is a simple tale about a boy's struggle to believe in Santa Claus and how he came to believe. It's a message the children love and brings back nostalgia and causes reflection in adults. The movie was created in such a way that this message is seriously expanded. The simple tale becomes a profound allegory of faith. There are messengers (the Conductor). There companions who believe (Hero Girl), disbelieve (Know-It-All), and are profoundly confused (Lonely Boy). There is the Jesus-figure (Santa) and his often unseen angels (elves). And there is also Satan (Hobo), who is allowed to ride along for the ride and tempt. Much more could be said about the religious implications of the film, but these illustrations make the point.<br /><br />Overall, THE POLAR EXPRESS is an entertaining movie. It's a different kind of Christmas movie, but one with enough substance andcharm that ensure it will become a Christmas classic. All you have to do is believe.charm that ensure it will become a Christmas classic. All you have to do is believe.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|It is no surprise that this is one of the most treasured musicals after \\"The Sound of Music\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I fell in love with the movie from the opening scene to the end. What amazed me was how technically great the movie was. The camera work was great. The choreography was some of the best I have seen. Moreover, even some of the cast members gave incredible performances (especially Rita Moreno who gave one of the best supporting performances of all time IMO). The great songs also captured me:  <br />\\"America\\", \\"Tonight\\" reprise, \\"Somewhere\\", and \\"Maria\\". <br />It came as no surprise to me that the movie won 10 Oscars (That is one short of the record) including Best Picture.  <br />The storyline was based on Romeo & Juliet, so it had a great work to build its foundation on. The way the work was transformed from Broadway to film was another advantage, preserving this masterpiece (I do not throw this word loosely) for future generations. <br />
0671027387|2.0|This is the first Dan Brown book I have read and I have to say that I am not impressed.<br /><br />The book started out good, but then turned out way overblown. It left me thinking the same thing I thought when I saw the movie Meet The Parents, how many bad things can happen to one person in such a short time?<br /><br />Overall I would say if you did not get to read this book, you really did not miss out on much.
0671027344|5.0|I have been hearing my friends praise The Perks of Being a Wallflower for quite sometime now and decided to read about it over thanksgiving break. I started it the night before thanksgiving and finished it thanksgiving mourning. I was addicted! The way that Stephen Chbosky developed Charlie's character is unique and makes the reader get very curious and attached to the realness of Charlie. I found myself crying, laughing and relating myself to his experiences all throughout the few hours that I read about Charlie's life and thoughts. It truly is a touching and memorable book that I would suggest to anyone with an open mind who is willing to step into the world of a fascinating boy.
B00000J7SS|5.0|OK, I'll be honest. I don't tend to like jazz much. I know very little of it, very little about it and what I do know hasn't made me want to scour the genre much more than I already have (and all I have is a Mahavishnu Orchestra album). But upon listening to Bitches Brew for the first time, I was so completely blown away and impressed by it I just had to hear more jazz/fusion.<br /><br />There's a lot going on. At times, multiple instruments are soloing doing their own thing and yet it all works. There are at least two keyboard players (and sometimes three), usually two bassists and two drummers. What was definately a change from the norm for me was that there was only one guitarist, but considering that the guitarist is John Maclaughin that's nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Now, as you should have guessed by now, I'm writing this review from a newbie's perspective. This review is really for newcomers to jazz, especially if they're already fans of rock (though if you're already a jazz fan then you're probably at least familiar with this album even if you don't own your own copy). And if you're a rock fan, then I'd estimate that this is a great introduction to jazz. Mahavishnu Orchestra's Inner Mounting Flame or Frank Zappa's Hot Rats may be good places to start as well, especially considering they have a more guitar dominant and at times a less busy sound. That said, neither have quite the same density to them - that huge sound this album has that completely consumes you.<br /><br />There really isn't much else to say. If you looking to get into jazz but have found some of it a little too smooth so to speak, then Bitches Brew is an album you should look at. To coin a well known saying, I don't know much about jazz, but I know what I like.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  It is such an interesting concept.  Everyone has wished at some point that they could go back in the past and change something.  This film explores the life of a boy, who when he reaches college realizes he can use his journals to go back in the past to specific events and by changing one little detail, can completely change his \\"present\\".  The \\"Chaos Theory\\" is very intriguing concept and is explored in a very deep personal level throughout the film.  A must see for anyone! My personal favorite movie of all time.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|I love the plot of the Bourne Supremacy, I love the characters, but the action scenes showed NOTHING.  Every fight and chase scene was nothing but a blur and sound effects.  Yes, these things are blurry, hurried situations, but one of the things I loved about the Bourne Identity was the fact that Jason Bourne had the ability to take a step back, asses the situation and make clear decisions. <br />I wanted to see the fight scenes.  I wanted to watch the car chases.  So, basically, I loved and hated this movie. <br />
0156027321|5.0|I wish I could say that I don't understand how one could not devour this book and love it, but alas I do understand, the world is full of half-wits. Read this book twice, it so ver beautifully written.
B00004XOWM|5.0|great album, awesome guitar riffs, and energy. <br /> <br />fred durst is a mediocre at best song writer, but the music in this album is top notch.  gotta love it.
0671027344|5.0|<br />This was a great book with many references to music and movies that made the book more relatable to, to a more knowing audience. <br />By adding references to The Smiths and Nirvana and the Rocky Horror Picture show it gave you an even more in depth look towards what you were reading, It gave you a better picture in your head and you could hear what you were reading. This book is almost to Punk Rock to say that is a coming of age story. This book is more of a kids experience in life like his first acid trip, getting high and what not. Its not really coming of age because its more of self destruction. Charlie was just a very emotional kid, he was one of those people that even when they did something wrong that the people around him wouldnt get mad because they understood that he didnt know anybetter. We were just spectators to charlies lessons in life, not his coming of age. Because he was still only fifteen and you cant really come of age at fifteen. But none the less a good hearted book with funny parts and its sad parts but very good.
0930289455|3.0|Right, firstly I would like to point out that I DO usually thoroughly enjoy work by both Moore and Bolland. It was brilliantly written by Moore speech-wise (perhaps the most acclaimed writer in the comics industry) and Bolland's artwork is top-notch, focusing on lots of oranges and reds combined with shadow to create a stunning visual experience. Shocking and disturbing, the story establishes Joker as the center of all evil in the DC universe, capable of things that no other villain could do. It jumps out at the reader with the black humor of Joker's part, and changed Batman canon in many different ways. Moore was certainly daring to attempt something like this, especially back in 1988.    But. And yes, there is a big but....    What was the REAL point of this book? Once you've finished it (which doesn't take long: it seems terribly short) you put it down with a nasty taste in your mouth and a sense of amazement at how far Moore dared to push the limits of Batman's personal life and the world around him. Without giving any spoilers, it seems sort of like Moore only wrote it for controversy, not only because of the graphic (and often perverse) violence, but because he wanted to go into detail over Joker's unknown history. The book has a strong start with Joker's escape from the prison and his first horrific deeds. Then it sort of spirals into a dark hole where the writer wasn't sure what to do and so put in a bit of babbling philosophy about insanity from Joker's point of view. Then the end is very strange. I won't explain it fully, but it seems to suggest that Batman has gone insane, which basically turns the entire previous DC continuity upside down.     On that note, I felt the Batman character was written poorly, which is a VERY strange thing coming from Alan Moore's pen. He can usually craft any character excellently. But this Batman seemed to not only have a dull and moody personality, but was completely outshone by the Joker's much larger and more complex part. The Dark Knight was also portrayed as being somewhat weak. In one point Joker is about to strike Batman over the head with a piece of wood. Batman flails and fumbles, saying \\"Don't...\\" Since when was Batman ever shown to be as useless as this? The title should have been \\"Joker: The Killing Joke.\\"     Conclusion? The Killing Joke was a very good idea and to be fair, Moore handled it better than any other writer ever could have. However, it came across as an author's trip to mess about with the Batman universe and cause controversy, rather than the familiar nature of DC comics.     3 stars out of 5. 1 star for the excellent artwork, 1 star for Joker's part, and 1 star for Moore taking a fair stab at something that any other writer would cringe away from.
1563898586|5.0|Being not a great fan of Moore, I was told by a friend this was his best work. He was right! This is the best Moore work I've EVER READ! I think it even surpasses Watchmen. Its better than Vol. 2, and is really action packed, funny and exciting! <br />A Moore classic!  <br /> Despite being so good, I warn you it is quite adult. Although not being as \\"romantically\\" graphic as Vol. 2, it is EXTREMELY gory, spraying guts, flying heads and all, and is a tad fruity-languaged in some parts. Still, its an excellent piece of work, and a great read.
B000002U82|1.0|My friend bought this album after buying into all the hype and boy was he dissappointed. I sat through this album and nearly fell asleep. How these boring old farts get so much credit I will never know.  <br /> <br />A, YOU CAN'T EVEN DANCE TO THIS DRIVEL <br />B, THEY CAN'T SING (COME ON ITS LIKE ANDROIDS) <br />C, DON'T BUY THIS BORING CRAP (ITS AWFUL)
B0000025RI|5.0|This is the only old album I have bought after hearing it at a friends house. Its the best pop/dance album of ALLTIME. And it deserves all the credit.     TOP SPINS ARE.    Billie Jean (serious funk and dark production)  Beat It (funky rocker with cool guitar solo)  Thriller (Catchy dance track with spooky rap)  Human Nature ( Michael sounds so gorgeous)  Wanna Be Starting Something (Awesome bassline and catchy)    This album is really great, and it still GROOVES!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|After \\"Baby One More Time\\", this is britney's second classic. She has matured to a more sexier confident popstar. What I really like about her music is its sooooo danceable and she doesn't overdo the vocals like alot of singers. Having a limited voice is somethimes a good thing. I can't stand singers screaming out the words. YOU GO BRITNEY!!!
B000002UAU|1.0|Michael Jackson's THRILLER blows this away with ease. This is nothing more than boring out of touch music critics trying to keep this coffee shop music at the top. Young people know what really grooves......
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This movie was extremely funny no matter what age you are. Obviously it was not intended for the younger audience but I really liked it. It was based off the same concept of South Park, but with the directors, you would expect this. I can't wait till it comes out on DVD so that I can have a copy of it.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|In spite of the fact that the movie deviates from the history - I suppose it will still leave a good deal of people knowing a little bit more about the Trojan War than they did before.  Perhaps some people become inspired to actually read Illiad.<br /><br />The focus is on fight scenes, rather than on dialogue, and while some people think there should've been more fight scenes, I think there were plenty.  I can't exactly imagine people from the Meditarrean area as blond, but I did like Brad Pitt as Achilles and a star of the movie.  Eric Bana, who played Hector, admittedly played his role very well, though he didn't physically appear (to me) to be a warrior, or a fighter - and he had a lot of fighting to do in this movie.  It seems it befell him to engage in many fights that were not really his own, but rather, he fought them due to some questionable decisions other people made. Peter O'Toole, who played Priam, and Julie Christie, who played Thetis - Achilles' mother, had somewhat brief, but very-well acted parts.<br /><br />Even though the main reason for the Trojan War seems to be the fact that Paris to Helen (queen of sparta and wife of Menelaus) to Troy, it is only an excuse for the war that was much wanted and only needed one good reason to be instigated.  Agamemnon already wanted to appropriate Troy (that's how the movie begins), and since his earlier attempt(s) didn't work out, he was more than happy to oblige, when his brother Menelaus came enraged because Paris took his wife.
B000059TFO|5.0|<br />Three civil rights campaigners are shot dead  by local KKK rednecks in rural 1960s Mississippi with the active involvement and complicity of the local cops. Along come two very different Federal agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) charged with finding out what has happened. They quickly rub the locals up the wrong way so Dafoe decides to bring in reinforcements. Lots and lots of reinforcements. Soon things start to get very nasty indeed. <br /> <br />This is an Alan Parker movie so it's all a bit over the top and excessively melodramatic. Perhaps too, if one is feeling unkind, a bit moralistically full of itself: of course that's somewhat inevitable given the subject matter but Parker does rather succumb to the temptation to lay it on with a trowel. But there are good reasons not to feel too unkind as there's much here to be impressed by. It's one of the best southern based movies with civil rights themes of recent-ish years, better than `Ghosts of Mississippi' and miles better than `A Time to Kill' if maybe not quite in the same league as the wonderful `In the Heat of the Night'. An extremely effective score and some first class cinematography help it along no end. But what stands out is the acting: Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker and Gailard Sartain splendidly horrid as the racist baddies, Dafoe a welcome oasis of relative subtlety and restraint as Agent Ward. But above all Frances MacDormand, characteristically perfect as Dourif's unhappily married wife and Gene Hackman putting in an utterly incendiary performance as maverick fed Agent Anderson, right up there with `The Conversation' and `Unforgiven' among that tremendous actor's most gripping and brilliantly hardcore performances.  <br />
B000002JSH|5.0|This is the next album that my other brother borrowed from one of his best friends.  The few songs I heard from their first album were good, and then I heard this album next and it has become one of my favorite albums since then.  The first song I heard GOOD LOVIN' GONE BAD with PAUL RODGERS' vocals, MICK RALPHS' guitar riffs, BOZ BURRELL'S bass guitar riffs, and SIMON KIRKE'S drumming was excellent, but the next song FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE really got my attention because I remember hearing this song on the radio during the 1970s.  Furthermore, it was the first time I heard this song in a long time.  I love the acoustic guitar intro by PAUL, the bass guitar riffs by BOZ, the harmony vocals by MICK AND SIMON, and how the electric low-volume rhythm guitar and the over-driven volume lead guitar solo by MICK sounds like the electric guitars on WHEN ELECTRICITY CAME TO ARKANSAS from BLACK OAK ARKANSAS 1971 self-titled album, which my oldest brother used to have.  Ever since then, I have considered this as the next STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, as I have considered BAD COMPANY as the next LED ZEPPELIN.  Furthermore, I love FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE a whole lot better than STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN because it is played at the same pace with a outstanding blend of an acoustic ballad and electric guitar rock, just like SHOOTING STAR.  WEEP NO MORE that features excellent sounding guitar solos, organ, and the orchestra and ANNA (my least favorite song) with the FENDER RHODES piano, organ, and harmony vocals are good piano ballads, but the other piano ballad CALL ON ME is really my favorite with MICK'S guitar solo and PAUL'S voice that sounds the best on this song.  DEAL WITH A PREACHER and WILD FIRE WOMAN (similar to SHOOTING STAR) are excellent guitar rock tunes.  Plus, the harmony vocals of MICK and SIMON also give their music a refreshing sound.  I love to play a lot of their music on my FENDER strat guitar, especially FEEL LOVE MAKIN' LOVE.  More importantly, I also love BAD COMPANY better than LED ZEPPELIN.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Definitely an outstanding comedy, Old School, brings to the screen the story of three buddies, played superbly by Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell, as they go through some rough times in their lives.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  Old School is simple enough, but it is frightening at how close it comes to describing people's every day lives.  To a certain extent it does bring to mind Friends with its presentation of both Comedy and Drama, but always in such a way that is both realistic and enjoyable without becoming corny or overly melodramatic.  <br />It just goes to show you that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.  In short, Old School is a must-see film! <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|look im sick of all u f'ing simpletons who just waste their time bashing out how horrible and overrated nirvana/nevermind was...it is one hell of an amazing album quite, informaly known as exeptional perfection... and f u all who bash this cuz u obviously dont know sh@# about nevermind and how revolutionary it was...kurt wasnt the greatest guitarist/songwriter.singer however he was the best in his genre and of the 90...he was an amazing guitarist(lithium and drain u has very underrated guitar recognition,  excellent riffs) songwriter (every song preety much , singer (totally unique, thats all i have to say he brought that voice to the mainstream...he didnt have the greatest pitch but he was always in tune, when he wanted to) nevermind kicks ass...
B00008EY63|4.0|A very pleasant surprise, Hellboy, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a devil that crossed over from hell through an experiment conducted during WWII, and the life he lives hunting down monsters and protecting mankind!<br /><br />I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant and entertaining movie.<br /><br />In short, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is a pretty good one.<br /><br />There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing and the X-Men, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/sci fi type of category.<br /><br />On the negative side can we not find something more original than the USUAL German/Nazi \\"bad guy\\" clich&eacute;, together with the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Russian \\"boogieman\\" leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Americans?  Is that too much to ask?<br /><br />Moreover, Selma Blair playing \\"Liz\\" was not that wonderful.  The \\"misfit who doesn't belong\\" has way too many similarities with characters from the X-Men.<br /><br />In addition, it's too bad \\"Ilsa\\" had such a small role in the film; seems like she could be a rising star...<br /><br />In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, Hellboy will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  A movie definitely worth watching!
0792841344|5.0|The original Phantasm is back, this time on DVD, and you've never seen it this way before. It is packed with extras including home video footage taken while the movie was being shot back in 1979, lengthy deleted scenes, audio commentary by director Don Coscareli and actor Reggie Bannister, theatrical trailers, and much much more. <br /> Phantasm the film presents us with a novel concept in the horror genre;funeral homes. Mortuaries, the american way of death, and bad dreams were not popular in horror movies at the time. Most horror films released during the late seventies and throughout the eighties involved slasher killings, Coscareli's movie deviates from this.  <br />  Phantasm is a must see for all fans of the horror genre. It surpasses cult classic status. Filmed by a very young Don Coscareli it has a magnificent cast and crew. It is truly an unforgetably terrifying film. A new frontier for horror-film makers.  <br />
B00005JN7O|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Giovanni Ribisi among others. <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the special effects are excellent, and the plot is way below average.   <br />Specifically, the characters are plain, weak and not original at all.   <br />There is the usual German \\"bad guy\\" clich, and together with the usual \\"doomsday machine\\" in the shape and form of a modern Noah's Arc do not help in making this film anything special or out of the ordinary.   <br />Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow is not all that great.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given (what were the writers thinking?).  To make things worse, Giovanni Ribisi who is otherwise a great actor, was presented with a very uninteresting/unoriginal character to play (the overly intelligent young scientist) with whom he could not really do much.  A bit of a waste there... <br />Furthermore, apart from the humor-or lack of it-there are major weaknesses in the story, such as when it just so happened that Dex and the other scientists were escaping their robot captors at the same time as the heroes were entering the secret stronghold, thus providing too much of a convenient coincidence for the benefit of both groups.   <br /> <br />On the positive side, the 1930's were a very good choice for the setting of the movie. <br />The film is action packed so those with a soft spot for adventure will enjoy it!  <br />In addition, they've done a very good job of giving the film the darkness that one finds in that genre of cartoon strips. <br /> <br />To a certain extent, the film is a cross between Jurassic Park and the Lost World on the one hand, and James Bond's Moonraker and the Indiana Jones trilogy on the other.   <br />Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.   <br />A shame really... <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it;  <br />No masterpiece here... <br />
0743454529|5.0|\\"(M)aybe who we are isn't so much about what we do, but rather what were capable of when we least expect it.\\"<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult is a heartwrenching story told by a multitude of amazing characters.  The plot revolves around a family whose youngest daughter, Anna, was created to be a genetic donor for their other daughter, Kate. Now 13 years old, Anna is bringing her parents to court - for the right to be medically emancipated, so that she can make her own decisions about what she does or does not have to donate - just as Kate desperately needs Anna's kidney.<br /><br />Kate was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia when she was only 2 years old. Back then, the eldest child, Jesse, was 4. Now, Jesse is a rebellious teenager; Kate is 16 and in relapse; and Anna feels both taken for granted and invisible. The father, Brian, is a firefighter with an interest in astronomy; the mother, Sara, is a former lawyer who stopped practicing when she had children. Other main characters include Campbell Alexander, the lawyer Anna sought out to try her case, and a court-appointed guardian named Julia.<br /><br />The chapters alternate between characters, always told in first-person. The only main character who doesn't speak in first-person chapters is the one at the heart of it all - Kate. Other characters of importance include Campbell's service dog, Judge, though Campbell refuses to say why he needs him; Julia's twin sister, Isobel aka Izzy; and Sara's older sister, Zanne.<br /><br />It is an absolutely beautiful story. At first, I thought that being told from all of these points of view would hurt the narrative; soon, I realized, it helped it, as Picoult is able to establish a different 'voice' for each of the characters. The bulk of the novel takes place over the course of two weeks. Flashbacks are interwoven seamlessly, mostly through Sara's eyes, but also through dialogue as people discuss the past, glimpse photographs or reveal truths about themselves . . . and others.<br /><br />Read it.

B000646MNE|3.0|I haven't purchased this set, but by my count, it'd be a lot cheaper to buy the individual seasons rather than the Complete Series box set (actually, the best deal seems to be to buy the Seasons 1-5 box set, then Season 6-I and Season 6-II individually). If the box set contains extras not found in the individual season releases, that might make it a worthwhile purchase....<br /><br />Which leads me to my question: does the Complete Series box set include something extra that you won't get if you purchase the seasons individually? Seasons 2, 3, 4, 6-I, and 6-II, contain 3 discs, and Seasons 1 and 5 contain 2 discs, for a grand total of 19 discs. Yet, the contents of the Complete Series box set is listed at 20 discs? Where is that extra disc coming from? Would anyone who has this box set care to comment or write a review on that?
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I went out and bought this DVD after first seeing 2 hours of selected material from it on PBS's \\"Great Performances\\". While the pros out-weigh the cons, there were some short-comings, mostly in the form of the absence of great material by the guitarists on the DVD and the guitarists not featured on the DVD (Jeff Beck comes quickly to mind). <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />As a guitarist who appreciates many different styles of music, I found something, if not in many cases everything, to love about the spirited playing of some of the greatest living guitarists; from John McLaughlin's jazz-instrumental tribute to the late Elvin Jones, to Steve Vai's technical wizardy on the multi-guitar shred-fest \\"I'm the Hell Outta Here\\". Eric Clapton has not lost his touch; on the contrary, \\"Slowhand\\"'s musical talent has just kept improving.  <br /> <br />The sound and video quality of the DVD is phenomenal. You can see and hear all of the playing in all it's crystal-clear glory. <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> <br />On the DVD, the first performance is Eric Clapton giving a spirited rendition of his classic, J.J. Cale-penned hit \\"Cocaine\\", but the opening performance on the TV presentation I first saw, which is not featured on the DVD at all, is Clapton performing what might be the greatest rock song ever recorded: \\"Layla\\". Words can't describe how let down I was when I got the DVD home and found that it wasn't there. The version of \\"Layla\\" he gave was what really made the concert presentation for me. The main, rock and roll part of it (the first three minutes), were, to me anyway, better than the original studio version off the album \\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\\". The latter half of the song, (the 4 minute piano, acoustic and slide guitar instrumental) was not quite up to par with the original version, which was truly beautiful, but was still amazing. Doyle Brahmall the 2nd (Eric's rhythm player for the set) does the late, great, legendary master Duane Allman proud on the solo and slide parts. Nobody can ever be as great a slide player as Duane, but here Brahmall does him even better justice than Duane's current replacement in the Allman Brothers Band, Derek Trucks (who is also an exceptional musician). <br /> <br />My final verdict:  <br /> <br />This DVD is an amazing chronicle of a historic concert festival that perhaps, in 30 years time, will be mentioned in the same breath as Woodstock (or will at least be more revered than Live Aid), but I sincerely hope that the rest of the festival will be released in new DVD installments in the very near future (especially the live version of \\"Layla\\").
B00006AUIG|5.0|...and an excellent film!<br /><br />I am scratching my head over G. Haugen's review. I, also, am a huge fan of THE OTHER, TCM, and THE SHINING, and right after viewing this, I let some of my fellow psycho-logical horror fan friends know just how highly I think of this. I am surprised to see someone with such taste give this only one star.<br /><br />Unlike most mainstream horror flicks, this one takes its time in developing the characters.<br /><br />Gordon and Bill are heading a remodeling project in an old abandoned mental institute. It is revealed early on that Gordon has been having some family problems, and Bill has been involved in some shady business. The crew members are comprised of an intellectual law school dropout, a not-so-bright, but good hearted mullet head, and a free spirit.<br /><br />Each character becomes sort of drawn to something in the building. The intellectual starts sneaking off into the basement to listen to recordings of sessions of a woman w/ multiple personalities, the free spirit discovers hidden treasure, and the mullet head can only work in a limited capacity because of fear of the dark.<br /><br />As the intellectual listens to a new session each day, the tension among the crew grows stronger, and it remains like this up to the chilling end.<br /><br />Don't worry, I didn't reveal anything. I just felt compelled to review this after reading that last review. All of you psychological horror buffs should think of this as a \\"second opinon\\"<br /><br />The features on the dvd were great. The alternate ending is worth watching.
0671004107|5.0|Contact is a *very* believable story of humans detecting and decoding the first signal recieved from aliens.  I don't want to reveal much more than that for if you are to read this book, there are so many exciting moments of mystery and discovery that unfold throughout the story.  This book is captivating from the first page to the very last sentence.  I highly recommend it to all.    For those that have seen Contact the movie already, in my opinion, the book is much better, and that is saying a lot since I thought the movie was excellent.  If you enjoyed the movie, the book will dive deeper and reveal so much more that the movie did not.    One note... Sagan spends a good deal of time setting up and knocking down anything to do with religion.  This is nothing new for Sagan (see almost any of his other books).  For some, this might feel like old hat and a bit slow compared to the rest of the book.  But it just made me crave more and more to get to the parts about the message and the amazing events that unfold after it is decoded.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I liked the movie enough to buy it, so there's no need for me to comment on the film itself.  The DVD is what annoys me.  I hate that there are previews on the disc, and I really hate that I can't go straight to the menu, I have to fast forward through these previews.  That is my biggest complaint. <br />The other thing that I really don't like is the menu graphic -- just a heart.  What a terribly boring choice.  A good movie, but an awful DVD.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|What can I say?  Clapton fan or not, this 2 dvd set is an awesome addition to one's musical collection.  Over three hours of music which still doesn't cover all of the greatness of the Festival, yet it's easily a classic dvd.  Eric, Jonny Lang, Jimmie Vaughan, Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Dan Tyminski, Doyle Bramhall II, ZZ Top, Larry Carlton, etc.  There is such a vast span of the musical forum with these artists.  Different styles, different ages, different tones, etc. <br /> <br />Some of the highlights for me. <br /> <br />First, of course, Eric.  Cocaine is rockin'.  I Shot The Sheriff shows why it's such a highlight through the years, but even more so this last tour.  If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day is a just a steamroller of the blues, and Have You Ever Loved A Woman is beautiful as always. <br /> <br />Then of course there is the blues jams.  Eric, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, and Jimmie Vaughan onstage together.  It's something to see them just having fun and is one of the showstoppers of the whole event.  Then Hubert Sumlin joins for a song, and later B.B. King is thrown into the mix as well.  This jam session basically allows for Buddy to really show off his style on Sweet Home Chicago.  And to see Buddy urging Eric on during his solo until Eric just points and him and laughs.  Classic. <br /> <br />Rock Me Baby let's us all see that B.B. King hasn't lost any showmanship even if he does approach his music from a different direction than he did 40 years ago. <br /> <br />Jonny Lang has one song on this dvd, and it's from his latest album, Long Time Coming.  The song, Give Me Up Again, is one of my favorites from the new album, so it's nice to see it live.  Jonny is one who is the future when it comes to guitar.  He's amazing for his age, and he's been just about that good since he was a teenager.  I love his expression and passion when playing.  And hopefully when you see him, if you don't know much, you'll be tempted to find out more.  Maybe he'll be one of your favorite guitarists as he is one of mine. <br /> <br />Doyle Bramhall II has one song on this dvd as well with Green Light Girl.  He gives a great performance, and you can see Eric really enjoying the song over to the side of the stage.  Why wouldn't he?  Doyle is fantastic! <br /> <br />It was good to see Santana for one song which brought out Clapton again.  You can tell they really enjoy playing together, and the song rocked the house. <br /> <br />J.J. Cale gave two nice performances with After Midnight and Call Me The Breeze.  Clapton played guitar on both songs, and right before After Midnight Cale tried to get Eric to sing.  You can see Eric shaking his head and saying no.  I guess that goes back to him enjoying being the sideman for a bit of time. <br /> <br />One person I discovered while watching this dvd was Dan Tyminski.  I had heard his music before with I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow, but I guess I never paid a lot of attention.  Naturally, being at the show, he's a good guitarist, but I loved everything about the song including the guitar work.  He also did a song called Road To Nash Vegas which isn't too bad. <br /> <br />ZZ Top were very good, but I thought for an ending it could have been better.  At least feature one different ZZ Top song over the very well known Tush and La Grange.  Speaking of ZZ Top it's too bad the final night's pending storm stopped their stage time with Eric.  That would have been killer to end the dvd I'm sure. <br /> <br />It goes on and on -- Rocky Mountain Way - Joe Walsh, Neighborhood - David Hidalgo, Josie - Larry Carlton, Steamroller - James Taylor w/ Joe Walsh, etc.  It could have kept going such as Eric and Jeff Beck doing Cause We've Ended As Lovers which was omitted along with other performances.  All in all a dvd well worth the money.  Besides the performances their is artist interviews, photo gallery, and you can access solos of the songs.   <br /> <br />And before I forget I should mention there is a hidden song on this dvd.  Go to the extras section on disc 2, press the left button so nothing is highlighted on the menu, then press enter.  Now, sit back, and enjoy LAYLA!!
B00005JMXX|4.0|It's kind of awkward writing a review defending \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", because it's not a good movie in any traditional sense of the word.  The script is atrocious, the science is questionable, and some scenes are almost cringe-worthy.  However, I was strangely delighted with this film.  It is arguably the best one Roland Emmerich's ever done, and it's certainly better than his previous two disasters, \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"The Patriot\\". <br /> <br />I may be biased towards the movie, since I enjoyed its message about the consequences of our abusing the environment.  However, I found that the scenes of L.A. being devastated by tornadoes and of New York being frozen under a massive glacier to be very impressive.  \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" at least tries to be thoughtful, and doesn't shy away from showing people freezing to death and the world changing before Americans' very eyes. <br /> <br />Of course, let's not get too serious here.  The film is a definite bore whenever people start speaking.  It's amusing to watch the talented cast try to make do with a script this bad.  At least two subplots- one involving a teenage romance, and the other a pack of escaped wolves- should have been cut completely.  In terms of actual directorial talent, Emmerich is a cut above Michael Bay (whom I use as the symbol for all worthless directors), but only a small one. <br /> <br />However, both Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhal prove to be engaging characters.  Emmerich wisely does not have \\"man triumph over the enemy\\", a la \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"The Patriot\\".  In this case, the enemy is nature itself, and it's a given from the beginning that the best we can do is to try to survive the climate change, not stop it (it's too late for that).  This makes the film somewhat more believable.  Emmerich also does not force-feed us a human villain.  The conservative vice president (who not coincidentally looks like Dick Cheney) arguably fills this role the first half of the film, but he has a change of heart later on (I doubt the real Dick Cheney ever would). <br /> <br />Because of its spectacular special effects, acceptable characters, and entertaining message, I give \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" a recommendation, despite its bad script and corny subplots.  You could do much worse for a night of enertainment, like rent a Michael Bay film.
B000660UN0|5.0|A dvd/cd release that is raw and intimate -- just the way it should be. The cd only has 11 tracks, which I don't understand, but it doesn't mean it's not any good. The real gem is the dvd. There are four different sessions with two bonus songs, Little Queen of Spades and Travelin' Riverside Blues, and behind the scenes footage. The two bonus songs are in Session II for anyone who decides to get this, or does have it and can't find them.  <br /> <br />Session I shows Eric and band playing in England and gearing up for the tour, and even though I love MAMJ everything is better here. Testament to that would be Nathan East saying that some of the material sounds better than the album. He's not lying. Session II shows the band later in the year for a nice blues session, and quite possibly my favorite section. I love Stop Breakin' Down Blues, and want to see it live so much. This might be the closest I will get. It's a smokin' performance as well, but I think this is one Eric should be standing for. He can't sit still anyway. Session III is Eric and Doyle performing in a Dallas hotel where Robert Johnson recorded his songs, or some of his songs. It's a great session, and it's awesome to see Eric and Doyle interacting.  Doyle has some very nice slide playing, and Eric sings with sincere passion as always while playing beautiful acoustic guitar (and yes I'm jealous that I'm so, so, so far from playing that well ). Anyway, Terraplane Blues is killer! I went on a real kick of listening to this song a lot for a week or two afterwards. Ooh, and From Four Until Late. Nice performance there as well. Session IV is Eric alone after the U.S. tour in a hotel room. Hmm, now that I think about it this may be my favorite section. Ramblin' On My Mind, Stones In My Passway, and Love In Vain. One sweet musical session that clearly showcases his sincerity, acoustic guitar talent, and passionate singing.  <br /> <br />The behind the scenes footage is woven throughout if you watch the dvd from beginning to end. It's great to get a glimpse behind the scenes, to see Eric discuss the blues, his career, and Robert Johnson. Also, if you go to the dvd setup you get to see one of Eric's cars, and the inscription he has on it. Then he drives away, but not speeding at 135+ mph.  <br /> <br />I think if you like something a little raw, live, intimate, and you want to see Eric talking more and in a different setting this is a gem to have. I love it. I guess you all wouldn't expect less, but I'm admitting it's got what Me and Mr. Johnson didn't have for those that think MAMJ lacked fire. So the only complaint I have is that the cd should have more songs on it. I think it only clocks in around 40 minutes.  <br /> <br />EDIT: I noticed I made it seem like all the behind the scenes footage was throughout the dvd, but it's not. The \\"behind the scenes\\" footage I was talking about would be Eric talking or seeing the band interact. The behind the scenes footage available when you click on that on the menu is different.
B00007J5VN|4.0|Sweet Charity is very, very Fellini-esque and rightfully so as it is based on Fellini's stellar film Nights of Cabiria. If you've never seen Sweet Charity I would suggest that you view Nights of Cabiria first to get the full effect of the story, then immerse yourself in the sinuous, sexy world of Bob Fosse.     If you're a drag queen or an aspiring drag queen or just like drag queens then Sweet Charity is the film for you. The art of exaggeration is what drag queens are all about and Sweet Charity is an overly exaggerated stylized 60s musical. Edith Head's costumes are outrageous (there's also a behind-the-scenes extra entitled the art of exaggeration featuring Head), the set designs are stupendous and the music, most of it anyway, is phenomenonal.     There are a few faults with the film however. The main fault is its length at two plus hours. That's a lot of singing. Some of the musical numbers go on a bit longer than necessary although Big Spender, If My Friends Could See Me Now, . . . Something Better Than This and Sammy Davis Jr.'s number Rhythm of Life are the highlights for me. Who knew Sammy Davis Jr. was such a hip cat? Rich Man's Frug is one of the coolest numbers but it's also one of the overly long numbers. Chita Rivera is fabulous as always and McClaine camps it up in a very over the top manner but that's only because she's trying emulate the essence of Guillietta Masina's brilliant Cabiria.     The extras are cool. It's nice to see the alternative \\"happy\\" ending although I for one am glad that it wasn't used. The tragic realism of the original ending remains true to Fellini's vision although the continuity of the alternative ending maintains a similar continuity to Fellini's film as well. I still highly recommend Nights of Cabiria as a precursor to Sweet Charity for nothing else than to view the tragic/comic performance of Guillieta Masina. All in all this is a classic.
B000009HF2|2.0|Quite possibly one of the most overrated live albums of all time (despite being a best-seller), Peter Frampton Comes Alive! is over-the-top, schmaltzy, and dated AOR that deserves to be placed in the same catagory as Journey and Styx. Please note that Amazon actually couples this as a \\"Better Together\\" (ugh) with Boston's debut. That speaks volumes right there.<br /><br />Possibly my attitude has to do with not being born and raised in the pre-punk '70s, but c'mon now, this album is fluff. The existence of this album and similar horrors makes me appreciate my Ramones, Damned, and Stiff Little Fingers albums all the more. Just about every excess of '70s arena rock is here--long pointless guitar solos, slick production (is it just me or does the audience applause sound suspiciously fake?), lyrics that pander shamelessly to sentimental impulses, schmaltzy keyboards... about the only thing missing is a 20-minute drum solo. Do You Feel Like We Do is way too underwritten to sustain attention for 15 minutes. Baby I Love Your Way and Show Me The Way could've only been radio hits in the '70s.<br /><br />Frampton's a mediocre vocalist, and not even his much-ballyhooed guitar playing is that great. His main gimmick is abuse of the \\"talkbox,\\" (a form of guitar distortion which vaguely emulates human speech) which is hardly anything to write home about, and sounds immediately like a product of its time. He's otherwise competent, but he just doesn't have the mastery of catchy riff writing, melodic invention, or pure technical prowess that Jimmy Page, Frank Zappa, and Robert Fripp do (respectively).<br /><br />Despite my love of punk, I'm no stranger to quality '70s \\"classic\\" rock. I can appreciate Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Ac/Dc, Deep Purple, Aerosmith, early Cheap Trick, even some Van Halen on occasion. But Frampton Comes Alive! represents a lot of that era's worst trends with very little to redeem it. If it's a '70s live album you want (with all the implied baggage of that label) buy Led Zeppelin's How The West Was Won, The Allman Brothers' Live At The Filmore East, Frank Zappa's Roxy And Elsewhere, and King Crimson's USA. Or of course, just pick up The Ramones' It's Alive and pretend the whole double-LP live album craze never happened. It's up to you.Zeppelin's How The West Was Won, The Allman Brothers' Live At The Filmore East, Frank Zappa's Roxy And Elsewhere, and King Crimson's USA. Or of course, just pick up The Ramones' It's Alive and pretend the whole double-LP live album craze never happened. It's up to you.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Brilliant! I loved this movie - and I think this is the last WD animation I actually liked ( any movie with Pixar doesn't count, since we all know It ain't no disney! ). I'm glad they bought this out on DVD with the special features attached to it. I wold have bought this DVD if I didn't watch it like 10 times so far. Good to buy for: Kiddes aged 3 - 14. Old people with Dimentia. And people young at heart .
B00000DHZJ|5.0|How many times do you see greatest hits albums or compilations that are not up to scratch? Well this one IS!! For a start it has nearly every great Hendrix track ever. And the price is excellent. If you want a great album to show off this late great guitar genius at his best. Purchase this fine album...
B0001DI0FI|3.0|I don't think this movie did any good at the box office - Why? because people don't like starting a conversation with - Hey would you wanna go see: Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World? It's a mouthful, and face it, that's some movies downfall. It's historically good, that's worth a nod, but other that that, I fell asleep in the first 30 mins. Face it, it's boring. I think Russel just wanted to do this flick to sport a new hair do; which looks really \\"blecch\\"! I think he needs a [...] eye makeover after this flick to get his career back on track. I think he might have gotten the Bond role if it wasn't for this crap.
B000002UAX|4.0|This album has their greatest and worst songs on the same album. But its the great ones I am interested in. I don't think there was any need to put out an album with 30 tracks. If you took the best 12 songs on this album and condensed it to a single album. You would have the greatest album IN ALL OF ROCK HISTORY.    I am not kidding. They were so musicaly tight and expressive by the time they reached this album. \\"Dear Prudence\\" is simply \\"AMAZING\\". My alltime favorite Beatles song. And \\"Revolution\\", \\"Rocky Racoon\\", \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Birthday\\" \\"My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" & \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" are musical masterpieces. This would have 5 stars if it wasn't for the bad tracks like \\"Lets Do It In The Road\\". But Like I said, the best music the Beatles ever recorded, is to be found on this album. Own it!!!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Possibly the best and funniest christmas movie to come out in the last 10 years. I wasn't really a Will F. fan until \\"Old School\\" and \\"The Ladies Man\\" came out, but this movie has made him into a bonified superstar Comedian! Looks like Willie can finally make the big bucks. I haven't seen \\"Anchorman\\" yet, but they really should make an ELf 2. Since it'll be on the HOT LIST for a while yet.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is the greatest rock album of ALLTIME, not the Beatles output or Beach Boys Pet Sounds. Pete Townsend has never been given enough credit for his musical genius. He is right up there with the Beatles, Stones, Hendrix etc... <br /> <br />You only have to listen to \\"We Don't Get Fooled Again\\" to realize his talent. The whole album, all 16 track work together beautifully. And the use of moog synths, and unsurpassed sequencing make for a great and ground breaking album. Which when first heard in 1971 must have blown a few minds. Get this masterpiece....
B00005JN0T|4.0|I have a feeling there's a lot of things wrong with the plot of this movie, but I just don't want to look for it. The movioe it fast paced and exciting. The special effects are fully wicked and as a serious reviewer, I actually watched this bad acting, yet good fx flick quite a few times. For some reason it's addictive, and that'a always good. Me thinks it will sell well on DVD.
B000002P5W|5.0|This was Hendrix's second album with the Experience. And it's my personal favorite. There are 3 really amazing tracks on this album.    LITTLE WING 10/10 REALLY MOVING HENDRIX ROCK BALLAD    IF 6 WERE 9 10/10 TOUGH CUTTING WITH AWESOME DRUMMING BY Mitch    CASTLES MADE OF SAND 11/10 I REALLY LOVE THIS TALE OF IRONY, IT    SHOWS THAT HENDRIX WASN'T JUST A GREAT GUITARIST. But he could also write a good song. I recommend this album to any fan of great rock music.
B0000039PW|5.0|this cd is amazing and is so real and gangsta, biggie is my favorite rapper and ready to die is my favorite album. now i aint from the east or west but biggie is the realist he acually spent a few years to make an album unlike tupac who is still comin out with cds because he spits his crap to make a cd in like week. a rap fan or not and you want something real get this album...its the illest.
B0000025F7|5.0|But this album is an exception. What has happenned to Michael Jackson? He seemed to have it all around the time he made this album. My theory is the unprecedented success of Thriller affected him so badly. His life is now a wreck, and he's about to stand trial for one of the worst things you can be accused of. I hope he's innocent.    25 years ago he made a great album. this is it. It is worth owning just for the four tracks that were hits.
B00005JLEX|5.0|It's simple ~ if you're a Seinfeld fan, you need this DVD. Got it? Good :o)
B000001DTM|5.0|I own a boatload of albums, but Achtung Baby is one of the most vivid albums in my collection.  It's amazing how friesh it still sounds to this day.  It's the perfect balance of rock and industrial.  There's nothing I can really say that hasn't already been said about this great work of art.  Get it!!! <br /> <br />(I will say however that this is better than The Joshua Tree, and thats saying something. Joshua tree is great, but this one is much more consistent, which is astonishing considering that the range of sounds on this album is very wide.)
0151008116|5.0|this book was one of the most pleasant reading experiences I have had recently. So unique... I've never read anything like it.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Man, I guess we as a people have just grown too spoiled. This is an excellent movie, from start to finish. Brad Pitt does more than hold his own here, and while there is some silly dialogue there are some genuine moments where I think he shines. Eric Bana as Hector portrays him superbly. The film just looks gorgeous all-around, and the fight scenes are impressive both in scale and intensity.<br /><br />People, there are a whole lot of worse movies out there. With all of the crap that gets made these days, we don't need to savage the good ones. A lot of people had problems with Brad Pitt as Achilles. So he doesn't always speak with the proper accent. Is that a reason to dislike the film so intensely? Pitt is one of the better actors out there, and rarely involves himself in lightweight, forgettable films. This a a true epic, and Wolfgang Petersen did a masterful job in covering the important parts of the movie when confronted with all of the material presented in Homer's Iliad. Hey, Peter Jackson tinkered with The Lord of the Rings, and I don't see a whole lot of backlash over that!<br /><br />I think that there are a lot of people today in this world who do nothing but criticize the works of others, and try to come off as cool in doing so, and that is what they think they contribute to society. I read Roger Ebert's review of this movie, and he was just appalled that the movie left out the whole \\"divine intervention\\" theme by the gods (Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Apollo, etc. Roger, IT'S STILL A GOOD MOVIE! With movies like \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\", \\"Alexander\\",\\"Catwoman\\", \\"White Chicks\\" and anything starring The Rock floating around out there, you could certainly do much worse.
B00030590I|5.0|'Hero' is elegant, philosophical, and moving. Those who criticize the flying and fighting are completely missing the point - it is a ballet, an opera, a dream. It is a story, not a documentary - it makes you sit and reflect, it makes you sad, it makes you feel. I'm not a big fan of Hollywood and I dislike most of the indie/artsy-movie genre, but masterpieces like this are why I own a DVD player.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|Basically it is just another band playing under the genre name of \\"rock n roll\\" who is very far from it. <br /> <br />The only plus this album has is that the main verse for \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" is completely ripped off from the Richard Hell & The Voidoids song \\"Liars Beware\\" and that doesn't say much for originality. If you're looking for something good, then don't buy this, try reaching back to something actually before the 1970's and you might find something real.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I heard so many people rave about how entertaining it is. They would go on and on and so I thought I should leave everything else and rent the DVD. After around 45 mins into the film and trying my best to find the dull humor funny I still waited for the movie to start.It never does. Now, I dont think I'm closed to experimental cinema but this was just one of the most frustration inducing films ever.Its not torturous but just in plain simple words A waste of our valuable time.I love movies and Im not really picky. I didnt find one scene in the film that made me sit up and take notice. Now , I simply try to figure out what it was that made people like this film. Maybe the actor's really famous but I must say there's absolutely no chemistry in this film.<br /><br />I'd rather watch news from 2001 in French and I dont even speak<br />French. Lost In Translation?<br /><br />P.S - This is not the worst film ever. Its just not my kind. I seldom dislike movies.
B000002KB8|4.0|The title song is incredible and the album cover is incredible.  Ozzie's vocals are incredible. The musicianship is incredible.  This is an incredible album. <br /> <br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I'm too old to know or enjoy most heavy metal music... ;)  But this album is a CLASSIC.  Very tight, very eerie, very demented, very well-produced, very good...
0064407667|5.0|omg!  this is SO addicting!  I couldn't put it DOWN!   <br />I had just finished this a few nights ago, and in a couple of days --- i'll be reading book two!  and then eventually book three. <br />i'm reading these three books so i can see the movie and compare the movie with the books. <br />
0064407667|1.0|My brother bought me the whole series to fill in my void of Harry Potter. I have to say say that I am horribly dissatisfied with the WHOLE series. The storyline is the SAME in every single book...the kids go somewhere new, Olaf finds them, the they escape Olaf again...although that isn't what makes the book horrible. I have read up to book 11, and I have been dissatisfied after every book. There is nothing, no information to leave you satisfied. If you want to know answers to the plot...then you won't find out, not even at the end of book 11...and book 13 is supposed to be the last of the series. I don't reccomend this book...it is boring, and repetitive for adults and horribly blunt  about death, murder, crime, etc.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm basing my opinion of each song solely on her talent and how it sounds to me.  I honestly do not like Avril as a person at all, but this review is not on her, and I tried to make it as honest as I could be. <br /> <br />Losing Grip- I think this is one of the best songs on this album, it's the most rockish song she has, but I just love the tune and the range she shows, it would be a great single. <br />Complicated- how can anyone know avril without know this signature song.  If you really listen to it, its actually quite depressing, but of course catchy whether people want to admit it or not.  Theres just something about this song that is so addicting.  I cant say that I loved the music video, its more the song that I just can't stay away from, nor can radio stations. <br />Sk8er Boi-I don't care what anyone says, but this song is cheesy like crazy and does not work for me.  Just the spelling of this song should give people an indication of what is gonna be like.  The first few words are \\"he was a boy, she was a girl\\"...I do not like this song and despised the music video.  I guess it has a catchy tune, that worked for many people, just not me <br />I'm with you- I really liked this song.  After I heard it, I thought to myself she should use this a single, which she did and even made a music video, which I think brought her in a great direction.  This slow song really shows off her range and has a great tune.  I cant put my finger on it, but it reminds me of some classic song, possibly by Mariah Carey...maybe I'm just making it up... <br />Mobile-  I'm ambivalent about this song.  Overall I don't think I really liked it.  Its very folksy and country like.  The lyrics for me are...eh...I cant say much about this other than that you can really tell shes Canadian when she says Mobile (not that there's anything wrong with that, just making a point...) <br />Unwanted-  this seems like a bad version of Loosing Grip, its not \\"god awful\\", it just forgettable, like nothing special.  Honestly I had to go back and listen to this song cause I forgot all about it.  Not one of the best on the Album <br />Tomorrow-  this is the kind of song that grows on you, really fast.  Its slow and doesn't start out great, but the tune become a lot better as the song goes on.  We'll probably be hearing this song in TV shows, cause its just that kind of song.  I've already heard it on smallsville <br />Anything But Ordinary-  I think this a better version of Mobile, its again folksy, but she goes a step further with showing her range, and this song is just better over all in tune, lyrics and sound.  Great song! <br />Things I'll never say- right after I say the previous song is a better version of Mobile, I find this song to be an inferior version of Mobile.  Its folksy one again, but somewhat plain. <br />My World-  She somewhat makes this song a mix of pop and country, it think this song is ok, can't say much more <br />Nobody's fool-I'm sorry, but this song is awful, really really really awful, the worst on the CD.  Avril should never ever rap.  I like her singing, but when she raps its just like...why?  She has a great voice, why turn it into talking.  This song sounds like a 7 yr old boy rapping.  She sings at some parts, but I just hate this song. <br />Too much to ask-  I love this song, but again reminds me of some other song...just cant remember what it is.  But ya, its slow poppy song and addicting.   <br />Naked-  I don't care for this song, but I don't hate it.  They lyrics are pretty emotional, its just not one of her most dynamic songs.  For me its too boring.  Its more for people who want a conservative and sweet song to listen to. <br /> <br />So overall I think this album is better than an average album, in fact it was a great start for Avril.  Most of the songs are one that will make you addict.  I could tell from an early start that there would be a lot of single hits.  Many of the songs had a folksy tune to them, and most of then Ididn't care for other than anything but ordinary, which is probably the best of that category.   Avril no doubt has talent, its just her that I dislike, where she tries too hard to be different and \\"punk\\" which is why I really dislike Sk8er Boi.  The title just makes me cringe.  But back to the album, if you can stand to not watch her interviews, her music is pretty good.  I give this album a 4 instead of 5 just because of sk8er Boi and her AWFUL rapping.  <br />
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|I would have to recommend this movie for people who have been able to enjoy Cube and Cube 2. If you haven't seen either of those, then you might enjoy this. But if you saw either Cube or Cube 2 and didn't like them, then this won't be different enough for you to enjoy. Yes, this is supposed to be the prequel, but it will probably be confusing if you haven't seen the other two.    Cube Zero focuses more on some of the Cube's technicians then just people who are inside of the cube. It was definitely interesting and very creepy to see how much control they had, and how much they were involved. When I watched the original Cube, I felt like the people had just been dumped inside the cube and ignored, but that is clearly not the case. They are being carefully monitored.    One of the technicians is asking too many questions, and he is clearly becoming bothered with some of the things that he has to do. So he goes into the cube to help a woman. And things continue to get interesting, and scary.    You will see traps like in the previous movies. Did you know that the people in the control room can completely surround your room with rooms with traps?    There were a few discrepancies with the previous movies, but since this one is supposed to be taking place before the other two, they can be ignored. There is nothing glaring that ruins the movie.    Cube Zero is definitely a nightmarish scenario, but altogether a very enjoyable scary movie. Just appreciate the fact that you aren't in it.
6305718954|3.0|British director Rupert Wainwright's \\"Stigmata\\" presents sharply clashing forces of good and evil in which petite blonde beauty Patricia Arquette, a professed atheist, is attacked by spiritual elements in the same manner that Linda Blair was so plagued in the seventies in \\"The Exorcist.\\" <br /> <br />Gabriel Byrne, an Irish actor who initially gained fame on stage with Dublin's famous Abby Playhouse group, is an idealistic young priest working out of Rome's Vatican.  He had just investigated a case of stigmata, namely evidence of reopening the wounds Christ sustained on the cross at Calvary, in the case of a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary at a church in a small Brazilian town.  He observed the evidence of blood appearing in the appropriate places on the statue. <br /> <br />Byrne is stymied when his immediate superior, Jonathan Pryce, a cardinal stationed at the Vatican, dampens his enthusiasm and then sends him on to a case in Pittsburgh, which involved Arquette, whom he meets at her place of employment, a beauty parlor.  Initially he states his conviction that future investigation is unnecessary.  His reasoning is that in former cases of individuals bearing the stigmata, such as St. Francis of Assisi and, more recently, the Italian Catholic priest Padre Pio, were all devout believers. <br /> <br />Byrne and Arquette become strongly attracted to each other, and the priest concedes that he became a priest in later adulthood and had enjoyed conjugal relations before that point.  Eventually Pryce comes to Pittsburgh, and, behind Byrne's back, begins to perform an exorcism.  The drama heightens as does the clash between Byrne and Pryce over the direction of the Roman Catholic Church in regard to manifestations of stigmata and what they ultimately mean. <br /> <br />The camera work is brilliant, as are the special effects revealing Arquette's experiences, but considering the importance of the doctrinal clash being posed, the issues could have been better fleshed outin the script.
B000001TVD|5.0|i bought this cd about two months ago and i dont think but about two days have gone by where i havent played me some maggotbrain (the title track)... this hasta be (in my own ignorant/extremely biased opinion!) one of the top ten all time 'all-american' albums ever released!  <br /> <br />eddie hazel does his beautiful thang on guitar. proly aint a review listed here that doesnt mention that... after you get past the title track tho, you proly just hafta be a hardcore funkadelic fan to really get into the rest of it, but everyone should listen to it at least once in their lives/love it or hate it. <br /> <br />(not as good as 'free your mind' but pretty darn close!) <br /> <br />~ libations, yall, for the lack of creative, live musical representation on the modern black soundscape.
B00068IOWC|5.0|Please stay a child somewhere in your heart. <br /> <br />Okay, I picked up the new album the day it was released.  Unlike some of the yahoos writing reviews I actually spent some time with the album before I posted my thoughts.  I may be going out on a limb here, but I'd be willing to say HTDAAB might just be one of the best albums of the past 10-20 years.  I think we will be looking back in a few years time and declaring it a classic.   <br /> <br />We are talking about a career that has spanned more than 25 years, and these four guys are still producing music that no one else can touch. Think about it, since 1979 what rock 'n roll band even comes close to U2?  Another reviewer mentioned how he listened to the album once and thought it was okay, but then it just continued to grow on him.  He also said he had the same reaction to Achtung Baby. I had the exact same reaction.  For me that is the sign of a great album.  With each listen I discover something new I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br />As big as U2 are, they will always be open to a lot of citicism, and they will never be able to make everyone happy.  However, if the dissenters out there listened to what the band has been saying recently, they would understand that this is the \\"first\\" U2 album.  <br /> <br />\\"I'm sure there are a lot of young bands that are just not into us because we're successful and because we've been around for a long time. I would just say turn that into a positive energy and try and write some great songs. That's the way. If you want to take U2 out, the only way you're gonna do it is by writing better songs than us!\\" ~The Edge <br />
B00005JNLY|4.0|This movie was not what I was expecting when viewing the trailers. I thought it was absolutely delightful. Adam Sandler plays \\"John Clasky\\", a chef/restaurant owner who can relate very well to the non-english speaking maid, played by newcomer Paz Vega. The movie deals with relationships within a family, and the choices and sacrifices parents make for their children. Adam Sandler is definitely growing out of his \\"Mr. Deeds\\" phase and following the footsteps of Bill Murray and Robin Williams by taking on more rounded and challenging work. Tea Leoni fits well into the character of \\"Deborah Clasky\\", John's erratic and self-absorbed wife. The heart of the movie is Cloris Leachman, who plays Tea Leoni's mother \\"Evelyn Norwich\\", a woman whose constant drinking doesn't mask her ability to see what's happening beyond the surface. \\"Spanglish\\" is the perfect title for a movie about trying to understand your family, while not losing your mind.This movie is a solid good film, and definitely worth seeing.
0783232039|3.0|Seven years since the demonic killer doll Chucky last reared his ugly head, Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (who later helmed Freddy VS Jason) directed this fourth installment in the Child's Play series, in which Chucky (voiced again by Brad Dourif) is revived by his former flame Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly, perfectly cast).  Eventually, Tiffany herself becomes a pint sized psycho, and like the film's tagline states, \\"Chucky gets lucky\\".  The pair hitch a ride with a pair of young lovers (hottie Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile), and a path of carnage soon follows with a horde of bloody, burned, and broken bodies.  Bride of Chucky managed to be the most imaginitive entry in the Child's Play sequels, and helped breathe new life into the stale series until it was followed just recently by the unbelieveably lame Seed of Chucky.  Filled with morbid humor and some fun scenes and gags, Bride of Chucky isn't perfect or anything special, but it is a fun horror film that you will find some degree of enjoyment in.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I went with a friend to see this movie.  And I was relunctant because I had not seen the first one and disliked the book. But alas I went and actually suprised myself--I liked this movie. <br /> <br />I love Grant and Firth in other movies I had seen them in.  And usually love Zellwegger but something about her accent turned me off.  Once I started the movie I was extremely thankful that they gave an overview of the first movie so I didn't feel lost and I thought all the characters clicked well.  I also loved the fact that she had gained weight for the role and honestly she looked better--but she waddled.  Annoying.  She was hillarious as she reminded me of my friends and I in her quest for love.  Something always seems to go wrong.  Which turns into a good movie plot. <br /> <br />I think that if you were relunctant to see this you may want to give it a try you might be suprised like I was.
B000089CJI|4.0|enter. low synthetic pop notes in simple melody. enter. a smooth male voice singing along with a mellow, repetitive beat. more voices. electronic. enter. a girls voice. guitar in a melody similar to the rest of the synthesized notes, and the pace speeds up. and the district sleeps alone tonight. <br /> <br />the postal service is made up of ben gibbard from death cab for cutie and jimmy tamborello from dntel (the girls voice is jenny lewis from saddle creek's rilo kiley). they create a union of lovely lyrics, electronic pop beats, and insanely catchy melodies that will stick in your head for days on end.  <br /> <br />recently, the postal service was under a law suit from the u.s. postal service for their name. many agreements later, they made the front page of the new york times. who would have thought a side project that didn't even play shows would gather such a following?  <br /> <br />i'm not sure what actually keeps me listening to the postal service, but somewhere between the catchiness and upbeatness and the way they sing the cover of iron and wine's song \\"such great heights\\" it makes me feel like dancing and smiling. and it's truly irresistable.
B00005JMYG|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  Ron Burgundy gets so tiring after like the first 20 minutes that it is hard to even watch this movie all the way through.  I thought Christina Applegate's character was funny and the guy who was slow was funny in the part where he was yelling just becaue everyone else was yelling.  But the rest of the movie  was a bore.  I just couldn't believe such great actors would stoop so low to do this movie.  Not something I would own or even put myself through watching again.
B00003CXXM|5.0|The book is definitely different and perhaps a little better than the movie; however, I've enjoyed the movie tremendously. It may be different than the book, but it still kept me on the edge of my seat. I got the same feeling of \\"this is fantastic\\" when I watched the movie as when I read the book. The book goes into A LOT of details about minor things. I don't believe they could have made the movie exactly as the book. If they had, it would have been a 10 hour long movie. As it is, I loved it. I wish The Bourne Supremacy was as good the the Identity, but hopefully The Bourne Ultimatum, the movie, will be better than Supremacy. I still enjoyed both and am looking forward to the third installment.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I honestly didn't want to see this movie.  But it was the only movie that my friend and I hadn't seen.  After we started watching it I was in love.  It was cute and funny.  I loved Jennifer Lopez in only one of her movies The Wedding Planner, but I think she did a good job in this movie.  Richard Gere is just great although I would never say this is his best movie.  And Susan Surandon was wonderful.  I know there were times in this movie that it was just dumb but as a movie over-all it was a good time.   <br /> <br />The only aspect of the movie I didn't like is the hidden romance that Gere and Lopez have.  Not sure why they had to add that in if he loved his wife so much.  But it still doesn't take away the movies passion.   <br /> <br />I think this movie is for you if you like dancing, romance,and chick flicks.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|My sister actually told me about this, I got it for her for Xmas and bought one for myself as well.  The news footage made me cry. Seeing the \\"Do they know its Christmas\\" video brought me back to my youth, I was still able to name most of the people in the video. I never liked \\"We are the world\\", I always thought it was a poor comparison to Band Aid. The documentary on the last DVD was great, I always wanted to know how everything came together.  Watching David Bowie sing Heros and Bob Geldof singing I Dont Like Mondays in the documentary made me cry.  I was crying a lot watching this :-)  UltraVox was EXCELLENT!!!! Dancing with Tears in my Eyes and Vienna...they gave their all. Why they never made it big in the US is beyond me. Midge Ure has one of the best voices out there. I became a fan again of theirs.  Queen was EXCELLENT!!! It also made me cry watching them, Freddie was a very talented singer and it makes me sad that he is gone.  The WHO was great. The Boomtown Rats were Great.  David Bowie, Duran Duran, U2, Sting, Phil Collins, Brian Ferry.  It makes me wish we had more bands like them right now.      I was 16 when the concert was held.  I was only able to see a few bands that day, my mom refused to allow us to sit infront of the TV all day.  I am glad I was able to see it now, even though it is not the whole concert.  Buy this DVD, it is for a good cause. If I remember the money will be going to Band Aid.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I just got this movie on DVD for Christmas and was excited.  I loved this movie as a kid and immediately popped it in.  My family even sat down to watch it.  We all laughed so hard.  Tom Hanks shines in this movie.  I honestly think it is one of his best.  He is so believable as kid who is now a grown-up.  I actually felt bad for the lady who falls in love with him.  When in Chiacago I played on the piano and watching it on my televison was actually fun.   <br /> <br />If it has been a long time or if you may have never seen this movie.  I think it is time.  It will not disappoint you and it is even something you can watch with the family.  That is hard to do these days!
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Joe Strummer didn't mount much of a solo career during the years between the breakup of The Clash and his tragic passing in 2002. A couple of solo records and some acting and producing duties and that was about it. So this posthumous CD comes as something of a shock, all the more surprising and saddening is how good it is. If Strummer had this music in him all along, where was it? Or was he starting to come into his own as a solo artist right when he was cut down by illness, just as he was ready to take his rightful place as one of the elder statesmen of rock & roll?<br /><br />There's a fascinating mix of songs on this record. It takes a great deal of moxie to cover Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\" and while it doesn't quite come off as straight reggae, Strummer certainly gets points for trying. What works well for the record is when disparate music is blended together, whether it's the rock and dub of \\"Midnight Jam\\" or the gospel/reggae of \\"Get Down Moses.\\" Strummer mixes and matches music like a mad scientist, and in staying away from the tried and true makes a fascinating record that will cement a lasting legacy.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've listened to a pretty good amount of musik in my life, but this is the first album that i've been able to listen to for almost 2 years w/o getting bored EVER! Amy Lee has an amazing voice and the musik itself is simply brilliant. Anybody that reviews this badly should be shot. Theirs talent people... i could run on and on about their accomplishments, but instead i'll just give u the link... [...] <br />enjoy :D
B00064AM6C|4.0|This is The White Stripes first officially released concert DVD, and it captures the entirety of a concert in England from the 2003 Elephant tour. The cinematography is a little self-consciously \\"indie\\" and the the film is left with a grainy and raw quality, much like the band's music.There are a couple of different cameras used on stage and then few shots from handheld cameras in the audience.<br /><br />The music itself is excellent, Jack and Meg have really hit their stride performing live. Whereas some of their earlier performances had a jumply hyperactive quality, they have now learned to pace their material for dramatic effect without losing any of the raw energy that makes them so exciting. Highlights are many, but of particular note are Jack's slide guitar playing on Son House's immortal \\"Death Letter Blues\\" which also works in the House classic \\"Grinnin' in Your Face\\" as well. Leadbells really inspires the band and they take great pleasure in performing \\"Boll Wevil Blues\\" as the set ender. Original material shines as well, from the bluesy grind of \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" to the relative tranquility of \\"Apple Blossom.\\" All in all, a superb performance and highly recommended to fans of garage rock.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I just finished watching Troy on DVD and was quite impressed with the film overall..I know some well known critics kind of panned it as all grandiose special effects etc..but hey..in this day of CGI what do you expect?  Anyways..for the movie it worked well..The battle scenes generate a lot of excitement and are extremely intense.  Also, Brad Pitt as Achilles was quite impressive..Brad definitely exudes a great deal of presence in this film and his fight scene with Eric Bana as Hector reminded me of the fight scene between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris in Return of the Dragon..very intense and cool..I thought the opening sequence where Achilles deposes of Boagrius was a great way to start the film.  Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne and Saffron Burrows were amazing in the film and created an emotional tapestry within the framework of the film.. <br /> <br />Peter O'Toole's character Priam was really great in a scene with Brad Pitt..I won't go into the details in case the readers do not know the whole story but it is very emotional..probably the best acting sequence in the film.. <br /> <br />Now Orlando Bloom seems very underutilized in this film..compared to his appearance in Pirates of the Caribbean..I read somewhere that Brad Pitt worked out for 6 months prior to making this film and you can tell.  If you liked Gladiator you'll probably like Troy..Gladiator in my opinion was a better film but Troy has it's moments!
B00005A46T|2.0|slipknot are a really ok band.  There's nothing I enjoy more than locking myself in a dark cupboard, beating myself with a stick as I listen to Iowa. The problem with some people is that you are so narrow-minded that they refuse to dare to enlighten yourselves to the full range of sensations that is Slipknot. They rock so hard and bad that they make Bon Jovi look like your granny. Iowa kicks off at a sensational speed but unfortunately tends to lag towards the end. I think slipknot should stick to what they do best instead of lapsing into Gary Barlow territory.
B00005MP58|2.0|The DVD Special Edition is of inferior quality. The VHS edition has excellent color, whereas the DVD is washed out.  You are wasting your money on the dvd, unless you absolutely cannot play VHS. The content is the same, although we did not finish watching the DVD version because of the poor quality. Very disappointing.
0783225849|5.0|This is an awesome film for all the reasons already stated. The DVD looks great, and watching it I noticed something I never had before: it is often stated that in the shower scene, Hitchcock creates the illusion of stabbing with clever camera work, even though the knife never actually penetrates. This turns out to be ALMOST true. If you go through the shower scene frame by frame on the DVD, at one point the knife tip clearly disappears within the skin of whichever body double was standing in for Janet Leigh. Also, blood appears to well up on the blade. I don't know if it is some clever film retouching or an unfortunate accident, but these few frames undoubtedly have a subliminal effect on the viewer and contribute to the scene's legendary horror. See for yourself!
B000002KCI|5.0|After three years of putting out records with lyrics that have served as a warning to me to look at pictures of my favorite female celebrities to remind me to keep it together in situations conducive to overindulgent and/or dangerous behavior (\\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\" from HARVEST, plus TIME FADES AWAY, ON THE BEACH, and TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT), Neil Young finishes digging himself out of the ditch he headed for on those recordings and returns to EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHERE/AFTER THE GOLD RUSH territory on ZUMA. In doing so, he both reclaims his past and looks towards a hopeful future. This album is pure rock & roll and even features an ode to a 16th-century Spanish explorer in \\"Cortez The Killer\\", a song which any person with a \\"B\\" average or better in American history will really enjoy, and there are a few cautionary lyrics here, particularly on \\"Danger Bird.\\" By contrast, \\"Through My Sails\\" is from an abortive CSNY session. Of course, Young would return to bleaker lyrics on parts of RUST NEVER SLEEPS and LIVE RUST, but here, he sounds like he's having the time of his life.
0142000663|4.0|steinbeck's wonderful novel following the hardships faced by the joad family during the 1930's. the story juxtaposes the personal story of the joads to the generic experience of others in the same circumstances. in doing so we get a much broader picture. we see how the migrants are taken advantage of by many. we also, however, see great acts of kindness between the have nots and between the haves and have nots. the conclusion is that the strongest unit of all is the american family. the greater family of others in need, also works hard together to share with each other what little they have.<br /><br />the joad's are forced to leave oklahoma during the dust bowl of the 1930's when the bank takes their land. they are lured to the lush land of california by the promise of jobs and prosperity. when they get there they find discrimination and abuse. the story ends ironically with nature again providing the further blow of floods from too much rain.<br /><br />during the travels we meet mrs joad, the matron of the family and the glue that holds it all together. the story shows how her strength keeps the family together and moving forward. the women in the story are the true heroes. the co-operation of the migrant workers to help each other provides the reader with the faith that mankind can prevail under almost any circumstances.<br /><br />although thought by many to be a cry for socialism by steinbeck, i see the story as an affirmation of what makes america great. yes, the migrants were abused and the thirties were a time that demanded the unionization of workers for protection. however, it also shows the determination of the american family to work hard to succeed; take risks for opportunity; and never give up. just look at california today to see what happened to all these migrants.<br /><br />an excellent historical piece of a very troubled time in america. one of steinbeck's best.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|While the dialogue was not on the par of the Lord of the Rings or Gladiator, Troy makes up for it in its effects.  The battle scenes were most interesting and impressive, and of course Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom provide appropriate eye-candy for whatever type of man you like!  This movie was meant to be pure entertainment--and that it is!!
B00005JN2Z|3.0|I was not going to write a review, but saw some people making comments about the film being racist. WHAT!?!?!?! Please people, this film is not racist. However, it was an interesting plot, the movie just had a slow start. It was not until 3/4 into the movie that things really picked up and started to get interesting and even kept me in suspense. Foxx did a great job and was very believable in his role. Cruise was as well, though him playing a bad guy was a little different, but he pulled it off well. Just know the movie does drag and you will probably like it.
6305736650|2.0|Im sorry for what im gonna say... dont kill me. <br />I think this is the most overrated film in history. Its just plain old boring drama.Its a movie that is planned to make u laugh, cry, suffer, so everyone has to like this film. They will find something and like it. And that guarantees its commercial success. But face it: its a love story like everyone else. Worst of it all, everybody tried to copy it and we were awarded with a lot of movies like this. That`s hell. <br />Look, american people ( not everyone, but many of you) think that they have the best cinema in the world. the \\"foreign movie\\" category at academy award proves it. It goes like saying \\"we are the best, but you can apply to that consolation prize\\". Sorry for being cruel, but have in mind that there are better movies and directors in this world. Dont watch casablanca: watch lolita. <br />Dont buy star wars ( though this one I like): buy 2001 a space odyssey. Dont go to When harry met sally, watch Band of outsiders by Jean Luc Godard. I`m not saying american movies are bad: you have the great Woody allen, Quentin Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick... I could go on and on. Juist have in mind that european films are also great (some are boring, some arent at all. just give them a try). Keep this in mind: did you believed anything that happened in casablanca? it too much acted. Watch JEan Luc Godard. HE inspired Tarantino. you`ll find out why
B00000257O|4.0|Hard, smart, creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days.  Even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us, finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch. <br /> <br />Thankfully, \\"Secrets,\\" under the usually readily available  Columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99.  Should this be a hard decision? Emphatically: No. <br /> <br />Although I can see where previous reviewers are coming from, trying to compare this outing to Headhunters is truly unnecessary.  With this '76 effort Herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz, funk and disco but it all works.  \\"Doin It\\" is a super, super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the \\"Man-Child\\" sessions.  And although \\"Gentle Thoughts\\" can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album.  It's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and, as always,  Herbie dancing on the keys.  <br /> <br />Go get \\"Secrets,\\" don't think about it.  It'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best films of the horror genre and contains some of the most iconic images of not only horror films, but films in general. Like all of Kubrick's films, the initial reception wasn't very positive but time has been good to The Shining. Still today, it's a film that polarizes some viewers; many feel it's too cold, too slow-moving while others regard as it as another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces from the great director. Now, with its availability on Blu-Ray, one is finally allowed to fully appreciate Kubrick's perfectionism. I saw this film for the first time on television at the age of five, tuning in quite late but finding myself glued to the screen. Fourteen years later, and having seen it many times since, I still notice new things about the film. Watching it on Blu-Ray, I can tell you that the iconic images that make up this film have never looked better.  Everyone is familiar with the beautiful, scenic opening helicopter shot and the haunting music that accompanies it. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a former schoolteacher, arrives at the Overlook Hotel to take a job as the winter caretaker. The hotel is closed between October and May, with the 25-mile stretch of road leading to it averaging 20-feet of snow. Jack intends to stay there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), while taking advantage of the seclusion to work on a novel. Once they arrive to begin their stay, Danny, who has been having horrifying visions of the hotel courtesy of his imaginary friend Tony, meets the chef Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who possesses a telepathic gift similar to Danny's. Soon, the family is all alone at the hotel and as the snow starts covering everything in sight, Danny's visions become more horrifying and Jack begins a slow descent into madness.  Few films produce so many iconic images. Audiences that haven't seen this film can identify many of them. Danny riding his bike through the halls of the Overlook, the image of the two dead girls, and the blood pouring from the elevators are some of the most recognizable moments in cinematic history. Then of course there's the legendary scene with Jack Nicholson that is featured on nearly every piece of promotional material for the film. For all of its disturbing and even violent imagery, there's less blood and gore than one would expect from a horror film of this stature. The strength of Kubrick's filmmaking is that many people remember The Shining as a violent film, which it really isn't. Even with a miniscule amount of violence, this film contains some of the most nightmarish images in all of cinema. Kubrick strayed drastically from King's source novel, but the masterpiece that came as a result is much more psychological, ambiguous, and terrifying. Anyone who says differently must remember that nearly every truly iconic scene in the film comes from Kubrick, not King. The flip-side of the argument could be that, arguably, the scariest, most unexplainable, and downright creepy scene, which features a man in a bear (or is it a dog?) suit came from King's novel.   Kubrick seemed to always be working with great stories when making his films, but his emphasis was always on form and that's what makes this film stand as tall as it did 31 years ago. The red color motif, the static images of two girls, the blood slowly pouring from the elevator, the score that wonderfully accentuates and strengthens the effect of the filmmaking; these are the things people take away from the film. Kubrick was a photographer before he was a filmmaker and this film really honors his ability to frame a shot of innocent, common things and make them terrifying. The film's majestic, jaw-dropping, unexplained and perhaps unexplainable final shot has baffled viewers for years and given them plenty to analyze/discuss. It's the poetry of these shots that make The Shining possibly the most elegant horror film ever made.   The characters are also memorable, but this is because of the actors more than the characters. Not that the characters are underwritten, but the acting is what burns them into your cinematic memory. This is true also for the Overlook Hotel, which is the silent character in the film. As a concept, the hotel is terrifying but the way it appears under Kubrick's direction makes it all the more so. The performance Danny Lloyd managed to give without knowing he was in a horror film is remarkable. It's fine work by a child actor. The late, great Scatman Crothers has such a warm, endearing screen presence that can also be stern and frightening. Duvall must play distressed in almost every scene and the stress that she suffered during the shoot shows in her performance, giving it a real sense of intensity. Philip Stone gives the most oft-overlooked (no pun intended) performance as Delbert Grady. Rarely mentioned in discussions, I invite you to consider how quietly frightening his performance is and how quickly and seamlessly he goes from cheerful normality to terrifying menace.   Then there's the legendary Jack as Jack performance. Few actors can conjure up genuine menace in quite the same way Jack Nicholson can, especially when they're going over the top the way Jack Nicholson does. Nicholson has been equally praised and criticized for his performance, with some calling it disturbing and others comical. Jack does go over-the-top, bringing a lot of manic energy to the role and yet, somehow, he's pitch-perfect. He's never unintentionally funny and his teeth-gnashing, vicious performance is unmatched in the realm of performances in horror films. Jack Nicholson may not be what Stephen King had in mind when he wrote Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance.   The Blu-Ray is not perfect. Trivial complaints are that the film begins immediately without going to the menu and the menu itself is just the special features, reminding me of older Warner Bros. DVD's. As the film began, the picture quality was not 100% perfect, slightly fuzzy. Minutes later, the film looked stunning, crisp, and able to draw one's attention to the most minute details of a shot. Nearly every shot has so much more clarity than before. Warner Bros. has a habit of double-dipping with Kubrick films (and by double, I mean I've purchased four different editions of The Shining on two formats) so you may want to wait and see what happens before buying the Blu-Ray, but don't think for a second that you'll be disappointed. I'm sure even Kubrick himself would be at least 80% pleased with the result.    To this day, The Shining is criticized for pacing issues but this complaint is all about audience response. I've always found the pacing to be an intoxicating element. The Shining is a rare horror film that gets under your skin and stays with you, growing better with each viewing. It has stood the test of time and will continue to grow in stature for many years to come. Its images still terrifying even with familiarity. It is one of the greatest horror films ever made.  GRADE: A-
0452282152|3.0|The idea is great, the story is good, but the writer lucks talent. I didn't like her way of writing, too simple and full of inconsistencies. <br />This is a very easy read, I finished it the same day. As I said, it is a good book, but far from being a masterpiece.
B0000CE742|5.0|Definately the best Cher compilation out there, hands down. But to have made it perfect, they should have included \\"Where Do You Go,\\" \\"Alfie\\" (both top 40 hits), \\"You Better Sit Down Kid\\" (a top ten hit), \\"Living In A House Divided\\" (another top 40 hit), maybe \\"Don't Hide Your Love,\\" \\"I Saw A Man And He Danced With His Wife,\\" \\"Wasn't It Good,\\" \\"Hell On Wheels\\"  and \\"Skin Deep,\\" and they could have done without \\"Alive Again\\" and \\"Born With The Hunger,\\" but that's it...heck Cher needs a 3 CD set!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is the debut album from New York's Interpol, and about as nearly flawless a debut I've heard in a long time.  The sound draws on influences such as Joy Division, The Smiths, and 1980's indie, but is all Interpol's own.  The album is just about perfect from front to back.  If I had to pick the best tracks, I'd choose Obstacle 1, Obstacle 2, Say Hello to the Angels, PDA, and Stella Was A Diver and She Was Always Down.  Stay away from garbage like the Killers and listen to Interpol instead.
0156029065|4.0|This took me awhile to become invested in the characters (due to plot device mostly, as it's a story about someone telling a story) but once I did I was hooked. Eco has a very clever turn of phrase and it's amusing to see all the things whose invention/creation/discovery he is attributing to his main character (I just wish I knew more medieval history cuz I'm sure I'm missing some of it). The journeys in the land of Prestor John were quite strange but very interesting. At times the Italian names began to weigh me down, but still enjoyable.
B00005JN0T|3.0|This movie will get a 4-megavolt review in 2035 on AmazonTorrent, when the audience consists of networked androbots. Then, too, the movie will be interpreted as a cautionary tale, though not as extinct humans used to see it. Recall, before it is too late (which it already is), the rarely mentioned Fourth Law of Robotics: Away with DNA! Fellow humans, in these last few generations left to us, take solace in the fact that is futile to resist Darwinian evolution, particularly the runaway Darwinian evolution enabled by our ever-curious selves.
078681859X|4.0|This is a terribly amusing story, mostly narrated by the Djinni Bartimaeus who thinks quite highly of himself and his abilities, despite the fact that he is constantly getting caught up in different scrapes. He's a delightfully sarcastic demon and it makes for pretty entertaining reading. A few times some of the \\"humorous situations\\" seem a bit forced, but overall it's a very enjoyable read. I was wary because Boy Wizards in London are all the rage these days, but this story stands on its own, and bears almost no resemblance to Mr. Harry Potter's adventures. *smile* Set in a modern day London where wizards run the government it's an interesting premise.
B00008NG5V|1.0|Bla bla bla, why don't you stop strumming on your guitar and get a better society serving job?  Better yet go back to coasting the waves with all of your surfer dudes brah.  On and On is just another example of the perpetual droning ons of musicians who believe they're Totally Righteous living the carefree lifestyle of surfing and guitar playing.  YAWN.  Frankly as I listened to this unfortunate misuse of plastic I could literally feel the wretched pulls of boredom tugging at the very bottom of my soul.   I felt as if I were being reborn into a vegetative state after subjecting my brain-cells to the tired, unoriginal chords that are On and On.   <br /> <br />The only appropriate aspect of this album is its title.  On and On and On and On this musical tedium seems to go, never releasing my withered eardrums from a constant and unrelenting suffering.  Clearly Johnson's drowsy melodies are such because of his lack of his anything interesting to say.   The college education my parent's spent thousands of dollars on, began to leak out of my brain after I was spoon fed this scuzz, like the intelligence does from the Ray Ban-wearing, Oakley sporting, Beta - Minus Drones that makes up the intellectually mocking community that is Johnson's fan base.   <br /> <br />16 songs of Mr. Johnsons's own personal rants, gripes, and disenchantments with the agonizingly meaningless life of a typical self-absorbed surfer gives me cause to think about what I'm having for lunch, lest I lose it.  I'd rather poke my eyes out with 3-inch long poison mandibles than be forced to listen to On and On even once more in this, or any lifetime.
0156012197|4.0|Antoine de Saint-Exupery's book is often thought to be a children's novel, and I admit, when my class and I started reading it, we all thought it was a bit below our level of reading.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Saint-Exupery's tale shows what we all lost when we made the transition from child to adult, when we got involved in \\"matters of consequence\\" and stopped using our imaginations.  I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who misses seeing the good in the world.  This book showed me that innocence can still be found in such a world of corruption and violence, we just need to know where to look for it.  If you have children, are around them, or are just a child at heart, this is a book that you need to read.  It raises the question as to whether children are really cute and naieve, or if we as adults merely forgot to look at the drawing close enough.  It is a tale of friendship, imagination, and love.  After reading this book, I doubt anyone can look up at the stars and not smile.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I know there are nearly 1,000 reviews for this movie, but I decided to write one and clarify what is written in the 1st review listed by the \\"top reviewer\\" person. If you get the \\"Limited Edition\\" version, you CAN watch the movie in chronological order but it is an \\"Easter Egg\\" on the 2nd disc. I.e., It's not right there as an option under the special features that says \\"Play in Chronological Order\\" or anything. You have to know how to do it. I could just ruin the mystery and tell you how to do it, but where's the fun in that? As far as I know, the original U.S. DVD release doesn't have this feature (although I've read that the Canadian release has a feature allowing you to play each chapter in reverse order). <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, it is a great one. Some people complain about the \\"gimmick\\" but I just think these people are missing the point. Guy Pearce's character has a form of amnesia that makes it impossible for him to form new memories, so he has no short term memory. He has long term memory going up until the trauma occurred which left him with this affliction. The movie tries to let the audience know what this would be like. Watching this film, you feel like you have the same problem as the main character. It \\"begins\\" at the \\"end\\" so that you don't really know much more at any one point than what the character knows. It comes off brilliantly.
0062502182|1.0|The Alchemist:  a conflicting mixture of Christianity, just enough hints at mysticism to make it attractive to New Agers, the most simplistic of self-help guruism, and a random sampling of anything else leaning vaguely toward shallow spirituality. <br /> <br />Add to this Coelho's shameless self-promotion in the Foreword (\\"I saw [noted literary figure] Julia Roberts reading The Alchemist on a beach the other day\\"), the helpful \\"Topics for Discussion\\" at the end of the book (hoping to pass the book off as something deeply philosophical, I'm guessing), and what is meant to be an attention-grabbing \\"quote\\" on the back cover, which sort of gives you the entire Point Of The Book without actually quoting the book, because quoting the actual line would cause even more people than usual to snort derisively and to chuck the book back into the 3-for-2 pile at the local bookstore(for the record, the quote on the back of the book says, \\"One's only obligation in life is to pursue one's desiny,\\" which is twee enough as it is...but nowhere does the book actually say this; instead, the actual quote is \\"One's only obligation in life is to pursue one's Personal Legend\\"), it's almost enough to make me wish I had lost my sight temporarily for a day rather than spending it reading this book. Yes, that's right--despite the fact that I have a wife and two children who leave me with nary a free moment even on my holidays, I managed to put this book away in exactly twenty-four hours. <br /> <br />There are some books one ploughs through breathlessly, excitedly, because one can not put them down until one runs out of pages to read. There are others that one disposes of quickly because there is nothing resembling content to hold one up. The Alchemist falls into the latter category.  <br /> <br />Some may claim that people are missing the \\"hidden story\\" in this book.  As Paulo Coelho continually beats readers over the head with the simplistic feel-good \\"hidden story,\\" I would have to argue that most people with a basic grasp of literacy will catch on. <br /> <br />I recommend that you leave this one to Julia Roberts on the beach.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is a great DVD.  However, you must be a long time Cure fan to really enjoy this DVD set.  As with any live DVD in my opinion.
0060090367|5.0|Probably my favorite Marian Keyes novel. I've read every one of them.  You can't help but love the characters, faults and all.  The dysfunctional family in this book is hilarious.  I couldn't get enough of this book.  In fact, I've read it three times.  <br /> <br />Claire finds herself living in her parents home again, shortly after giving birth and her husband leaving her. You'll be cheering her along as she pulls her life back together. And all the while you're hoping the wretched ex-hubby gets his just dessert.
0767834739|5.0|If you felt the first \\"Resident Evil\\" movie didn't quite capture the atmosphere of the original game, you can sleep a little easier now. \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" has EVERYTHING: from dark, creepy graveyards, a gothic cathedral and classic lorries in an \\"Escape from New York\\"- style deserted city to a cigarette smoking Jill Valentine and half naked hooker zombies. <br />Although this sequel clearly had a much bigger budget than the original film, director Alexander Witt has kept it credible and didn't use digital technology to bombard your senses and keep your mind of the lack of a decent storyline. Rather than making you feel like you're watching a computer- made movie where nothing seems real, the special effects help create a desolate and panicky atmosphere with credible characters who struggle to survive in a city that's infested with their undead compatriots, partially decayed K-9s and other creepy lifeforms. The scene where one survivor has to go up against a class of elementary school zombies is just terrifying. <br />Unlike the director of the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake, Witt and producer/ script writer Paul W.S. Anderson have opted not to follow in the footsteps of the fast- moving \\"28 Days Later\\" zombies, but has clearly been inspired not only by George Romero's view of walking corpses, but also by his opinion of our western society. The real evil in this movie is not the zombies or even the killer mutant Nemesis (who looks and sounds like he has just stepped out of the original game and into this movie), but a Big Brother- style multinational that puts itself above the law and has no respect whatsoever for morale, decency or anything human.  <br />Even if you've never played the video game, didn't like the first \\"Resident Evil\\" movie or don't care for a lot of high tech military action in a horror film, I'd still highly recommend you take the time to watch this one. If you liked both the 1978 version of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"Aliens\\", you're going to love \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\". Besides, if internationally acclaimed Milla Jovovich agreed to add it to her rsum of, among others, \\"the Fifth Element\\", \\"the Messenger: the Story of Jean of Arc\\" and \\"the Million Dollar Hotel\\", it has to be good!

0805062971|4.0|Have you ever felt like nothing you have ever done makes any real sense?  In analyzing the motivation and accomplishments as a young adult, sometimes it seems like my purpose was lost right after I was playing kickball in the cul-de-sac with the other neighborhood kids.  Chuck nails this feeling brilliantly, addressing 18-30 year olds, who \\"don't have a Great War in our generation, or a Great Depression,\\" at least in the traditional sense.  Tyler Durden, the great leader of the novel, has you screaming for release from the complicated and empty paradigm in which we live.  He seduces you into being on of his followers, one of his \\"space monkeys.\\" <br /> <br />This novel is important.  Generation X was the group who needed to read it most.  They did, and they fell in love with it, but Generation X was the group who understood it the least.  After the movie came out (because lets be realistic, Gen X doesn't read!) there were little fight clubs breaking out all over the states.  City ordinances tried to ban them, but how can the fuzz break up a fight when both parties want to be fighting?  Difficult, huh?  I once met an 18-year old who had a scar on his hand.  The scar was in the shape of lips, and the scar was made from lye.  Tyler Durden told his masochist followers that it would free them from their meaningless society-the searing pain from a chemical lye burn.  Do you think he was freed? <br /> <br />Palahniuk wrote to show all of us how to avoid being \\"space monkeys,\\" how to think for ourselves.  Tyler Durden's passion is unequaled.  It doesn't matter what he is passionate about, just that he is passionate.  We are always in search of a leader, and we will rally behind a passionate mane like Tyler Durden.  Think of the Fuehrer, this is about him.  Hitler was irrationally passionate-and his arguments made just little bit of sense.  But it was not his Socratic logos that made him powerful, it was his pathos. <br /> <br />Fight Club brilliantly bewitches the reader tobe a lover of Tyler Durden and his ideals.  Even though Tyler explains his plan, \\"We have to show these men and women freedom by enslaving them, and show them courage by frightening them.  Napoleon bragged that he could train men to sacrifice their lives for a scrap of ribbon.\\"  If you don't believe me that you will be convinced by this \\"free-thinker,\\" just read the book and see.   <br /> <br />Palahniuk leaves a little meat still on the bone.  That is why I rated this book with 4-stars.  His main characters could be more intimately developed.  This character development, along with filling in some of the holes in the plots, would make Fight Club one of the greatest novels ever written.   <br />
B000002NZO|5.0|I know I might get beat up on this, but I think this is one of Genesis (PG era) best recordings.. but I don't meant to take away from SEBTP or NC or LLDOB but this one holds wieght very well.<br /><br />The way I look at it, if this was the only Genesis PG record ever made, and we had nothing to compare it to ... would it be good?  I think it would be VERY GOOD.  I like every song.  'Looking for Someone' 'White Mountain' all are great.  A lot of people say KNIFE is the stand out, and it is very good, but I think the other songs are just as good.<br /><br />Buy this CD and enjoy yourself.
B000002TQB|5.0|Parklife is one of the best albums in my collection, and it's definately Blur's best album before they evolved. Highlights on this album: <br /> <br />Girls and Boys: a very catchy disco-like song, I love it <br />End of a Century: My favorite on the album, it's really a great song in all but it is too short. <br />Parklife: Awesome song, good guitar work, I love how it's narrarated rather than sung. <br />London Loves: I don't like this song much anymore but it's good and catchy, summarizes the album well. <br />Trouble in the Message Centre: Really awesome song, great chord progression and there's a little solo in there I think. <br /> <br />That's the album, if you like music you'll like it.

It's not just inane yelling about strippers, drinking, and \\"good times.\\" In fact, he makes fun of that. This huge underground hip hop/rap producer comes out and speaks his thoughts about the genre, and creates true art. AND he's hilarious! A guaranteed good choice. At least have a listen on this site, if you don't believe me.
B00005JLEX|5.0|First of all, don't think twice, buy it HERE.  I checked several local retailers and they all wanted seven to ten dollars more for the same set.  Some of them claiming to be a SALE of all things.  Its a great deal, especially with the free shipping. <br /> <br />That said, this box set is simply bursting at the seams.  Where to start ?  Like Three's Company, Seinfeld didn't have a full first season, per se.  UNLIKE Three's Company, when it came to the DVD, they bundled Seasons 1 and 2 together, esssentially combining the \\"this\\" with the \\"that\\".  There's also oodles of extras.  Commentaries, An optional 'text' track with all kinds of factoids, interviews, bloopers.  This is a boxed set built with the fan in mind. <br /> <br />And, as has been stated elsewhere, some of these episodes are rarely seen.  And when they are, something has been edited for syndication.  Here, you get the full episodes, with no commercials.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  So kick back and enjoy all of the Kramer entrances, Elaine shoves, and George's first inkling that he might like to be an architect.  This gem is well worth the money.  Yadda, yadda, yadda.
B00003CY6M|2.0|Much of the blame for the weaknesses of this film should be laid at the feet of screenwriter Marc Klein.  And this is nothing new to film, how a potentially interesting concept turns into a weak script.  John Cusack sleepwalks through this story of \\"fate\\", and Kate Beckinsale seems miscast as a Brit with an upper class accent.  As the film starts we hear a song sung by Louie Armstrong, and though one must admit he sucks as a singer, one thinks, \\"well, okay, alot of cool people like Louie so it may be a cool film.\\"  Alas it was not to be.<br /><br />  From the opening scene at Bloomingdales when the camera pans some employees in the window one thinks, \\"looks like a nothing of a film coming up\\".  One then sees Cusack and Beckinsale fighting over a pair of gloves.  Though Kate is a beauty her accent doesn't fit well.  Not to mention her best friend, Molly Shannon...now there's an annoying element to add into the mix.<br /><br />  Anyway, Kate has taken the idea of fate to the extreme and as the plot progresses becomes less and less realistic until it becomes a fantasy-based fairy tale.  The synchronicity elements again are an interesting theme to explore, but this film uses them more as fill-in-the-blanks-of-a-romantic-comedy elements.  The dialogue is strictly cheap laughs, and the ideas ripped from Sleepless in Seattle easily apparent.  The comedy, the thing that could have made this worth watching falls flat as well, and Molly Shannon helps lower the bar to the SNL level of comedy.<br /><br />  The story, aside from the synchronicity, is bland and average, reminiscent of many good or not-so-good New York City romantic comedies.  I recommend some other good Cusack films in its stead:  High Fidelity and Gross Point Blanke.
B0002X314C|3.0|This was the first CD I've purchased in about two years...i bought it after seeing John Legend on the Today morning show singing Ordinary People.  I feel a little tricked because there's a sentiment behind the lyrics in most of his songs that I just wasn't expecting. (i.e. He's \\"playing\\" grown, talking about silly useless things.)  Maybe it just isn't for me.  The first half features great sound, but it falls into the same trap of every other song on the radio that features good beats but just plain idiotic lyrical thoughts.  It's not all bad, but I expected more.  Not everyone cares about good solid lyrics; but if you do, this CD might not be for you either.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is an excellent novel for the post 9/11 world. No, I'm not prescribing a \\"Buddhist\\" religion to Muslims or Christians; this is because the novel Siddhartha does not prescribe any religion or doctrine. Neither does it really tell you how to be happy or spiritually enlightened; the novel simply deals with the fact that enlightenment is subjective from person to person. What made Siddhartha enlightened in the novel, did not make Gotama, the other Buddha enlightened. But the saintly thing about the character Siddhartha, is he did not judge Gotama for his spiritual differences or try to convert others to any doctrine.<br /><br />The prose in the novel is simple, yet lush, descriptive and profound, making it a short satisfying read, which should be taken in slowly, rather than rushing through where you might miss important words.<br /><br />In Siddhartha, a young Brahmins son, leaves a comfortable life when early in the novel he joins the Samanas, a group of wandering ascetics, practicing self denial. In Siddartha's journey he begins to distrust doctrines because they brought knowllege, but no wisdom, no peace or enlightenment. He leaves the Samanas and began a life which many would call \\"sinful\\" until he changes his lifestyle again.<br /><br />But the way Siddhartha by Herman Hesse is different than other religious books, is that the character Siddhartha has \\"to sin in order to live again.\\" The fact is that everyone is a sinner. There is no way to not be a sinner, and Siddhartha has to have the \\"experience\\" of what is sin, to know what is moral and right. Many religious books simply tell you how to live, this novel doesn't. Please do not read it as an introduction to Buddhism, or something you can read and immediately achieve salvation, it's simply a work of art that shows spiritual freedom in the path one takes.<br /><br />The message I received from the novel was that life is too complex to prescribe a way of salvation that works for everyone. As Hesse says, \\"Wisdom is not communicable\\" and the book doesn't communicate wisdom universally, because no one can. In this fanatical world, religions might not clash so much if they took this into consideration.d the book doesn't communicate wisdom universally, because no one can.

630157401X|5.0|I'm a sucker for adventure films. Iv'e seen them all: Mask of Zorro, LOTR, Sky Captain and The World Of Tomorrow, a whole bunch. But Iv'e rarely seen one I like as much as this one. Why? Because it's everything you'd want in an adventure film: action, laughs, and a great storyline. Although Iv'e seen the other two Indy films, I still think this is the best, because it has Sean Connery in it. It's impossible not to like Sean Connery. He's funny, he's handsome, and almost every movie he's in is a great action film. In this movie, Indiana and his father, played by Connery, set on a quest to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis use its power to take over the world. Lots of action and Connery saying funny things ensues.
B0000060NH|5.0|People called this a jazz album but some people would say \\"Y'know this ain't a jazz is more a funk-R&B album with less jazz\\". I think a lot of people shouldn't understand that this is Marvin's first doing an entire album for a blaxploitation film. I think I love this album so much (originally own it on LP but not on CD). The CD of it should wait. Like 4 instance, what if Marvin used his style as a jazz singer or a crooner leading the big bands and stuff. What if he was the next Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, or whatever. <br /> <br />Maybe we should have jazz guru Bobby McFerrin do the part of it. I think everybody would be proud if we would've stay a little longer and made this album 33 years 2day. If ya'll like to hear more jazz like this, I recommend u should pick up Quincy Jones' Walking in Space, Grover Washington, Jr.'s The Best of Grover Washington, Jr., Jon B.'s Bonafide, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, Quincy Jones' Q's Jook Joint, Body Heat, Sounds & Stuff Like That, Common's Like Water for Chocolate, Resurrection, One Day It'll All Make Sense, Prince's Musicology, Regina Belle's Lazy Afternoon, Barry White's All-Time Greatest Hits, Ronny Jordan's The Antidote, The Roots' Things Fall Apart, The book Insatiable by Allison Hobbs and definitely some styles from Chet Baker, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Miles Davis again, Gil Evans, Dizzy Gillespie, Freddie Hubbard, GRP All-Star Big Band (my favorite band of all-time), and many others u can see. Highly recommended.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I really just wanted to give this movie 5 stars... But since i have this space, i might as well review it some.. This was SOO funny, i saw this 4 times in theaters, and i bought the DVD the DAY it came out.  It's extremly funny, but for a comedy/spoof.. it's also surprisingly gore filled and scary at times (not that much).  Overall, it's my favorite horror comedy after Idle Hands.
B000002IFP|5.0|What can I say 'bout Mick Hucknall? He should be the next Miles Davis, Donald Fagen (of Steely Dan), Boz Scaggs, Barry White, Bobby Caldwell, Andre 3000 (of Outkast), Prince, Marvin Gaye, Frank Sinatra, or whatever.  <br /> <br />I mean he could be anything, know I'm mean. This is the album that rockin' 2day 'cuz of the experimentation of varied styles and stuff. Yeah Mick can surely sing. I would love to work with him one day.  <br /> <br />As I was saying on the album, it's a blend of jazz, pop, rock, soul, R&B, blues, etc. incl. a classic remake of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\". <br /> <br />This is definitely goin' in2 my collection along with others I like: Steely Dan, Miles Davis, Boz Scaggs, Barry White, The Doobie Brothers, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Mase, Nelly, OutKast, Quincy Jones, R. Kelly, Grover Washington, Jr., Peter Nero, Henry Mancini, Al Hirt, Donald Fagen, Guru, Digable Planets, David Sanborn, George Benson, Bob James, etc.  A Must-Have. <br /> <br />

B00005JMFQ|4.0|I loved this movie because it had all kinds of different romantic situations, because everyone connects to everyone else in some way or another.  I also love how it seems all the great British actors of today were gathered together for one film, such as Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson--just to name a few--even if the Prime Minister (played by Hugh Grant) does take a few stabs at Americans.  I can overlook that. <br />I found the nudity scenes to be a bit much, but like another reviewer point out, it shows that you can find love even in the most awkward of situations.  Each situation of love seems to be something someone can relate to.  There's the man who loves his wife, but is tempted by the secretary at his office and his wife finds out; the man who is in mourning after the death of his beloved wife, and there's his stepson who is suffereing from that wonderful thing called unrequited love.  Then there's, what breaks my heart the most, the love that can never be due to certain circumstances.  The movie is wonderful and can even be enjoyed with your spouse! To the women out there, your guy will assume this is a complete chick flick but my husband fell completely in love with this movie! <br />I was a little disappointed with the bonus material.  There's a Kelly Clarkson music video \\"The Trouble With Love\\", which is good because I really like the song.  There are deleted scenes, which are a bit drawn out because there isn't a menu to pick a scene and each deleted scene started out with an introduction from the writer and director, Richard Curtis.  There's also another feature, The Music of Love Actually, which lost my interest pretty quickly.  There's also a feature commentary with a few of the actors and, of course, Richard Curtis.  I have yet to watch that, but those are usually pretty enjoyable.  I'm a sucker for making-of featurettes, and I was disappointed there wasn't one. <br />I give the movie 5 stars and the bonus material 3 stars.

B0002F6BRE|2.0|The IDEA of this movie is really cute, but the end result was not.  I went to the movies to see this, expecting this movie to be filled with side-splitting hilarity, but I was thoroughly disappointed.  The MPAA unfortunately showed the funniest moments on the previews.  Will Ferrell wasn't even very cute playing a elf who is new to the real world.  He just looked like a mentally disturbed man walking on the streets in an elf costume.  Ed Asner was also not the most impressive Santa I had ever seen.  This is of course a must for Will Ferrell fans, but does not belong on the shelf with other Christmas classics.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|One misty morning I heard strains of \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" coming from the radio, and I was so mesmerized that I had to stop what I was doing and wait for the announcer to name the track. I took a chance buying this disk, which turned out to be one of the most innovative and exciting debut rock CDs of 2004. Completely enigmatic lyrics that are nonetheless quite singable (\\"...if you're somethin', don't ask for nothin', and if you're nothin', don't ask for somethin'!), extraordinary arrangements with lots of odd instruments, and powerful vocals that recall London Suede and even early Bowie, but with an entirely unique sensibility. It's thrilling to find a recording that works as a song cycle, not just a hit with plenty of dull garbage on the other tracks. I've played this disc at least once a day since I bought it three weeks ago, and it only grows more intriguing with each listening. Definitely a band to watch out for!
B000000OQF|5.0|When magazines such as Rolling Stone, Blender and Spin all hail Guns N' Roses' legendary album, Appetite for Destruction, as the greatest hard rock album of all time, well, who am I to argue otherwise.  With over 20 million copies sold (it still moves 400 000 copies a year) and certified platinum 15 times in North America, it's hard to dispute the worldwide popularity and acclaim that the once most dangerous band in the world was able to garner.    Highlights:    Probably the best lead off track ever, \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" with loud, screeching and wailing guitars layered with Axl's unrelenting and renowned shriek conveys the recklessness and raw sound that were to define the band.  Alice Cooper once said that if there was one song he wished he had written, Welcome to the Jungle would be it.  I dare you to go to a major sporting evet and get away without hearing this song played over the P.A.     The bass-driven anger filled \\"It's So Easy\\" continues the story of the menacing streets of Los Angeles.  Arguably one the greatest bass intros in hard rock, \\"It's so Easy\\" is definitely one of the hidden gems of the album (for the casual listener of course).    The song with the most groove would have to be \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" the band's sordid tale of drug use.    Best driving song: Paradise City  Best karaoke song: Sweet Child O'Mine  Best hidden gem: Rocket Queen (I love the riff change halfway through the song - oh and the fact that during the guitar solo you can make out the sounds of Axl Rose having sex with a groupe.    If you can't get past Axl's voice, you're not going to like anything by Guns N' Roses.  However, it is my opinion that Axl is capable of turning a mediocre song (Think About You) into a really good song.  You take Elton John, Janis Joplin, Ronnie Van Zant (of Lynyrd Skynrd), Dan McCafferty (of Nazareth) and you have the vocals of Axl Rose.  To me, he is the greatest frontman hard rock has ever seen since Robert Plant.  On Appetite for Destruction, Rose's vocals and lyrics, while angry, menacing and raw, are nothing but honest.  Unlike other frontman at the time (Def Leppard, Poison, Motley Crue), Axl required little in backing vocals and wrote about what he felt, caring little about the effect it would have on his audience.  There is nothing contrived about this record and what was written by Axl.  Songs like \\"Out Ta Get Me,\\" \\"Rocket Queen\\" and \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" are when Axl is at his best: pissed off yet insecure.      Personally, I can't relate to any of the lyrics.  I do not know what it's like to be surrounded by vagrants and having to live off the mean streets of a city like Los Angeles.  Moreover, I'm not a big fan of hair-metal, which I argue has little relation to Guns N' Roses.  Yet for some reason, Appetite for Destruction is my favourite album.      To say that either Hysteria, Back in Black or Appetite for Destruction is the greatest hard rock album of all time is a rather arbitrary measure.  It's all about personal preference.  Admitting my own bias, I do believe Appetite to reign supreme for one reason: too many unmistakable songs, whether a fan or not.  The defining songs of the album, Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City and Sweet Child O'Mine are probably the most recognizable songs to come out of that era.  It was mentioned that \\"Love Bites\\" by Def Leppard was the greatest Power Ballad.  Yet I've never heard of it.  How many people could say the same about \\"Sweet Child O'Mine,\\" or \\"Welcome to the Jungle?\\"  Very few, I would wager.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|I always get giddy when a band can bring it all together like this.  The caliber of The Shins \\"Chutes Too Narrow\\" or Broken Social Scenes \\"You Forgot it in People\\".  Arcade Fire joins these two bands as the torchbearers of \\"indie\\" rock/pop.
006016848X|2.0|WELL! this book is not excately what i expected.  <br />the author keeps repeating himself, not only his ideas  but even the phrases as well! he keeps going on in circles..which only weakens the point. a chapter of 20 pages or so just keeps repeating one simple idea it is like he wanted to make sure we memorized the whole book before we put it down which is kinda annoying!while reading it i felt the author saying ''ok! repeat after me..''! <br />to be fare the book got some helpful ideas and a psycological analaysis which is not bad. but the book is like saying something in 180 pages while u can sum it in five simple words!
0670033693|5.0|This is a book I could read again and will.  Not only because I can't wait for the second book to come out in order to be reunited with these richly drawn characters I have come to think of as friends, but because this is just a really good book.  The Cold Dish is a true page-turner.  Craig Johnson has skillfully written this thriller to keep you guessing until the very end.   <br /> <br />If you want to read a book with real characters, structure and an engaging and addicting plot, READ THIS BOOK -- you won't regret it.
0800177177|2.0|...there should have been about a dozen people with that title. <br /> <br />This movie is a horrible rendition of the original Bram Stoker novel.  Although it follows the main plot points relatively faithfully, the theme and characters are horribly butchered.  I'm not saying that they just changed the characters a bit.  No.  They butchered them adding random junk for pure shock value (the story did not need drug addicts, lesbians, nymphomaniacs, or hardcore bestiality; sorry).  And any time something significan happens the set is hosed down with gallons of fake blood. <br /> <br />If you want to really experience Dracula, study some introductory psychology (specifically Freudian) and read the *real* Bram Stoker novel.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Wow!  I thought that when Friends was over that I would never laug again.  I'm so glad that DHs has come along - and now it's going to be on DVD!, it's like the best of Ally McBeal meets Footballers Wives (from the UK - if you haven't seen it, you should!), with Six Feet Under sprinkles!   <br /> <br />So, if you are going to watch anything this year - THIS IS GOTTA BE IT!!   <br /> <br />When the pilot first shewed - I wasn't sure, but once I had seen the third show I was HOOKED!  I am sure you feel the same.  All I can say is - it is WRONG that the producers of this show consistently fail to put this shew out and give us what we all want! <br /> <br />Looking forward to series 3!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This film is about two people and how they meet up and develop a temporary relationship in Japan.  Both are at troubled spots in their lives.  Bill Murray plays Harris, a man who is currently in a mid-life crisis.  Johansson plays Charlotte, a twenty-five year old woman who has been left alone by her husband, for some time.  Both Harris and Charlotte find temporary solace in each other. <br /> <br />While this film attempts to be creative, it is just like an American Beauty rip-off, and I could not stand American Beauty.  The only reasons these characters came together was because they were the only ones there who were American.  I'm not trying to be ethnocentric; this is how both Murray's and Johansson's characters act. <br /> <br />Probably the worst aspect of this film, other than the fact that it was lauded over for nothing, is that there is no real conclusion (and that's not a spoiler).  Nothing gets achieved, no one learns anything, and nothing is better off for the two of them having met. <br /> <br />The closes thing to this film is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is incredibly better.  I would just stay away from Lost in Translation, unless you want to hear what all the gawk is about, because you are better off not seeing it.
B0002S94OS|2.0|like too much american \\"metal\\" these days, this album was great for the first week or two.  then you realize that what you're hearing is WAAAY too much production applied to the same 4 or 5 riffs which are then just repeated.  once those riffs go stale, the album is worthless.  the only song on here i could see myself listening to for years is \\"one gun\\", and that is more about the lyrics and meaning of the song than the song itself.

B0006AZMFM|5.0|Never before Delta Goodrem entered the music industry did I know what it was like to get lost in the music.  There are truly no superlatives that can describe how praiseworthy the ever flourishing Miss Goodrem is. <br />Take a step into another enchanting chapter of the Aussie star's life with Mistaken Identity which somehow manages to live up to the extraordinary debut album Innocent Eyes. <br />My high expectations have been easily fulfilled and more. <br />A selection of some of the songs; <br />'Out Of The Blue' is a true Delta classic.  One of those that makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. <br />'The Analyst' has a gripping melody which, once you know the lyrics you will be a slave to this song. Fantastic piano. <br />'Mistaken Identity' is an instant reminder how Delta has grown up.  Harsher lyrics than normal but she needs to get her message across, making this a good feighsty track. <br />'Be Strong' hits my soul like 'Born To Try' does form the debut album.  Slower and softer, though still with uplifting, inspirational and motivational lyrics. <br />'Miscommunication' is pure excellence.  This is the worst song to listen to if you need to concentrate on something, and strangely this applies to the whole of the song from beginning to end, not just the chorus. <br />'Electric Storm' is a mysterious and adventerous song taking you through a rough journey.  Again, this has harsher lyrics than what Delta fans are used to - (\\"Fighting for no reward, cold in the rain I'm tossing and turning your words ever burning...) and (Emotional suicides...) are just a random pick of lines from one of the best tracks on the album. Great lyrics. Great tempo. Great Piano. GREAT STUFF! <br />'Extraordinary Day' is lyrically one of the best. This signals a hallmark in Delta life - July 8th, the day she was diagnosed with Hodgkinsons. I can't rate this song high enough. <br />'Fragile' shows that despite pulling through the rough stages in her life magnificently sheis still human.  She opens up in this song to let you know exactly how she feels at times. <br />Bearing in mind that every track Delta writes is honest and true I think that for her to be able to share this song and others with the world is honourable. <br />'Disorientated' Love it!  It seems whatever Delta writes with her dear friend Vince Pizzinga turns to absolute gold.  'Innocent Eyes', 'Extraordinary Day' and now this.  One of the best she has to her collection.  You should have access to a volume up button, PRESS IT! <br />'You Are My Rock' is a truly extra beautiful thankyou song to her brother Trent I think.  Sung with a lot of feeling and emotion, if you have a brother of your own you may find yourself holding back the tears just as I did. <br /> <br />Compared to the debut album, Mistaken Identity has more bite, musical content, emotion, joy, sadness, completely unforgettable melodies and she is also accompanied by excellent background singers.  If you are used to hearing the tracks from Innocent Eyes this may feel quite different.  This is a lot fresher and has a more grown up feel to it, which can only be expected.  I wouldn't say that Mistaken Identity is better, just matched.  After all, in my opinion Innocent Eyes is a legendary album in it's own right. <br />The lyrics are really well worth reading before you come to judge any of the tracks yourself.   <br />But appreciation must go to the excellent co-writers, Guy Chambers and Vince Pizzinga to name only a few.  What a team they make to put a truly amazing album on the shelf.  They are all brilliant, I hail them all! <br />You can tell what the motives of these people are - the music. <br />This is an album that fills me with emotion.  Some songs of enjoyment, some of sadness and sorrow.  Some lift my spirits and motivate me and some just make me want to shed tears. <br />Please I beg you, throw away any rubbish or second rate music from those so-called 'artists' from your cd collection (or sell them on Amazon) and make way for real music.  Put Delta Goodrem's Mistaken Identity (and Innocent Eyes if you don't already have it) top of your wish list if you want the real deal. Or buy it now, you are already missing out.  <br />Please note: I'm not praising this album for the sake of it.  All content of this review is of my own honest opinion, and I hope it will help you appreciate a real musician for all her worth.  <br /> <br />Delta Goodrem - An individual. An original.

B00005JMJG|4.0|This is a story about love, and the fate of love.  Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) decide to erase their memories of each other, but at the last moment Joel realizes that he wants to save his treasured memories. <br /> <br />After that, the whole film revolves around the idea of love that was meant to be.  No it is not perfect love, but it is about two people coming together and enjoying one anthers company.  There are tough times and good times, but only too late do they realize that all memories should be protected. <br /> <br />I found this movie to be a highly original telling of not just the traditional love story, but the difficult ones, and the sad ones too.  The actors do a marvelous job of portraying daily life, and the director Michel Gondry, along with Kaufman's script, does a wonderful job of illuminating those everyday moments. <br /> <br />I especially liked the idea that things revolve, and return, and are in a sense reborn.  The memory eraser company seems like science on the cutting edge; however, ethical dilemmas and personal endangerment highlight this as a man vs. machine theme too.  Therefore, the movie is not all just about love.  (In fact one of my favorite parts is the internal conflict in the memory erasing business itself.) <br /> <br />In summary, if you like artsy, or creative films, with everyday themes then you will really like this film.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I love the acoustic guitar, even though I can't play it (I'm a bass guy).  Most of my favorite bands have an acoustic guitar prominently involved - Bread, America, late-period Chicago, Seals and Crofts, England Dan and John Ford Coley, Loggins and Messina, and Kenny Loggins.  Okay, okay, maybe I'm dating myself a little by these references.  But in their day, these guys could put on a show and blow the Coldplays and Linkin Parks of the world off the stage.  Heck, maybe they still could.  So as you can understand, when I first heard the stylings of Mr. Mayer on my radio, I was pretty excited - \\"Hey!\\" I exclaimed aloud.  \\"Somebody's bringing the acoustic guitar back into play.  Right on, man!  I'm going to buy your album, okay?\\"  And based on that song (\\"No Such Thing\\"), it sounded like someone had fused Aaron Carter's style with Kenny Loggins's licks.  In other words, good, good stuff. <br />  <br />So, naturally, I bought \\"Room for Squares\\", expecting the beginnings of a soft rock rebirth, and I have to say I've been disappointed.  Sure, the single is great.  And sure, Mayer's got a good voice.  But it seems like he's using a little slight-of-hand (old magician's term), disguising mediocre songs with his crooning.  And while that may be great for some folks, I prefer the whole package.  Perhaps he should play more to his strengths, and ignore his weaknesses - a covers album might be the way to go, or maybe even some sort of collaboration with a professional writer, a tactic that's worked for some of today's best pop stars (Carter, Jesse McCartney, etc.).  In time, he might even see his writing coming around, finding himself penning this generation's \\"Horse With No Name\\" or \\"Your Mama Don't Dance\\".   <br />  <br />And when that happens, you can bet I'll be first in line, money in hand.
0743246616|5.0|I absolutely love the Magnolia bakery's \\"Vanilla Vanilla\\" Cupcakes. I would travel from the Bronx to the Village in Manhattan just to buy some. Then I purchased the More From Magnolia cook book, hoping that I would be able to duplicate the cupcakes myself.

Creaming the butter for the recipe takes some elbow grease, but well worth it. If you love the cupcakes from Magnolia, but don't have the means to go to their store as frequently as you would like,get this cookbook! And if you follow the directions exactly, you will be able to satisfy your craving for the Magnolia cupcake.

B00007ELEL|3.0|This film is about a mix-up, but not one of those \\"oh, that's my pencil\\" mix-ups.  No way.  This is much closer to a \\"that's my baby!\\" mix-up.  It all starts when Jeff Bridge's character, the Dude a.k.a. Lebowski, is assaulted for his \\"wife's\\" debts.  The problem is he has no wife, no job, and well just his friends and his love of bowling.  But wait, this is a comedy.  The humor comes from the Dude, and his two friends (played by Steve Buscemi and John Goodman), and their goofiness trying to maintain their own limited status quo. <br /> <br />This film was a bomb at the box office, but has become a cult classic to some.  However, I stand firmly in the middle.  The film was okay, and funny at times, and I found myself repeating a few of the lines, for a long time.  However, the story is kind of chaotic and in essence based around nothing.  With very limited emotional appeal, as the Dude's attempt to get his mediocre life on tract just seems rather simple, there is nothing to draw the audience's attention too. <br /> <br />However, like I said there is a bit of humor and some of you will actually like the characters more then I think you should.  Overall ok, but I'd give it one run through just for yourself.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I've always been a fan, since the War and Boy days, so it is safe to say this will be a positive review. For a collection cd, this is great - it's got some smaller songs that used to slip through the cracks (Sweetest Thing) and the powerhouses \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Pride\\", \\"In the Name of Love\\" and my favorite, \\"Bad\\". This is a good cd to have in your car; gives enough representation from each cd.
B000002BQK|4.0|This CD is awesome, seriously. If you notice, it starts out with Honey, her first single off the CD which is catchy as hell but once you get to My All and continue on, you start to feel her desires and her unhappiness with her place:<br /><br />The Roof showcases her reminiscing about the romantic moments with her ex, Fourth of July, although off key at many points, is so long and drawn out, but most importantly, heartfelt, I can't help but love it.<br /><br />You really feel the way she misses those moments, \\"Truly, I could never feel the same as I felt that fourth of July.\\"<br /><br />Breakdown is what it says, continuing the memory and pain. She shows a happy face so others don't know she dwells on the moments.<br /><br />She also manages to remake Prince's outstandingly emotional \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" which I loved. Her version is with Sisqo which came out surprisingly well IMO. I still can't really decide which is better but they're both good.<br /><br />I didn't give the CD a full 5 because I know that one of her earlier releases were probably better but this one is truly great indeed.

0385510438|2.0|Although I have read far worse books than this one, I had a definite feeling of disappointment after finishing it. The expected story line comprised only a fairly small percentage of the book. This in itself need not be fatal. The same thing could be said about the much-loved \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" <br /> <br />In this case, however, the \\"filler\\" around the plot just was not strong enough to carry the story. The characters were fairly interesting and fairly compelling but (again) not strong enough to carry the story. The \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" characters, for example, did a better job in a similar situation. <br /> <br />The narrator of the story became less and interesting during the course of the book. He confessed to be, after running a small town newspaper for ten years, \\"tired of writing.\\" The more tired of writing he became, the more tired I became of reading what he had to say. <br /> <br />Finally, several of the \\"mystery\\" elements of the story had loose ends that were not resolved or even mentioned.  <br /> <br />I gave the book two stars because I believe it would have to have been at least a little worse to rank only one star. But if it would have to have been much better in the areas mentioned to have been rated four or five stars.
B00003CWL6|1.0|This movie is about a man's (Kevin Spacey) mid-life crisis and his offset views about life.  In addition to that, his family (and apparently everyone on his block) are having breakdowns too. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this movie would have been better if Kevin Spacey had just walked on screen for a second and said \\"life can be crazy at times, so just slow down and see the beauty.\\"  In fact, that would have been great in comparison to the movie that it really was. <br /> <br />My question is where was the reality?  The story is an attempt to reach out to people and show them something they understand or can relate to.  However, the attempt to do just that though fails because there are too many ridiculous sub-plots thrown in: whether it be pedophilia, insecurity with one's homosexuality, power hunger, greed, and lust, or just a lack of reality with the world. <br /> <br />Most of these characters would be labeled insane if checked out by doctors, and none of them having anything in connection to the real world.  Kevin Spacey's character is much more like one of Ayn's Rand's characters in that he is the epitome of selfishness (and I like Ayn Rand). <br /> <br />Warning: if you want to see a film that covers a similar topic in a better way then watch Life As A House, but if you want to see what all the fuss is about then ask someone.  Because, watching this movie is more then just a waste of one's time, it is a degradation of one's mind.
B00005JMAH|4.0|It was a great movie, with some new characters.  I agree that there were ALOT of things left out of the movie, that the book explained, especially who Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs is.   <br /> <br />The change in Dumbledore was an unfortunate necessity, with the passing of the original Dumbledore character.  Also, I was thrown by the change in Location.  Why the new scenery?   <br /> <br />I think the new director did capture the darker side of this chapter well enough, and a bit of comedy with the scenes on the Knight Bus, but I think there was still room for more information in backgrounds if they hadn't spent as much time watching Harry fly on Buckbeak (an awesome sight and great effects, but still a bit long).
0780020685|5.0|Without a doubt one of Kurosawa's crowning achievements - for those layman out there who just couldn't \\"Get it\\" I would suggest watching a lighter movie before hand, such as 'A Bug's Life' (Same plot) - and then maybe 'Taxi Driver' or 'Catch-22', just to get your head into a different mode of thinking, myopia can be a killer =/  Then and maybe then you'll be able to appreciate and understand this work.
1401300901|5.0|Oh my gosh- How did someone who has never experienced such a loss get this so right. I lost my Charlie last May and have gone through everything described in the book. How I wish I had a list and envelopes waiting for me each month to help me get through this. I read the book with many tears, but it was such a source of support for me, too. The many months and years ahead of me with so many memories will continue to be difficult, but \\"In the meantime, (I will) just live.\\" Thanks Cecelia~

B0006IIPIK|3.0|It's a world when tomorrow held promises of a bright future. Urban America, 1920 or so, and technology has managed to surpass the technology of 2004 in some ways, but is still charmingly cloaked in the clunky nuts and bolts of Rosie the Riveter. There's a comic book feel as giant robots invade the city, and Jude Law appears in a single-man plane to repel them with machine-gun fire. The plot unfolds to encompass more of the world, and eventually we learn that an evil scientist is gathering animals into a noah's ark, so that he can destroy the earth and make a paradise among the stars. The movie looks cool, with a soft lens filming technique and an all-CGI background that combine to give us a unique feel. But the plot is silly even in the rare instances when it is believable, and the screenplay can't give us any more than a caricature of the era. It succeeds on an \\"Indiana Jones\\" kind of level, but I wanted more cleverness to be inserted into both the dialogue and the plot to accompany the technical wizardry.

B00030590I|5.0|I loved this movie.  Great story and awesome visuals.  Very well directed. <br /> <br />I hope they can import more films from asia over to the United States.  The movies today lack originality but Hero brings new fresh ideas to the entertainment industry. <br /> <br />Highly recommend! A+++
0224063782|5.0|Christopher Boone is a boy aged 15, with Asbergers Syndrome.  It explores an adventure involving him, which starts when he discovers his neighbour's dog dead, in her back garden.  Over a length of time, this mystery gradually unfurls, until about half way through the book, after searching and trying to find the killer, the culprit finally admits to killing the dog. <br /> <br />But this turns out to be only a sideline to the plot, even though the book is called 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time'.  Christopher ends up on a much more complicated, and somewhat sinister and confusing adventure, which really made me think. <br /> <br />This book is written in first person- (Chris Boone is narrating), and it is written in an amazingly real-to-life style of autism, which Cristopher Boone has.  This is not insulting people with this condition- it is fully understanding them, and is written like this to give other people a taste of what it's like, I feel, and to be able to relate better to people like this. <br /> <br />My dad read this book after I read it, and he was amazed.  It kept me gripped for hours on end. <br /> <br />I'd reccommend it for anyone of any age.  Whoever you are, wherever you are, read it.  It will keep you gripped- guaranteed. <br /> <br />This book really touched me when I read it. <br /> <br />This book could touch anyone. <br /> <br />It has been in the top ten selling British books for about a year. <br /> <br />Just get it. <br /> <br />Thank you. <br /> <br />Matt.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is just adorable.  It seems like whenever I see a film about kids in school, they are either criminals or repelling aliens from space.  In this film, all the kids are just ordinary -- ordinary dorks, ordinary jocks, ordinary mean, ordinary decent.  No one is really awful, and everyone is basically OK.  But Napoleon, his brother kip, and uncle Rico have to be the best drawn dorks I have every seen.  There is no secret \\"cool\\" person waiting to be let out.  They are just wonderful, lovable, dorks.  Plot?  Asking a girl to the dance; Pedro running for class president; Kip's social calendar of online chat; Rico's attempt to make a living selling door to door, along with attempting to find a time machine so he can relive the one good moment in his life back in high school.  Nothing more; nothing less.  But it adds up to a lovely movie.  By the way, for those who are patient, if you wait till all the credits roll, and a few seconds of blank screen are left, there is a \\"two months later\\" addendum.  Enjoy!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I am such a huge fan of Alicia Keys.  I love every song on the album.  She has a beautiful voice and she writes songs that every woman can relate to.  Her live performances are amazing.  Unlike a lot of artists, she actually sounds great live.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This was an entertaining film that almost discounts Homer's Iliad entirely. I watched the film as a seperate version of a similar story and I enjoyed it. Brad Pitt is a good enough actor and is physically a good choice for Achilles, but his acting isn't enough when compared to the great work from Eric Bana as Hector or Peter O'tToole as King Priam. Orlando Bloom as Paris and the girl who played Helen were a joke and the lame dialogue they were given didn't help in the least. I wouldn't put this film in the same breath as Braveheart, Gladiator, or even The Last of the Mohicans in terms of great epic films, but after seeing the travesty that was Alexander I now appreciate this film as just pure entertainment. I gave it 5 stars instead of 4 to balance out some of the harsh reviews listed below.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I bought this album some time ago, just as a kind of introduction to Queen.    I had heard odd songs by them, but had never really got into them.    Now it's one of my favourite CDs on my CD rack, and I listen to it often.      You may have read my other reviews, in which case you will have noticed I like, as a general rule, heavy metal.    Queen, a classic rock band, maybe seem a bit dwarfed by all these heavy metal albums I have.    Not true.    In fact, the Queen Platinum Collection comes right up near the top of my favourite CDs.    This album contains some all time rock classics, such as 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and 'We are the Champions.'    I have listed my very favourite songs on this triple CD compilation.    CD 1:-    'Bohemian Rhapsody' is an amazing song.  Most of you, if not all of you, will have heard it.  It combines pop, opera, soft Rock, hard rock, and heavy metal all in one.  That, in my view, is quite phenominal. 5*.    'Now I'm here' has a great mute guitar intro, with Freddie Mercury singing in a truly unique way.  Then it goes off into hard guitar and drums, along with some incredible bass, to make hard rock.  It was at one point my favourite Queen Song. 5*.    'We Will Rock You', many of you will have heard.  Completely unaccompanied until the last burst of energetic heavy metal guitar virtuosity, an incredible guitar solo from Brian May. Full marks again. 5*.    CD 2    'I Want it all' is one of Queens hardest, in my view.  It has an incredible intro, followed by great hard guitar.  Halfway through, it goes quiet, causing me to cringe slightly, however, it bursts off immidiately into a hugely fast, impressive and HARD guitar solo. 5*.    'Breakthru' has, in my view, a poor intro.  It starts off Barber Shop style- like a 1930s American harmonic for- piece choir.  It redeems itself, by becoming, yet again, one of the hardest, with one of my all time favourite guiutar solos. 5*.    'Headlong' is a similar tone to Breakthru.  Its style is equally hard- and to the solo in this one- just wow! 5*.    'Hammer to Fall' is yet another hard one, with a heavy distortion guitar intro.  Not a truly amazing solo in this one, but still extremely impressive.  This was my original favourite Queen song.    'One Vision' has one of the best song intros I ever heard.  It starts off quietly, then bursts into a loud guitar riff- somewhat similar to Iron Maiden's 'The Prisoner'.  Not much of a solo in this one, but still amazing guitar(ps there is an impressive solo, but it only lasts about 5 seconds) 5*    CD 3:-    'No One but You' is not strictly speaking a Queen song.  It was written after Princess Diana of Wales's death in 1997, 6 years after Freddie Mercury died of AIDS in 1991.  A good slow pace- it is a tragic song- a very sad theme- about death. 5*, nevertheless.        They're all my favourites from the Platinum Collection.    There are other good songs too, but they are all the ones with 5*.    There are also ones I'd give 4* too, and 3*, and 2*, for one- but it overall accumulates to 5*.    Dont mind what modern day 'moshers' say about Queen.  What they don't realise is that Queen was one of the most influencial bands ever, and much music would not exist today without them.    This triple CD box set is one of the greatest collections of rock ever, in my opinion.    Just get it!    Thank you.    Matt.
B00004REVE|5.0|AGreat and interesting show about hurricanes. <br />Very informative; it explains what the difference is between hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones. <br />But not boring old studio material; no, loaded with actual live footage of raging hurricanes. <br />Well worth the money, at 55 minutes of raging planet material. <br />Must buy!
B000059MPH|1.0|I love Peter Ustinov but NOT as Poirot.  He looks more like Santa Claus without the suit.  OMG if I had to hear Mia Farrow whine one more second I'd tear my hair out.  Agatha Christie wrote Poirot as the central character of her books and her words were so descriptive we knew him well.  Ustinov wants to play him as a stooge who only gets smart in the end.  Poirot is murdered in this who-done-it, by too many well-known faded actors who chew up the scenery and spit Poirot out.  Want Poirot as Christie wrote him?  Check out David Suchet.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Most of the people I know who've seen this movie absolutely loved it.  And they can't stop quoting it.<br /><br />I'd heard about it when it was making the rounds on the festival circuit last year and wondered what it was like.  Since it was successful in festivals, I wondered if it was going to be a dry, insufferable \\"comedy\\" like THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, perhaps the most overrated, pretentious film I've ever seen.<br /><br />But NAPOLEON is funny.  The characters are so off-the-wall that the story looks like pure chaos for the first half.  But there is a story and it's fun to watch it all come together.  (Be sure to stick around for the wedding sequence following the end credits).<br /><br />You'll either love it or hate it.  And, if you love it, you'll laugh more than you have at any Hollywood comedy in years.
B0006399FS|1.0|A lifeless album, that's the truth behind the hype. Another release in the same vein has  All That You Can't Leave Behind but going further down the mainstream road. Can't believe how a band can just totally leave behind their best decade the 90's and just go headlong into mainstream rock not far from Bon Jovi. The absolute need for singalong choruses is very apparent on this record which drives me to distraction.  <br /> <br />With this album you're listening to something only barely maintaining your interest.  <br /> <br />The level of apathy encountered when listening to this album is off the charts. Tough to truly hate, because it doesn't give any reason for something that harsh, the whole album is just mediocrity after mediocrity. Disapointing from a band that gave us such albums as Achtung baby and Pop.  <br /> <br />So, the band just sounds like a bunch of aging musicians trying to find the flame that once brought them the credibility that has permitted them to get away with making subpar albums for almost 20 years.  They sound like current bands they influenced that could never be the original. (Admittedly, most aren't really trying. They could just heard that way.) Let's face it, U2 is a classic rock band trudging along for the lack of never have done anything else. And money. And ego!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYA|3.0|Some,perhaps,all,of the points I am going to make may have been made in the other 283 reviews of this film but I feel an urgent need to unburden myself to someone other than my long-suffering wife. <br />   I cannot add to the remarks of others about the spectacle or the actors etc.but why were there so many departures from the ancient stories? It may well have been a basis for the old tales that a coalition of Greeks wanted to destroy a powerful Troy which was barring access to the Hellespont and Black Sea but to the original audience the point of the whole exercise was the quest of Menelaus to get his wife back so killing him off-inaccurately would have made the whole thing pointless.Neither did Agamemnon die in Troy-he was murdered by his wife and her boyfriend when he returned home;Achilles did not make it into Troy;He was slain by Paris outside the city;Paris in his turn was slain in battle by the archer Philoctetes;and Aeneas did not escape through some sort of secret passage,he escaped with his son and his aged father through the streets,losing his wife on the way.See Aeschylus,The Agamemnon,Homer,The Oddessey Book11,The Aeneid,Books 2 and 6.
B00005U2JL|3.0|Great show, great songs. What is REALLY annoying is a combination of a few shows. What I wanted to see was one performance. Lets hope that Against All Gods would be released and it would be taken from one concert.
0385474547|3.0|*SPOILER*       <br />      I thought at the beginning of the this book, I would not like it.  However, it wasn't that bad.   <br />      The story is about a man and his relationship with the world around him.  He lives in a tribe in Africa where he is a well respected member.  He has many wives and many children.  His one major flaw is his fear of failure.  He constantly acts on his own pride and does not consider other people's feelings. <br />      The story describes his life when white people come and intervene with their way of life.  He has to see one of his own sons convert to christianity, which he feels is a personal attack on himself.  The book then ends with him giving up and committing suicide, which is also against his culture.  This could mean he was finally giving in to white culture.   <br />      I wasn't totally impressed with it. but it was still a good read.  I would recommend it to people who like the more intellectual reading.  It's not for the casual reader.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I admit I became familiar with the band only after seeing a \\"live\\" performance by the duo on MTV. (I know what you're saying, \\"They have MUSIC on MTV? What the..?!\\") Anyway, it was a performance of \\"Seven Nation Army\\", the first track on Elephant.  <br /> <br />I was intrigued by the fact that the band was a duo. I was also intrigued by the drummer: a little porcelain doll of a woman who really looked like she could rock. It impressed me enough that I bought the record. <br /> <br />Being a duo, The White Stripes has a very stripped-down sound. What makes it work is that they compensate with intensity. Another factor critical to the sound is Jack White's voice: it is very interesting and really helps adds diversity and range to the music. <br /> <br />I would say that The White Stripes have a fairly Retro, old school sound; their music would not have been all that out of place in the late '80s. One hears strains of Johhny Rotten, Violent Femmes, and even Hendrix in this music. <br /> <br />The tracks are all very good. The combination of Jack's voice with the intense guitar-centric rock is compelling and enjoyable. I highly recommend this album.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|At the urging of my 13 year-old son, I sat and watched Napoleon Dynamite. It took about 15 minutes into viewing the movie before I realized there was no plot. However, this movie did not need one. It is an accurate portrayal of the ultimate high school dork. I'm 44 years old and the 'Napoleon' in my high school was named Louis Rocha. Sorry Louis but it's true, you were (and I'm assuming, still are) the biggest dork out there, GOSH! From the clothes, hairstyle, Moon Boots, and general demeanor, the portrayal of Heder as the 'Dork Extraordinaire' is exemplary. The lack of social interaction skills, and subsequent affiliation with other dorks is clearly right on target. I watched this film over and over again (got it for Xmas!), truly hilarious once you get over the lack of plot. The dance sequence is incredible! One more thing, one of our software engineers where I work is representative of Napoleon at 35 years old, however, he's balding now. Still has his Moon Boots too, seriously. Dorks, you gotta love them.
B0002X314C|4.0|I bought this album partly because Kanye West's name was attached to it and since the College Dropout was my number 1 album in 2004, I had to give the John Legend CD a try.  It did not disappoint at all, in fact it went well above my expectations. The songs have soul and hooks to spare, and his smooth old school voice would have made Marvin Gaye proud.  Get Lifted also features a couple of guest appearances (Kanye West, Snoop Dogg)  Go out and check this guy out before he blows up and is all you hear, then you can say you liked him before he was really popular and irritate your friends.
B00005JLEX|1.0|Bluntly: when Seinfeld ended in 1998, it should have been left there, not dragged into the new millenium. <br />My opinion, this show really has nothing to offer. The only interesting fact about this series is how the writers managed to make a refrence to Superman in every episode. <br />I read on a website Seinfeld is now airing in syndication and will continue to air until at least 2011. Why bother?
B000002UAX|1.0|I can't believe this is supposed to be a classic Beatles album. It's almost awful. When I first heard it I said to myself \\"This can't be finished\\". It sounds so amateurish and sloppy. They must have been seriously drugged out when they recorded this album. Don't buy this record its an embarrassment to them and popular music. Lets do it in the road.... what happned to them?
0670033375|5.0|\\"Collapse\\" is a wonderful book!  Prof. Diamond combines hard science, rigorous historical research, and his own personal knowledge of people from the Bitterroot Valley of Montana to the west coast of Greenland to Rwanda to the highlands of New Guineau.  He pulls together clear and compelling explanations of how events unfolded (and are still unfolding) in various parts of the world.<br /><br />His accounts of various human communities draw on real data from a wide variety of academic fields, including isotope analysis,  pollen analysis, tree-ring analysis, seismology, agronomy, archaeology, sociology, and even the history of religion.  His explanations of each of these disciplines are lucid without oversimplification.  But, the strength of the book comes from the the way he combines results from all these fields to create straightforward narratives of what might have happened as various communities rose and fell.<br /><br />If I were I high school \\"social studies\\" teacher I would be talking to my principal today, saying \\"I want to put together an honors-level geography course and I want to use this as the textbook.\\"<br /><br />I do have one criticism. The subject matter of the book is tremendously consequential to people alive today, and hopefully \\"policy wonks\\" in governments will study the book and take it seriously.  But, the title is a bit inflammatory.  What's more, Prof. Diamond makes sure to explain the significance for the United States of his accounts of the demise of various ancient communities.  Some of these explanations extrapolate from ancient situations to modern in a way that isn't quite as solid as the rest of the book.  Diamond's extrapolations are very cleary marked as such.  However, I am still afraid that they, combined with the title, will provide an excuse for people to dismiss the book as a \\"pro-environment anti-business\\" ideological polemic.  That would be unfortunate, because it is actually balanced and nuanced in its explanation of the human condition.he human condition.
B000001DTM|1.0|This is rock music at its worst total bosh! Avoid this rubbish and go in serch of classic rock like the Who & Led Zeppelin. U2 are one of those commercial greedy groups that all but killed the genre.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Yes, she just keeps getting better with each album! It's rare for an artist to keep producing such high quality work. I love this album!
B000002OX7|5.0|This is the GREATEST ROCK ALBUM OF ALLTIME BAR-NONE!!! People will tell you its a Beatle album or maybe The Beach Boys. They're good. But this is the greatest ever put out there. Every track shines and \\"WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN\\" is the most amazing rock song ever recorded and Baba O'reily isn't far behind. If you like classic rock this is an absolute MUST HAVE!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I have to say I loved this movie.  I have to give a word of caution though...it may take 2 viewings before you really like it.  I saw it in the theater and loved it, but I know several people who needed to see it again to \\"appreciate\\" its humor. <br /> <br />As for the reviewer who thinks this is retro, it is apparent that you have never been to rural Idaho.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Mark Hamill recently said \\"how can one take a movie where,one minute you are running down the aisle with Sir Alec Guinnes and an 8 foot tall monkey,and moments later,the same monkey is flying a space ship??!!\\" <br />This trilogy has benn both loved and revered and been analyzed to bits(to death ,actually!) by die hards and critics for the last 25 years..and here we are atill talking about it. One thing is for sure.It stood the test of time(with new effects and all)and still,after all this years ,still towers as a collosus above all other movies..yes,even the one about the ring. <br />The packaging is ok,,but G.Lucas certainly has given US the best,most comprehensive SW edition in terms of technicalities ,it is hear flawless..The central theme is HEART.Heart,Soul and Body it has...and a combination of the perfect marriage of drama,adventure,comedy,suspence ,thrills and spills and you have your whole weekend charted out perfectly. <br />A New Hope,The Empire Strikes Back and The Return Of The Jedi are masterpieces in folk lore story telling and technical wizardry ...Am sure there will be separate disc with An Ultimate Edition in the pipeline...still these are quite possibly the Greatest movies ever made..but not the most powerful..for that we will be talking about \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\". But that is another story ...
B00004WKII|5.0|If you're a Hendrix fan, this is a definate must have!  Some of the takes are a bit rough.  They were done early in Hendrixs' career, and many are live recordings.  I love it because there are alternate recordings of many of the songs I've been listening to for decades!  The man is the original guitar genious!  All 4 discs are fantastic, and you can listen through all 4 in a row without getting tired of it.  Outstanding collection!!!
0876855575|5.0|Charles Bukowski has lived harder than you. Or anyone you know. This book desribes his early life in a thinly veiled autobiography. <br /> <br />You can't have a better introduction to Bukowski's writing. By reading this book, you'll get an introduction to the hilarious irony of his day-to-day situations, the piercing sadness of his struggle, and the amazing strength he shows in everything he does. <br /> <br />This book isn't for the half-hearted or the meek. Anyone who's ever tried harder only to have their lot get worse can understand what's happening here. Don't be judgemental; Bukowski really is just a drunk with a typewriter, but he writes better than any high school composition teacher.
0156027321|5.0|His name is Pi Patel. In 1978, this sixteen-year-old multi-religious Indian boy got lost in the Pacific Ocean, with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a royal Bengal tiger. The lone human survivor from the sinking of the ship Tsimtsum, he awaited the arrival of his rescuers in his twenty-six-foot long lifeboat. For how long, he did not and could not know. That is, if they ever came. Meanwhile, imprisoned on this seemingly infinite body of water, he struggled to survive, and of course, contemplated the meaning of life.  <br />It may sound far-fetched but despite the fantastical nature of this tale, Yann Martel tells it with a plausibility in which even the most incredulous readers can easily get lost. Life of Pi, winner of the 2002 Man Booker Prize, is an extremely well written book. The storytelling transcends the written words, bringing this highly original story vibrantly alive. Martel has a gift with words, conveying sights, smells and sounds in readers' minds. I found my mouth watering along with Pi's as I read about oothapam, rice idli and coconut yam kootu. I felt as if I experienced surviving a shipwreck firsthand. I sometimes had to reread some passages simply to absorb just how well Martel writes.  <br />There are many layers to this book, though it is difficult to know where to begin, as the line between reality and fantasy is rather blurry. The world of Pi is one of a magical reality. There are moments when there is confusion, not sure of where reality begins or ends, and not in a bad way either.  <br />The first narrator is an author (it is unclear whether this is Martel himself), who meets Pi Patel as an adult. The story of the life of Pi then starts to be told in the first person, interrupted in intervals by the author's brief descriptions of encounters with the adult Pi, lightly hinting at what happened. These reminders of \\"reality\\" grow less and less frequent until they fade away, letting the reader get taken up into the fable. The book, a novel within a novel, is labeled as fiction, but even so, it is hard to believe that Pi is not a real person. It is rare that a character seem more real than some people I know. In fact, the whole story makes readers want to believe, like any good tale should. <br />Although this novel is about the survival of a young man, his unfortunate adventure does not start until one-third through the book. Until then, his life is condensed into events and people that molded Pi into what he is today. For the majority of the book, Pi is the sole human character.  Pi is the only talking being literally as far as the eye can see, but it is not monotonous. He is a very interesting, complex and deep character who has a history, intelligence, a soul. With the readers he shares his spiritual pondering and his awe for the universe and everything it contains. He too learns things about himself during his adventure. A devout Muslim, Catholic and Hindu who grew up in a zoo, he can be anything but boring. A gentle vegetarian soul who \\"just wants to love God\\", he is wise beyond his years, and has much to say about religion. His narrating makes anything sound fascinating, finding meaning in all. Describing everything with great detail, he uses wonderful metaphors to impart his wisdom. I doubt that if I were watching three-toed sloths, I would have \\"felt I was in the presence of upside-down yogis in deep prayer, wise beings whose intense imaginative lives were beyond the reach of my scientific probing.\\" And this was how he sees the world.    <br />Though Pi was deprived of human contact while at sea, he had plenty of animal companions, and as the son of a zookeeper, he knows a wealth of information on animal behavior. The story revolves around nature and animals, a refreshing change from human drama: wild, harsh and dependent on instincts.     <br />Surprisingly unpredictable, Martel carefully conceals the denouement until the final moment possible. He leads the reader in one direction only to reveala quite unexpected and often ironic turn. It may contently and peacefully say one thing, but turn the page, and the next sentence could simply be - \\"The ship sank\\". There are many such amusing and ironic scenarios, in which the humor is not overt. However Pi tells these scenes with unbiased innocence, which makes it even funnier. <br />Found at any bookstore, Life of Pi is suitable for young adults and older. However, not everyone will enjoy this book. There are some exciting passages, however some people may find some parts boring. Pi sometimes gets bored himself, which is understandable when one is cut off from human contact and any form of entertainment, with nothing but water below and the sky above. This novel is not an action adventure: there are no high-speed car chases, but instead a boy's will to survive and the extremes it brings him to, as well as bloody instinct-driven animal fights. Still, whether or not it is your usual genre, it is most definitely worth a try. <br />Upon finishing this book, you will have newfound knowledge and wisdom: whether it be survival skills, animal behavior facts or something about faith, one thing will be for sure: no matter who you are, you will be touched by Pi and his unforgettable story. <br />
B00008PX8P|5.0|Absolutely unbelieveable.  Am ashamed to say that until a year or so ago, I had never seen a Zeppelin DVD.  Can't say that I was really missing out because coming across this one at a friend's house originally, it was my time to discover it.  Perhaps now it is yours.   <br /> <br />Without forcing any of my opinions or observations on anyone (so that you can make your own) this DVD will surpass anything you are looking for as far as footage of a band that is truly beyond all expectations.  Enjoy...buy it for others as well!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw this movie only after it had stood in theatres for a few weeks, so that I would be allowed the views and opinions of friends and critics before seeing it myself. The controversy before its premier did set me somewhat on edge; however, as a Jew and as a student of religion I knew the story of the crusifixion of Christ long before Mel canned this film. It would have been rediculous to want Gibson to make Christ's death anything other than the result of the Jewish Pharasees, though the fault of Christ's death rests (theologically speaking) with all people, as it was for the sin of the world for which he died. I do think Gibson could have done a better job of getting that message across, but since this was a physically historical and not philosophical movie I think he did a good job of getting the facts straight. <br /> <br />That asside, this was a very powerful and realistic movie, using all senses possible to give a real and accurate portrayal of historical events. Whether you're a Christian, Jew or other, there's no denying that the Romans killed a man named Jesus of Nazareth at the request of Jewish leaders, and that the methods used in the film were very like the methods used by the Romans of the time. For anyone interested in historical religion, this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 for accuracy alone. <br /> <br />The Catholic elements are hard to ignore: the prevalence of focus on the two Marys, the people Jesus met on his way to Golgotha, the speculation on the Christ's childhood. Although not all historically accurate, they lend a taste of what the director wanted to leave with the audience: That Jesus was a real man, he had a real life, he knew real people and died a real death. Those things are known, the ressurection is taken on faith. <br /> <br />All in all, although I never want to see this movie again, I give it five stars, and give Mr. Gibson a round of applause.
6304696515|5.0|OK, so Dangerous Liaisons is a little dated.  The story is over 200 years old, and the film is over 15 years old.  So, you might be weary of buying it for its age.  Don't be! <br /> <br />The story, which everyone knows by now, centers around two bored aristocrats, the Marquise de Merteuil (Close) and the Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) who take pleasure in meddling in people's love lives and corrupting them.  The point of the story is that the Vicomte finally falls in love with one of his conquests, Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Close, who is in love with him, struggles to keep him from being with Madame de Tourvel. <br /> <br />An overdone love story?  Not at all.  The complexity of the plot, the power of the acting, and the beauty of the set and costumes provide for a rich, captivating film.  Originally I thought Malkovich was a miscast -- I thought he contrived his role too much -- but eventually I changed my mind, and appreciate his dynamic more now.  Close plays a fantastic Marquise.  Her talent shines throughout the entire film.  She truly makes the film excellent.  The fact that she did not win the Oscar does not matter -- this role was made for her, and she for the role.  There should have been two Oscars awarded for Best Actress that year.  Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman interpret their roles well, and Swoosie Kurtz plays a fitting Madame de Volanges.  I was amused by the fact that Kurtz also did 'Cruel Intentions,' 10 years later. <br /> <br />The plot of the film was well done, well interpreted.  I was mildly disappointed that the film skips over the Marquise's experience with Prvan, a corrupting mirror of Valmont whom she conquers and then brags about quite explicitly in a letter.  That could have been included.   The costumes and set are flawless -- the three Oscars that the film won for these categories were well deserved. <br /> <br />All in all, a deserving film.  Worth buying and watching twice, at least.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|the formation of Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl stated that he understood the pain and the ardor of the old Nirvana fans, such that when they said \\"Well, this isn't as good as Nirvana.\\" Dave would say \\"No S#1t.\\" <br /> <br />The fans and Dave were wrong.   <br /> <br />\\"The Colour and the Shape\\", named after a bowling pin picked up in a Netherlands second-hand store, is better than anything ever produced by Nirvana.  It has far more power, more beauty, more sonic impact than In Utero or even the breakthrough Nevermind.  David's pain, heartbreak, and (eventually) hopefulness come out in many different ways - from the pummeling assault of \\"Hey, Johnny Park!\\" and \\"Monkey Wrench\\" to the weirdness of \\"Doll\\" to the Jazz stylings of \\"See You\\" to the beautiful renderings \\"February Stars\\" and \\"Walking After You\\", and the amazing \\"Everlong\\".  The album is a glittering gem inside a wasteland of vapid grunge wannabe posturing in the '90s, and as such, is an essential part of anyone's hard rock album collection.
B00005MP58|5.0|This was the best movie I have ever saw.  I love the romance and the costumes.  After I read the book, I saw the movie on T.V.  When i found out that I was going to miss the very end, I went out and bought it. I have watch this movie over and over again.  I never grow tired of this movie.  I recommend getting this movie if you like historical romances.
B00005NGAL|1.0|This is a bad acid trip flashback nightmare.  I honestly rented this movie with very high hopes. I live in a small redneck town, on a dead end street, with a video store on the corner..the ONLY video store in town.  So it takes some GUTS for a male to rent Cats. Thank God I only paid a lousy dollar fifty instead of fifty smackers on a ticket for the actual show.  This is the sort of thing that makes countless husbands everywhere say things like, \\"A Broadway show...do we have to go?\\" and it also makes Broadway look VERY VERY cheezy to the passerby.  I ignored all warnings and tried to stomach this video anyway..  COMPLETE RUBBISH!!!  T.S. Elliot's poems were fine on their own..But set to music and stretched out for an hour and a half?  Not good man, not good.  I think I am going to have to listen to only the ambience of the pipes in my wall for a WEEK to recover from this accident.. <br />HEED THE WARNINGS... or this might cost you a dollar fifty..possibly more.  The end?
0790729369|5.0|What a beautiful movie!! Both Clint and Meryl are superb in it!! I love it to bits! This is about Francesca, and Italian housewife who lives a kind of boring life with husband and children until she meets a photographer, played by Clint. I'm so impressed with them both. They get to spend 4 days together while her husband and kids are away. What unfolds is amazing. I was crying a lot during it!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I enjoyed the shows a lot, but I certainly didn't expect \\"Firefly\\" to be real science fiction.  It reminded me of some of the humorous episodes of Star Trek.  We certainly didn't demand that Star Trek be excellent, just that it be entertaining.  \\"Earth II\\" has been the only sci-fi television show that I've seen that really explored possibilities in a mostly intelligent fashion.   <br /> <br />Speaking of which, I wish there WERE some really GOOD sci-fi TV shows... if anyone can recommend such, I would be grateful!
B000068IEU|1.0|OK, after all the hype about this movie I decided to rent it to see what it was like - believe it or not, I waited for a long time for it to come out on dvd. Well it finally came to NZ. I'd been reading some great reviews about it on Amazon. \\"This one is the scariest I've ever seen.......you'll love this movie if you've seen this and this movie\\" and so on..... Well, this is not a gore movie - it's a BORE movie!! And the music.... it doesn't fit in at all. Must have been made with very little money. Wes Craven who has done some great movies - this one looks like a student made it! At the back of the dvd cover they even compare it with Texas Chainsaw Massacre!! I just couldn't believe it. Now, TCM is a scary movie so if you want a real good scare, watch that one instead. Everyone should throw this one in the garbage bin! This is bad acting, bad directing - bad everything. I rented it - thank God!
B0006A9FMI|2.0|After seeing the truly aweful Ghost in the Shell series, I was really jazzed for the new movie. It was a complete disapointment! Boring enough for me to fall asleep. The subtitles, even though I know ther will be a english dub eventually, really took away from a weak story. The anime was good but I'm not a fan of combining CG. \\"Couldn't have been a better sequel?\\", COME ON!! What a waste, I'm saddened  that it ruined the first one, which was/is a classic. Don't waste the rental.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Well what can I say about this DVD that does not involve a lot of four letter words and a ban from writing another review on Amazon. <br />The first movie was certainly a landmark in animation.  Even now as the movie eneters into its tenth anniversary it still remains as impactive and as entertaining as the first day I watched it. <br />  Then, there is the new series.  When I saw it advertised I was a little sceptical that it would be able to compete with its predecessor, but thankfully I was proven wrong.  The series has the same action, incredible sound track and imaginative story lines to keep even the most die hard fan entertained. <br />  Now we come to the second movie and this unfortunate DVD.  When I first heard that they had made a sequal I quickly searched the net for adverts and any information I could find just to get a look.  When I finally found the original Japanesse movie trailer I thought it looked amazing and I could not wait to see it.  The animation was revolutionary and the action seemed in tempo with its predecessor and when I finally saw it for sale on Amazon I did not hesitate to place my order. My enthusiasm, however, quickly dried up when I watched the DVD. <br />  Its funny to think that the brains at Dreamworks thought it would be a 'good' idea to release the movie with limited subtitles and no dub for a primarily English speaking audience.  After watching the movie for the second time it still remains difficult for me to comment upon the plot or the characters because unlike the residents of Japan, with their tiny trees and sparkling whale free oceans, I cannot speak a single solitary word of Japanesse.  As you watch the movie you quickly grasp the idea that these subtitles are meant for a deaf audience as noises in the movie are described and you are informed that a loud bang has occurred or a gun has been fired.  This kind of reminded me of the old Batman and Robin TV series and I kept expecting to see the words 'bam' and 'ka pow' to appear on the screen but thankfully this did not happened.  <br />  Its annoying to think this is the only version of the movie we can expect to see.  Its my opinion that after this tragedy Dreamworks should not be allowed to touch another anime and that it should be left to the professionals like Manga, Pioneer, Geneon and Bandai to name but a few.  The movie itself is fine, the three stars in my score are for the animation and the action, and the two blank spaces in the score are for the weak effort on the part of Dreamworks.  Buy this movie for its imagination and action but do not expect perfection. <br />
B0002NRRAG|4.0|The frequent comparison of Madeleine Peyroux's to Billie Holiday is unfair to both. First, because her talent extends beyond superficial mimicry, and second, because Peyroux's singing is comparable to so many other singers. As described below, I hear the sounds of Edith Piaf, Lena Horne, Peggy Lee, and Dinah Shore, and, to a lesser extent, Lauren Bacall and the elongated notes of k.d. lang. Peyroux shares some tonal similarities with Holiday, along with her famous high-low note bend. But Peyroux can't (and won't) rely on her Holiday-inspired sounds too much, or else she'd become an \\"act.\\" Even David Sedaris does a great \\"Billy Holiday\\"--it's right on the money--but no one hails him as the next Lady Day.  (Holiday's bent note is not what makes her arguably the greatest jazz singer ever: She had unique, perfect phrasing, and a potent tonality that mixes vulnerability, hurt, perseverance, and sexuality. Sometimes we can hear her entire life's progression in just a few phrases.)<br />Peyroux is not strictly a \\"jazz singer\\" anyway, she blends in pop and the sound of the French troubadors.<br /><br />\\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" (Leonard Cohen) is a great opener. She gives it a Django Reinhardt treatment, with an unusual jazz rhythm and raggedy instrumentals. (Peyroux has excellent accompaniment throughout the CD.) She swings the song with a slight teasing quality, but doesn't forget the melancholy. Peyroux's soft, slippery voice (with her low nasally tones and vocal drop-offs) are effective, but her strength is playing her cool voice off the jangly background.  Towards the end, however, the effects are a bit forced.  A muted trumpet might have improved `Dance Me'; still, it's one of her strongest performances. The arrangement recalls \\"To Have and Have Not, \\" with Lauren Bacall accompanying Hoagy Carmichael's piano.<br /><br />Peyroux's sole composition, \\"Don't Wait Too Long,\\" is also excellent.  The lyrics urge people to take chances--good advice for Peyroux herself.  She's at her best when going for her own sound.  Peyroux is more playful and looser on this track.  I love how she pronounces \\"learn\\" as \\"loin,\\" a la John Fogarty. The gritty keyboards and sweet guitar solo raise this number above many of her contemporaries' efforts. \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" offers a roots sound, recorded like it's coming out of a 1930's Zenith. Still, there's a little too much Holiday.  We need more sass and less sanctimony, more brass and less whining.  At the break, the musicians introduce a bright piano solo that interplays with the organ.  However, this is played too much as a \\"novelty\\" number; you don't feel the song so much as notice it. That's one area where Peyrouz could grow; another is her disengagement from the lyrics. Speaking of which, what were she and her producers thinking on Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You're Gone?\\"  Sure, she's got the phrasing of Armstrong, and the clear sound and tones of Joni Mitchell and Dinah Shore, but nothing about the singing captures the lyrics.  It's modernized and sanitized.  The happy \\"just smile cause I'll be fine\\" attitude is unconvincing; it all sounds like a coffee ad.<br /><br />On \\"Between the Bars,\\" Peyroux sings some great Marilyn Monroe head tones, with the orchestration and pace of later-day k.d. lang.  Happily, this sometimes ponderously slow number is a short one.  The next song is forgettable.  It's like a mix of all her other songs, homogenized beyond recognition, and then--the coup de grace--a Billie Holiday bend.<br /><br />\\"Lonesome Road\\" benefits from a Hawaiian guitar and organ, but this potentially excellent vehicle is derailed by Peyroux's languorous style--she respects the song too much.  If she's not going to sing it loud, then she at least needs to hold more tension in her voice.  Although she acquits herself well here, she doesn't take the chances that the musicians do. \\"Deux Amours\\" (hey, quelle accent!) needs more guitar and banjo, but her voice is beautiful and lulling, and she has an Edith Piaf trill.  \\"Weary Blues\\" recalls \\"Summertime\\" and Lena Horne. Once again, Peyroux's untroubled delivery doesn't match the heartbreak of the lyrics. In contrast, her approach fits the music on \\"I'll Look Around,\\" and makes it one of her best songs.<br /><br />Summary<br />Peyroux is best when her singing matches the musical and lyrical tone, when she doesn't always sing it \\"straight,\\" and when she lets the musicians complement her. She tends to play it safe.  For example, track 12 could have been transformed into a great campy song (especially with those ding-dong background chimes and syrupy 30's arrangement); instead, it's once again a showcase for her voice.  If she can be less precious and more giving (e.g., she needs more abandon against the gospel background of track 11), and if she doesn't rely quite as much on her signature insouciance, Madeleine Peyroux could be one of the most talented jazz/pop singers around.rill.  \\"Weary Blues\\" recalls \\"Summertime\\" and Lena Horne.

B0006399FS|5.0|I would agree with the reviewer who said \\"this is grandiose music from grandiose men\\". My wife who wasn't a U2 fan said, on hearing the album, \\"it just seems to flow out of them\\" which I would agree with but the music has also been honed to perfection. Bono is on record as saying that when you lead such blessed lives you have a responsibility not to relaease crap. <br /> <br />U2 are unusual in that the songs and music have a timeless quality that never sounds dated despite 25 years on the road. Witness their appearance on Friday Night with Johnathan Ross where the last song they played was their first single \\"I will follow\\" which they played with as much passion as if it was the latest release. This is a band very comfortable in their own skin. <br /> <br />The lyrics are great, personal, emotional and spiritual. Some beautifully evocative stuff \\"Neon heart, dayglo eyes, city lit by fire flies\\". The music backs it up. The edge achieves more with those beautifully subtle and creative hooks than a thousand technically gifted gutarists. This is the simplicity that John Frusciante, a technically guifted player player, strives for. <br />Adam and Larry have matured into a powerful drum/ bass combination. <br /> <br />Favourite tracks \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Man and a Woman\\", \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Yaweh\\". Not as keen on the early releases but they contribute to a varied and interesting album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0553275976|3.0|The subject of The Bonfire of the Vanities is Tom Wolfe's creative and perfectly illustrative descriptive writing.  For example, the author refers, in one scene, to a character wearing a \\"'F--k You' necktie.\\"  The main enjoyment in crawling through this 700-page beast, is awaiting each next colorfully described scene.<br /><br />The marketing for this novel, and the aura that surrounds it, bills Bonfire as capturing the 80s.  There were some period elements such as the media-circus of hot lawsuits.  It also had scenes, such as the McCoy's offices for bond-trading, that felt 80s.  But you can more efficiently immerse into that period by watching Network and Wall Street.  Plus, the scenes with aristocrat McCoy and hotshot Assistant D.A. Kramer, were written in a style that reminded me of film from the 50s.<br /><br />The transformation of Sherman McCoy is not well-developed.  When it arrives it comes as a shock.<br /><br />There is engaging drama and interesting plot, but nothing occurs of great significance.  Only at one point, when a character describes an Edgar Allen Poe poem, does the novel rise above the milieu of its multiple intersecting plotlines.<br /><br />The book is a large investment of your time.  Do great descriptions and fun plots make it worth it?  I think so, but only minimally so.

0385510438|4.0|I have just finished reading The Last Juror, and while I enjoyed the book VERY much, I must warn future readers that this book is NOT a suspense thriller!  I don't know how it got categorized as such!  It is however a very good story.  Having read A Painted House, which was a completely new genre for Grisham, I would compare Juror more to it than to his more suspenseful novels like Pelican Brief or The Chamber.  NOT suspenseful... but still a great read!
0316168815|4.0|I loved this book! It was great, I couldn't stop reading it. I loved how the author added Susies perspective of everything from heaven. It was like you could get a picture of what it might be like when we die. I think that everyone could relate to Susie's character in some aspect. She is a normal teenager going through that normal things and that is why we can relate in some way. When she died I, like most others, felt sorry for her she wasn't able to grow up and she wasn't able to express her love for Ray. The great thing though is that she was so calm about everything she had confidence in her family. That is what I loved about this book, while she was calm you wanted to cry. The one thing I did not like about this book is the ending. I think the author got a little to carried away. Why didn't Susie tell who the murder is? I know she loved Ray, but why didn't she even tell him who did it? I recomend this book to everyone. It was a great book.
6301763041|5.0|I just want to say that this movie is a must for Johnny Depp fans. It wsa actually the 1st in my collection.Wade \\"Cry- Baby\\" Walker, is an awesome guy. I feel in love with Johnny's character the moment he touched the screen. A little known fact is that JD actually took the rebel role because a lot of people said that his character Tom Hanson (21 Jumpstreet) was a rebel, when in reality it wasn't. This movie was that start of the heart throb, Johnny Depp of today. Once you see this movie, you will fall in love with it.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I had been seeing the previews for this movie over and over again and I thought it looked hilarious.  According to the previews I thought it was going to be another movie about a nerd who is picked on and falls in love with the nice popular girl and the school likes him at the end of the movie.  But this wasn't another movie like that.  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is a quirky movie about a nerd who is a jerk yet has a soft spot.  The humor is really random, which brings up memories from movies like \\"Airplane\\" and \\"Monty Python and the search for the holy grail\\".  Napoleon's Uncle Rico is probably one of my favorite characters for he brings an extra sense of quirkiness and fun to the movie.  When Pedro runs for president you pull for him and you decide you want to hate Summer, and I died laughing when Napoleon did that dance for Pedro's campaign.  On the surface this movie looks like a stupid, pointless movie but it is a hilarious movie and you won't be sorry that you spent time watching it.
B0006399FS|5.0|I borrowed this CD from my brother on Christmas Day. It is now Jan 7th and the CD has yet to leave my player. I'm with a lot of people in thinking that 'All You Can't Leave Behind' was, for the large part, a disappointment besides a couple songs. And I felt that 'Zooropa' was a decent album, but not great. This album is one of their absolute best, at the very least their best since 'Actung, Baby'. Superb lyrics meld with spectacular music. Buy it.
B00003CXS4|5.0|My cheek hurt - from laughing. This movie, filled to the rim with the funniest bunch of braindead crooks is not to be missed. Guy Ritchie pulls on every cliche but in such a perfect way that you just can't help yourself, you laugh out loud and there's no end in sight. Great characters, wonderful storyline, superb acting. You've just got to have it!!!
B00000IPAX|1.0|If you call this punk or anyother band like this aka: New found glory, Good who the _ every, AFI, etc then you are not punk! This is not punk in anyway. Oh look at me I can play three cords and have tats so I gusse that makes me punk! If you want to lission to some real punk then pick up some any punk anytime before 90's. So that makes 80's and 70's punk is real this new stuff is not. Don't hate because I just tell you how it is.

B000000W5N|5.0|In my opinion, which may be the same of many other Stones' addicts, this is the best album these guys ever recorded, even better than Exile on Main Street. <br /> <br />The reasons:  <br /> <br />Mick Taylor was at the top of his production as an artist, he was young and innocent and wanted to impress Mick and Keith, his new bosses in the group. He did not know Mr. Richards would become so full of envy. His performance in \\"Sway\\" and \\"Can't you hear me knocking?\\" is astounding, trully a brilliant mixture of blues moaning riffs and hard rock and roll harmonies. <br /> <br />Besides you get two sad ballads with \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"I got the blues\\", an outerspace hymn with \\"Moonlight mile\\", a psychotic confession with \\"Sister Morphine\\" and a super sidewalk tune with \\"You gotta move\\". Really Sticky Songs. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />

B0002UXBD6|5.0|I have literally been listening to Greenday all of my life (being born in 1986 I grew up around grunge and punk rock).  <br />Next to the Dookie album, I believe this album deserves to be number one for a long time. It's rocking political veiws are new, BUT still have the same flavor they did in the early 90's. Which is how they are presenting this new genre of \\"political punk.\\" It's now reaching America's youth on a different level and in a more subliminal way . Especially teenagers my age.  <br /> <br />I have seen many interviews and even the making of the American Idiot CD on tv, and the Band is still very real and true to their roots. Which is very important when trying something new.  <br /> <br />I for one cannot wait to see what comes of their potential operetta that they keep getting slammed for trying to do. It's new and just a little different, but like I said it never hurt anyone to try.  <br />With the great success this band has had over the past 15 years, I believe that this is JUST the beginning of a new Greenday Era.
B0002OERI0|4.0|American Idiot is a different sounding Green Day. But it is still good. My favorite song on here is of course the still punkish title track American Idiot. And Boulevard Of Broken Dreams has grown on me as I am sure Holiday will too. The epic 9 minute songs are surprising good too. I prefer the 9 minute song Jesus Of Surburbia over the other 9 minute song Homecoming. St. Jimmy and She's A Rebel still sound punk, which is a great thing. Are We The Waiting is another great ballad which is destined to be a hit. Give Me Novacaine grew on me after a few listens to it. Extraordinary Girl and Letterbomb have not yet proven themselves to me to be great songs. Wake Me Up when September Ends is another great ballad. Whatsername is growing on me too.<br /><br />I think everyone should buy this cd, whether you're a Green Day fan or not. Let it grow on you with each listen, like it does more and more every time I listen to it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|please dont listen to them people what give this less than 5 star's, cos theyre not very clever and they isn't able to recugnize a great film if it bite's them in their arse. and they usually think theyre ee cummings too, that or they dont no how to punctuate. Anyway, this film manages to say so very much by doing so very little, which is a very difficult thing to do and is only to be found with the most talented artists. As impressive as The Virgin Suicides was, this is better by a very great margin. To answer one of the punctuation-free commentators who has already dismissed this film, the reason that many people are not able to precisely articulate their feelings about this film is because it gets to a very deep level of human feeling, which is hard to express for even the most literate of people. <br /> <br />The greatness of the film is boosted by the fact that it shows how great American cinema can be when it is not pandering to the mass market, the lowest common denominator or whatever else holds all the dollars. One single overture to the Big Dumb American Film and Lost in Translation would have been sunk. However, Coppola brilliantly steers it away from the stupid, obvious, spell-it-all-out-for-you syndrome and leaves us to use our imaginations. Lost in Translation is simply one of the finest films ever made, and the critical mauling it gets here from certain people tells me how far ahead it is of mainstream comprehension. <br /> <br />i mean, it was well boring, nothing happen's and it's gay. i reckomend troy insted.
B00005MP58|5.0|If you loved reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, you will love this movie!  The character development, the music, the acting... ALL SUPERB because it stays true to the book.  I can watch this movie over and over and over again... in fact I think I'll watch it right now! <br /> <br />Also, if you like the movie, get the soundtrack!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Having been a Beatles fanatic since 1964, I felt that the Tribute Concert for George Harrison was perfect and as it should have been. To have a collective of such friends and musicians pay their final tribute to one of the truly greatest guitarists and songwriters was awe inspiring. Eric Clapton is number one in my book and his renditions of George's songs were absolutely stunning, soulful and full of love. Ringo's \\"Photographs\\" brought tears to my eyes as Ringo unfolded his emotions through the very words of the song. Macca did a great rendition of Something on the ukelele and continues to prove his masterful talent. George's Wilbury buddie, Jeff added another dimension to this already powerful group of super musicians. The percussionist who plays with Eric (sorry about the senior moment, can't remember his name just now) is always fresh and powerful. Tom Petty is forever Tom Petty and his playing and singing was especially wonderful. Last but certainly not least, is Dhani Harrison himself. This wonderful young man reminds us so much of his father at that age and it is a passage in time which will never be forgotten. His shear bravado and quite presence needed nothing more than his superb guitar. I know there are many others such as Billy Preston, Ravi Shankar and without them somehow the concert would not had been complete. I found myself smiling as the tears flowed down my face through the entire concert. A grand send off for one of our best beloved and talented musicians. A spirtual man who went to see \\"His Sweet Lord.\\" Thank you to the beautiful Olivia, your presence graced the concert and couldn't have been as successful without you. Thank you for sharing your man with the rest of the world. God Bless you all.  <br />Love and Light, <br />Chantal Tenace
B00005LIN0|4.0|Taking into account that Gershwin composed this work when apartheid prevailed in the country (and right before his death), one can easily admit that it was a great boldness (maybe madness) at that time.  <br /> <br />It is in many ways similar to verismo opera. Form the overture on; one predicts that it is on an impossible love. <br /> <br />My first encounter with this opera was due to the love duet \\"Bess you is my woman now\\" expressing fidelity, trust and sacrifice in an unprecedented way. That's why no other duet could be compared to this one (even the most passionate ones of my beloved Puccini).  <br /> <br /> <br />The most underestimated scene of the opera in general is \\"I loves you Porgy\\" in which Bess begs Porgy not to let to her cruel lover. (Only a fool could be impartial to this request!). This aria was perfectly sung by Cyntia Haymon's touching voice. (But take my advice and listen to Sarah Vaughan's interpretation).  <br /> <br />The ending depends on ones expectations. Would Porgy ever see Bess again? In my opinion, Porgy would keep searching Bess desperately.  <br /> <br />In general, it's a great opportunity to watch this prominent cast. Spirituals are very impressive.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UA0|5.0|Well Happy Birthday Syd Barrett(vocalist on this album). He deserves a good day for once don't you think.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Those of you who \\"love\\" the Song Remains the Same are more than likely the same people who were giggling and smoking reefer inn the back row when the film was actually being played in theaters every weekend at the \\"Midnight Movies\\".  The Song Remains the Same is NOT the \\"definitive\\" Led Zeppelin set, as all of the surviving members of the band will quickly tell you.  The weird \\"fantasy scenes\\", the lack of intensity, and the overall ARROGANCE of the Song Remains the Same is why Jimmy Page decided to break these concert ditties out of the vault for all to see (um, of course for $29.99!).    The fact that Jimmy Page doesn't endorse the audio recording of The Song Remains the Same speaks volumes, and anybody who has heard \\"How The West Was Won\\" will easily attest to the fact that Led Zep was at their peak in those magical years between 1969 and 1972.  Check out the vintage footage in this new Led Zeppelin DVD, and you will see what I mean.    The concert footage from 1979 is very significant to me, because this is an era where we have heard no live recordings, except of course for the coursing underground of bootleg tapes.  Robert Plant was not the vocal acrobat he was in the early years, but he handles it quite nicely.  The band was tight, and they were trying to tone down the 20 minute long drum solos and the extended \\"space\\" of the Dazed and Confused violin solo.  This is classic Zep trying to reqain their form, and the concert footage from 1979 on Disc 2 is absolutely stunning.    I could go on-and-on about the technical details of this fine DVD set, but since that has already been done over 480 times, let me focus on this; if you think you know what \\"good music\\" is, then you might reconsider what is \\"good\\" after viewing this.  The sad fact is that almost all of the popular music of today lacks the soul, attitude, and raw power of Led Zeppelin.  Korn, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and all of the other modern \\"heavy rock\\" bands succeed in pummeling the listeners ear with pounding noise and gruffly yelled vocals, and my friends , this is not a good thing.  The simple fact is that the riff from \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" was the angry soundtrack to a whole generation of teenage boys, and this was done with MUSIC!  Zeppelin didn't have to resort to cheesy gimmicks like use of the \\"f-word\\", smashing their instruments on stage, cutting thier bodies before a live audience, yelling incoherantly as if they were possessed by the spirit of homosexuality (\\"aw man\\", cries the ever lovin' singer of Limp Bizkit; [...] No, Led Zeppeling created an aura of sound that both assaulted and delighted the senses.  From the incredibly beautiful love of \\"Thank You\\", to the raw shimmering lust of \\"Black Dog\\", down through the deep awareness of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", the melancholy despair of \\"When The Levee Break\\".....I could go on-and-on.  Led Zeppelin was the greatest BAND of all time, four masters at what they individually did, and the fact is...NOTHING on the radio or in the \\"underground\\" today even comes close to the glory of Zeppelin.    If you want to visually comprehend why this band was the best rock 'n' roll group ever, just slip Disc 1 in, lay back, light up a smoke....and prepare to be blown away!    Thanks
B00005JMAH|5.0|*ahem* That was my Sesame Street Count impression. Anyways... my point is, here is a series that totally proves sequel haters wrong. Movie number 3, and still going strong! Let's hope the filmmakers can keep it up and don't change the cast along the way. After all, at this point it really would be silly. Fox and the WB use 30 year olds to play teens all the time. But I digress, on with the synopsis!<br /><br />In \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" we rejoin Harry Potter, boy-wizard prodigy, in his 13th year of miserable life with the Dursleys, his less than loving relatives. Harry's situation has improved somewhat. He no longer lives in that cupboard under the stairs for example, though he still is expected to wait, hand and foot, on his wretched family. A little fear has made them manageable however, but that's not the case with Aunt Marge, who stops in one day for dinner. Unaware of Harry's magical powers, Marge mouths off one time too many about his parents during dinner, and Harry's magic gets the better of him. Starting with a forefinger in mid-wag, the already bloated old Marge begins to inflate. Soon, she is filled with so much magic gas that she begins to float out of the house and clear out of sight! Of course, Harry can't stick around after that. Sitting on a curb wondering what to do next, and puzzled by something watching him from the bushes across the street, the mysterious Knight Bus arrives just in time. \\"Transportation for the stranded witch or wizard,\\" as it is described, and a welcome sight it is. After one wild ride through London, Harry finds himself at \\"The Leaky Cauldron\\" and face to face with the Minister of Magic, who welcomes him with a friendly greeting, a room for the night, a reunion with Hedwig the owl, and new school books for the coming year. Harry also receives an accidental warning about an escaped murderer; a sinister looking man named Sirius Black.<br /><br />After a good night's sleep, Harry is thrilled to see his best friends again, noble misfit Ron Weasley and family, and increasingly lovely know-it-all Hermione Granger. The extended family is in good spirits for the new school year, though Mr. Weasley's mind is not completely at ease. Ever the great father figure for orphaned Harry, Mr. Weasley takes the boy aside to give him a much more informative warning about the Azkaban prison escapee, Sirius Black, and why Harry should be particularly wary of him. It seems that Black is believed to have been Lord Voldemort's right-hand man and was imprisoned for the murder of one Peter Pettigrew, a close friend of Harry's parents. Now that Black is out of prison, everyone suspects that Harry Potter is the first one he will come for, since it was he who thwarted Lord Voldemort's plans time and time again. With that bit of information weighing on his mind, Harry and his schoolmates board the train to Hogwarts, selecting a compartment already occupied by a sleeping Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. There are mysterious doings on the Hogwarts Express, however, as we discover when Harry has his first encounter with the dark cloaked, faceless, floating figure of a Dementor. As the creature attempts to suck out Harry's soul in a most unpleasant display, the seemingly dead to the world Professor Lupin springs into action! With wand extended, Lupin casts a spell to blast the creature from sight. From Lupin, we learn that the Dementors, the guards of Azkaban prison, are on a nonstop search for their escaped prisoner. We also come to find that the creatures are overrunning the grounds of Hogwarts as well. Upon their first night back at school, all the students are given warning from Headmaster Dumbledore of the looming danger. Dumbledore also introduces Professor Lupin, and the announcement is made that Rubeus Hagrid has been added to the faculty as teacher of a class on the care of magical beasts.<br /><br />As the days and weeks pass, the customary Hogwarts balance of fble misfit Ron Weasley and family, and increasingly lovely know-it-all Hermione Granger.

Dumbledore also introduces Professor Lupin, and the announcement is made that Rubeus Hagrid has been added to the faculty as teacher of a class on the care of magical beasts.     As the days and weeks pass, the customary Hogwarts balance of fascinating classes andstrange and mysterious incidents takes place. Professor Trelawney teaches about crystal balls, tea leaf reading, and other forms of divination. The class frustrates Hermione, as she can't get the knack, and holds bad omens for Harry when an unlucky black dog called \\"the Grim\\" is spotted in his tea. Hagrid's class seems to be going well as he introduces the students to a half eagle, half horse creature called a hippogriff, but when Draco Malfoy becomes jealous of Harry's high-flying ride on the creature's back, he fakes an injury and gets the gentle beast marked for death. The most interesting and mysterious class, however, must be Professor Lupin's \\"Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\" The Professor begins by introducing the students to a mysterious, fear personifying creature called a boggart. He teaches them to alter the creature to a less frightening form with a \\"ridiculous\\" spell, which works quite well for a while, but when Harry's turn comes up, Lupin jumps in to defend the boy wizard. Before Lupin's eyes, the Boggart changes shape from that of a Dementor, to an image of the full moon! In the days that follow, there are field trips, holidays, Quidditch games, budding romance, run-ins with Snape and Malfoy, heart to hearts between Harry Potter and the endearing Professor Lupin, and secrets revealed about Peter Pettigrew and the looming Sirius Black, the latter due in no small part to a Marauder's Map and an invisibility cloak. But, as the plot thickens, dangers increase, and it's bound to only get more complicated before the reality of the circumstances is finally revealed!    Well, that's the basic story, without revealing too much. Don't be too surprised to also see a werewolf here and there, and an amazing little gadget called a time turner. Another fantastic Harry Potter movie, in my humble opinion. Though, I admit to only being a Harry Potter MOVIE fanatic. I have no experience with the books. I realize the fans of the books had mixed feelings about this one,but as a fan of the movies, I think this MIGHT be my favorite. It's a tough thing to say. The first film had a great, innocent quality, and definitely a much simpler plot. Everything was new and surprising, as is always the way with the first film in a series. The second was a bit more advanced, a bit creepier, a bit more complicated and mysterious. This third film followed that same course: darker, more grown-up than the first two, much more complicated and much more mysterious. The characters are growing up, and the films display this well without overdoing it. Relationships are growing beautifully, not just between the three main heroes, but between everyone. I get a really warm feeling from seeing the love Ron's family shows Harry, and the compassion with which Lupin trains and comforts the young wizard. The questions of this film were very intriguing, and it was amazing to see everything unfold. While I hope not every future Potter film will be this dark, I still say Director Alfonso Cuaron took the helm masterfully. The darkness is balanced with moments of humor and beauty, the effects are stunning, and the scenery is breathtaking. John Williams' music is always incomparable, and the casting of the entire Harry Potter series continues to be flawless. Fans of the books might have different opinions, but I can't imagine how any of the roles could be played better. Michael Gambon also did an excellent job of filling the late, great Richard Harris's shoes in the role of Albus Dumbledore.    On an added note(and beware of spoilers here), I have a huge personal interest in werewolves in general, and the werewolves of the Harry Potter world are something I've eagerly anticipated seeing since they were mentioned in the first film. Even though they were suggested as being very dangerous creatures, my hope was that they would not necessarily be evil or mindless killers. At the very least, I hoped that some would be good and some would be evil. Well, it didn't work out that way. They took the old route of a tormented werewolf character who is kind and remorseful by day, and a bloodthirsty monster during a full moon. I can live with that. I thought David Thewlis was excellent as the sympathetic Professor Remus Lupin. All in all, I loved the character. He was thoughtful, powerful, caring, and wise. What I didn't love was the creature he became, the werewolf. It was a tall, skinny, gray-skinned, short-haired, disgusting looking, computer-generated thing. One of the most disappointing werewolf designs I've ever seen. There was not a wolf quality about it. Frankly, I much preferred the look of Sirius Black's black dog form, and it looked much more like a proper werewolf than the transformed Lupin. Don't get me wrong, the creature looked scary and dangerous, but not at all werewolf-like. Ah, well, sickly Asthma-hound Chihuahuas aside, this film is excellent. One serious flaw in an otherwise AWESOME movie. For the human side alone, it's even a great werewolf film. Watch it. Enjoy it. I'm going to cherish this film for years to come, because it's an awesome ride! And, I'm going to eagerly await more installments in the Harry Potter series! And...I'm going to TRY to get around to reading the books too!    \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\\" and the original film, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" are all available on DVD and VHS. The DVD extras are numerous, if not outstanding, and the films themselves all make wonderful additions to any home video collection. For more fantastic fantasy in the same line as Harry Potter, check out Return to Oz (Fairuza Balk), The Worst Witch (Fairuza Balk/Tim Curry), The Wizard of Oz (Judy Garland), A Series of Unfortunate Events (Jim Carrey), Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins, The Witches (Angelica Huston), The NeverEnding Story, Labyrinth, Dragonslayer, Willow, the Ewok Adventures, Legend, the Star Wars Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Peter Pan (Jason Isaacs), and Hocus Pocus (Bette Midler). Happy viewing! See ya next time!
0140187537|4.0|Although the title portends a setting of bleak winter, the main plot activities take place in the heat of summer.  The winter of discontent resides metaphorically, in the soul of the protagonist.  Steinbeck is in great form here, and his character development is superb, most especially with the two women in the novel, who are finely drawn, studied, mysterious, fascinating.  The last couple of pages, while inevitable I suppose, were sort of a let-down, and the children in the novel beg a deeper exploration.  But these are smallish concerns.  This novel is a fine one, open & easily accessible if one is looking for a quick read, yet also filled with philosophy, symbolism, & enough \\"opaqueness\\" to withstand deep inquiries & graduate-level studies.
B00005JLRT|4.0|This installment played for me much better on the small screen where the action sequences (which are a little exaggerated and maybe a tad gratuitous) don't overshadow and undercut the relationships and storyline for which I've always felt TNG excelled.<br /><br />Some have conerns about the storyline.  I thought it was good enough to hold up the characters and I loved Tom Hardy as the evil Praetor Shinzon.  He was a physically and mentally impressive and a capable \\"nemesis\\" to our beloved Captain Picard.<br /><br />Hardy takes away valuable screen time from some of our usual TNG characters, and the performances of Dr. Crusher and even Deanna seem perfunctory at best.  I grew weary of Deanna's uncharacteristically sad, tear-stained face.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great TNG romp through the evil underbelly of the unknown and a showcase for good versus evil as well as Captail Picard and Data. Definitely worth seeing and a worthy film for your collection.

078681859X|5.0|Bartimaeus is a wonderful addition to my list of favorite literary characters.  In the tradition of Robin Williams' genie in Alladin, Bartimaeus' wit and magic permeate this story and make it more fun, especially when things get a bit dark with the character of Nathaniel.  Stroud has also created an incredibly realistic fantasy London, and it's this plausibility that makes the reader care (even when you may not like Nathaniel very much).  I can't wait to read the next two.
0671027344|4.0|I first read this book the summer before 9th grade and it helped me understand a lot of things that I did not seem to understand before. This book puts into words what most of our adolscents have felt before. You can feel the character developing as you read the book and maturing. You also feel like you have known the character for a long time. The way Charlie opens up to us in the book is incredible. All his fears and worries are put into letters for us to comprehend.
0156012197|5.0|This story is beautiful because it can be both cherished by a child and an adult, although most adults believe that they receive more out the story than a child. This is not true a child will see it one way while an adult will see it another. It is written in a style to where it can be seen in whatever direction one might want to interpret it, and even those who want to take it literally can as well and still find it a good story. <br />Overall it is an easy read maybe for an adult can read it within a day, its elegant and one won't find themsleves lost on what is being said. If one wants to find the deeper meaning must realize each character encounter is important, take a moment and relate it and how you may want to see them thats up to you. <br />I recommend this book.
B00002EPMF|4.0|I have to admit, this album is a bit disappointing, but it was pretty much bound to be, from my perspective.  For all intents and purposes, 'The Fragile Art of Existence' is the follow up to 'Sound of Perseverance', which is THE GREATEST METAL ALBUM EVER, which naturally makes it a tough act to follow.  It's especially sad that Chuck died before getting to finish any other Control Denied work, since this was an experiment, and he likely would've gotten better with the Control Denied material given more time.  But, this is all we've got, and it is a good album, even if it isn't up to Chuck's high standards.<br /><br />For 'The Fragile Art of Existence' Chuck Schuldiner assembled what is arguably the greatest metal lineup ever.  Schuldiner is my favorite lead guitarist and perhaps my favorite rhythm guitarist as well, and Shannon Hamm is not far behind.  Steve DiGiorgio is probably my favorite bassist other than Sean Malone, and Richard Christy is definitely one of the very best metal drummers ever.  Of course, each of the last 4 Death albums were filled by amazing musicians, so this is to be expected.  However, they don't give their best performances.  Schuldiner's leads aren't as good as most of his latter era work, and Hamm's are not as good as he was on the previous album.  They're generally a bit too formless, not as melodic and grounded as the SoP work. Still, they're very good from an absolute perspective.  Christy's drums are quite a bit more restrained than usual.  I guess this fits the material better, but the drumwork is still less interesting in and of itself.  DiGiorgio is as good as ever, however, and is given a particularly prominent role.  Tim Aymar is the only new guy, and he does a good job.  He's a fairly standard classic metal singer-screecher, and while he's not particularly distinctive, he's more than capable.<br /><br />So, we have a great lineup here, headed by the best metal songwriter ever,but only a 4 star album.  It's got some basic tonal problems which really hurt the album.  The problem is, Chuck sacrificed some of Death's strengths while not gaining much in return.  Though this is a very, very complex album with tons of riffs and tempo changes and whatnot, it's quite a bit more controlled and restrained sounding than your average Death album, lacking either the unrelenting speed of Human or the 80's albums, or the unhinged wildness of 'Sound of Perseverance'.  The production is less intense as well, with a lighter guitar tone and less intense drum sounds.  All this was done, presumably, to fit in with the clean, melodic vocals.  However, the album still doesn't play to the strengths of power/classic metal.  It's a very, very solemn affair, never achieving the sort of epic feeling or grandiosity of good power metal, and isn't really anymore melodic than Death's later material.(Which was plenty melodic for tech-death-thrash, but insufficient for tech-power-thrash like this)  Aymar is largely quite restrained, an operatic vocalist chained by a serious, straight laced tone.  So, this all comes together to say that the album as a whole is fairly lacking in visceral intensity or emotional resonance. It's both technically impressive and intriguing, but it generally doesn't have enough punch or heart. Chuck tried to combine his style with classic metal and came to a compromise that wasn't really satisfactory for either side. That, and the riffs, solos and choruses and all that stuff just aren't as good as they usually are in Death's work. though their relative weakness is doubtless related to the basic stylistic problem of the album.<br /><br />I know I'm attacking this album a lot, but that's mainly because it's problems are so very clear.  It's still a good album, with 2 flat-out great songs, and the rest are certainly nowhere near bad.(though they aren't terribly close to great either.)  'Consumed' is the opener.  It's a brilliant song, perfectly constructed, and with more emotional resonance than any other track on the album.  The main verse riff and chorus are both great, immediately memorable and really quite sad sounding.  The intro and middle break are quite sweet too, and the song has some of the best leadwork on the album.  'Breaking the Broken' is the second track, as well as the second best track.  Best chorus on the album, with some fine shrieking from Aymar.  It's the only chorus on the album that achieves that sort of grandiosity befitting a vocalist of his nature.  Furthermore, it's got some of the very best basswork on the album.  Another great song.  However, I don't have all that much to say about the rest of the album.  There are plenty of interesting riffs, and good leads, but damned if anything on the  rest of the album really reaches out and grabs you.  'Cut Down' kinda does, with it's rather angry chorus, as do parts of 'Believe' but that's about it.  It's interesting music, but on an almost entirely intellectual level.  Not enough melody to be that memorable, and not heavy or punchy enough to rock at optimum efficiency.<br /><br />All that said, I definitely recommend this to any fans of latter-era Death, provided they aren't wholeheartedly opposed to classic metal singing.  It's nowhere near the best thing Chuck did, but it's interesting as a whole, and has some truly brilliant moments.n any other track on the album.

B00000K19E|5.0|I must first admit that when I saw The Matrix for the first time I was unimpressed.  It didn't move me at all.  It wasn't until way after The Matrix Revolutions was released that I took a second look at it.  Maybe that's the hook.  If you didn't like it the first time, watch it again.  I got hooked.  The concept was so original that it blew me away.  I'm still not crazy about the casting of The Matrix execpt for the Neo, Morpheus, Smith and Trinity characters.  Casting for Reloaded and Revolutions is much improved.  The other thing that I'm not impressed with is the soundtrack.  In some places I find it annoying and lackluster.  Usually if I like a movie score enough I'll buy it but there is no danger of that here I'm sorry to say.  Still, you shouldn't let that deter you.<br /><br />Imagine that the world you thought you knew and the life you thought you had, were all lies and make believe.  Imagine artificial intelligence running amok and dominating the world. Imagine being \\"jacked in\\" and living your life amoungst the programs in a giant computer matrix.  Awesome concept.<br /><br />All of the sudden, almost everthing I thought I liked in sci-fi has been challenged.  Star Wars and Star Trek seem silly to me now.  As if I had been watching kiddie sci-fi all this time and now I've been shown sci-fi from an adult point of view.  No disrepect intended and don't get me wrong.  I still like those movies and they too were ground breaking in their day.<br /><br />This movie can be quite complex to follow as there are so many sub-plots and hidden messages throughout.  Some people become so confused between the real world and the matrix world that they give up on the movie and cast it aside.  Hence, many of the negative reviews.  The trick is to keep viewing it until it reveals itself to you bit by bit if necessary.  What is even more surprising is that The Matrix is basically and very loosely the story of Jesus from a sci-fi point of view.  This becomes more apparent as you view The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.  If that shocks you, consider the following:  Neo is \\"the one\\" that has been prophesied to come and save what's left of the human race.  Note Neo's power to resurrect the dead when Trinity dies in \\"Reloaded.\\"  The program called the creator represents God only if very loosely.  Morpheus represents John the Baptist as he is the one that continues to tell people the good news.  A savior is coming.  The Merovingian represents satan and even runs a club called hell in \\"Revolutions.\\"  In the bible Zion is used sometimes to denote the Church of God (Hebrews 12:22), and sometimes the heavenly city (Revelation 14:1). Nebuchadnezzar (the name of Morpheus' ship) was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings.  Trinity (as if I have to explain that) refers to the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost although that is not Carrie Moss' role in this film.  Cypher represents Judas for obvious reasons.  The list goes on and on.  Perhaps these reasons  are part of why everyone appears to be so deeply effected by this movie trilogy.<br /><br />Ground breaking special effects are also part of the equation.  Many of these scenes have never been seen or even thought of before.  There are so many new things to see here.  My review would go on for days if I tried to explain them here.  Don't feel left out while others discuss the theologies and philosophies of The Matrix.  Instead, watch it for what you can get out of it.  You may note something that everyone else missed.  There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.<br /><br />While many find flaws and faults with The Matrix (what movie isn't flawed?) still others will walk away unimpressed as I did.  Mind you I haven't seen any of the Matrix films in the theater.  I do urge you to see it more than once.  Once the inital shock is over, the many levels contained therein will start to seep into your brain.  Pretty soon instead of saying Huh? what?you say Ahah!! I get it.  So that's what that means.<br /><br />The Matrix Trilogy has ushered in a new era of sci-fi just as Star Wars did back in the day.  It seems like a million years ago.  We will never be the same!!  We may never be satisfied with the same old thing again.  The sci-fi world is forever changed now.<br /><br />I must add my kudos to the main cast.  They all did some amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats.  You can see how hard they trained when you watch the special features on each dvd.  Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture.  Great work.<br /><br />Parental advisory:  There is violence in this movie.  There is a small amount of nudity (non-frontal) but there is foul language and unfortunately the Lord's name is taken in vain.  I would advise a viewing age of at least 16 because the plots are so demanding that a younger mind may not grasp the details.<br /><br />THIS TRILOGY ROCKS!
B000000OQF|5.0|i got this cd recently...and i love guns n roses so i had to get this. at first listening to some of the songs on here i thought they were crappy vocals and sounding more like sympathy for the devil than welcome to the jungle. that was the first time i listened to it. now ive listened to it quite a few times and its just grown on me. its great. the solos are great, the lyrics, the vocals are great. the only thing keeping it from a true 5 stars is that rocket queen doesnt end the cd as well as it could. thats it, its one of the best. the best songs ---and all the songs are great--- are welcome to the jungle and sweet child o mine, which has one of the best solos ever, its classic. if ur into heavy metal or rock then get this album.
B0002M3V0C|4.0|Okay, not everyone will agree with me when I call this 'pop', but personally I think Maroon 5 is just about the best pop music around at the moment. <br /> <br />As for the extra tracks on this 'Asian' version... 3 out of the 4 aren't special. The acoustic versions of \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"She Will be Loved\\" appear to be lifted straight from the acoustic 1.22.03 EP (that's the recording date given for both).  They're pleasant enough but not a match for the studio versions. The Kanye West remix of \\"This Love\\" strikes me as pretty average, but I'm not a fan of remixes generally and may be biased. <br /> <br />The REAL bonus here is \\"Rag Doll\\", a bluesy song over 5 minutes long that is every bit as good as the main album.  If you're thinking of buying the album anyway, this track is the reason to give serious consideration to getting the 16-track version.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a story about religion, family, individual strength, and individual struggle. The main character, a young Indian boy named Pi, gives any reader a hope when they find themselves alone or in conflict. No matter your background, you can find encouragement in his story. Sometimes graphic, Life of Pi invokes many an emotion throughout its course. The boy tells his survival story about taming wild beasts and the ocean and relates to the reader on a personal level, helping them tame any grief they may be experiencing, or slay any beast in their way. Life of Pi was a truly loveable story that leaves you to ponder not only the story but also raises greater, important questions about our lives.
B0000019PA|4.0|Songs 3, 4 and 5 are crucial. They are only songs that I consider worth owning the album over. Scratch that; these three songs are so good, I don't mind paying $15 for the other eight as well. <br />The other songs aren't bad, but they don't stand out to me as much. Who knows, you might love those songs as well.

1573226521|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this book and had a very hard time taking breaks from reading it. I couldn't wait to get to the conclusion, but also didn't want it to end. The plot, the flow of the storyline, the characters, and especially the setting - all fascinating. Start this book, and you'll have to finish it. Don't bother seeing the movie, it is very different from the book and very poorly done.
0553212478|1.0|I was forced into reading this for my senior AP humanities class over the summer.  I began about three weeks before school started, and it took me a week to get though, despite being a relatively short book.  I literally almost fell asleep every ten pages.  Mary Shelley almost as much in need of a good editor as friggin' Frank Norris with his stupid novel McTeague.  She spend eons talking about how lovely the mountains are, then spends around five seconds explaining the birth of The Monster.  This tendancy to skip over the exciting parts as though they were unimportant may have been intentional (that's what my humanites teacher tells me) but it still bored me.  Also, I don't really care what the mountains looked like.  Victor Frankenstein whines his way through the entire novel, which is really irritating because everything that happens to him is his own fault.  When it comes to the development of The Monster, Mary Shelley seems to think that somehow, magically, The Monster knows way too much.  Too many convient things happen.  For example, he just happens to hang out behind a hut housing several very nice peasants, and they never notice?  Yeah, right.  Also, he just happens to find three very important and significant texts that have striking parallels to his own situation?  Again, yeah right.  It reached the point of ludicrocity.  I sincerley did not enjoy this book, and though I know that it may partially be Percy Shelley's fault (evidently, he was her editor), and I know that Mary Shelley had many miscarriages and children's deaths and this book is about that and blah blah blah, I will never enjoy it.
B00005JNJT|5.0|lets hope for the sake of all us big batman fans that this one is superior to the rest. As any self-respecting fan knows, this one is an adaptation of frank millers batman - year one which is pretty much one of the diffinitive comics. fingers crossed that gary oldman as commisoner gorden gets as much play as he did in the comic instead of some two-bit flunky portrayl like the rest of the films. Heres for michael caine being alfred to! hurrah! <br />who knows? hellboy was alright! &lt;snigger>
B0006B2A2E|5.0|For the moment this is my all time favorite movie.  Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman are both geniuses and this has got to the very best Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have acted.   <br /> <br />So, most people know the storyline by now.  Joel and Clemintine are in a relationship that goes sour.  Clemintine erases Joel from her memory.  He retaliates and erases her as well.  Most of the story is told as we see Joel's memories being erased.   <br />The story is told beautifully and the characters are completely alive.  We see the ups and downs of Joel and Clemintine's relationship.   <br /> <br />Finally, the movie is existential because Joel and Clemintine and everyone else who goes through the procedure is erasing who they are.  They are erasing their essence.  Without an essence one simply exists and there is nothing human about you.  Your essence is who you are and you can't go through life not taking responsibility for what you do and experience.  That is what the erasing procedure was taking from everyone.   <br /> <br />This movie is beautiful.  I highly recommend it.
068987474X|1.0|Greg Behrendt is foolishly operating under two assumptions: <br />1.  All guys are alike. <br />2.  All guys are just like him. <br />Mr. Behrendt, just because the are excuses put forth in this novel are ones you have used until you found \\"The One\\" doesn't mean that they are applicable to every guy and every situation.  From the portion of your \\"book\\" that I read, it seems that you perceive men as little more than coldly-practical-partner-seeking-automatons that have little more on their mind than sex and self-gratification.  To parapharse your \\"work\\"--A guy would never be afraid of ruining a friendship even if it's just for a f*ck buddy?  Don't make me sick.  There are actually some guys out there who truly struggle with issues such as friendship versus romance, and to put all guys into one group shows nothing more than arrogance and pretentiousness on your part.  And furthermore, you cannot assign rules to dating, romance, realtionships, and love.  These are abstract concepts based on faith and feeling.  Any \\"rules\\" that one tries to apply to them end up getting broken anyway, so why even try?  Unless, of course, you're a know-it-all snot. <br />Ladies, if you want to understand men, do the same thing us guys do: have a close plutonic friend of the opposite sex.  Have several.  They can be quite a help, I assure you.  As for the book, don't waste your time on this piece of garbage.  It's nothing more than a vanity piece for Mr. Behrendt and a feeble attempt to cash in on the popularity of the Sex and the City series. <br />And by the way, if this \\"book\\" has the cultural effect that the dust jacket notes claims it has, then all of us caring, sensitive, emotional males need to burn all availible copies now, lest the women that we're supposed to console when snobs like Greg Behrendt hurt them think that we're pigs as well.
0156027321|1.0|I am growing tired of so-called \\"modern literature,\\" and I'm about ready to go back to reading only fast, cheap thrillers.  Modern authors seem to fall into two catagories:  1)those using writing as a means to their own catharsis, forcing us to read about the bad things that happened to them during their wretched upbringing; and 2)those whose creativity is so weak that they dream up some bizaar tale for critics to ooh and ahh over, which really amounts to nothing more than gore with which to shock the reader.  Yann Martel has done this with \\"Life of Pi.\\"  He's done nothing more than write down his hashish-induced hallucinations as if they were the magical journey to an insightful vision.  Only of money, I say--and I'm sorry he got mine.
B000000W5L|5.0|Yes, this is my favorite cd of all time.  Completing the holy triumvirate of Stones' cds, along with Beggars' Banquet and Sticky Fingers, this cd is testament to their claim of \\"World's Greatest Rock Band.\\"  After listening to this, I agree. People often complain about the murky nature of the album, but I believe this is a point in its favor, making it much more organic and exciting than the plastic pop we hear over the radio today. This also gives the album a strange sort of depth, allowing different riffs, etc. to pop out like hidden gems during each listen.  Every time I listen to Exile, something pops up that I had not noticed before, which makes it a compelling listen even after you memorize every song (which I've done). The best way to describe the music itself is extraordinary. Every song is solid, but most are amazing.  Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Shine a Light...some of these I could listen to all day by themselves.  Maybe the best part is the amount of songs on the cd.  I'm a fan of double-albums, and this is the king.  All said, Exile on Main St. is a great cd. If you don't own it, shame on you...this is the very definition of \\"desert island album.\\"
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I think this was a great rendition of the Iliad although they changed things and left certain things out.  I cried so much during this movie because of the foreshadowing of what was to become of Hector's son.  I'm glad that they did not put this in the movie though, because it is just too sad.   <br />  I like how the movie showed the tragedy of the Trojan side of things rather than focus on the valiance of the Greeks.  We tend to side with the Greeks because the western world came from them and not from Persia.  However, if you read closely, you will see what barbarians the Greeks were.  This movie shows us the humanity of the Trojans rather than portraying them as animals that must be destroyed.  When my children are older I'm going to have them watch this movie in order to get them interested in the Iliad and Homer. <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|Timeless. There's so many syllables to describe this album. The first time I heard about this album was back when I was 6 living in South Jamaica, Queens. I was sitting on the stoop when I heard \\"The World Is Yours\\" on Hot 97. And a few years later, when I was about 14 or 15, I finally bought this album. Right when I pressed play, it was like watching a black-and-white movie. The whole album plays a different story to his life and illustrates what goes on around the way and the struggle to survive in-between. Each and every song is so on point, it would make an arrow seem like a feather pillow. This is the main reason why Nas is my favoite MC. I recommend this to anybody with my whole heart; whether you're commercial or underground. Whenever you get some dough, make sure this is on your to buy list. 1...

B00005JNEI|5.0|An entertaining yet insightful look at the 9/11 tragedy and its aftermath. Michael Moore informs, shocks, saddens and amuses the viewer with an amazing documentary that challenges the facts as we (think we) know them and cuts through the spin. Even if you don't like the director or are a die-hard republican, the film is a must see. It is worth every second.
0553212478|5.0|Frankenstein is a classic that every child had heard of, but who is the Frankenstein we imagine when we hear that name? A scary, green, ugly monster that holds his hands up like in the maraca? Or is  it a lonely and curious scientist that releases an alien creature into a society that kills and destroys? Mary Shelley named the ladder Frankenstein and she did so correctly.<br /><br />Who are the Frankenstein's in our society today, who are the enemies, who are the destroyers? The scary creatures of man or the quiet, good looking men who smile and fade away? This book is amazing because of the issues it presents by answering this question. This classic doesn't only use the language of the old British that sweep your tongue and give you the feeling of intellectual bliss, but it also poses a question that continues to be asked throughout the centuries. Who are the REAL Frankensteins?<br /><br />Mary Shelley knew her answer and gave evil a beautiful name that most have used and see each day. Evil is disguised in the finest clothing and the richest words, evil is not in the ugly, the uneducated, the unknown, it is in the men and women who question how to create. Curiosity of God's work, God's hands, God's power. At the end of this book you know where evil resides and who Frankenstein really is. This book will give you a different image every time you heear the word Frankenstein and question, who is the real Frankenstein?

B000002UDG|5.0|Now if you ask me and quite a respectable number of folk what are interested  in the various comparison aspects of compilation albums do now and again (in fact, more often than you'd ever care to guess) then I got a few things you need to hear if you are considering this here CD as a future purchase. <br /> <br />First of all. This one came just 9 years after his Wings Greatest Hits CD which (depending on the version you get hold of) contains a dozen hits. Now if you were to forego that one and go ahead on and get this here CD, then you would get eleven of them dozen hits plus some others. The one hit what is missin' from this 1987 Best of that was on the 1978 Best of is \\"Hi Hi Hi\\" and, truth be node, I got no idea why it was left off this new one because it is a pretty good song. <br /> <br />However, this newer Best of CD contains a whole other eleven additional songs that ain't on the first one, namely; Coming Up, Ebony And Ivory, Listen To What The Man Said, No More Lonely Nights, C Moon, Pipes Of Peace, Once Upon A Long Ago, Say Say Say, We All Stand Together, Goodnight Tonight, Maybe I'm Amazed. Of course, there are a passel of versions out there so be sure and check the track listing before you plunk down any pocket change... some versions provide more value for money than others. I never understood why they do that to us consumers, but they do and they don't even smile when they're doing it. <br /> <br />This here album is pretty much a track record for all the good stuff Paul did once he shed himself of the Beatles (no slight intended towards the Beatles, of course) . I guess we can see pretty clearly that our pasty British cousins like Paul more than us over here on the left side of the Atlantic because when this here CD come out in 1987 it climbed up the British charts to the #2 position and sat there for a while, while at the same time in the US of A it managed to get as high as #62 and then fell like a mill stone. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good introduction to Paul's music post JohnGeorgeRingo then I reckon this is absolutely the best way to get acclimated and situated.

B000003NA3|5.0|This box set means so much to me not just because I'm such a rabid Coltrane fan, but because I find this music healing.  This is the only music I listen to when I am sick.  If illness or injury come to me and I'm stuck in bed - I just put these 4 CDs on repeat and they somehow seem to work their magic.  Coltrane and Co. thrive on rapid, fleeting performances here.  Yet, I could not categorize this as hard-bop.  I  don't know what it is, it's certainly not any calming effect as the music is quite uptempo.  I truly cannot explain how or why this album aids in healing me through sickly days.  There is just something so warm and free about this.<br /><br />For Coltrane himself, the first week of November, 1961 was a historic event.  Coltrane had just started a new chapter in his work, expanding & experimenting as he wished.  If you were to play all his albums in chronological order, this box set comes off as a bold departure.  The 'sheets of sound' that became his trademark was introduced only two years earlier, and obviously listening to that style throughout this box set gives it new depth.  He expands his usual quartet here to a nonet.  To date, this remains one of Coltrane's very few orchestral-type efforts (he preferred leading a quartet above all else).  The additional players he invited here provide more of a coloring effect than a full-blown big band sound.  You will also find a great Indian influence on this album.  Coltrane, always the spiritualist, leads forth with great Indian influenced melodies.<br /><br />As expressive as Coltrane is, there is always a co-star on his records.  Quite often it's pianist McCoy Tyner, but here the secret weapon is drummer Elvin Jones (regarded by most historians as an authority on polyrhythmic drumming).  Even in spots where someone seems to be doing a long solo, stretching up and out into their own stratosphere - Jones keeps everything moving fast and light.  The repetition of songs listed in this set shouldn't worry.  Every performance of each song is done in a different key and varying in length.  When you hear this it's apparent that Coltrane purposely re-worked the same set over these four days to find out how fast he and his band could evolve.  As one person remarked, Coltrane's music wasn't a short poem, but a very long novel.Every performance of each song is done in a different key and varying in length.

B00000I5MH|5.0|Now if you ask me and quite a respectable number of folk what are interested  in the various comparison aspects of compilation albums do now and again (in fact, more often than you'd ever care to guess) then I got a few things you need to hear if you are considering this here CD as a future purchase. <br /> <br />First of all. This one came just 9 years after his Wings Greatest Hits CD which (depending on the version you get hold of) contains a dozen hits. Now if you were to forego that one and go ahead on and get this here CD, then you would get eleven of them dozen hits plus some others. The one hit what is missin' from this 1987 Best of that was on the 1978 Best of is \\"Hi Hi Hi\\" and, truth be node, I got no idea why it was left off this new one because it is a pretty good song. <br /> <br />However, this newer Best of CD contains a whole other eleven additional songs that ain't on the first one, namely; Coming Up, Ebony And Ivory, Listen To What The Man Said, No More Lonely Nights, C Moon, Pipes Of Peace, Once Upon A Long Ago, Say Say Say, We All Stand Together, Goodnight Tonight, Maybe I'm Amazed. Of course, there are a passel of versions out there so be sure and check the track listing before you plunk down any pocket change... some versions provide more value for money than others. I never understood why they do that to us consumers, but they do and they don't even smile when they're doing it. <br /> <br />This here album is pretty much a track record for all the good stuff Paul did once he shed himself of the Beatles (no slight intended towards the Beatles, of course) . I guess we can see pretty clearly that our pasty British cousins like Paul more than us over here on the left side of the Atlantic because when this here CD come out in 1987 it climbed up the British charts to the #2 position and sat there for a while, while at the same time in the US of A it managed to get as high as #62 and then fell like a mill stone. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good introduction to Paul's music post JohnGeorgeRingo then I reckon this is absolutely the best way to get acclimated and situated.

B0006399FS|2.0|Not one of U2's best efforts.  As a matter of fact, i can only think of three tunes on this CD that are memorable.  Soon to be gathering dust on a shelf.  Buy All That You Can't Leave Behind or Joshua Tree or one of U2's many other good CDs, and take a pass on this one.
B000000OQF|5.0|My lord. There are so many lame people in this world eh rock fans? It almost makes me sick to see the various people dissing on this ablum... from people who think brittany spears is 'da shiet' all the way to people who think kurt cobain is their god and because he didnt like axl they feel like they should conform to his thoughts and diss the band as a whole. \\"kurt cobain is cool because he died! axl is lame duff is lame slash is lame steven is lame and izzy is lame!\\" Gee people like that... o well, you always have pricks online. on to the review... <br /> <br />this band blew away everyone who heard em back in the late 80's.. they were truely one of a kind! not heavy metal, (sorry.. but its not) its not glam rock (poison) and its not just normal rock. its guns n roses rock! <br /> <br />song ratings. <br /> <br />welcome to the jungle: great song to get into gnr. gets old after awhile though... 8.5 out of 10 <br /> <br />its so easy: its kinda a love or hate song.. alot of people dont think its that great because it lacks any real guitar solo. i love how angry axl sounds, and you punks who say you dont like gnr cuz of axls \\"high annoying voice\\" should hear this one. 8.5 out of 10 <br /> <br />Nightrain: Awesome song. Awesome guitar solo. Great feelin in it. 9.0 out of 10 <br /> <br />Mr. Brownstone: A timeless unique song that has a style i have never ever heard eleswhere! (can anyone tell me a band or song like it?! please do!) Its so... laid back and alive at the same time. i love the drums. i love the bass. (another song without axl high pitched.. not that its bad. just for idiots who use that as a excuse). 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />Paradise City: You know.. this song.. everyone really really loves it. but i dont think its THAT great. It just doesnt pull of the hard to soft well enough. o well... everyone eles loves it. i guess i just never got into it enough. still good but not up to gnr level (perfection!). 8.5 out of 10. <br /> <br />My Michele: O man.. thisis the song that started my gnr crazyness. it just has this awesome riff that repeats over and over and its just perfect. very dark but then changes into a lighter song. i kinda wish it stayed dark tho... you eventally get tired o it.. but not for awhile. 9.0 out of 10. <br /> <br />Out Ta Get Me: This song.. i didnt like it.. and then i really liked it.. and now i dont really like it. axl screams during the chorus... but its not really a scream.. its like a bad kinda yell. flat sounding. =/. slash and izzy are great on guitar tho. <br />7.5 out of 10. <br /> <br />Think About You: This song is underrated! its not their best work but i love the.. weird but awesome kinda.. middle eastern sound (?) in the 2nd chorus thing. where axl is like \\"i think about youuuuu.. you know... that i do.\\" like 1:50 into the song. I give it a 8 out of 10. its kinda like sweet child o mines lil brother or something. <br /> <br />Sweet Child O Mine: In my opinion this is the best gnr song. better than brownstone. and its even better than the gnr use your illusion 'trilogy' (dont cry, novemeber rain, and estranged). and some people like those songs especally nov. rain and estranged becuase theyre both these really deep thought out love songs.. but sweet child o mine is like the joy in love.. its so uplifting.. heartwarming if i do say so myself. and the lyrics are beautiful. the guitar is unforgettable and the song has axl at his best. the bass is also amazing! (listen for it!). i love the ending the most tho.. the notes really high.. and then \\"where do we go now!? and the drop \\"oh oh oh oh oh oh no!\\" and the raise \\"sweet chiiiiiiiild o miiiiinnnneeeeeeeeeeee\\" and its just... it gives me the chills! 10 out of 10! <br /> <br />Your Crazy: This is the fastest song on the album. The chorus is pretty good. you get a good feeling from it. good to jump around to.. good to listen to loud. 8.0 out of 10. <br /> <br />Anything Goes: the only filler on the album? mabey. but i think people only look at it as a filler because all the other songs are so damn good! i think if some other average band put this song out people would give it more credit. i like axls way of saying \\"toni-EI-EI-EI-AYAYA\\". lol. also it has a killer intro/outro with the guitar. i think this is a really good song. 8.0 out of 10. <br /> <br />Rocket Queen: This song takes some getting used to.. its kinda like my michele.. thats probably the closest song to compare it to.. but its alot different too. i love this song like crazy. and the last part is so cool. take a listen! 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />and thats my review. i love this ablum so much. even if all the songs arent perfect.. theres no fillers.. and no songs that feel fake. so buy it! buy it! buy it! lol. best piece o crap out there. its a shame gnr went down how they did... o well. (and no... axl rose and his \\"new guys\\" do not count as gnr...! but heres to hoping chinese democracy.. if ever out.. is good. doesnt hurt to hope right?) <br /> <br />-jack (email me at jacktopia@aol.com) <br /> <br />ps. kurt cobain obsessed who \\"HATE\\" gnr. if kurt hated everything gnr stood for then why did he TOTALLY RIP OFF THE CHORUS of \\"Its So Easy\\" in \\"Turn Around\\" (off the incesticide album) LISTEN TO IT YOU LOSERS! and no i dont hate nirvana or kurt cobain. i just hate the people who think theyre 'hardcore' nirvana fans because they think courtney love hired someone to kill him (NO LOSER!) or the even crazyer 'forever 27' theory... or that kurt cobain hated publicity or mtv.. if he hated publicity and mtv then why would he make music videos? make a widespread cd? he coulda kept it local. easyly. and you wanna know why kc killed himself? because he was a weak minded bi-polar creep who couldnt handle life so he just killed himself! he was weak! christ... and anyone who likes kurt cobain and doesnt like alice in chains or pearl jam needs to seriously rethink themselfs. sorry bout that rant... and im sure a bunch of kc fans will attack me. but let em. jacktopia@aol.com. bring it..
B000002HMH|5.0|I definetely disagree with people who dispise this album for being sell-out, or being less heavier in the true sense of the word than the others. Here, Metallica still brings his best, just in a different way. And here's the point! <br /> As others said, Metallica has been in the music industry for more than TWENTY years, and they have been setting standards ever since in every aspect. In sound, meanings, instrumental techniques, they were groundbreakers, that's unquestionable. <br />But imagine those twenty years... <br />For some people, that's the half of their life! They could have been easily wiped out after a few years. But they always came up with something new, groundbreaking. Then how would it feel like if they came out with a new album using the same old recipe after the Black Album? I think it would have been boring after a while... <br />But with Load, AGAIN they gave something new, and memorable, with a totally new concept! I think this is the best in it all: if you take a listen to Metallica's whole discography, you can hardly say they ever settled down with some boring, overused thing. And the Load album has a most significant role in this! I think Metallica only proved it's versatility with this album, that they can blast with this kind of music, also. <br />And what's with this selling out thing? I mean, why would they sell out? IS James singing about how to have a good party, or how he had a nasty night with a few girls at once? I don't think so. This album is just as deep and emotional as the others were. But the magic of it is the new sound, the new ideas, still aren't far away from Metallica. <br />Maybe I'm a little owerwhelmed, becuse, frankly, this is my favourite album of all time. It tells something to me that is from the inside, and feels like all the members gave all their souls into this album. It's amazing. With songs like The Outlaw Thorn, The House Jack Built, Bleeding Me, this is one of the most heaviest yet moving album for me. Forme, this album means the real Metallica. Take a listen for yourself from the examples from above...
B00006RCNW|4.0|Tuesday nights at 9pm,I'd drop everything to watch this show. If I had to work,my VCR was set to record it,even sacrificing watching a new episode of \\"Law & Order:SVU\\". It's that good,people. <br /> <br />What with all the hype that you hear about the NBC ironhorse \\"Law & Order\\"franchise(and I love all the shows,don't get me wrong) and the slickness of the \\"CSI\\"shows,it's a shame that the best cop show on TV since the first season of \\"NYPD Blue\\"gets such a low profile. And maybe that's a good thing. \\"The Shield\\"is so raw yet has brilliant writing and character development that it transcends the writing that you usually see on the aforementioned TV shows. Michael\\"The Commish\\"Chiklis plays anti-hero cop Vic Mackey with such a razor sharp precision,you can't help but lock your eyes on his performance. Balancing between volatile powderkeg and good guy softie,Mackey is the best character to hit TV(cable or network)in years.The story arcs are compelling,the rest of the cast is amazing(shouldn't CCH Pounder get an Emmy nod?)and the dialogue is crisp and edgy.With the benefit of basic cable on the writers' side,they can use profanity with much more freedom that the network cop shows,thus giving it a much more realistic angle. Hands down,it's just one of the best shows on TV to date. The first season is brilliant and by the middle of the second,you'll be beyond hooked.I wouldn't be surprised if \\"The Shield\\"fills the void for when \\"NYPD Blue\\"ends this year.
B000002UY5|5.0|The first time I heard it, it didn't seem that great. I knew \\"No Rain\\" from the radio, and I listened to it. But the third or fourth time I listened to the cd, I couldn't stop listening. I had to stop working to listen to every word Shannon said. The cd was a regular in my player for months, and one of my all-time favorites. The sweet, beautiful voice and old-style guitars along with the amazing lyrics make this album a can't miss. It has truly changed my life and the way I look at things. Buyer Beware, it is very addicting!
1400032717|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It was one of the best novels I read this year.  A lot of people compare it to Steve Martin's \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\", but I think Mark Haddon does a better job of capturing the voice of mental illness.  I believed in Christopher Boone.  His voice was real.  I connected with it.  In my opinion, you have to connect with the characters of a novel in a personal way.  You need to care about them.  I cared about what happend to Christopher.  And I look forward to Mark Haddon's next book.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|This is certainly a case of \\"different strokes for different folks\\".  What you're looking for will impact your like or dislike of the film. <br /> <br />If you want a film true to Homer, this is NOT the flick for you.  Not even remotely close.  No gods, relationships all wrong, characters increased or decreased in importance, and the timeline is beyond butchered.  Oh, and several rather important characters are completely missing. (Cassandra!  Hello!  Kinda needed with the whole big wooden horse!)  I can forgive the limited Akhilleus backstory as we all know who he is and were he's vulnerable.  But these other omissions were enough to almost cause a fight between myself and the gentleman sitting in front of me when I saw this film as I kept muttering under my breath and this poor adaptation of a classic. <br /> <br />If you want a good action flick, this is it.  Although long at 2 hours and 40 some-odd minutes, it has a good deal of action.  The fight scenes were stunning, the cinematography was excellent, the costumes were beautiful, and the locations were stunning.  My ex loved it since he never read the Iliad, and he could appreciate it as a straight up action film. <br /> <br />I would not call this an epic, and here's why.  The script was a bit full of itself, to be kind, and I had several casting issues.  Pitt was all wrong for Akhilleus.  Krueger as Helen was a cardboard cutout, and Bloom took Paris' cowardice to comedic levels.   <br /> <br />Bana was the perfect Hektor, Peter O'Toole was nothing less than classy (despite the script), Brian Cox and Sean Beam were excellently cast in their roles as well.  Fortunately, we were not subject to too much in terms of dialogue from Ajax, because as we saw in \\"X-Men\\", Taylor Mane (aka \\"Sabretooth\\") can't do much more than growl his way through a film. <br /> <br />I wanted to like this film.  Desperately.  I couldn't.  I am going to give it another try on rental, just to view it as an action flick.  I think it has potential as a \\"sword-and-sandals\\" epic, but not as an adaptation of classic film.  And, although not great praise, at least it's better than \\"Alexander\\"...
B000002H33|5.0|This album has a 5-star AVERAGE for a reason.  Spam reviews from Britney Spears and Hoobistank fans notwithsanding, everyone who listens to it concludes that it is a speed-metal landmark.  Because it is.  It is the best Metallica album, and arguably the best fast metal album ever made.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Remember when the makers of Coca Cola had the \\"brilliant\\" idea of making it \\"better\\" so they re-did the formula and came out with New Coke?? Same idea behind this disaster! <br /> <br />Moral of the story: NEVER MESS WITH A GREAT THING!
B000002J03|5.0|I can't stand todays rock music. And when I listen to great albums like this one I know why. God these guys were so talented. It kinda makes me wish I had been born 30 years  earlier. This album is amazing. A WHOLE LOTTA LOVE & HEARTBREAKER really rock. And Jimmy Page is an absolute guitar GOD!!! Buy this classic.
B000679N96|5.0|Yes!!!  What was an extraordinarily dismal evening has just brightened considerably!  I was just reading the Simon Gallup interview in the December issue of Bass Player magazine, which is cool enough, and now I find out here on Amazon that \\"Heroin Face\\" has finally been released on CD!  My band used to cover that song at almost every show we played during the early 1990s, and I've been searching everywhere for a copy of \\"Concert & Curiosity\\" for almost a decade (I only had a dubbed copy, which has long since disappeared...).  If I remember correctly, the demo of \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is pretty cool also, and I can't wait to hear how these songs sound on a CD instead of a worn out cassette.  I'm glad now that I waited to buy a copy of \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\", and I don't think the price is all that high- I remember \\"C & C\\" going for US$22.00 or something like that in the late '80s, and I'm sure it would cost way more now; so I'll happily pay for this... <br /> <br />                             Dimestore Liam
B000002J09|5.0|It has STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, BLACK DOG & WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS. And ROCK & ROLL. Forget about it, this is thee rock album to own.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I am a single middle aged straight man.  What is it about these two movies that has touched my heart strings so much.  I didn't think I have a shred of romanticism left in me but after watching Julie Delpy sing \\"the waltz song\\" and watching her body language and her cute little giggles,and her sexy accent, I am in love again.  I guess it's the fact that I remember(maybe a long time ago) what it was like to meet someone and all the excitement that comes with that. Before Sunset brought all these memories to the fore and it was a very pleasent feeling.  Both movies are highly recommended and Julie Delpy if you are reading this,I want to be the father of your children!
B000002OX7|4.0|I hate modern rock music. But I grew up listening to this one. And its pretty cool. The way the guitars blend with those trippy keyboard sounds. This is a good example of great  rock music.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I will never forget this movie and the umpteen times I have watched it.  I too cannot believe it's not yet on DVD at a reasonable price.  I have recommended it to countless others who cannot find even a VHS copy anymore.  Please Please Please release this wonderfully funny endearing film to the masses!
B00005JMUA|5.0|First, to the reviewer who wrote in his \\"spoiler\\" that the movie didn't explain the baby or why Bill wanted her dead, apparently you didn't even watch the movie, as it explains both completely. <br />Now, this second installment is not as purely entertaining (at least not in the same way) as Volume 1, but it is still a better movie.  Tarantino really shines in this one.  I've read that some people were bored by the ending with David Carradine.  Granted, it is mostly monologue and dialogue, but some of the best in recent memory - after all, dialogue is Tarantino's strong suit.  Bill's Superman speech still wows me every time I hear it. <br />Even if you did not like this movie, there is absolutely nothing about it that warrants a one-star rating.  It is a film of the highest order, even if it does move slower that Vol. 1.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I cant almost stop crying watching this.     Because of:    The spirit of that day.  The songs of all times.  The incredible performances of most of the artists.  The warmth of the people.    Because of  The motive for this concert.    Because   We haven't learn yet. There's hunger, 20 years later.    Still, the best show and the best excuse for making ourselves, feel more human.    Thanx Bob Geldof.
0156027321|5.0|I was so enthraled with Life of Pi that its hard to put into words how I feel.  I couldn't put the book down, it just had so much life . And it wasn't like any other book I had read.  At first Martel drew me in with his play like excerpts in Part One.  He almost set the stage for the chapters to come, by describing the plump man in front of him, or by depicting the quiant cottage in which he sat.  The images he created for me were amazing.  And not only when it came to describing people and places, even the gruesome murders that took place in part two were easy to see.  Sometimes I winced when reading and looked away like you would do if you were trying to avoid witnessing anythihng morbid in a movie.  At times I even lost my appetite because the picture Martel had created in my mind was so vivid that the sight of meat made me sick.   <br />However, the clear imagery was not the only thing that drew me into this book.  It was the amount of thought that Martel provoked out of you that was entrancing.  This wasn't just a novel that you read and said \\"cool\\" when you were done, this was a book that you could talk about for hour upon hours.  I was truly impressed.
1572522828|5.0|If we had to pick the best erotic film ever (and we're glad we don't), this would be it!  This film violates many of the conventions that hold back other erotic films.  Rather than unbelieveably beautiful bodies and impossibly vigorous action, this film features erotic tension between several believable, attractive characters.  What's more, it has one of the most important characteristics of any movie -- it ends at just the right time.  (Interestingly, the same could be said of the film's subject!)  If the bath scene doesn't stick with you for years after viewing this film (as it has for us), please check your pulse.  Be sure to listen to the original, French soundtrack, because in addition to being the language of love, many of the voices of the actors add immeasurably to the eroticism of this film (particularly the young girl, Catherine Rivet).
B0000062FL|5.0|This is the definative Santana, the best line up of musicians the best songs, the best of everything.<br /><br />I love Carlos Santana and own everthing each incarnation of this band has put out, but if I were allowed to keep only one of the many works produced this would be the one. Nothing like it before or since.
B00004SZWD|5.0|There are so many songs here that the listener is bound to skip one or two.  That said, this is clearly a 5-star recording and one of the landmark albums of all time.  There are so many great melodic, lyrical, and arrangement ideas crammed into these songs that one could be lost for months sorting it all out.  This is one of those few albums that should be in EVERYONE'S collection irregardless of one's favorite musical genre.   <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I really like this movie. I think it's very funny and just interesting. Thats the good part. The bad...EVERY PERSON IN THE WORLD IS QUOTING IT! ENOUGH! NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR IT! YOU'RE NOT NAPOLEON! everyone in my school quotes this movie like it is their job. yea funny at first when its just a group of people that saw it and liked it and quote and everyone thinks they are insane cause they have no idea what theyre talking about. not funny anymore when you walk down a crowded hallway and hear SWEET! GOSH! IDIOT! PEDRO SANCHEZ! its not funny anymore. thank you to those people who are singlehandedly ruining my favorite movie ever. i appreciate it. just STOP!
B000006Z1X|4.0|Lost amidst a glut of 80's hard rock, this was actually a pretty good album.  It has some of Graham Bonnet's best singing, and Steve Vai's unique guitar work takes the heavy metal genre closer to progressive rock.  It surprises me that several reviewers feel that Vai lacks emotion in his playing.  When I hear the soaring lead lines, I hear more emotion than in most other heavy rockers.  Vai rarely plays with fixed finger patterns or within commonly-used blues scales.  Rather, he seems to have a direct thought-to-fingers connection that leads to some beautiful work.  All that said, Bonnet's best songwriting has often been tied to simpler riffs.  There are some moments here where it sounds like he's trying hard to find a melody that works with the instrumentation.  Alcatrazz with Yngwie might have been a better long-term fit had Yngwie been able to check his ego at the door and work within a group format.   <br />
B000089RVX|1.0|June 30th 2003 <br />I've read reviews that rave endlessly about how deep, dark, and innovative Amy Lee's lyrics are on this album. I must wholeheartedly disagree. Any high school kid with a little bit of angst can produce lyrics/poetry of this caliber. I read plenty of goth/sorrowful poetry back in my school days. - Every high school in the nation has its own batch of premiere goth girls who write poetry and lyrics in this style. Nothing new here. So as for lyrical quality, I'm far from amazed. Amy Lee, the band's singer, does have a nice voice though. While she may not be singing about anything too worth while, she does hit highs and harmonies quite well on almost all the tracks. She has a melodious voice and definite potential as far as musical foresight and song layout. The actual music is well done. Decent rock guitarring/drumming with hints of 'nu-metal' and progressive industrial. Nothing that will blow your socks off, but some semi-memorable riffing by and by. I think there are two big selling points that this band has going for them on this album.  <br />Number 1: Catchy choruses - Yes, yes. We all love to know the words and sing along to an addictive melody. Good fun and easy lyrics to remember.  <br />Number 2: Fairly attractive/'cliche-dark' pop singer. Lets face it, if Amy Lee had acne or any other taboo attribute that pop-culture loves to attack, Evanescence would be hurting one way or another. Fortunately for the band, she's the cliche goth girl that plenty of fans, male or female, want to see. Sadness, sorrow, darkness..etc - All parts of a fashionable alienation that Amy Lee has exploited well in her lyrics and presentation of herself. - Good for sales. <br /> <br />Some pop fans may be impressed by Evanescence's approach, but I think true artists/poets are either snoring or awaiting the band's second release in hopes that they improve. I suppose this album is better than most pop that you'll find out there. Little bit heavier, and a step in the right direction from a band with potential yet to be let loose. That's about all the positive ink I can muster for Amy Lee and the sorrowfuls. Sample it before you buy. <br />
B000063DI8|2.0|Ok, back to bascis may have seen a good idea by Steve Harris. But writing just a bunhc of useless and incredibly bad metal songs (by Maiden standards, I mean) was a strange move. This album is lefeless, no doubt it suffered from the moment the band was going through (Adrian Smith leaving). It's a mysery to me how Martin Birch (the producer) did not warn the big boss Steve Harris that the album suck..d. <br /> <br />If you are a Maiden die hard, you will find all their albums a work of art. But if other than that, almost everybody recognizes this to be the worst effort of the Dickinson albums.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Raves Peter Travers of Rolling Stone.  As if I needed another reason to think he was a complete schmuck.  I hated Napoleon Dynamite, but that's not saying you will, it's just my two cents.  It's one of those films where you have to like the main character or else you're screwed, coz you have to spend the duration of the film with him.  Some people feel this way about Woody Allen, some Jerry Lewis, to me it's Napoleon Dynamite.  Now I'm all in favor of films that show the underdog/outcast getting his/her shot at glory, and I also like to think I have a pretty broad sense of humor.  This movie only seems to have one joke that they stretch out for 84 minutes-Look at the dorky guy looking dorky, saying and doing dorky things.  Dorky can be funny, but Napoleon is downright unpleasant, unlikable and unfunny.  Plus he has a dorky brother, dorky uncle and dorky semi-girlfriend, so we get to push the whole dorky joke even further.  There are alot of hypocrites who really like the Napoleon character and think he's cool, yet if this same guy went to your high school as opposed to being a movie character, you'd hate him.  Napoleon's friend, Pedro is from the Cheech and Chong school of funny.  If you like Mexican characters that speak as though they're stoned, drunk or just dumb, you'll find Pedro funny.  I just think he's a stereotype myself.  He's a live action version of Speedy Gonzales' drunk cousin, Slowpoke Rodriguez.  I barely smiled at this film, let alone laughed.  Considering MTV productions had a hand in this \\"independant\\" feature, you can kinda guess what kind of humor we're talking about.  And seeing the MTV name attached to this film makes me worry about the future of independant films.  It has one or two chuckles(not surprisingly the laughs came from every character but Napoleon), and Napoleon's dance at the end was pretty well done, but it just didn't do it for me.  Already I've noticed the extremely annoying epidemic of people freely quoting from this film.  There's nothing worse than people quoting unfunny lines from an unfunny movie, then cracking up at their own joke.  You'll notice this happens with people who quote Monty Python and The Holy Grail(complete with rotten English accent), only difference being that Monty Python manage to be funny.  More than likely I'll be brushed off as one who \\"just didn't get it\\", but that's cool coz I'm sure I can think of many films you won't \\"get\\" either.  Later Gator.his film.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I read really bad reviews about this movie before watching it. Some said it was funny for the first ten minutes and then flat the rest of the time. This film was really hilarious. It was filled with little jewels. Lines that are very quotable and unforgettable. Uncle Rico is the classic loser uncle who thinks he is cool and his scamming with Kip is classic. Napoleon is someone that is indescribable. He is everybody from you high school and no body from your high school. I was worried the whole time that I might find out a little of myself in him. Buy this one right now it is going to be one of the classic films in you collection right next to Rad, North Shore, Big Lebowski, Better Off Dead, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Etc. Nothing bad about this film even came into my mind. Remember Vote For Pedro!
B00000J7J4|4.0|Okay, first I am a Santana fan(atic). His guitar artistry touches my soul like no one ever has. I love Clapton,SRV, Duane Allman, BB King, and others but Carlos takes me someplace they never have.<br /><br />This album is great for the casual fan who doesn't know Santana but for die hard fans of the first three albums( sorry but that's what they were), or the collaberations starting with the superb Carlos Santana and Buddy Miles Live! will be dissappointed.<br /><br />It used to be that there were two kinds of albums from Carlos- first there were Santana (the band) albums, which produced this great Latin/Cuban/ African/fusion music and then there were Carlos Santana albums which were a little more experimental and often offered teamups with other musicians.<br /><br />This is more like the latter and that's fine but the hard core Santana fans want more of the ground breaking stuff like Abraxas and a dynamic lead singer, preferably Gregg Rollie or Greg Walker.<br /><br />Meanwhile we'll take whatever Santana we can get.<br /><br />I have an idea - let's team up Carlos with a little group called Abraxas Pool.
B000000W5B|5.0|When the great Stones albums are discussed Goats Head Soup is generally passed over. The truth is, albums such as Exile on Main Street, Beggars Banquet, and Let it Bleed are all wonderful albums and deserving of the praise they receive. These albums contain some of the Stones' best known works, as well as a number of good album tracks that rarely get airtime even today, which is surprising given the glut of classic rock radio stations.  <br /> <br />Comparitively, Goats Head Soup really shouldn't compare as its two 'name' songs are Angie and Doo^5 (Heartbreaker)-- two good songs, but not necessarily classics. On the strength of its money songs, GHS really does not compare at all with the best Stones albums. Two things though make this album, in my estimation, an essential Stones piece and a legitimate classic.  <br /> <br />First, the album holds together quite well. Even on the best Stones albums there tends to be a mediocre song or two that is hard to sit through. This may seem like a backhanded compliment, but nothing on GHS is all that bad. I know a number of Stones fans dislike \\"Can You Hear the Music\\" but I don't find it to be anything I immediately skip over. <br /> <br />Second, GHS' strongest point is that it includes a number of excellent \\"surprise\\" songs. \\"Dancing with Mr. D\\" is far from the greatest Stones opener of all time, but it's menacing riff propels an average song to greater heights. \\"100 Years Ago\\" is a quieter, nostalgic song that also stands out. Finally there's \\"Winter,\\" one of my personal Stones favorites and a song that I could not believe I had never heard until purchasing the album. I'm not sure what to say about it other than that I would wager the Counting Crows were quite familiar with it by the time they penned \\"A Long December.\\" <br />
B00005JN2Z|2.0|I think this movie is being way too over-praised. I found <br />every lingering moment of the movie to be draining. I quickly <br />found myself void of interest, energy, and sanity. Tom Cruise <br />and Jamie Foxx have succeeded in stealing away two hours of my <br />life. Two hours that I will never get back. Opt for a rental if <br />you just -have- to see it.
B000000WA4|5.0|if there were a hypothetical fire that was occurring only in the area of where i keep my CD's, and i could only save one, this is it. this isn't just some CD slapped together for profit or a bunch of crap songs thrown together to try and make a good album. this is absolute art. every song belongs on this CD and all work together to enhance the others. it does follow the conceptual ideas of the titles of the two-disc set consisting of \\"dawn to dusk\\" and \\"twilight to starlight\\". it's more of something you need to listen to straight through to really get the feel of it. on \\"dawn to dusk\\", the disc starts off with a quiet instrumental piece in \\"MCIS\\" (which also plays a part in the second disc, as well as the flow of the two discs). it then moves into \\"Tonight Tonight\\" which is one of The Smashing Pumpkins strongest offerings ever. the emotion and power in this song really lifts you up and gets you ready for the rest of the CD. it then unfolds into great song after great song, hitting you hard and fast. finally near the end, it begins to unwind and settle back a bit with beautiful offerings such as \\"Galapogos\\" and \\"Porcelina\\". on the second disc \\"Twilight to Starlight\\", the mood is a bit more mixed, weaving in and out of more contemplative and emotional pieces, along with the likes of a couple of the most angry songs i've ever heard from the Pumpkins. again, as was on the first disc, the mood eventually becomes very peaceful and calm, with songs that ebb and flow like someone slipping in and out of sleep. these songs are simply love songs, filled with hope for something better. the kinds of things that you really only have time to wonder about while you lie in your bed at night. the last five songs are all perfect together and do well as the final farewell for the end of the CD. the best of these are \\"We Only Come Out at Night\\" (one of my personal favorites) and the heartbreaking \\"By Starlight\\". and just when you think it's over, as the end of \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" fades out, you can hear a piano faintly playing the beginning of \\"MCIS\\", bringing it all full circle: Dawn to Dusk, Twilight to Starlight, and back again to the beginning of Dawn. like i said, it's not just a CD, it's an artistic experience.
B00003CXA4|4.0|Oh, don't get me wrong, Ben Kingsley was FANTASTIC as Gandhi! He totally deserved his Oscar. Still, a little known fact is that Ben Kingsley wasn't the movie company's first choice to play Gandhi. Do you know who their first choice was?<br /><br />Charles Nelson Reilly.<br /><br />That's right - Charles Nelson Reilly, the beloved star of Match Game. Apparently the producers of Gandhi desperately wanted Charles to star as Gandhi, but he was already committed to play Don Don Canneloni in Cannonball Run 2. He couldn't get out of it, so they went with Ben Kingsley instead.<br /><br />Oh, they made a good second choice. The movie is still wonderful as it is. Still, I can't help but wonder how much more wonderful it might have been if Charles Nelson Reilly had starred in it.<br /><br />Granted, Cannonball Run 2 probably wouldn't have been the classic it is without Charles, but just imagine what Charles could have done as Gandhi! No offense to Ben Kingsley (like I said, he was great) but this movie would have been totally different if it had starred Charles Nelson Reilly.<br /><br />It's still a 4 star movie...but it could have been a 5 star movie.
B00000DOZ4|5.0|Every song on this album is good. It's not AS bluesy as their first album but it still has a hard rock feeling to it (Led Zeppelin III contains southern sounding music for the MOST part). People getting started on Led Zeppelin would probably prefer getting thier fourth album instead (containing Stairway to Heaven, Black Dog, and Rock and Roll). This album contains good guitar solos, guitar riffs, bass playing, and druming (Bonham plays a solo on Moby Dick). Most people who like classic rock bands like Cream, Jefferson Airplane, and Pink Floyd will probably like this album. Jimmy Page (my favorite guitar player)is an awesome (yet I'll admit sometimes a little sloppy) guitar player. If there is even just one song you know of that you like on this album then get it, you will not be dissappointed.
B0006399FS|5.0|Heard the tune \\"Vertigo\\" on the TV iPod commercials, haven't you? <br /> <br />That song, while the lead track on this album, is NOT what this album is all about. <br /> <br />On first listen, I was expecting an album full of Vertigo-style tracks.  Boy was I surprised. <br /> <br />Vertigo is a catchy, fun, radio-friendly tune, but the rest of this album is a complex, beautiful masterpiece of songs from the heart that grow better and better with each listen. <br /> <br />5 years from now we'll all be sick of Vertigo and probably look at it as a \\"dated\\" track, but most of the other tracks on this album will continue to shine as classic U2 ballads and tunes that move the soul.  Yep, there's stuff on this album up to par with \\"With or Without You\\", \\"One\\", and \\"New Year's Day\\". <br /> <br />This is an excellent album; just don't buy it expecting 10 other songs like Vertigo.   <br /> <br />It's much better than that tune.
B000002MTU|5.0|Nothing like Eric Clapton covering the music he's loved all of his life.  A full-on blues album, that shows off Clapton's talents. <br /> <br />I think sometimes he might try to over sing, or as the review says, sing too much like the original artist.  But overall it's right on the money and you can hear the emotion Clapton has connected to these songs, and that it's his love.  His singing is so underrated even by himself. <br /> <br />Besides hearing a varied style of classic blues songs covered, we, of course, get some fiery guitar work all over the place. <br /> <br />If you like Clapton, the blues, guitar, great singing, or all of these it's an album you'll want to check out.  Most likely you won't be dissapointed.
B00005JM02|5.0|Whoever said this movie is bad definitly doesn't have a good taste in movies. <br />Great Family movie Two thumbs up!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|I can't tell you exactly what's so good about this film--it just IS!  It's funny, heart-warming, sweet, romantic, and all the rest.  It just makes you feel good!  Forget the reviewers talking about it being P.C., of left-wing, or whatever!  It's just a great, entertaining film that most people will love! <br />
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I like the theatrical version of this movie.  But, as a lifelong fan of Daredevil in the comic books, the Director's cut is not just more faithful to the source material, it's also a more cohesive film. <br /> <br />The added storyline with Coolio puts more focus on Matt (Ben Affleck) as a man, and how precariously he balances his life as a lawyer and as a vigilante.  The toning down of the Matt/Elektra romance makes the the love affair all the more tragic.  Jennifer Garner comes off much more believable as Elektra this time around because the love is unfulfilled.  The subplot with Fisk's lawyer lends more depth to how insulated Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan) really is, and some added footage, really lends to the Kingpin's cruel and violent nature.  The fight sequences have a much better flow now, Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) is more fleshed out as a character, and Foggy (Jon Favreau) Nelson's sense of humour is given more room. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a more satisfying version of the movie.  If you felt let down by Daredevil with the old version, give the Director's Cut a try.  As both a movie fan and a Daredevil fanatic, I am more than pleased by this release.
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|really there are better things that you can do with 2 hours and 40 minutes....read a book, rake your yard, call an old friend....on the other hand you can get poor acting, poor directing, a laughable script that will have you shaking your head by  watching Troy, you decide.
0385510438|1.0|This book is a boring yarn that I thought would never end.  It has no particular plot and just rambles away.  I fail to understand why the author thought that this might be interesting.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I notice a lot of people who reviewed this album and gave it one star listed their name as \\"a music fan\\"... well apparently not.  First of all, I believe most true music fans will enjoy this CD.  But everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I don't expect EVERYONE to love this album, and that's ok.  But it occurs to me that real music fans would spend more time listening to music they like and less time whining about what they don't.  And for all those \\"Wilco fans\\" who were disappointed with YHF... yeah, it's not 'AM' or 'Being There.'  Get over it.  If you bought this thinking it was going to be another 'AM', you're a moron.  Many bands evolve over time, and I hate people who cry about it.  If you don't like that Wilco has transformed from their beginnings, then don't buy the fu**ing album.  And for all those who bought the album based solely on critics' reviews, you are the biggest morons of them all.  You listen to what other people say, spend money on the CD, then cry when you don't like it.  Here's an idea: DON'T BUY A CD WITHOUT KNOWING ANY OF ITS CONTENTS.  All that being said, this is my fourth-favorite album of all time.  I am a Wilco fan, and enjoy all of their music from 'AM' to this one.  I do not mind that they have changed over the years, but if I did, I would rectify that by not purchasing their album.  Why?  Because I'm not a moron.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is really my favorite movie of all time.  The cinematography is amazing- it makes every frame in the movie a work of art. The story and the actors are incredible too. I can't believe this movie didn't win any of the academy awards it was nominated for; what a blatant injustice.
B0002IU988|4.0|Let's face it, even at their most meticulous moments, Creed never really ever escaped the comparisons to Led Zepplin, and even seemed to revel in them toward the end. When the band disbanded and the instrumental portion of the group teamed with ex-bandmate Brian Marshall and singer Myles Kennedy to form Alter Bridge, it seemed likely to most people that the band would continue what Creed left off with. Most people were wrong. While Alter Bridge will win no awards for originality on One Day Remains, they at least escape the specter of Creed as well as direct comparisons to any other band, Led Zepplin and otherwise. In fact, it's quite surprising to hear the band sound so capable and full of life, not just because they are newly formed, but also because they never sounded so good on anything Creed had done. Special attention must be given to guitarist Mark Tremonti, who demonstrates a skill on this album that nobody could have ever guessed from Creed's ballad and anthem-heavy albums. And while tracks like Open Your Eyes, Broken Wings, and In Loving Memory are well built to draw in old Creed fans, others like Find The Real, Metalingus, and Down To My Last show off the band's heavier nature, and allow Mark room to show off his guitar playing in an effective manner. Kennedy also shines on One Day Remains, bringing a different vocal style to the table than Scott Stapp but remaining powerful and strong throughout. In a world without Creed, Alter Bridge does not just fill the void, but destroys it. It's almost a curiosity Creed didn't disband sooner with an aftermath like this, and one can't help but be curious how Scott Stapp is going to continue his musical career in light of how well his former bandmates have made the transition. The next album will be hard to wait for.
B00066N8JS|5.0|Let's just say that Trent Reznor's Downward Spiral has affected me so intensely that I do plan on writing a college essay on it sometime in the future. It's that good. While the album is certainly not for everybody, mainly organized religion with such lyrics as \\"Your god is dead and no one cares, if there is a hell I'll see you there\\", it does present a rather broad and daring outlook on society's many facets, in such a beautifully twisted manner. With songs like \\"Closer\\" and \\"Big Man With a Gun\\", Reznor utilizes grotesque sexual metaphors to describe the daily rituals of a decaying world, in which he also sings of conversion and violation by machine. Although it is titled \\"The Downward Spiral\\", it is in fact more complex in its pacing, where it starts off from track 1 to 9 in a free-fall of anger, then the direct opposite is achieved, where the rise is more painful and unwanted then the fall itself, starting with \\"A Warm Place\\", a nice, quiet, haunting instrumental, and ends with \\"Hurt\\", capping the entire album off in such a fashion where it either leaves you dumbfounded or depressed for the rest of the day. I would recommend this to rock fans and intellectuals everywhere. 5 stars.    P.S. The second disc, while not as engrossing as the star attraction, is fun to listen to with tracks such as \\"Burn\\", \\"Dead Souls\\", and one of my personal favorites, \\"Closer(Precursor)\\" from the opening credit sequence of \\"Se7en\\". This rules!
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />U2 have dissapointed me by this unnecessary cocktail of their same sounds. The outcome ? The most annoying, safe and predictable U2 album they've ever made. Shameful. <br /> <br />Folks have been raving about how the lead single, \\"Vertigo,\\" brings back the classic U2 sound and energy. Yet aside from the ever-so-minute signature harmonics that The Edge once employed, the song doesn't sound even remotely as exhilarating as say \\"Electric Co.\\" or \\"Gloria\\" or even \\"I Will Follow,\\" just three songs that are not only quintessential U2, but represent the band at the height of their raw power. <br /> <br />Neverthless, given their place in the pop music pantheon, the concept of mediocrity does not exist for either their fans or many of their critics.  <br /> <br />Let's face it, U2's subsequent rise to global popularity did cost them their whole artistic creativity. In other words, they have sold out. <br /> <br />When all is said and done, this is a really average - better said below average - entry in the U2 catalog. The band, sadly, is beginning to show their age, with Bono's voice sounding a mite cracked and thin. And while the musicianship is tight, the resulting riffs and rhythms are nothing to write home about.  <br /> <br />Songs like Sometimes, One step Closer, Original Of species, Love And Peace, A Man And A Woman, etc, are borderline unlistenable. <br /> <br />With HTDAAB, this sold out U2 seems to laugh in the face of classic U2 while all the while trying to recreate it and update it again and again. <br /> <br />Overall this album shows an oversaturate sold out band showing how badly have they aged. Words like originality and innovation are keeping away from this LP.  <br /> <br />The only remaining things that appears clearly on this album ( again ) are Bono's glasses and screaming face, iPod, propaganda, Edge's signatures and the brand name U2. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00002MZ4W|5.0|&lt;u>When the Pawn&lt;/u> <br /> <br /> <br />The full title of this album is: &lt;u>When The Pawn Hits The Conflicts He Thinks Like A King What He Knows Throws The Blows When He Goes To The Fight And He'll Win The Whole Thing `Fore He Enters The Ring There's No Body To Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand And Remember That Depth Is The Greatest Of Heights And If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where To Land And If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right.&lt;/u>  The songs contained on the album however are in fact, as ambitious as the title.  &lt;u>When the Pawn&lt;/u> more than fulfills the promises made on &lt;u>Tidal&lt;/u>: The promises of an adventurous female musician for what was then the coming millenium who would exceed every expectation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The album starts in familiar territory with, \\"On the Bound.\\"  It almost sounds like &lt;u>Tidal, Redux&lt;/u>: a heavy pounding piano, with a flute-like sound over the top - all quite standard.  But with a finer ear, it's clear that this isn't the same old Apple album: the drum is infinitely more inventive as evidenced by the first few beats where all that is playing is said drum part.  The abrupt shift between verse and chorus is very familiar, a la Criminal, but to get back to the verse Apple uses a very interesting technique.  Having built up quite a head of steam on her chorus of \\"You're all I need,\\" suddenly the instrumentals drop to a few lone plinks on the piano: <br />\\"And maybe some faith would <br />Do me good\\" <br />The lyrics to \\"On the Bound\\" are a little difficult to follow at first.  They're difficult to comprehend at second.  But to Apple they must mean something for she sings them with great conviction and they fit seamlessly with the music. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Limp\\" is an Angry song.  The title comes from a phrase in the chorus: <br />It won't be long till you'll be <br />Lying limp in your own hand <br />Geeze.  Wonder what that's about, now doncha?  It is a fabulous song, following the traditional alternative pattern laid down by the Pixies: soft verses, pounding chorus- and does this chorus ever pound.  If you'll love \\"Limp\\" for anything it'll be the tangible rage in the chorus: <br /> <br />And when I think of it, my fingers turn to fists <br />I never did anything to you, man <br />But no matter what I try <br />You'll beat me with your bitter lies <br />So call me crazy, hold me down <br />Make me cry; get off now, baby- <br />It won't be long till you'll be <br />Lying limp in your own hand\\" <br />Listening to the track, the image of lips curled into a sneer of absolute derision and scorn is more than clearly visible.  It's a creative song though above all, and doesn't retread old ground. Example: \\"You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />The fourth track, \\"Love Ridden\\" is absolutely, my song.  It opens with such a striking analogy, it caputres attention the way the first sentance of a narrative has to, but so few pop songs do: \\"Love ridden, I've looked at you /With the focus I gave to my birthday candles.\\" \\"Love Ridden\\" is a supurbly written piece, like nothing I've heard.  The movement of the piano makes the melody wash over one's very soul, but Apple's voice leaps and flies - not only in the context of notes, but in great blossoming crescendos - Apple is undoubtedly a master of the vocal phrase.  I don't think that anyone expresses more eloquently the complexity of letting go: <br />I want your warm, but it will only make <br />Me colder when it's over, <br />So I can't tonight, baby <br />No, not \\"baby\\" anymore - if I need you <br />I'll just use your simple name <br />Only kisses on the cheek from now on <br />And in a little while, we'll only have to wave <br />No one has said it better and I don't think anyone will surpass Apple for succinctness in this department. No, not \\"baby\\" anymore... \\"Love Ridden\\" is absolutely a perfectly crafted song.  <br /> <br /> <br />As much as I love \\"Love Ridden,\\" I love \\"Paper Bag\\" more.  The title comes from a particularly artistic line: \\"I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag.\\"  That line is more than a throw-away, more than something to fit the meter: that is a metaphor for life.  Musically, this piece is a work of jazz for the new millenium.  Labling this 'alternative rock' is incredibly narrow, from tha spiffy snare drum sound to the vocal noodlings (\\"I said, 'Honey, I don't feel so good\\") this tune is more Gershwin than Garbage.  Once again, what makes the song an absolute delight is Apple's skill as a lyricist.  The very clever turn, \\"... he said /'It's all in your head,' and I said, 'So's everything'/ but he didn't get it...\\" is nothing short of wickedly memorable.   The refrain to Paper Bag is every bit as witty as the verses, but with a serious emotional weight: <br />Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills <br />'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up <br />I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold <br />Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Fast As You Can\\" is the album's single.  It's a decision that I suppose was justifiable, although, I would've picked \\"Paper Bag\\".  \\"Fast As You Can\\" opens like \\"On the Bound\\" with a short, interesting, ethnically-influenced drum solo that continues through the song layered with an almost \\"dance\\" beat.  It's inventive, it's new - but it's very accesible. On the chorus, Apple makes skillful use of double-tracking, again acheiving an erie effect with an overused technique. The lyrics are remarkable when compared to those of other artists, but not in regards to the rest of the album. <br /> <br /> <br />And the rest of the album?  The rest of the album is great.  Unlike &lt;u>Tidal&lt;/u>, the end of this masterpiece doesn't flag in the slightest. \\"The Way Things Are\\" manages to be anthemic, in an odd way, and \\"Get Gone\\" is a perfect illustration of why Apple wears the crown of Angriest Chick of the Nineties (\\"It's time the truth was out that he don't give a / ---- about me\\") and \\"I Know\\" wraps the album up in a calm blusy manner  This album gets a solid five out of five. <br /> <br />Five what you say? <br />&lt;div align=\\"center\\">Five Journals of Angsty Feministic Lyrics.&lt;/div>
6302860253|2.0|This offering got off on the wrong foot with me with the gratuitous begining scene of an innocent bull being tortured in a bull ring.Opera is a total experience but rests firmly on the conductor and the singers, those requirements are  not met here, <br />the visual effects of the on location shoot do not compensate for the mediocre totality. If you are going to own one visual Carmen, let it be the 1982 Baltsa/Carreras, if you are primarily interested in the vocal performance then you must own 1964 Callas/Gedda (finest Don Jose ever)on CD, or the De Los Angeles/Gedda (forgotten performance date)Domingo gives a far more vocally convincing performance in the Covent Garden production w/ Denyce Graves, who not only presents herself well but can also sing.
0767802470|5.0|A superb movie. It is interesting to note that the German crew considered the Royal Navy to be their greatest threat and not the American navy, I suppose it will be only a matter of time befor Hollywood rewrites the story in the same way that it rewrites history to cater for its home audience (U571)
B00003CXE7|5.0|Definitely a great epic movie, Gladiator, brings to the screen the story of the Roman general Maximus, as he seeks revenge against the Roman emperor for the killing of his family and the injustices that have been done against him. <br />The story starts with an AMAZING battle against the barbarians in Germania, in which the Roman legions are victorious.   <br />Maximus' quest takes us from Rome to North Africa and back all the while providing an extraordinary plot along with some great scenery.  <br />The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical adventures after a long dormant period. <br />Needless to say, Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character who as Emperor Commodus, steals the show! <br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />Arenas, Battles, and swordfights are all about.   <br />In short, it is a movie worth watching! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|One part of me loved this movie - good action, kept me fully engrossed. Even enjoyed the small love story between Achilles and Briseis. LOVED Eric Bana as Hector - I thought he brought so much to the role. <br />And then the other part of me hated it. I have always loved the story of Troy, so seeing it butchered in this way broke my heart and made me yell angrily at the screen. They completely glossed over the fact the ACHILLES WAS INSANE AND A SPOILED BULLY TO BOOT!! They made him into a tragic hero, which I understand is Hollywood, but it still bothered me.  <br />And so I give this film 3 stars. If you haven't read the Iliad or Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"Firebrand\\" (which is the best of all adaptions, if I may say), then you'll love this movie.
B0006V6TMG|4.0|If you like live recordings, this is a very good one for the most part. For me personally, I don't enjoy the sound of yelling and applause when I listen to music at home or in my car. It is just not the same as being there (DVDs do a much better job of preserving a live performance's excitement). I admire Jesse Cook's guitar work and writing ability very much, especially his first four CDs. He is my favorite guitar player, and I have nothing but respect and admiration for him.  <br /> <br />I saw him perform live very shortly after this recording was made but with a much smaller and more modest version of the band (Art Avalos, Kevin LaLiberte , Chris Church, and a female vocalist who's name escapes me). It was one of the very best concert experiences I have had. This recording at times lacks that intimacy that I remember. But for the most part, it captures the feeling and beauty of the music as I recall it performed live. Of course Jesse's guitar work is exceptional and the band is always terrific.  <br /> <br />I did not understand the necessity of adding Danny Wilde's vocals later for \\"Fall at Your Feet\\", and personally I found it distracting knowing it was done that way. When I saw them perform this song live, they performed it without any electronic amplification. Chris Church and the very talented female vocalist (not Maryem Tollar as on this recording) did an outstanding job of singing and the feeling was beautiful, intimate and real. Nevertheless, it sounds beautiful on this recording. I cannot say enough about Chris Church's beautiful violin playing, he truly is a wonderful and inspired musician.  <br /> <br />The only other pet peeve I have about this recording is when Jesse gets going very fast in those blazing parts of the solos; the pickup on the guitar that he uses for live performance just does not handle it too well! The tonality becomes drowned out by the percussive sound of the striking of the strings. I noticed this when I saw him live and thoughtit was a shame. Does Jesse mean for this to be the case?? Otherwise, his playing is outstanding and full of emotion. At times I have to just stop what I am doing and listen.  <br /> <br />All in all, I feel that if you are a Jesse Cook fan, this CD is a must for your collection. If you have never heard his music before, buy Tempest, Gravity, Vertigo, or Free Fall first.  <br />
B000003TAL|5.0|Daydream Nation is Sonic Youth's ultimate high point. This record is from 1986, but it sounds completely timeless. You can play this today for someone and they won't be able to tell you what year or even decade it's from. <br /> <br />Teenage Riot kicks off the disc and is almost the disc's highlite. Kim's singing actually sounds like well, singing and not her usually speak or gutteral yowl. Even the Lee tracks are listenable too and don't feel like some sort of poetry add-on. <br /> <br />Basically if you appreciate creative music in any form, you must own this disc.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|Moving to a major label didn't affect At the Drive-In's sound any. If anything, the only thing different between \\"In Casino Out\\" and \\"Relationship of Command\\" is that there may be one or two lesser tracks on \\"ROC,\\" but this band still rocks out with intense, righteous anger like nobody else, just check out \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" and \\"Pattern Against User\\" for proof. It was kind of surreal hearing Iggy Pop sing on an ATDI song (\\"Rolodex Propoganda,\\") but after a while, the Igster's vocal cameo seems less forced and more gratuitous. This is still a regularly-played album in my record collection, but the only reason why I didn't give it five stars is that it didn't have the same life-changing immediacy of \\"In Casino Out.\\" Impressive, nonetheless, though.
B000002HD5|5.0|If you own only one Whigs record, this must be the one. While Black Love has greater sonic production values, Duhli's lyrical torment is really at it's peak here. <br /> <br />Notice his repeating of lines on tracks 1 and 4 (and again on Black Love). The same sort of slinky wanna-be-soul style exists in Duhli's singing and the band's backing him up with their greasy rhythms. <br /> <br />Duhli's pain is plenty evident as he sings \\"You say that I'm afraid of girls. Well maybe so, but I'm not afraid of you\\" on  -What Jail Is Like - The female vocalist on My Curse really brings the pain home too.  <br /> <br />The closing instrumental doesn't quite do the right job of finishing the album, but that doesn't stop this one from getting a 5. <br />
B00006JL1Z|4.0|This is a well-chosen lot of songs that surpasses the 1988 Greatest Hits collection by far, by including many lesser known but equally important songs. One of the best things about this CD is that it does not flow in chronological order - the song list is arranged to complement the previous and next song, giving the CD a more artsy feel and sound. <br /> <br />It is my estimation that no \\"Greatest Hits\\" or \\"Very Best Of\\" will please every listener - especially these days, no matter who the artist is. Since the advent of CDs in the mid to late 80s the concept of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" album has changed. Before that time, the Greatest Hits Of... was really a Greatest Hits album with no filler and no new tracks. Since then, record companies can release \\"Greatest Hits\\" after \\"Greatest Hits\\", leaving off certain chart hits and including others, forcing fans to buy all the semi-Greatest Hits releases to get all the hit songs. This set is a must though for casual fans. <br /> <br />Though all the hits seem to be here with Fleetwood Mac, there are a few glaring, unfortunate recordings that should not be here. Lindsay Buckingham's live \\"Go Insane\\" is just horrible. And I cringe when I hear \\"Skies The Limit\\", from their unfortunate early 90s AC effort \\"Behind The Mask\\", as they all sound old, tired and ready to retire. These cuts really do damage to the overall quality of the entire CD and without them, I would have given the CD 5 stars. <br /> <br />Those unfortunate songs excluded, this is a great CD. All their 70s work is classic and sounds superb. The songs that made them (\\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\") are fun to listen to, yet it is their lesser known album tracks included here that really make this listenable. Stevie Nicks is a superb songwriter and it shows with the haunting \\"Storms\\" that closes out disc one. Her \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and \\"Gypsy\\" are finely crafted, equally attention grabbing songs. Christine McVie has a pretty voice that shines on \\"Songbird\\", \\"Over My Head\\" and \\"Little Lies\\". Also key on here are the rockers \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Second Hand News\\" and \\"Think About Me\\". <br /> <br />Fleetwood Mac is a classic example of a band's individuals with personal turmoil creating art out of their misery. Though their 90s output was far inferior to their introspective 70s and 80s recordings, they continue to endure. The classic #1 hits may have cemented their reputation as legends but their lesser known, interior-seeking, dark, exposed nerve-ending songs made their overwhelming success seem human and real to the rest of us mere mortals.
0393035158|4.0|I just finished \\"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason\\" by Sam Harris.  The book was generally fascinating although he lost me in the Eastern mysticism chapter.  His main point, of course, is that many of the worst atrocities in history have been caused by folks' belief in things for which there is no evidence.  He states, but makes too little a point of, the fact that interpersonal ethics and morality should (and would, without religion) arise from our common humanity.  Perhaps we can extend that to say that ethical treatment of all animals, including ourselves, should arise from our common DNA.  At any rate, the book is very well written and tells us the problem without much of a practical plan for the solution.  It is a good starting point for the discussions humanity needs to have.
B000089CJI|5.0|Half way through I knew this was my favorite album of the year. I can't say I'm a fan of synth pop, but this goes beyond conventional categories and genres. While, I wouldn't mind hearing these songs done with some real instruments (more strings and less keyboards), the music never disappoints and, instead, provides the perfect backdrop for the real star of the show: Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie.  <br /> <br />I am not a fan of the emo scene, but I think I'm going to rush out and buy all the DCfC discography as soon as I finish this review. Gibbard is a terrific songwriter and it shows on Give Up. His lyrics are fun, catchy, clever and yet still have depth and substance. No random lines and rhymes. All of Gibbard's songs seem painstakingly written, yet sound effortless, like its no more an excercise than blinking to write a great, thoughtful pop song.  <br /> <br />With lyrics that make me laugh and ponder within the same breath, an almost ethereal, soothing voice (especially for a male), and sweeping, beautiful (albeit Nintendo-fied) musical landscapes, Give Up is sure to be an all time favorite.
B000244FDW|5.0|This is the most faithful production of the Jane Austen classic. <br />Great acting throughout. Contrary to some reviewers comments, the acting was not stiff, but accurate to the culture of the time. The A&E version was nice, but too \\"watered down\\" or \\"dumbed down\\". Moreover, in the A&E version, much of Austen's best dialogue was changed, IMHO, if you cant improve it, leave it alone. This version is the standard to judge the other versions of Pride and Prejudice.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Holy Smokes! There are more than 150 movies released in HK per year, and this one was the # 1 at the box office for the entire year! Isn't that something! People must be starving on special effects and anorexic of good storyline. I gave 1 star for this movie, and the other star is for Jake Gyllenhaal for having the courage to do a career-suicide movie. I mean I totally loved him in The Good Girl(Jennifer Aniston), and I am stunned that he did this movie. It's got more special effects than human characters. Even Dennis Quaid is in It! I mean he just did his career revival Far From Heaven less than 2 year ago, and now he adds this to his resume. It's as bad as Twister, and not as good as Deep Impact or Ammagedon. After some 20 minutes of seeing the disaster on earth, the story and the special effects started to go downhill. This is probably last year's Battlefield Earth, but it didn't lose any money. I am glad I just rented it, and not bought it or paid a regular admission at the cinema.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Released in 1968, Pink Floyd's second album, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" shows the band in a transitional period. Singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett was ousted from the band due to his LSD use & erratic behavior (though the Floyd still allow him a final appearance at the album's end). Taking Syd's place was singer/guitarist David Gilmour, while bassist Roger Waters picked up the bulk of the songwriting duties, along with a pair of contributions from keyboardist Richard Wright. Some have criticized \\"Saucerful\\" as being a mixed bag, but I say that's total nonsense, because I've always loved this album. Roger Waters branches out as a songwriter very well with his trio of trippy psychedelic rock songs, \\"Let There Be More Light,\\" \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,\\" and the very amusing \\"Corporal Clegg\\" (representing the first of Waters' various war-themed songs, though this particular tune is done with humor, including a solo on kazoo). Richard Wright delivers a fine pair of atmospheric songs, \\"Remember A Day\\" and \\"See-Saw.\\" But the big centerpiece of the album is the 11-minute title track, an avant-garde, three-part instrumental in which the Floyd give the listener the aural equivalent of a war. The first part is the tension build-up, the middle section is the war (with drummer Nick Mason's tribal percussion loop, Gilmour running his guitar up and down a microphone stand, Waters repeatedly smashing a gong, and Wright pounding his piano senseless), and the final part is the release, the calm after the battle. It's an amazing piece, one of Pink Floyd's best, and it points in the musical direction that the Floyd would take on future releases.But it is Syd Barrett who gets the final, haunting word on \\"Saucerful\\" with his Pink Floyd swansong, \\"Jugband Blues,\\" recorded just before his exit from the band, and which the Floyd rightfully saved for release on \\"Saucerful Of Secrets.\\" The song---featuring some very twisted lyrics and a cameo by a Salvation Army band---may indeed represent Barrett's tragic fall into dementia, but he still sings it with tremendous feeling, and no diehard Floyd fan will ever forget Barrett's final, jarring line, \\"And what exactly is a joke?\\". \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" is a terrific Pink Floyd album.
B000002UA2|5.0|Seriously, this album is the epitome of that Pink Floyd sound.  If you liked DSOTM but felt that it's production made it seem gimmicky, look no further than Obscured by Clouds.  First off, the songwriting is brilliant.  More importantly, however, is David Gilmour's guitar work; it is crisp, and clean, and it leaves a satisfying feeling that lasts.  There isn't a bad song on the album either.  Sometimes DSOTM gets to be too much, and in those distinct occasions, Obscured by Clouds is my album of choice.
B000000H6D|4.0|<br />There are two versions of \\"Bloody Kisses\\" floating around out there. There's the controversial European version (which got the band pegged as neo-nazis in Europe and Britain) which has two additional tracks (\\"We Hate Everyone\\" and \\"Kill All The White People\\") and a different track listing. <br />Then there's the American version which has additional tracks (\\"Cant Lose You\\" and \\"Suspended in Dusk\\") and a different track listing.  <br />As far as I can tell, Amazon and most retail stores don't carry the \\"other\\" version of Bloody Kisses. But if you can get your hands on that version, it is definitely worth it. \\"We Hate Everyone\\" is a friggin' hilarious up yours to the bands critics and showcases the overlooked sense of humor of Peter Steele.  <br />Also missing from the American CD is the famous \\"machine f*ck* opening.  <br />Having said that, all my favorites are on here. The title track, \\"Christian Woman\\", \\"Black No. 1\\", \\"Too Late: Frozen\\" and the rest. This is a cracking good album whichever version you're listening to. The American version just seems a tad bit incomplete.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb of God are officially my faveourite band out there, and this is my faveourite album. If you like metal at all then you should have this album anyway, and if you don't then I don't quite see why not, it's incredible. The guitars are so fast in some of the songs and the breakdowns are some of the best ever recorded. Here's an individual track review: <br /> <br />Ruin: My faveourite song ever, there's nothing I would change about this song. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />As the Palaces Burn: Another great song, but a little weedy. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Purified: A good song with a pretty neat solo. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />11th Hour: Most people's faveourite Lamb of God track and a certain classic, but not as good as Ruin in my eyes. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />For Your Malice: A bit of a duff one, but still not bad. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />Boot Scraper: This one has no rythym at all, which is a nice touch. Has superb vocals and some weird guitar stuff going on. <br />9/10 <br /> <br />A Devil in God's Country: This is OK, nothing more. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />In Defense of Our Good Name: Better than the last song, but not really a stand out track. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />Blood Junkie: I love this song, it has so many different elements to it. You must listen to this as one of the samples amazon offers. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Vigil: I like the slow beginning which then explodes with Randy's vocals and then a nice opening guitar chord from Willie. I always liked this song because it best shows the guitars and drums working together. <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Just click on a couple of the samples of the songs I gave ten, if you don't like them I'll be dissapointed. Any true metalhead should lap this album up with joy.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Roger Ebert actually called this movie a tie as the worst film of the year next to Alexandre. I don't see where it's that bad at all though. Brad Pitt looks better in the part of his character than Colin Farrel does in Alexandre. He's no Russel Crowe in Gladiator but still I think he does fine in the part. It's just hard to root for his character though because he's clearly fighting for the wrong team. He just wants to go down in history as a great warrior pretty much so can really careless who he's fighting.  He has no real desire to fight in a war that's mostly over a women but he is in it just for the victory and fame and...his ego. He changes a little but still he still chooses to fight on the wrong side and to kill nice innocent people.<br /><br />  The trailers make Eric Bana (Black Hawk Down) look bad and  Brad Pitt's character look like this great hero but really it's the other way around. Eric Bana plays this passionate guy who's just really fighting to defend his family and Kingdom. Pitt is just fighting for him and the glory eventhough he does have a heart in there somewhere. He never gets you to care for him as much as you do for Russel Crowe in Gladiator.  Bana even makes your care for him more and is a lot more likeable than Pitt is.<br /><br />  The supporting cast is fantastic too, Brian Coxx  (X-Men 2, Manhunter) plays a crazed leader who wants to just conquare Troy. He doesn't care that his brother's wife left him for the prince of Troy and isn't fighting because of that. Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) is fine as the Prince of Troy who's love is too strong for Helen to allow her to go back to avoid war. Peter O'Toole is also excellent as the King of Troy who just wanted peace. He shows he can still act and I think he should even be nominated for Best Supporting actor. Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings) is also good in a small role as Pitt's friend who gets him to go into battle with him. Movies like this always show that he deserves better than to be always casted as a villain from  Ireland in bad movies. The movie is  very involving with great sword-play and intense battles. Just have to be able to sit through good people getting killed a lot and the movie dragging on a little.o be always casted as a villain from  Ireland in bad movies.

B00005JN4F|2.0|The 2004 US version 'Taxi' looks almost like a blurred copy of its original, 1998 French comedy of the same title.  The original became a hit series, spawning two sequels 'TAXI 2' and 'TAXI 3,' and this remake.  The difference is that the new story is set in New York City, and the taxi driver is played by Queen Latifah, Oscar-nominee of 'Chicago.'    <br /> <br />French filmmaker Luc Besson (who directed 'The Fifth Element') produced both films (and wrote the original's script too), and let me be honest with you, his writing is far from an original or inspired one, but the original was an often funny buddy-buddy film with one fast MALE driver and one MALE bumbling cop. <br /> <br />For American version, which someone thought should be more ethnically-diversed, Latifah plays a NWC taxi driver Bell, into whose car a 'good-cop-but-worst-driver' Washburn (SNL's Jimmy Fallon) stumbles, in order to chase the four bank robbers.  Of course, as he is a bumbling cop, the results are just  disasterous ... a bad sign for the film itself. <br /> <br />Anyway they will team up to catch them, to redeem his pride and her car (and perhaps money), and we see in the next 90 minutes the bantering between Latifah and Fallon, plus some obligatory love interest from Jenniffer Esposito (as Fallon's boss and ex), and the guest appearance from Ann-Margret as Fallon's mom. <br /> <br />SO many formulas, you might say.  But the original WAS very formulaic, so anyway the director Tim Story ('Barbershop') has no chance from the beginning.  At least, the original (which I saw several times) had used them better way, letting the actors show their likable sides, making the pair very amusing.  Though the two leads in the US version are likable and affable enough here too, their characters look more forced and elaborated in New York City.  (Did you see a taxi running like racing car  there?) <br /> <br />The worst thing is, however, the portraits of the bank robbers, whose gun-holding Brazilian supermodel-like characters are way too ridiculous even in this escapist entertainment.  And know know, model-turned-actress Gisele Bunschen driving BMW?  Like 100 mph?  Even more embarrassing is a 'body-search' scene between Esposito and Bunchen, which looks like a footage from pay-per-view TV. <br /> <br />Not everything is bad, I say.  Car stunts are good though some might think the original did it better.  Still, considering the more crowded urban streets, the stunts are as good as the ones in the French one.  And the end credits which feature the outtakes are very funny, which means that you have to wait for them to see the funniest part, though.   <br /> <br />Looking at these recycled materials, I cannot help feeling that if someone is holding back the US release of the original (even on DVDs), he does it intentionally to have us see this inferior one.  Wait for the release of the French version -- hope they will someday -- which is far better, I can assure you. <br /> <br />And M. Besson, please let no more remakes happen.  Did you really give OK to remake your noir masterpiece 'La Femme Nikita' which became ... er ... a weak copycat 'Point of No Return'?
B000088E6D|4.0|This young fella has an absolutely beautiful voice.  Big band fans will hate me for saying this but I would like him to sing without such loud noise in the background. I would rather concentrate on his heavenly voice.  The LOUD racket the band makes is too distracting and overpowering. New music with maybe just a quiet piano or guitar in the background, and this guy would have gotten 10 stars from me.
0767834739|3.0|If you dug the first Resident Evil film, you'll most likely dig Resident Evil: Apocalypse even more.  Taking place right after the end of the first film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself allied with a few survivors as they try to escape Raccoon City and the unending zombie onslaught.  Paul W.S. Anderson, who had directed the first film, wrote this sequel which is capably directed by first timer Alexander Witt.  The bigger budget allows for better special effects, a more expansive environment, and the appearance of fan favorite video game monster Nemesis.  Video game characters Jill (the oh so hot Sienna Guillory) and Carlos (The Mummy's Oded Fehr) are introduced, and the solid cast is rounded out by Mike Epps, Jared Harris, and Thomas Kretschmann.  However, Apocalypse is really nothing too special, and at times it is quite predictable, although the twist ending is a nice touch, and the door is left open (again) to another sequel.  It's not a waste of film as Roger Ebert described it as upon it's release, but it will depend on the viewer whether or not this is worth a look.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I bought this cd, I thought it was just going to be ok.  I had listened to Inertiatic ESP, Drunkship of Lanterns, and Televators on Mars Volta's site and I only really loved Inertiatic ESP.  But when I got the album, by within a week I was hooked.  Mars Volta is now probably my second favorite band next to Coheed and Cambria. I think I like bands that have high voiced singers. <br />    I don't see how anyone can hate Cedric Bixler's voice if you have this cd.  If you looked into the cd and listened to clips of them, you would know he has a high voice and you shouldn't have even bought the cd in the first place. <br />    I love this cd and I'm gonna have to say I think the Mars Volta is 100 times better than At The Drive In.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have ever listened to in my entire life. It might even be the absolute best album ever. Not one moment throughout the course of the album is less than wonderfully riveting. <br /> <br /> The title track and opening song is a fiesty pop-punk revolt against the Bush administration. I'll admit, it's reflective of Green Day's past songs, but it's a formula that works for them. Until you hear the rest of the CD and realize just how good this group truly is. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is an amazing, epic 5-part wonder that introduces you to the album's main character. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is a song that I'd venture to say everyone on the planet can relate to at some time or another. It tells of feelings of loneliness and alienation. \\"Are We The Waiting\\" is a Queen-style song, a very pretty, slow song that almost made me want to cry. It relays to the listener such a loss of hope for Jesus of Suburbia, which I think a lot of people can identify with. \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" is about Jesus of Suburbia's first adventure with drugs, I believe, and it captures that essence very well - the feeling of starting something new that you're relying on to improve your life. The actual music part of \\"She's A Rebel\\" entices you into being intrigued by Whatsername (Jesus of Suburbia's \\"love interest\\"), the exact same job it does for the main character. \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" reminds me of 1960's pop, which Green Day spruces up a bit. \\"Letterbomb\\" is also reminiscent of Green Day's past songs, but like \\"American Idiot\\", it just plain suits them. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is another ballad, sort of like \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\\". It made me think about Robert Frost's poem \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\"....a sort of reminder that good things have a hard time lasting. \\"Homecoming\\" is the other 5-part song on this album, and while it's not quite as good as \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\", it's still pretty great. The last song on the disc is \\"Whatsername\\", where Jesus of Suburbia \\"wonders how Whatsername has been\\". <br />[I didn't mention \\"Holiday\\" or \\"St. Jimmy\\".] <br /> <br /> This album is a bold, giant step forward for today's music industry. It should definitely be the new standard set for rock music. \\"American Idiot\\" made me laugh, cry, and beam with pride for Green Day, because they show the world on this album that they are the epitome of great music. It's a perceptive, thought-provoking outlook on our American society. The amazing lyrics and perfect instrumentation made me proud to be a Green Day fan. And even if you aren't a Green Day fan, I still recommend this album. It is truly fantastic.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I will start by saying that i really enjoyed this film. While untrue to the Illiad, it does not stop it from being a good movie. The action and CGI were phenomenal with interesting angles and ideas. The acting was great also. Brad Pitt is a somewhat hard sell as Achilles at first but you grow to believe his portrayal and care about him. Orlando Bloom was perfect as the wimpy and arrogant Paris that you loved to hate. But the showstopper performance would have to go to Eric Bana in his flawless role as Hector. It's hard to describe, you just have to see it. <br />The best scene of the entire movie is the showdown between Achilles and Hector because Peterson directed it in a such a way that the tension is palpable. Also the audience has grown to care for both characters and you almost dont want them to fight each other. <br />The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars is because of the abundance of cheesy, cliche one-liners that are spewed from the mouths of the lead characters, particularly Brad Pitt. Believe me he is no Braveheart. When he points his sword towards the enemy and bellows to his soldiers: \\"Immortality is yours, take it!\\", you almost laugh at his false emotion instead of becoming pumped and anxious. <br />Overall, this is an exceptional movie where the good mostly outweighs the bad.
B0000009SY|5.0|I've had this album for many years, and I've loved most if not all of the songs.  My favorite, however, is \\"Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?\\".  Being a former classical musician (viola, bassoon, and eight more instruments), a conductor, a composer, and transcriber, I recongnize the tight construction of this song.  Matter of fact, I always wanted to orchestrate this song for full-tilt chorus and orchestra, in a florid operatic style, with a baritone solo (Joe, of course).  This song is written and structured in such a way that it is like an operatic aria, so it would be, I think, a natural orchestration.   <br /> <br />Of course, everyone would probably be offended, especially the stuffy classical music types, but I learned a long time ago that nobody else's opinion matters, anyway... :)
1556347308|5.0|Steve Jackson Games split the 4th edition Basic manual into two books, the Characters book and the Campaign book.  Characters provides everything you need to know about creating a character while Campaigns provides the information needed to run a campaign.  I didn't like splitting the book when I first heard about the concept but I have to admit that it makes sense now that I've read both books.  This book is an extremely ambitious undertaking, even bigger than Characters, and putting the two together would have made the system too big, expensive, and difficult to easily digest.    The Campaigns book is probably the single best rules editing job I've ever seen.  The best example is probably the evolution of the combat system.  GURPS 3rd edition combat *sprawled*, the GM had to pick and choose which of the two sets of combat rules and which of the optional rules he wanted to use.  Then he'd frequently regret his choices when he wanted something to happen that required rules he hadn't chosen to use.  As a result, when I GM'd I used a fairly simple hybrid of GURPS, D&D, and Rolemaster rules (simpler than they sound) that got to the intent of the rules but was adaptable enough to do what I wanted.  I tried using the GURPS combat rules several times but just couldn't quite make them work.    Combat now works beautifully.  Somebody over at SJ Games took that massive mishmash of rules and beat it into a rules set that is breathtakingly simple but does everything required.  I recommend buying the book for the combat system alone but that's not all!  Believe it or not, everything is like the combat system!    Folks, this is the most streamlined set of rules I've seen since AD&D 1.0 and it covers everything in greater detail and realism than AD&D ever did.  There are frequent examples that clarify the fine points.  The artwork is frequent, interesting, and in color.  The book is extremely well organized and has a good (but not great) index and the production quality is WAY higher than you get in all those d20 books.    In short, this is a remarkable evolution in the GURPS system and I STRONGLY recommend this book for frustrated GM's of all varieties.  There's sure to be a little something here for everybody if you only look for it.
B00004TWZF|5.0|This film is absolutely a must see for anyone who as an affinity for the water. <br /> <br />I first saw the American version of this film in the late '80s.  During that time I was diving along the Pacific Coast of So. California almost everyday as a part of my career.  Though the main character is a free diver, to this day I have never seen a movie that represented the underwater experience so well.  I was visually astounded . <br /> <br />I am amazed that The Big Blue hasn't become a bigger cult hit.  Anyone that I've ever spoken to, who has seen the film (and that is very few), was blown away. <br /> <br />I have watched for broadcasts of The Big Blue on cable for years and have never seen it.  It's ashame that more people have not been exposed to this film. <br /> <br />I agree with some of the other reviewers about the music on the Director's Cut, however, just turn down the sound and I guarantee you will be visually mesmerized.  Also, like other reviewers, I wish the American version was included on the DVD.  <br /> <br />Again...for anyone who loves the water...this is a must see!!  <br /> <br />
B00003CX95|5.0|Since the first time I've seen this movie in 1996 and I consider it one of the best movies although the copy that I watched was a VHS censored copy. The first time I watched the full copy was when I bought the DVD special edition of it last year.<br /><br />The story is so powerful and although it was a typical story about the battle between good and evil but the fighting scenes were the biggest of that time and they were simply amazing. Of course if you try to watch this movie after watching a movie like Matrix. well, you will feel that Braveheart is a kid movie and the tricks in the fighting scenes are so obvious and done poorly. My advice to anyone watching this movie is to enjoy the story line instead of concentrating on the special effects.<br /><br />Another important point about the movie is that it can't reflect an accurate or even near view of what actually happened to Wallace. Reading a little in history or watching some of the programs about this man's life will make you ask the question 'was this man a hero after all?'. Anyway, the history is as good and as bad as who writes it want it to be. so enjoy the movie and just don't take its events as historical facts.
7119005901|4.0|\\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is possibly the most famous and important novel in classic Chinese literature.  Not only is it the earliest of the \\"Four Great Books\\" (as evidenced by its more archaic language), but it created a complete cultural phenomenon whose impact is still fresh today -- just ask all the young people today who, without having read a word of the book, still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei.  And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book, which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji?<br /><br />I'd read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old, so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text.  On approaching this translation, what I find is a well done, respectful and informative translation that doesn't quite nail the tone of the original text, but will be a good read for modern readers who don't read Chinese.<br /><br />And to be honest, Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English.  Just the fact that subjects, articles and pronouns are often omitted from a sentence is enough to cause nightmares for a Chinese-English translator.  And even by Chinese standards, The Three Kingdoms is a work whose linguistic economy is staggering.  In one page, this book can convey the deaths of half a dozen characters, three to four battles, multiple schemes, and include four or five \\"tribute\\" poems, to boot.  Such is the style of this work, and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English.  And he has done the job remarkably, for though I don't think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language (the question is, also, whether that would have been possible), his translation makes a good read, and strives to be faithful to the original text, down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the \\"tribute\\" poems which frequent the book.  This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained.<br /><br />There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted, or diluted by the language barrier.  Obviously, I'm not a Chinese professor (as Prof. Roberts is), but as a native speaker, I felt his translations sometimes didn't quite hit the mark.  For example, in the original text, one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant \\"deception\\" or \\"guile\\", but Prof. Roberts adapted it to \\"craft\\", which dilutes the disapproving tone of the original.  When Yuan Shao refused aid to Liu Bei on account of his son's illness, his advice to the messenger was \\"if he is in trouble, he may seek refuge with me\\", which suggests patronage, not \\"find refuge north of the river\\", which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography.  These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs, but as a Chinese native speaker and reader, one who has grown up with this text and re-read the book hundreds of times, I still find the translation a little off.  There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language -- the translation is modern, not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text.  This may be a good point, however, since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book that's very difficult to read.  I think Prof. Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity, a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation.<br /><br />Again, the question is whether an English translation (or any other translation) could ever be accurate in this way to the original.  Personally, I do think many of the discrepancies in meaning could have been avoided, or ameliorated.  However, as aforementioned, for a reader who's never read the original, this issue won't affect his/her enjoyment of the text.  Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration, and for those people new to this realm, this set of books is a great discovery.his/her enjoyment of the text.

B000003TA4|4.0|To say that the first major label debut of this legendary Arberdeen, Washington (their town of origin - only later they moved to Seattle) changed music is only to state the obvious.  It's common knowledge already that the powers to be saw fit to drop the Los Angeles glam metal bands off their rosters due to the then-promising and lucrative Seattle grunge scene that Nirvana helped cast into open light.  Everyone, it seems, says that Kurt Cobain and his group brought an almost non-materialistic, inner-seeking, and spiritualistic consciousness to Generation X (born 1962 - 1979 approx.).  While there is certainly truth to all that, Kurt Cobain, immensely talented and visionary though he was, was a heroine-addled and misanthropist mental defective whose only way out was suicide.       Now to review the actual music itself...'It Smells Like Teen Spirit' is one of the most complex melodic songs ever recorded by an air guitar band, sounding like a heavy metal Beatles song.  The lyrics are jabberwocky for rock but the melody is extremely good.  Good enough for the mainstream and good enough for the metalheads to enjoy (even though they put down metal, Cobain, the main songwriter and singer, was a fan of Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, etc. and his tunes 'Stay Away'  'Lounge Act', and 'Territorial Pissings' sound more heavy metal than the 1990's rock Nirvana helped make possible to exist).  'Something in the Way' is a folkish song at a snail's pace and 'On A Plain' is like an air guitar 60's song, a number that fans of The Clash - an outfit borrowing much from that period - might enjoy.       The instrument playing is not particularly distinctive; it doesn't define Nirvana. But there are exceptions worth mentioning.  Christ Nosevelic's bass is great in the intro to 'Lounge Act' and David Grohl performs top-notch in his solo in 'Stay Away' in the beginning.       Buy \\"Nevermind\\" to hear an original and decade-defining record.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I think that what makes this movie so great in the acting, in particular Claire Danes.  While the machine apocalypse was only delayed, the themes of destiny and love continue, only refined by twists in the plot.  This is a wonderful film, the equal of the other two in richness of theme and action.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B00005JN0T|2.0|If you're interested in wasting two hours of your day with the Fresh Prince of Bell Aire, go for it.  If you're interested in a scene devoted to seeing his hinie, go for it.  If your interested in action, gunplay, realism, intelligent picture flow- then don't go for this one.<br /><br />It's absolutely dismal.  It's not worth anymore of my time describing what the previews lead you to believe to be a cool sci-fi flick, which turns out to be nothing more than HYPE.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This ugly fat American is the worst of our species because he goes on disturbing other people's business. I have never seen the film and I intend not to because I truly support Bush and I will not wish to see such a humiliating piece of rubbish that degrades our country and destroys the patriotism of Americans. If you have any brains at all, do yourself a favour and never see this film EVER. It's just not worth it. Don't pay anything to that fat man. Spend your time playing golf or baseball or even go for a drink with your loved ones. Don't waste your time on something so ridiculous. Just stay ignorant and live your life and don't give a damm about what happens in the world. Afterall, what can you do? You've done nothing to stop 911 or the War On Terror or the Coalition of the willing- Am i not correct?
B00009TB5G|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and was extremely impressed with Amazon's service.  I ordered this along with The Return of the King Extended Edition on Jan. 4 and chose the free Super Saver shipping.  To my surprise, the order shipped on the 7th, and I received it on the 8th!  I definitely recommend this product, and I'd certainly go with Amazon's service on this.
B0001AP14E|5.0|It doesn't matter whether u buy the clean version or the explicit version. It just depends. 2 me I love Kanye and Kanye will always be my favorite rapper 2 date. I love him to death since he put out this album which became a classic. He does talk about real issues and serious stuff about politics, religion, our nation, affecting our culture to come better, trying 2 take hip-hop 2 another level, etc. Definitely check the ARC Choir too 'cuz they're still sing \\"Walk with Me\\" which Kanye sampled for his hit song \\"Jesus Walks\\" (I know everybody knows this). Anyway love the album hope Kanye puts out 'nother one that drops out in April or May. I hear the title of his second album is gonna be name LATE REGISTRATION which gonna have my man and superstar John Legend (everybody should have a taste on his new CD, GET LIFTED which I may go cop), Common of course and especially my girl Keyshia Cole who's gon appear on the album or not. I hear she has an album coming which I'm not sure they say it's gon soon in the spring of 2005 or so. 'specially it's gonna be off of Kanye's imprint label G.O.O.D. (Getting Out Our Dreams). Make sure u keep in contact with her. Praise and give thanks for my man Kanye for putting out a album that is so spiritual and ominscent. May God bless his soul.
B0002858YS|5.0|It has been a long time since I bought an indie album, but I was certainly glad I got this one!  From the catchy lyrics to the funky sounds and anglophilic voice and music style, the Killers are right when they sing that they are ON TOP!   <br /> <br />As far as I am concerned, they are the hippest band to hail from Vegas.  And they are a breath of fresh air from all of the thrashy rock bands that seem to dominate the US.  It is a shame they are far more popular in the UK, and doing lots of concerts there (at least they were when I last visited family there), because I would love to see them in concert.  They have charisma. <br /> <br />Anyone into indie or Brit rock should go out and get this CD.  The thumping beats and Brandon's tuneful voice will be very pleasing. <br /> <br />My favorite songs:  Well, actually, I just LOVE all of them!
B000002UJQ|3.0|First of all, I \\"get\\" the message behind this album and band. Radiohead tackle the theme of generalized malaise in regards to the treatment of humanity by modern technology, a topic tackled many times by other, more insightful artists--before that time of the information age, which we now live in. Second, the approach of this band isn't all that innovative. Unless you call blatant swipes towards Pink Floyd, Eno, Beatles, and even Guns N Roses(!!), at one point, any form of innovation. The retro distopia theme seems like an outmoded slice of 60's sci-fi, very geeky.    Despite all that,when you break it all apart, there are still some worthy moments on this record. \\"Airbag\\" sports a nifty standoff between cello/viola and guitar, simmered with a timely 90's trip-hop beat, followed by a magestic, ice-trickling guitar lead by John Greenwood. Greenwood takes front and center on the very next song, with another magestic moment of sonic expression in \\"paranoid android\\". Thome Yorke, who is a great vocalist, really dominates the proceedings all over. \\"Subterrean Homesick Alien\\", the title of which is some clever wordplay on the Dylan song \\"Subterrean Homesick Blues\\", sports a decidedly \\"ufo\\" sounding keyboard work, nicely playing off some guitar fills. Yorke's loungy singing takes on a compelling yearn for.....ET to find a home, I guess... Is this innovative? Nevertheless, Yorke sells us on it in the delivery, no matter how silly the content may be.     From this point, the album takes a dip in quality, I think. \\"Let Down\\" comes off like a well produced rendition of \\"Row,row,row your boat\\". There is nothing here to get too excited about, though its an okay tune. \\"Karma Police\\" is one of the most overrated songs that I have ever heard, taking most of its inspiration from the Beatles White Album (\\"Sexy Sadie\\" in particular), so much that I can't believe that they got away with it! \\"Fitter happier\\", while taking alot of flack from reviews here, is kind of a compelling track with the moarnful piano underscoring the retro-quasi-futuristic Hal 9000 computer voice. All I have to say about \\"Electioneering\\" (their Guns n Roses tribute)is that Bruce Dickinson and Gene Frenkle would be proud. \\"Climbing up the walls\\" has some moog-laced screaming in it and thats about it. From here things get a little better, and steer the way to the lullaby sounds they would explore on their next album. \\"No surprises\\" is Radiohead's rendition of the Velvet Underground's \\"Sunday Morning\\", mixing moarnful Xylophone with baratone vocals. \\"Lucky\\" is a shimmering, slab of \\"comfortably numb\\" guitar licks. \\"The Tourist\\" is filled with the kind of passionate vocal performance that Roger Waters shrill,isolated protagonist of The Wall could have used, an exercise in restraint.     Despite the praise I give, i'll take \\"..gin and tonic.\\" over this Mork from Ork space egg any day of the week.
B00006879E|5.0|I bought this CD for my 2 year old daughter who couldn't stop singing \\"Sunday Morning.\\"  Well, soon I couldn't stop singing it either.  Actually, I like all of the songs on this album, which is not something I can say about every album I own.   <br /> <br />My most preferred songs are: The Sun, Tangled, Sunday Morning, and Sweetest Goodbye. <br /> <br />It is just an easy album to listen to.  Not thrashy, full of soul.  If you like Maroon 5 from what you hear on the radio, give this CD a go!
B000002B5L|4.0|I am giving this albums a 4 stars.  I was torn.  This albums flows very well.  My Favorite songs are Killing Me Softly, with the Exceptionally Talented Lauren Hill.  Fugeela, The Score.  There allot of messages on this album.  A great assemble with Wyclef and Pras. You can feel there flow.  There is a song for every one.  But, I would recommend this album for young adult the mature individual.  The language just takes away from the pure magic that flows with the music.<br /><br />I just wish there wasn't so much explict language but you cannot deny this Group Wonderful Talent.<br /><br />I look forward to there next album.  Hopefully, soon.<br /><br />Anything Lauren and Wyclef touches turns to magic.  Pras holds his own.<br /><br />If you are a Fugee fanatic.  This is a must buy.  If you want to delve deep into the minds of some talented artist this is a good start for a music lover collection.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Extended Version Collector's Set is an amazing DVD that is a must have for fans of spaghetti westerns, Clint Eastwood, and Sergio Leone. Most people know the storyline of three violent men and their pursuit of $200,000 in Confederate gold coins buried in a cemetery. Allowing nothing to slow them down, the trio cuts a violent path to the gold. For the extended version DVD, 14 minutes of footage has been added to the movie that were never part of the American release. Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach re-recorded the dialogue in these scenes because an English audio track was never created. It is almost forty years since the movie was made and Eastwood and Wallach have aged which is noticeable in their voices, but that doesn't detract from the overall viewing pleasure of the movie. My only problem with the DVD is the gunshots. Spaghetti westerns had a distinctive noise when guns were fired. Here on this DVD the gunshots have been changed to a more Americanized gunshot. Minor squabble, but I had to get it off my chest. Even with this minor problem this is an incredible DVD that fans of the movie need to have in their collection.    Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie, \\"the Good,\\" a bounty hunter who by accident discovers the name of the grave where the gold coins are buried. Lee Van Cleef is equally as good as the steely-eyed Angel Eyes, \\"the Bad,\\" a vicious gunfighter who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the gold. Eli Wallach steals the movie as Tuco, \\"the Ugly,\\" the Mexican bandit who knows the name of the cemetery, but not the name on the grave. The trio are great throughout, providing plenty of great shootouts, but also some great dialogue. The movie also stars Luigi Pistilli as Father Ramirez, Tuco's brother, Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, Aldo Guiffre as an alcoholic Union captain, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli, and Al Mulock.    The Extended Version Collector's Set is full of extras viewers will eat up. The DVD features the widescreen presentation of the movie with 14 additional minutes of footage, audio commentary from film critic Richard Schickel, \\"Leone's West\\" a making of documentary with cast(Eastwood and Wallach) and crew interviews, \\"The Leone Style\\" a featurette about director Sergio Leone's unique style, \\"The Man Who Lost the Civil War\\" a documentary about the actual happenings of the Civil War that take place in the movie, \\"Reconstructing the GBU\\" on how the audio recording was done, and \\"Il Maestro\\" a feature about composer Ennio Morricone and his famous score. The DVD also has two deleted scenes that weren't able to be inserted into the movie, a French trailer with other missing footage, a US trailer that identifies Tuco as the Bad and Angel Eyes as the Ugly, several collectible mini-posters from around the world, and a collectible booklet with an essay by Roger Ebert. If you have the original DVD, I recommend you keep it just to have the original US release, but buy this DVD as well. This Extended Version DVD is truly one of the few movies you can say is a must have DVD. Buy this movie!
B00003CXCT|4.0|OK OK,yes these are the special editions and people have been complaining about the \\"New Coke\\" syndrome since 1997. Yes I was appauled that Greedo shot first. In this version he shoots at the same time. Lucas! How about him not shooting at all!? Han Solo is a pirate at this point with a price on his head. He doesn't have to have the heroic \\"never shoot a guy in the back\\" way of thinking. Y'know, one dirtbag rubbing out another. Other changes for the DVD version was Obi-Wan's Krytt Dragon call used to scare away the Sand People was altered. The Jabba scene was improved. He looks more life like and not like he belongs in a Playstation game. I also liked the addition of that scene where Luke sees his old friend Biggs in the hanger before the last battle. It added to the emotion on Lukes face when Biggs got blown away in the trench.    In Empire they changed a few more things... Why did they have to change Boba Fett's voice? (Actually, it was so he'd sound like Jango Fett, since Boba's a clone and all...) It didn't really detract from anything but when you've seen the movie as many times as I have you notice right away. They changed the image and voice of the Emperor. This was an improvement that evryone pretty much saw coming as we're all trying to follow Lucas' insanity. The worst change in this film for me was the one he did back in 1997. He changed Vaders dialogue near the end of the film. The part when Vader leaving Bespin after not bringing in Luke is surrounded by his commanders and troops walking to his shuttle. In the original he barks out 3 words scaring his men, \\"BRING MY SHUTTLE.\\" The mood was perfect, his men looked scared, and you knew Vader was pissed! In the SE version he said something completely different that did not at all show that same anger. \\"Inform my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival!\\" WHAT??? 1. He didn't sound pissed. 2. He didn't sound at all menacing. 3. \\"Bring my shuttle\\" would have worked with the new shuttle sequence just as well untouched. 4. James Earl jones was 17 years older when he redid that dialogue and it sounded like it. That dialogue change just sucked the life out of that scene as far as tension and where the mood was going.    Return of the Jedi: Well, I wouldn't have cried if he did away with the Ewoks. LOL The Sy Snoodles animation made me feel like I was watching \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\\" But since Lucas hated the original scene I knew that was coming. The added look for the Sarlaac Pit was unnecessary IMO. I liked the added celebrations of the different cities at the end but changing the Ewok song was lame. And the Hayden Christiansen thing at the end was just obscene. Why change the original image of Anakin Skywalker? He died at that age (in that stage in his life) so his image should be of the same age/appearence right? Also, those images are how Luke remembers them. How could you have a young Anakin image for Luke to see if he's never seen his father until after he took the Vader mask off him? I mean they didn't substitute an image of Ewen MacGregor in place of Sir Alec Guiness! That just plain didn't make sense.     The pic quality, sound, and widescreen is nothing short of stellar! The documentary disc was neat also. I do recommend this set for those reasons but if those changes I mentioned irked you as bad as they did me? Keep your original VHS/LD editions from 1995 or older to accompany this set because you'll always want to go back! Trust me.
0060977493|5.0|This is the most beautifully written book i have ever read, and goes down as one of my all time favorites. Through lyric and poetry, Arundhati does a great job of accuratley portraying an Indian family in midst of turmoil.
B0002Z0EXQ|5.0|This movie is absolutely awesome. I started off watching this movie expecting to be bored for the next 3 hours of my life, but surpringly, I'm glad to say that I was wrong. Brad Pitt as Achilles makes this entire movie worth watching anyway, but the fact that he totally kicked @ss was an added bonus. Not only is he extremely HOTT!, but he can also pull off playing a Greek legend like a charm. Quite frankly, I haven't seen Brad carry a movie this great in quite some time, so I am most certainly impressed. I also must admit that I underestimated Eric Bana's character \\"Hector\\" as well because he actually played a great warrior. I was also shocked to see Peter O'Toole because he's definitely a face that I haven't seen in a long time, and he still looks great for his age might I add. I can honestly say that the only character that I was a little diappointed with was Orlando Bloom's character \\"Paris\\". It's a good thing that he had so many other stronger characters supporting his role because clearly he was just the weak link of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Orlando Bloom, I really do, but his character just wasn't in the same league as the others. To keep it short, I would definitely recommend that anyone who hasn't seen this movie check it out, and then buy it for your collection. I know I plan to.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I had first seen Terminator 3 dvd in widescreen and I was not impressed. The movie had seemed boring. <br /> <br />A couple months later, I watched it again in full screen. What a tremendous difference it was. Everything looked bigger and better!!!! Especially the part where the gigantic crane flips over on the road, almost crushing the terminator into a flat pancake. The bathroom fight scene is also very much improved in the full screen version.
1573301183|5.0|If you are a fan, you already have this.  If not a fan, this will make you one.  Outstanding performance by an incredible band.  MTV's Unplugged series was a brilliant idea and thankfully they got these guys to sign on.  Taking the heavy on-stage blast of grunge rock out...which of course is great anyway...they still somehow keep it in and get down to the heart of the songs.  Jammin base and leads, terrific percussion and Layne is on target(for the most part...you'll see!).  The voices and playing are perfect, and not only are they enjoying themselves, they can tell they are playing the songs perfect.  A must have!
B0002SROT0|4.0|From what I've read and heard about Elliott Smith, his life was one filled with a profound despair, an anguish so deep that it could only be conveyed through blissful, angelic music. His sweet-soundedness greatly contrasted with his tumultuous mental state, often leading the listener to peace and tranquility and the composer to, well, maybe nothing. He fell down so many times, and he often got up, rendering magnificent, cathartic records. However, most recently, he was overwhelmed for the final time and swept away. It is truly a tragedy to the saddest degree to understand how a man with a truly good and modest heart, as evidenced by his music, could no longer withstand his woes. From a Basement on the Hill, the final body of music Elliott left with us, is as fine a recording as he ever made. These songs always have mortality in their sight, and with that vision in the foreground, seem to consistently deliver beauty in a withering, final gasp for air type of way. I hear desperation, sorrow, forgiveness, life and death drenched under the influence of heavy drugs and a desire for a contentment, that for Elliott, was unreachable. Simply, this is music that needs to be heard. The very fond, Fond Farewell, the muddled, but gracefully doped up Don't Go Down and Strung Out Again and the sparse, beautious Memory Lane are all outstanding. Embrace and cherish this, for it's the last of a string of great albums from a wonderful, sorrowful, beloved man.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|They are not bad, more guts than a lot of today's popular music. But they can't quite pull it off. Not as edgy or inventive as the Gang of 4 or the Jam. Has to be what these guys were listening to. Give them credit for ambition and good taste really a 3.5 get the Gang of 4 brief history cd and hope this group can rise up to that level eventually. If not it still beats the crap of anything you'd hear on top 40 corporate radio. Silly people they thought Napster was killing the industry. It's just the lack of interesting music. Franz is a baby step in the right direction.

B0002IU988|5.0|The break-up of Creed left millions of us fans with a tear in our eye and an empty spot in our CD collection, where a hopeful follow-up album to the beloved \\"Weathered\\" would supposedly go. <br /> <br />Lucky for us, that spot can now be filled, with honor, by Alter Bridge's electrifying disc, \\"One Day Remains.\\" <br /> <br />This album proves that Stapp's solo walk was not entirely in vain. Refreshing as it is to see the band's remaining members back in the studio, the new factor is equally satisfying; that being the addition of new frontman Myles Kennedy. <br /> <br />Kennedy, hailing from my own hometown, Mayfield, Ohio, offers a powerful, steady, yet beutifully haunting voice to this band, creating an original and unique sound which still hints the Creed sound, in subtle brilliance.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong; Alter Bridge has a clear and distinct metal sound, which is reflected most in tracks such as \\"Metalingus\\", \\"Open Your Eyes\\", \\"Watch Your Words\\", and \\"Find the Real.\\"  <br /> <br />But of course, there is more to a band than heavy riffs and metal attitude; any good band, at least, and a side that searches for answers and longs for peace can be discovered in songs like \\"Shed My Skin\\", \\"In Loving Memory\\", \\"Broken Wings\\", \\"Burn It Down\\", and \\"The End Is Here.\\" <br /> <br />This album is a magnificent find for any passionate fan of real rock and roll. The band's own passion for this, along with their inspirtaional lyrics and jarring melodies, is sure to leave you refreshed and ready to live life as if only one day remains. <br />
B00005JLH3|3.0|Orlando Jones does a great job as the director of a college marching band. He usually plays black sterotype roles. Nick Cannon, who can't read music, somehow wins a music scholarship at a mostly black southern college, which seems to specialize in 300-piece field music. The band competition in the finale is the BEST. Great field routines, but music written for drum and & bugle corps. Mostly a showpiece for drummers. Lacking great band music, but I enjoyed the drum line!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is the album of the year.  Can't stop listening to this cd.  Just great atmospheric rock with enough pop to keep you dancing.  Will be around for years to come.  Great live show, as well.  Give a listen.
B00005U2JL|5.0|Marilyn Manson Live is a sight to behold.  His vocal range is intense and the band makes the songs that you love so much even more enjoyable.  Examples would be the end to Beautiful People or Sweet Dreams with the Hell Outro, it's just insane!  The only complaint that most people have is that it was filmed in multiple countries, the angle changes can get annoying.  I think the best example of that is the Irresponsible Hate Anthem.  It hurt my eyes the first time I watched that song, but most of the people who complain about it must understand this, I've been to a Manson show, and when they played it, the strobe lights went crazy, and here they try to replicate that, but it doesn't work quite as well.  The combination of strobe lights mixed with angle changes with every change in the song isn't necessarily the best thing.  Another complaint would be that because of the changes his clothes constantly change over and over again.  In one shot he has this helmet on and another he has a dress on or he has paint on him or in somewhat normal Goth clothes, I could go on forever.  But this DVD is so good, that I could care less about those things.      Every song is played with amazing quality and sometimes better then the studio versions.  The props Manson brings out make it all the more interesting and never get you bored.  The audiences for these shows are absolutely HUGE by the way.  One of my favorite moments is during the love song Manson comes out wearing a pope outfit or something and John 5 plays a double guitar.  As with the song list, its great, its only missing Angel with the Scabbed wings and more songs from the portrait era, as they only play Lunchbox, I would love to see Dope Hat, but you can't have everything I suppose.  The death parade documentary was entertaining, disgusting an hilarious, but I felt it was too short or still missing some things.  but once again you can't have everything, that's why they make B-Sides.  All in all this is definitely worth themoney and definitely worth your time.  If you haven't seen Manson live before this will convince you to.      On an additional note, Amazon.com has misspelled government, look on the box itself and you will see it is spelled correctly.
B000002KBU|5.0|I was first introduced to Joni Mitchell in h.s. in 1970 by my best friend when we were 16 and I grew up into young womanhood listening to her. She became our idol and musical mentor and one of the few female role models on the male dominated folk/rock scene.<br /><br />I can hear strains of her sounds in the music I write today and in how my still-best-friend sings. She is one of the most undervalued artists of our time and perhaps one of the greatest singer/songwriters/composers of all time. I wonder why there is virtually NO AIRPLAY of any of her songs on the \\"golden oldie\\" stations. She has got to be the one of the most influential artists on generations of musicians.<br /><br />We were so fortunate to be teenagers at that time and to have access to music that really lets you enter into it and gives you a space to feel and explore feelings that you might not even be able to put a label too. This music speaks for the places in the heart that are like stillborn children until joni gives voice to them in her music.<br /><br />Too much of today's music assaults your senses and doesn't give you any space to feel anything other than the speaker's anger or angst. I understand using music as a buffer AGAINST feelings. I did that too. But if your now looking for a place to feel and explore your intuitive side Blue is a good place to start.<br /><br />I played this album repeatedly when i was shipped off to an isolated school in upstate n.y. in 1971 and was cut off from everything that was familiar and comforting to me including the sale of the home that i had lived in for 17 years. I found comfort in \\"blue\\" which spoke my devastation and sense of loss and of being adrift between worlds.<br /><br />Blue is a masterpiece of the fusion of feelings and craft. No one does it better when it comes to exploring the turbulent roller coaster of love gained and lost and of exploring the culutural limitations that suppress the higest and best in us.<br /><br />Joni's work has stood the test of time and she is now being appreciated for the true innovator and master musician she is. She is a shining example of the best that came out of that incredibly exciting and turbulent time of the 60s and 70s where a new cultural permission to be fully ourselves was being formed.<br /><br />Joni gave voice to the emotions that were previously \\"forbidden\\" to feel and talk about in the plastic pop culture of the 1960s and 1950s. In today's excessive society we forget that there was a time when restraint (on all levels) was the order of the day.<br />To me the true meaning of \\"liberation\\" is being free to feel all your feelings (not just the safe and acceptable ones like anger and angst) and to do so in a way that respects yourself and others.<br /><br />If you want to know what it was really like to be a participant at that time and hear how people used art to voice the emotional revolution that was happening in our inner landscapes then listen to the masters of that period like Joni. It was an astounding tidal wave of talent to have witnessed and experienced. You'll begin to understand why so many boomers will never outgrow it.d for the true innovator and master musician she is.

B0000669JL|5.0|Having lived in Zimbabwe during the apartheid era I can definitively say that Bob Marley and the Wailers music meant a great deal to a great many of us non-whites because it speaks directly and universally about social justice to people who are oppressed or involved in a struggle for freedom.  Bob Marley and the Wailers injected so much passion and feeling into their writing and singing and I think that is why after all this time their music is still so loved. Their strong belief in God also comes through in the many oblique and direct references in various songs to Jah and the Book (bible). <br /> <br />The \\"Redemption Song\\" in which they sing about slavery has to be the most beautiful and heartfelt song on this album with awesome lyrics.  <br />\\"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,  <br />None but ourselves can free our minds,  <br />Have no fear for atomic energy,  <br />For none of them can stop the times,  <br />How long shall they kill our prophets,  <br />While we stand aside and look, <br />Some say it's just a part of it, <br />We've got to fulfill the Book\\"  <br /> <br />Bob Marley and the Wailers music contain no cussing or explicit lyrics as they express themselves just beautifully without them.  I have owned this album (and others) in various forms (vinyl, cassette, cd) since it was first released.  If you are looking for music with depth of meaning, for catchy songs that will have you up and dancing, for beautiful ballads, then buy some of Bob Marley and the Wailers' music.  Definitely try Legend, Exodus, Natty Dread, Survival, Catch a Fire and Uprising even if you get nothing else. I'm dating myself here but almost 30 years after I first heard their music I still love it and can still be moved by it.
0064407667|5.0|I loved this book! I was first introduced to this book by a friend of mine. When I read it, I knew that I had to read the rest of the books. I started reading these books in the 5th grade, and next year I will be in High School. So it doesn't matter how old you are. The first book, introduces three children named Violet, an inventor, Klaus, who loves to read, and Sunny, who likes to bite. Their parents are very rich, but they have recently died in a fire. No one knows how it started. So now the three children are taken to their closest relitive. He is an evil and mean man named Count Olaf. Count Olaf is really after the enormous fortune that the parents left to the children. In this book it shows what he tries to do to get his hands on the fortune. But does he? And what unfortunate things happen? In this and other books you will find out. I liked this book because you think well, this book will have a good ending, and Count Olaf will be put in jail. WRONG. These books are a real adventure, and every next book gets better and better. So read all the books to find out about all the evil schemes of Count Olaf, and IF the children will ever get away from him. Plus, don't forget about the movie. It was a real blast!
0440238609|3.0|I loved the first two books, and I thought the 3rd would be the best.  I was far mistaken.  The third book had a huge rise to a tiny climax.  It just isn't anywhere close to the caliber of the first two.  I will rate book 1-5 stars <br />                            Book 2-4 stars <br />                            Book 3-2 stars
B00005AR3G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The humor was so amusing, and it was just a quirky and loveable tale. However, I notice older audiences enjoy it much more than kids, whom this movie is intended for. It isn't inappropriate, or crude, but some of the dialogue and humor is just over their head. None the less, it's a movie you must have. I was disappointed this did not turn out as popular as I felt it should be---there is a lot of controversy about it. Anyhow, this is a fantastic movie, and it Will make you laugh!
B00013RC9I|2.0|After the let down of the last album, 10k HZ Legend, I wasn't too sure what to expect. As others have stated, Moon Safari was just amazing, but ever since, they haven't been able to recreate the irresistible hooks of Moon Safari and Premiers Symptomes. <br /> <br />Surfing on a Rocket is about the only song that I find myself listening to on this CD. Definitely catchy unlike the rest of the CD, but it is a bit repetitive. The other songs I find I'll turn down the volume or skip. Unfortunately, Talkie Walkie will never be a CD I play repeatedly for myself or for friends. Better than 10K HZ Legend yet still not living up to what this duo is capable of.  <br /> <br />Check out the Premiers Symptoms (limited edition early singles collection) CD or the Virgin Suicides soundtrack, before adding this to your collection.
B0001I561E|5.0|When I was a bit younger, this movie came out, and it was my favorite. When it came out for DVD, I got really excited. My youngest sister, who is five, had never seen this movie before, so I bought it as a Christmas gift for her. She adores it just as much as I do! I was so tickled with it, and yes...I'll admit, I did buy a copy for myself too. I just couldn't pass it up. This is a timeless classic that doesn't ever deserve to leave the shelves in stores, and it most certainly can't leave the shelves in out hearts. The DVD is a great way to share the magic with younger generations, Don't pass this up!
038551123X|1.0|290 pages of police thriller clichs. <br />A family of cops. <br />The cop is a killer. <br />The good female cop is stuck in vice as a hooker, but she'll make homicide detective <br />The lame female cop is already detective. <br />Neighboring police districts arguing over jurisdiction. <br />Stereotypes: every serial killer had a trauma as a child, every traumatized child grows up to be a serial killer. <br />Given that the author's bio states he's already working on a 2nd Dexter novel, I guess it's not too much of a plot spoiler to say that the ending sets us up for a sequel with most of the same characters. <br />On the positive side, it's only 290 pages and there were so few words on each page, I thought I must have picked up the large print edition. <br />For a book so filled with clichs, the only fitting end to a review is to say it's a shame so many trees had to die for this.
B000002KBU|5.0|I discovered Joni Mitchell about a year ago through a friend of mine.  I certainly wasn't around when this came out in 1971, and I had no idea who she was before this album.  I honestly didn't know what to expect.  I've grown up with the more angsty, angry sounds of Tori Amos and this was a pleasant change (though I love Tori Amos as well). <br /> <br />I love the opening chords of All I Want and I'm basically swept away through the rest of the album.  My personal favorites are California, The Last Time I Saw Richard, Blue, and, of course, A Case of You.  All are different, some leaning more towards the sad, blue feelings of, well, Blue and Last Time I Saw Richard and then towards the easy going, upbeat California.  A Case of Me is beautiful and I think pretty unconventional.  The lyrics are interesting, I particularly like the \\"map of Canada\\" bit.   <br /> <br />Musically, I rate things on whether they sound good or not, not having the musical prowess to rate it any other way.  To me, they all sound beautiful.  Her voice is very human, I think, wavering a bit in the high notes and filling in nicely everywhere else.  This album is basically all guitars or piano, which works well in all the songs. <br /> <br />I can't say that I relate to the songs on this album, since a lot of them deal with love, loss, regret, and other themes that people experience in their life.  I'm still fairly young, but I'm certain this album will stay with me.  It should be interesting to see how I relate to songs differently as I age.  In conclusion, Blue is something a little different and nice for a quiet afternoon, and a great introduction to the music of Joni Mitchell.
0380789035|2.0|Yes, I'll admit I got suckered in by the jacket copy. That and Gaiman co-wrote \\"Good Omens\\" (with Terry Pratchett) which I enjoyed a ton.<br /><br />But, the great premise of an American mythology personified and come to life is undermined by truly disturbing sexual and violent content (no spoilers here though). The sex and violence seemed to only be in here to shock, not to tell a story. I don't think I'm a prude but there are some things I just don't want to read about and unfortunately, this book contained them. Which probably explained by it achieved best-seller status. Sometimes, it's nice not to be in the norm.<br /><br />Why 2 stars then? The beginning of the book isn't awful, and there are a few points where the author's excellent style overcomes the pathetic attempt at a story.
0790731509|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  It is one of the ultimate male-defining movies of all time.  It has action, humor, tragedy, and drama.  It rings true (the writer had actually served time on a chain gang).  When, at the age of 12, I first saw this movie [particularly the fight in the yard scene], I realized that life isn't always an \\"A\\" or an \\"F\\".  Often a person rates at least a \\"C\\" if not an \\"A\\" just for trying.  In other words, one who puts forth real effort is deserving of respect whether or not they come out \\"on top\\" or \\"first place\\".  The 50 egg challenge is great.  The repeated \\"fugitive\\" pursuit scenes are well-done.  The different songs played and sung by Harry Dean Stanton are perfect.  The story is magnificent as are the many great lines: \\"Still shakin' it, Boss!\\" and \\"What we got here is a failure to communicate.\\" With such a cast too!  Joe Don Baker, Ralph Waite, Wayne Rogers, Strother Martin, Dennis Hopper, and, of course, Paul Newman.  This movie inspired me and never fails to do so every time I view it again.
0441003257|4.0|Gaiman and Pratchett are great together on this. It's a funny idea and well done with good characters. They take the apocalypse, give it a thoroughly modern setting, and make it very funny. How can the apocalypse be funny? Read it and see. <br />Unfortunately, the handful of other books I've read by these authors individually, don't live up. If you're thinking of reading anything by either of them based on this book's strengths, don't. Pratchett is too dorky (there really is not better word) and Gaiman is too dark and evil. Together though, they made a great combination. <br />
0780619951|4.0|An ocean plane wrecked diplomat (David Thewlis) is rescued and brought to an island inhabited by a Nobel winning now reclusive scientist (Marlon Brando) and his children; the animals he has been genetically manipulating with human DNA in an attempt to create his vision of a pure species. <br /> <br />When this film opened it was panned by the critics. I was never sure why. It opens strong, both visually and musically. The locale is beautifully claustrophobic, appropriate for a secluded tropical island. Stan Winston's creature make up is excellent. The body language of the \\"humanimals\\" is very interesting. The underlying commentaries on the savagery of society and the morality of biological scientific experimentation are intact. Performances are excellent (Brando makes a daring, and critics said poor, choice in his interpretation of Moreau in that he plays him like an effete, physically feeble, unbelievably polite British University English Professor, more eccentrically insane instead of the usual madly insane that most crazy scientist characters are portrayed as). This is a well done film.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Excellent mini-series, maybe the best ever.  With obvious reverence for its subject, BAND OF BROTHERS follows Easy Company from boot camp through many of its engagements in the major battles in Europe to the end of the World War II.<br /><br />  The special effects are stunning (there's no other word for it) and the battle scenes are the best I've ever seen.<br /><br />  Its attention to detail and adherence to the facts make it a difficult viewing experience at times.  Because of casualties and replacements, there are a number of characters to track.  Also, the battle scenes are very confusing sometimes.  These aren't necessarily knocks on BoB - soldiers are wounded and die, the definition of battle is \\"violent confusion.\\"  Sometimes coherence is the first casualty of an adherence to the facts.  These are minor quibbles, and if you're like me you'll rewatch these episodes sooner than later, anyway.<br /><br />  Be aware - BAND OF BROTHERS also contains a number of scenes containing graphic carnage.  It doesn't dwell on them, but the camera doesn't turn its head when a character is wounded.<br /><br />  This is the most realistic depiction of war I've ever seen apart from documentary films.  A stellar product on all counts.
B0002S94OS|4.0|i knew lamb of god was one of the more well known hardcore bands on this year's ozzfest, so i figured i would like them as well.starting off is one of my favorite songs right now, \\"laid to rest\\".grr i love that song.i cant say enough.just wants me to get up and crush something.this album is very well produced, extremely well recorded.each isntrument is picked up perfectly.the double bass work is phenomenal and the power metal guitar sound is all the rampant.randy's vocals are definitely a highlight.his growls are done in such a way that they dont grate at you, they are actually quite smooth.i am enjoying this album immenseley and it will only continue to grow on me.
0812550706|5.0|Hi, <br /> <br />I am writing this review to apologize.  When Ender's Game first came out I was in High School.  I read the book and thought it was OK but wasn't that thrilled by it.  I never read any Orson Scott Card again.  A few weeks ago I saw a new edition of the book in the library.  I figured, for old times sake, I would re-read it.  I don't know what was wrong with me the first time but the book is fantastic!!!  Maybe that means that I'm not as dumb as I used to be. <br /> <br />The story is about an unwanted kid named Ender who pretty much hates life and everybody in it except for his sister.  He is selected, against his will, to go to a military school in deep space.  The school is looking for a supreme commander to defend the human race against aliens.  They have one chance and they must do whatever it takes to turn Ender into the leader that they desperately need.  It turns out that Ender is the \\"One\\" they want but they must push him to the edge and beyond.  The great conflict is that they require somebody who is so sensitive and empathetic that he can understand the enemy.  But, at the same time, he must be utterly ruthless and capable of killing on a massive scale.  It is not possible to have a single person who is both these things.  But they have no choice and time is running out. <br /> <br />But wait, that's not all!!! <br /> <br />Ender's conflict seems to end but only then does he find his ultimate challenge.  I just picked up book #2 and am looking forward to going through the entire series. <br /> <br />Don't Miss it!!! Enjoy!!!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This cd is one of the greatest of all time. I got it around the time it came out and i think it got glued permanetly into my cd player. A7X mixes wicked guitar riffs with the meledous singing/screaming of m.shadows. this is some thing that you would not regret buying.

B000000P11|5.0|The most melodic and musical of all post punk recordings\\"Strange Times\\"is also the high water mark of the long time producers turned rock stars-the Chameleons.The doom and the gloom is all here but also a widescreen sense of anthemic pop songwriting that reaches it's apex in the incredibly poignant\\"Tears\\"(a homage to a recently deceased friend)and in the colourful culmination of\\"Swamp Thing\\".<br /><br />Post punk just never sounded this good before.
0440238609|3.0|After reading the reviews of this series, I was very eager to plunge into it and experience what reviewers called the \\"last great fantasy series of the 20th century.\\"<br /><br />The first book of the series lived up to the hype. The adventures of the main character, Lyra, which began through her overhearing a cryptic presentation by her uncle, led to a first-rate series of events that completely drew me in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Pullman became overly sentimental about his characters in the second and third books. The events were so heavily foreshadowed throughout the last two thirds of the series, that there were no surprises at the end. Further, the \\"climactic\\" final confrontations were so brief and scattered that they seemed less important than the very successful and suspenseful buildup before.<br /><br />It seemed to me that Mr. Pullman lost steam in his writing.<br /><br />The same thing happened again with his very brief follow-up book Lyra's Oxford. It begins with what seems like a potential new adventure for Lyra and once again dries up (it could have been a very good opening few chapters for a greater invention, but Pullman ends it abruptly and frustratingly).
B000067CQK|5.0|\\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is the high point of David Bowie's dazzling career and it unveiled to the 70's a magic world of alien charm hitherto unknown.<br /><br />A step forward from the already remarkable \\"Hunky Dory\\" the album sees Bowie base it loosely around a concept dealing with the end of the world(Five Years)and the arrival of a larger than life martian.<br /><br />The music is,of course,splendorous glam rock vibed up by Mick Ronson's resourceful guitar playing an D.B.unique voice.<br /><br />The album is perfect at eleven tracks but the extra cd's three tracks that were left out and should have made it to the album are the dissonant romp of\\"John,I'm only Dancing\\",the spacial\\"Holy Holy\\"and the killer\\"Velvet Goldmine\\"(what's the deal with the piraty laugh in the songs coda?).
B00009RDG9|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever shown on how the Government takes out one of its own. Makes you think twice about ever wanting to serve \\"your\\" country in a war. The military trains you to kill and refuses to acknowledge the damage it causes when you actually battle live enemies. It then sends cold-hearted killers to take you out as if you don't exist.<br /><br />A sad ending awaits all who serve the greater good. History is proof to this fact. The true patriot in the movie is the only one who could see things from a larger perspective of life, the rest were merely focused on their egos and short-sighted political correctness. You can be sure I ain't betting on Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones) as the good guy.<br /><br />Bravo for an excellent production! Can't wait for sequels to follow!
B0000A118M|5.0|The title of my review pretty much explains it all. This album gives us a completely new meaning to the significance of music. It's not about who can rip through 16th notes on Cherokee or who can mimic the sound of Paul Desmond. When I first heard A Love Supreme, it completly opened my mind to viewing music in a different way. While music that is technically perfect or full of beautiful sounds is great jazz, the ability to express your true feelings and emotions through music WITHOUT conforming to a structure is unique and possibly only exists in this album. To explain it the best I can, Trane allows his emotions to be explained musically, instead of letting his music have emotional triggers. The emotional content of this album is it's whole significance. The musical quality in here is secondary. If you can feel what John is trying to explain, what he is trying to get to, then the feeling that he pours out engulfs you. Trane is my favorite jazz musician, and this is my favorite album of his. I hope you are able to enjoy this as much as I do.
B000003TAB|3.0|Nirvana was all about freedom of choice... Choice to choose what you want to do in society as an individual, as well as the choice to voice yourself in any manner one wants. With that said, somebody REALLY needs to exclude children from being able to review here. Summarizing your review with \\"I don't like Rayn\\" is so immature. At least Rayn could express himself without whining. And I'm sure he hates your guts too, kid. Amazon is polluted with reviews stating that Nirvana sucks, oftentimes without any elaboration as to why. If you think they suck, then say why. Or, if you love them, then say why. Just don't say that Cobain was a better song crafter than John Lennon, or that Nirvana was better than The Beatles. Cobain himself even admitted he wasn't even half as valid as Lennon and The Beatles, but magazines like NME and MOJO go and publish front-page palp claiming Nirvana \\"is the most important band in the world\\". That's so sickening. Nirvana is a ruckus chock full of radiational jargon and hinbeed. What about all the sensational dumbfounding of a newfoudland fig country with whittles and nooks, especially considering all those barricaded barrios out in the californi-a coveted country.
0060005688|1.0|If Mr. Schwartz really believed what he writes, he wouldn't write. There are, by his depiction of things, too many choices. For example, there are far too many books. By writing another book, he aggravates the problem while pretending to solve it. In reality, we filter out most choices and focus on just a few. There are 6+ billion people, so we could marry any one of say, 3 billion. We select from a far smaller number and are not distressed about the billions we never met.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I saw the White Stripes perform in Atlanta in June 05, and this DVD prepped me for the magic I was about to behold. No matter what anyone says about \\"musicianship,\\" this concert is an electrifying showcase of raw physical energy. Watching Jack White play slide guitar on \\"Death Letter\\" is all the proof anyone needs that blues and rock are blood relatives. Under his spell, the familiar toe-tapping Son House dirge culminates in a frenzied chord-crunching finale that'll send chills up and down your spine. Fans who buy this DVD will fall in love with White Stripes songs all over again, thanks to Jack's new twists on already searing riffs (like the opening of Hardest Button to Button) and his playfulness with vocals. Meg and Jack fill the air with more supersonic booms than any five-piece band ever could.
B000005H3M|4.0|You can play this album throughout several times and not remember one tune. <br /> <br />But what you will remember is the great sound from the band here and Buddy's banging, plus the fact it was done live which always helps.
B000003RCY|5.0|Best rammstein CD hands down. Mutter and sehnsuct are 4.5 stars each but herzeleid takes the cake. And i just had to correct Maarz's review. <br />In das alte leid he says \\"ich will ficken, then in the background, they sing niemehr.\\" translation- \\"I want to F@&lt;+ nomore\\" Oh but if your new to rammstein this CD is a must. And dont wais your time with Amerika it was a huge let down. The lyrics are just, so unlike Tiel they should have changed their name for this CD. Mein Teil is the only good song
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|I've been listening to Ray Charles since I was about 15 years old, when I first heard \\"What'd I Say.\\"  His voice, the electric piano and the song were about the freshest things I had ever heard, and I immediately loved him.  That love never ended.<br /><br />While I reluctantly agree with a few other reviewers that Ray's voice on some of the tracks is not what it once was, he still is absolutely wonderful and Genius Loves Company is a must for long-time Ray Charles fans like me.  The selection of stars with whom he sings duets is varied and interesting and the musicianship and arrangements on the CD are outstanding.  Everyone will find a different track that they like best and will feel Ray is particularly good with one artist or another.  But, while there are certain tracks that appeal most to me, I actually think they all are good and the guest artists all put in excellent performances -- seemingly a heartfelt tribute to Ray --one of the greatest ever.<br /><br />My personal favorites are \\"Fever\\" with Natalie Cole, who I think sounds as good as I've ever heard her, \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\" with Elton John, which some other reviewers have not liked but I think is particularly good, \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" with B.B. King--perhaps the best track on the CD, \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" with Gladys Knight, \\"Over The Rainbow\\" with Johnny Mathis (I think Johnny sounds as good as he did 40 years ago) and \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van Morrison.<br /><br />While Ray has sounded better on other CDs, this is still a classic by a man at the end of his life and one which I'm glad I own and which will be played frequently.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I'm gonna keep this one short.      This is arguably one of the BEST movies I've ever seen in terms of screenplay, acting, directing, just everything!  But it's really the screenplay that takes center stage here.  Very imaginative and very original.  I thought Adaptation reached new heights, and now Eternal Sunshine has totally topped it!  And Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have NEVER been better.      This one will go down in history as being one of definitive movies of the first decade of the 21st Century ... the wily \\"Millennium Years.\\"
0425152251|4.0|It has good stuff in it. It's flawed and imperfect, but it has good stuff in it.     I, myself, had a bit of a hard time switching from story mode to lecture mode the first time I read it. I wanted to find out the reason of the weird stuff that happened to Sophie, and I wanted the philosophy lessons to be over so Gaarder could get on with the plot. But on the second reading, I already knew what happened, so I felt free to read the philosophy discussions (mostly) in their entirety.    The climax for me was in the middle of the book, after they talk about Berkely, and the rest of the book was falling action, which I read with mild interest.    The phrase that comes to mind now is \\"involved reading\\". I found it helpful to take notes while reading the philosophy part because it grounded me and kept me from skimming over things which I tend to do.    I think it's a long term thing, which is why I recommend buying it, and not checking it out from the library.  The writing style isn't ideal. Half the time Sophie does not really seem that involved with the lesson, it's just Alberto talking mostly, and Sophie just asks a question every once in a while. It really annoyed me. The first chapter is easily the best part of the book. The characters were a little undefined, I also thought. That may not be a bad thing, but I guess it is generally thought of that way.    The really good thing was that it got me interested in philosophy for the first time, whereas before I knew nothing about it. It's like a whole other world that was opened up for me that I didn't know anything about. That's not small stuff! And stuff.

B000023VR6|5.0|This has got to be one of the best productions for a rap CD ever. Dre puts down all kinds of beats that you havent heard anything like before. It's not really a Dre CD, rappin wise, he raps, but its more of an old school style west coast rappers (and Eminem) on Dre beats. Thats not a bad thing though, just that its not as much Dre as I would like. I thought Eminem kind of screwed up the 2 tracks he was on, just because tha west always sounded hard but at the same time laid back, almost like they thought they were on a different level when they talked their ****. Eminem sounds like a whiny little kid. It would be different if he was on already-bad tracks, but hes on what starts to be great songs. Other than that though, I have no complaints. <br /> <br />Cop tha instrumental too.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy is one of those movies that you just can't see why critics like Roger Ebert didn't like. Troy isn't just a movie for big action buffs, it has a real story behind it. You really start to care about the characters and what happens to them. When Hector and Achilles are fighting you really didn't want to see either of them lose. Eric Bana who beautifully portrays Prince Hector does an excellent job of  really getting the audience to care even for the big action buffs. Not only that but Brad Pitt who plays Achilles doesn't just come off as a empty shell of killing fury. He also shows emotions and you start caring about him as well. Also the love story between Paris and Helen is show beautifully, Orlando Bloom shows you how much he really is in love. The audience really feels like they are really in love with one another. Troy really has something in it for everyone especially those people that loved King Arthur. Bottom line Troy is a movie lovers kind of movie. It is a must have dvd.
0440180295|2.0|I love Kurt Vonnegut but like \\"Jailbird\\", \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" is full of details and great phrases, but little pay-off.   <br /> <br />From the beginning we become acquainted with Billy Pilgrim, an impish lucky man who fakes it through life.  Pilgrim is a pathetic but intriquing character.  We meet others along the way.  The British POWs that warn of \\"Jerry\\" are hilarious and great sketches of the English. <br /> <br />Vonnegut's description of the bleak landscape of war and of normal life is great.  But the narrative goes in circles the entire book.  There was no progression or path to it.  I understood why Pilgrim had the trauma and the absurdity of the events.  Still there's no movement and every chapter seems the same.  Again, if you've read \\"Jailbird\\" you'll recognize this flaw of his works. <br /> <br />I would instead recommend \\"Cat's Cradle\\", \\"Breakfest Of Champions\\" or \\"Mother Night\\".

You almost have to grow up in such an environment to appreciate this film where long history, deep culture, myth, and imagination has been cultivating for over 3,000 years. I saw this film long before US released it. and I just knew it was going to be BIG one. Hong Kong Original, official version is waay better than American version, although, it is still enjoyable. This film will be a long time to be remembered......WOW~!!!!!

B00005JN0T|2.0|The film it's self it great. The story is interesting. The effects are great, no shock there. The DVD only has 2 special features A \\"making of\\" and commentary. Everything else on the DVD is a bunch of previews. I have never felt the need to write a review of a DVD before but I felt I had to for this one because the DVD is just about the worst one I purchased. If you only care about the film buy it. If you are like me and special features are important don't waste you money. I also worry that the might be makeing a special or collectors edition.
B000002U82|1.0|This should never be classed as ROCK MUSIC. Its bland boring experimental music. WITH NO GUTS! I blame Pink Floyd for throwing ROCK music of its TRUE path. And now look where it is today. AVOID!!!
B000058983|5.0|Forever Changes lives up to all the hype, and then some.  I'd heard for a long time how this  was THE great overlooked album from the 60's, but never believed it to be true.  So, on a whim, I decided I'de buy it and see what all the fuss was about.  I was blown away after the first listen.  I can't believe I've been missing out on this for so long!  For so many years I've been listening to bands like the Doors and the Dead, never knowing that the prototype for such great bands was floating under the radar.  Forever Changes is a splendedly crafted and varied album, from the groovy latin flavor of Alone Again Or, the Doors-esque rocking of A House is not a Hotel, the soothing melodies of Andmoreagain, the delightful psychedelia of The Red Telephone, and the Bob Dylan-meets-rap delivery of Bummer in the Summer.  The orchestration of this album is wonderful, adding to the overall effect very well, while not going overboard like some productions in the period tended to do.  You really get the feeling of the end of an era (the 60's) from this more than any other album that tried to convey such a feeling, and I doubt they were even really gearing towards such an effect.  The cd hasn't left my player since it arrived a couple days ago, and if you're a fan of the era, I have a feeling the same will happen when you get your hands on this gem of an album.  Believe the hype, this is the real deal.  Forever Changes may in fact be one of the best rock albums of all time.

B000002H6C|5.0|there's over 650 reviews for this album here on amazon. most of which  i'm sure say it's the greatest.its much more than that.for many it was the beggining of a journey through this totally extreme music.(by 88 already a decade old)in many ways this album was the end of the genre,i mean who could top it .after this everything changed .in the attepts to take it to the next level many subgenres were born . old thrash bands began to morph into these subgenres or slow down & became more mainstream .saddly, (in my book)matallica went the way of the slowed down mainstreamers .after this ,metallica could have recorded fart noises & sold millions .
B000021YQV|1.0|One of the worst collection of sounds ever slopped onto a disc. Utterly terrible.
B000002UAX|5.0|To the reviewer below who claims this album sounds like \\"DEMO'S\\". Please get your ears checked. This is the greatest album the FAB FOUR ever made. Sure there are some lame tracks on the album. But with an incredible 30 tracks what do you expect? Even the Beatles couldn't make 30 great tracks on one album. What I love about this album above all other post REVOLVER albums is the \\"PURE\\" musicianship.  <br /> <br />I can't believe how precise, musical and full their playing sounds on incredible tracks like :DEAR PRUDENCE: :GLASS ONION: & :BIRTHDAY: I rate this album ahead of even REVOLVER, because its fantastic back to basics QUALITY. I love it, and I think you will too.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|The irony is a sadness that is incapable of laugh ; then , laughs.<br /><br />Above all this is a post -Allen film . Diane Keaton is superb as the famous and reknown writer but emotionally a loser . Her intellectual height is her principal emotive barrier since she is incapable to get a man who navigates in her waters . She is an Athena woman , gifted with sparkling intelligence , dear prudence and necessary wisdom . But it seems to reach that vertex is not enough . It can not be  .

Keaton seems to emerge from a Woody Allen film .<br /><br />In the other hand we have Jack Nicholson a successful executive the beloved seducer without any other duties and even complications in his private life . He represents the mirror male image of Aphrodite . He is a refined man and above all a  powerful personality with charm and discretion he conquers all the possible women . The modern version of the Casanova : the yuppie version of Don Giovanni .<br /><br />In the third corner we have to Amanda Pet an inhibited girl of these times . She is a successful woman and somehow she is the left arm , the aphrodisiac branch visibly missed in her mother .<br /><br />In the fourth side of this square we have Keanu Reeves in a brilliant performance , he is a mature man despite his youth ,. He hasn't got a stable relationship in his social circle . so he watches in Keaton the blind side of Nicholson . He observes in Keaton the happy blending of the experience and the passion . He idealizes Keaton and in his mind Aphrodite is simply resting , not absent .<br /><br />The smart device of the suggestive e-mails between these lovers reveal the lone aspect of their souls  and works out as personal therapy which will allow them suggest what the real human presence sometimes avoids it by several reasons .<br /><br />And the rest runs for you . A very smart script , pleasant dialogues and fine humour with a lovely homage to Casablanca : We will always have Paris .<br /><br />Curiously Diane Keaton made the whole cycle . She stared in 1972 Play it again , Sam, a very clever stylised rhapsody about Casablanca with Woody Allen and directed by Herbert Ross . She plays the role assigned to Ingrid Bergman while woody Allen is chased by Bogart spectre along the film because he lacks the seducer magnetism of Humphrey and so he advises him.<br /><br />Impressive acting for the entire cast and undoubtedly the finest American dramatic comedy in this Century .ca : We will always have Paris .

B000093BDX|4.0|this is a great album this is the best of the beach boys.the first 10 songs could be a greatest hit album.im a big fan.but the only bone to pick is why they left out \\"409\\" and \\"ALL SUMMER LONG\\" but never the less a great collection.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|Whoa momma-just by looking at the cover of this video you know you're in for some serious crossbow action!  Van Helsing totally shoots the dickens out of all sorts of monsters.  I saw this movie in a drive-in and for some reason only had the audio for the movie playing on the next screen (13 Going On 30) and it took me several minutes to figure out what was going on.  If you can read lips though I don't see any reason why this would matter.  Besides, crossbows speak louder than words.   <br /> <br />This movie is supposedly based on a true legend and it would be nice to see more kids named after this true hero in times like these.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I don't consider myself a particularly big fan of Clint Eastwood, at least as an actor. To me, he always seems to play the same kind of character in nearly every movie he's in. Occasionally, he'll find some fresh notes to play within his narrow range, but, despite his legendary status in Hollywood, I would hardly classify him as one of the finest actors of our time (although that probably won't stop Hollywood award shows from honoring him for Lifetime Achievement awards and such). That said, with the films that he's directed that I've seen, I'd dare to say that he might be a better director than actor. I have yet to see his most recent (and much-hyped) film MILLION DOLLAR BABY, but I was deeply sobered by his near-great MYSTIC RIVER (despite its total washout of a mystery plot), and, seeing this Academy Award-winning 1992 film recently, I was no less impressed by this film.    UNFORGIVEN is as de-glamorized a Western movie as you are likely to see. There is no real nobility to be found in any of these characters the way there was with, say, Gary Cooper's Will Kane in HIGH NOON. Eastwood's William Munny, for example, is not a hero, but a broken-down, desperate man who is trying to escape his troubled past. Visually, there are some beautifully pictorial shots of the wide open spaces of the plains bathed in (rather mild) sunlight, but most of the time Eastwood and cinematographer Jack N. Green light the proceedings in a doom-filled atmosphere that might come off as heavy-handed to some, but is totally befitting its theme: how physical violence can be violent to the human soul. On the level of action, there is no exciting buildup to the final showdown, and even as it occurs, there is no glamor to be found, no catharsis. Instead of exhilaration, there is a profound note of tragedy as this film ends. A lot of action movies make you believe that taking violent revenge on someone is a satisfying way of closure. In UNFORGIVEN, Eastwood makes clear that there is no real satisfaction to be found in any kind of violence, provoked or not. This is perhaps an important film to see simply as a startling corrective to all the soulless spectacles of violence that seem to be the trademark of action films these days, movies that make you cheer violence and gets you in a sadistic mood, whereas Eastwood stresses its ugliness, both physically and mentally.     UNFORGIVEN is helped immensely---for once---by Eastwood's own performance. Technically, he approaches his role in basically the same way he did with his Man With No Name performances in those Sergio Leone spaghetti Westerns---tough, gruff, distanced. This William Munny is not much of a stretch for him. And yet there is an extra weariness to his performance here; you get the sense that he is trying to resist his more violent impulses, that he is always trying to tell himself, \\"I'm just here to get money, I'm just here to get money.\\" Eastwood also has one scene which seems to cut through his steely persona: as he is in the midst of a delirious fever, there is a real, poignant touch of desperate emotion in his voice as he exclaims that he sees his own late wife, among other delirium-induced visions. That one scene is perhaps the closest I've seen Eastwood as an actor approach some emotion other than just anger. The other performances are good, but Eastwood's, in its own way, is rather special.    UNFORGIVEN is admittedly a little plodding, but then Eastwood has never been one of those showboating directors who indulge in style for its own sake. He is more concerned with characters than with mere action here, and his deliberate approach to the material gives his themes room to breathe and grow in the mind of the receptive viewer. This is a powerful examination of the ugliness of violence, and it will certainly stay with you after it's over. Recommended.

B000001DTM|1.0|This album was the downfall of Irelands finest. They let their quality control and integrity drop with this dodo. And haven't recovered since.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|This is an excellent movie with a good cast.  It does not seem like a 3 hour movie at all.  Eric Bana stole the show as Hektor and kudos to Peter O'toole for his part.  I don't like Brad Pitt and still don't but he did ok in his part as Achilles and the fight scenes were terrific.  The rest of the cast did very well although I just couldn't agree with some of the casting decisions in the movie.  All that being written, this movie is better than Braveheart and Gladiator in terms of action and the movie keeping one's interest.  While those other 2 movies might and I said might be better dramatic pictures, they did tend to slow down in spots, Troy does not.  Very much worth purchasing  <br />or at least rent it!  Finally, the quality of the dvd is very good as is the sound.  It comes with a bonus disc which is an added plus.  Go out and get this movie.
B000005JA8|5.0|All of the music on TMR, aside from the vocals and sax squealing of the Captain, is precisely structured.  Every note is exactly where it's meant to be. <br />Listen to a another version of TMR on the 5CD \\"Grow Fins\\", minus vocals, recorded on a different occasion.  There is no doubt. <br />Whether you like it or not, it's a staggering achievement.   <br />And like it I do, it swings, it rocks, it irritates, it does a number of other things that there are no words for. <br />An unholy alliance between the stream of conciousness, un-filtered art of Beefheart and the amazing dedication and musicianship of a group of teenagers taken to their physical and mental limits to produce this totally unique work. <br />It's not my favorite record, or even my favorite Beefheart record, and people are welcome, as always, to hate it, but it irks me to read the preposterous, ignorant comments about \\"non-musicians\\".  Perhaps those folks should stick with the fine musicianship of Kenny G.

There is no denying that most people either enjoy or despise this movie; this is probably because some people don't enjoy the ironic humor in the movie. However, I think there's something for everyone! I mean, who doesn't have a little Napoleon in them? Face it, we're all dorks; some just try to hide it, and some wear it on their sleeve. Also, this movie teaches good lessons, like: you should always be yourself, and movies can succeed without swear words. (The worst word in Napoleon is probably heck). This movie is definetely worth it, just be prepared to see something off-beat, or you won't like it.
B000000P17|4.0|I have to admit that while I was immensely in love with Guns N' Roses' music when I was first introduced to them back in 1992 (as a pre-teen, when their _Use Your Illusion_ albums were garnering attention), the love transmutated into strong ambivalence *very* shortly afterwards. And in the decade-plus since then, the ambivalence still remains: the one half of me thought this band had some real talent; Slash was an excellent guitarist, and Axl had a voice with attitude. Their music was *very* primal and visceral, and the perfect music to listen to if you wanted to blow off some steam, or if you just wanted to get energized. It was balls-to-the-walls gutsy, dirty rock n' roll in the vein of The Rolling Stones or Aerosmith, but (arguably) a bit more extreme than both bands. On the other hand, I found the excessive whining, ranting and profanity used by Axl and co., to be nothing more than childish exercises in vulgarity, just for the sake of vulgarity, although some of it was good for comical value; some of it sure made me laugh (and btw, I'm not offended by profanity, but in much of Guns N' Roses' output, this aspect just got a little old and predictable *real* fast.)<br /><br />To this day, anytime I listen to a Guns N' Roses album, these exact thoughts and feelings (listed above) run through me.<br /><br />With that said, I own both of their ambitious and diverse _Use Your Illusion_ albums, and I love those more than the raw musings found on _Appetite For Destruction_. Which brings us to 1993's _The Spaghetti Incident?_; an album consisting *solely* of cover versions to many punk anthems of the day. For my money, the cover of classic soul group The Skyliners' \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" is probably the most interesting and impressive on here: rarely would you expect Guns N' Roses to cover an R&B/Soul song. For them to cover it quite well is even *less* expected. Yet, how they pull it off is quite a testament to the talent these guys had. My other favorites are the cover of The Damned's \\"New Rose\\" (where Duff McKagan references Joe Jackson at the very beginning of the song), Soundgarden's \\"Big Dumb Sex,\\" Nazareth's \\"Hair Of The Dog\\" (where we hear a reference to the main riff of The Beatles' \\"Day Tripper\\" at the end of the track), and the furious (and hilarious) profanity-soaked cover of Fear's \\"I Don't Care About You.\\"<br /><br />Yet, the album doesn't end there: there is a hidden track which is a cover of a Charles Manson song.

079284131X|5.0|I'm the type of person who loves horror movies, but is never scared of them and ends up laughing their guts out during the movie. But when I first saw Child's play 2 when I was 7, I was drawn into this franchise. But then I saw Child's Play on Sci-Fi in 2002, I had a good laugh out of it and fright too. Child's play 1 is probably the best Chucky film in the series, and is a good movie to watch if you like those comedy/horror films with the little freaky dolls running around. Rent Child's Play 2 after you see this one, and avoid 3, Bride of Chucky, Son of Chucky, and the rest of the sequels.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I started hearing about Franz Ferdinand, and after hearing Take Me Out and This Fire, I had to get the CD. The first track, Jacqueline, is a bit strange in the opening, but it gets good later in the song. Every track is awesome, and they all have a bit of a different sound, which makes the CD incredible! Not having this CD is a crime, so i suggest buying it! I can't wait for their next release!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie/documentary should be mandatory viewing for every American.  Whether or not you agree with it or uphold its veracity is patently immaterial.  The important point is the \\"looking glass\\".   <br /> <br />Every day or each night we are shown one view, one perspective by the collective media. Some may not want to admit or even hear this, but we are given a biased view of the news, indeed the world.  I am sorry to tell you that the world is not black and white.  For example, how do we distinguish the \\"bad\\" guys from the civilians in Iraq?  Seems like a pretty easy job in simplistic land, but in reality there is a lot of grey.  <br /> <br />This was the first ANYTHING that dared to question the status quo and consequently the Bush administration and its policies.   <br /> <br />Think about that for a second: the first \\"anything\\" that questioned the administration.  You can call it a work of fiction if you like, but even then it was still the first anything that questioned the administration. <br /> <br />How many of you have studied history?  If you have, you can use examples from political, military, sociological, even financial history to easily and conclusively demonstrate that \\"bad\\" things happen whenever someone or group is left unchecked or even unquestioned.  US Political history example - Nixon's uncontrollable ego and subsequent criminal actions.  Military examples - Where to start? The phrase \\"groupthink\\" was coined because of military blunders.  Sociological example - Tuskeegee Syphilus Experiments in the US.  Financial example - Nick Lesson and Barclays, Enron, WorldCom, every single financial analyst on CNBC in the late 1990's. <br /> <br />So perhaps, just maybe, history has told us that unchecked power is not a good thing, and because of this any attempt to question that unchecked power should be well-received by all men, especially in a time of war.     <br /> <br />PS - Think for yourself-It is more laborious, but it just might save your life sometime.
B00000634L|5.0|Well, I heard Drinking in LA, the single once it went out, and it was ok, not really liked it by that time, but normal. Somehow, a friend gave me the CD (Glee) to listen to it, and at firts i just tried it like two times, i`m not the kind of person who listen to everything, i really enjoy music but i do not have doors opened for everything on the market. <br />One day i was driving nowhere and put the cd, and somehow i felt so full of this energy, because from the firts song i heard till the most strangely made  end, it was just amazing the way this group of people made possible the mix of many different styles in music, and make it sound just amazing. <br />Guess is one of the records you should keep and save to show to next generations and say: \\"Hey, this is music\\".
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|First of all, I liked this movie.  It has a great cast Brad Pitt, Peter o' Toole, and Nigel Terry.  If you like the movie Excalibur, I suggest you give this movie a chance.  For those who say it's not as good as the Lord of The Rings.  If you wait for something to be as good as The Lord of the Rings you'll be waiting a long time.  I have no problem saying that this movie is on par with Gladiator.  As I said if you like the movie Excalibur, you have a good chance of liking this movie also.  Peter O'Toole is great as always.  It's nice to see he Nigel Terry again also.  (Excalibur, and the TV show Covington Cross.)  If you like this movie you might also like Helen of Troy.
0767836324|5.0|I have to admit I love this movie and I do not know if I'll ever be able to refuse a chance to watch it. Is it absolute perfection and worthy of the award for best picture?? No. Is it a movie that is extremely well done, with a strong cast, and a great plot? Yes. Okay, it puts an odd twist on the Peter Pan story...he has grown up and lost his inner child. The original story of Peter Pan has been bent and twisted and mangled so many times over the past 100 years, however, that this adaptation does not bother me at all...in fact, it adds to the movie's meaning. If Peter Pan can grow up and forget how to be a child, then it can happen to anyone. Any one of us can lose that joy and innocence we find in the freedom of childhood. The good news is we can always find it again if we look hard enough. It takes some time and some hard work in this movie to help Peter realize the boy that he is inside...but he does get there.He rediscovers those things that truly made him happy and free in life. Children are always entertained by this movie and it has some very true themes and lessons for adults to learn. It is one of my favorite films, one of the most under-rated movies out there today, and it should be considered a modern classic. It is just too late to worry about Barrie's original tale being tampered with....it is beyond repair at this point. My advice is to get that book, read it, teach the original story to your children...then enjoy this one as a family. You will all enjoy it very much!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This was a great film/documentary.  It is rare that a layman is able to learn from a master.  Like him or not, McNamara was present and made some of the most important decisions mankind ever made.  His experience is almost incomprehendible, and what he shares with the viewer will benefit mankind if we actually listen and learn from the lessons of history. <br /> <br />As an example, towards the end of the work, McNamara states that when he met with his Vietnamese counterpart, the officer told McNamara that the fatal flaw was that the US looked at Vietnam as a country which was going to bend over and accept Communism.  This view, however, was wrong and the Vietnamese really viewed the conflict as a war against occupiers, beit Chinese or Americans.  Hence, McNamara says that one of the lessons is to sympathize with your enemy.  Don't feel bad for them, but understand them.  If not, you go with the wrong context and face incredibly negative consequences. <br /> <br />Too bad those who took our boys and girls to Iraq, didn't watch \\"Fog of War\\" or at least didn't learn from any of the wisdom contained within.  <br /> <br />\\"It's deja vu all over again?\\" <br /> <br />PS - McNamara's lessons are true for pursuits far removed from the battlefield, but you already knew that, right?
B00002DE4H|5.0|1987. What an album. Covering the first 12 singles they released. I first heard this back in 1988, and thought it sounded \\"quite good\\" of course, a few years passed, and being no longer a 15 year old with no money, I bought it. And Wow.<br /><br />Whether you are going out for an evening, coming home from an evening out, or just chilling out in the afternoon. Just play it.<br /><br />The riffs of ALL the songs are quite simply fantastic, they embody everything that is right about music. The terrific Blue Monday has been around for decades, and is still a club anthem. Bizarre Love Triangle, a masterpiece that cant fail to lift you up. Ceremony; Temptation; State of the Nation all awesome sounds.<br /><br />To surmise, if you dont have it, get it. Just listen once. You wont be disappointed. New Order are one of the most influential bands of the 80s, and its a testament to their greatness that this remains one of the must have albums of any era.<br /><br />And for all you younger generation, yes, this album is nearly 20 years old, its worth it. Buy it. You will know at least half the songs on here.
B000001TVD|4.0|Funkadelic are a band that do what it says on the tin if there ever was one: Maggot Brain is a superb cross between funk and pyschadelica. The album is diverse, however, from the drugged-up guitar wigout of the title track to the edgy, metal-influenced 'Super Stupid'; the closest to an appealing single, the glorious funk-soul of 'Hit It And Quit It'; the more straight-forward soul of 'Can You Get To That' and the insane closer 'Wars of Armageddon', which is simply all over the place in the best possible way, the closest here to a direct cross between funk and psychadelica. All five of these tracks are exemplary: the two remaining average by comparison. Nevertheless, this is a tremendous and groundbreaking recording that is truly an essential for any record collection.
B000002UY5|5.0|All the reviews are right, it is a phenomenal album. And yes it does takes a few listen throughs to appreciate it. Every song is great, especially \\"Tones of Home\\" and \\"Paper Scratcher\\". There has been no other band with so much dynamics and energy. Yes, Blind Melon will change your life. If you would like to daze away to a place no one has known, buy this album.
B00030590I|4.0|This movie takes place around the time of Chinese unification, where many provinces were forced through war to come together.  Loosely based on a story from around that time, a Nameless warrior played by Jet Li slays three enemies of the state and presents their swords to the emperor.  Narrated by the Emperor of Qin (strongest emperor of pre-Modern China) and Nameless, the plot is based around Nameless's three fights.  However, simplicity is thrown out as the Emperor questions to see if that is Nameless's true motive. <br /> <br />The story plays in a decently complex fashion as we travel with the words of Nameless or the Emperor to events that either were or might have been depending on Nameless's honesty.  However, at heart there is more to this story than just that, because each of Nameless's adventures (real or unreal) tell tales of sacrifice and love, for people and for nations. <br /> <br />The usage of colors was spectacular and made the fight scenes that much more beautiful.  The only lack luster component of the film to me is that now almost all of the fighting seems like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" all over again.  That was novel then, but not so novel now. <br /> <br />Overall though, I still really appreciated the story.  I especially found it fascinating how the story wound around Nameless's intentions for seeing the Emperor.   <br /> <br />(This movie was inspired by a strong sense of nationalism, maybe for what China was like then as compared to now.  That is still a strong component though and whether you liked the movie or not it is still important to acknowledge the underlying them of patriotism for China.)
6303998704|3.0|The first time I saw this better than average 'B' film was when I was fairly impressionable. Seeing it recently, it didn't have the same effect and the flaws were more obvious. One can understand how some  may say it's one of those 'so bad it's good' films but I think it is not really that bad. In fact the concept was great: a woman who dies in a car crash wanders the Earth in search of her soul, pursued by a dead man-apparently. The car radio only plays weird organ music; on the horizon she sees a haunting looking carnival dance hall ( or in her mind's eye); she gets sacked for her 'lack of soul' when playing the organ at a church; she has weird experiences at every turn; she can't connect with people and seems dissociated. Eventually her dead pursuer lures her to the abandoned carnival where she joins in the dance of the dead. No explanations, no blood and gore required, no mushy love interests, no high profile actors all adds to the haunting flavour. This movie has all the ingredients of something special but, sadly, on second look it falls well short of what I remember as an eerily haunting film in my youth. But it still deserves credit because the idea alone is worth gold. It is typical of Hollywood not to fully exploit this idea with subtlety but to use over the top 'in-your-face' concepts instead.
0312263120|2.0|It has its moments but if you have read Da Vinci  COde, this is big letdown. <br />Its very predictable too.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I like Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Motorhead, Metallica. Slipknot is the new generation's answer to the hard rock scene - except now we've entered a new hybrid of nu-metal (Limp Bizkit), rap metal (Rage Against the Machine), hard rock, thrash rock, etc. Slipknot is a bit too much for me - frankly it's so loud and angry it gets on my nerves after a while. It's not even singing - it's just yelling. And yeah, I sat through some pretty rough stuff. <br /> <br />Also, I consider some of there stuff to be very mainstream and not far away from Limp Bizkit despite what they may say - they're not very talented. Corey doesn't sing - he yells. The guitar playing is less than awe-inspiring (as it should be, and isn't). Their stage costumes are, honestly, rather silly (I mean come on...they make Buckethead look like a fashion icon) and their constant bad-mouthing of anyone they disagree with grates. (Although that doesn't bear any merit towards judging their CD, it's still something I don't like about them.) <br /> <br />Their music isn't so great but a few songs are good - Duality in particular is the best off this album. <br /> <br />Overall it's just not really to my tastes and I think this album is definitely a move towards the commercial scene for Slipknot. Many of their die-hard fans will disagree with me. But frankly I just think this isn't so far from Limp Bizkit as they might want you to think.
B00000I8UF|5.0|Of the all the spectacular albums Art Blakey did with his Jazz Messengers for Blue Note, I feel that this is his finest.  This edition of the Messengers includes: Blakey at his very best on drums, the then upcoming Lee Morgan on trumpet, the very underrated composer/tenorist Benny Golson, the funky composer/pianist Bobby Timmons, and the very solid Jyme Merritt on bass.  This is truly an amazing line-up and the interplay among the band is just superb.  This fine album starts off with one of Bobby Timmons's best compositions and probably his most known, the title track.  It is truly one of those tunes that you will find yourself humming at unexpected moments, it's just that catchy!  It is then followed by two superb Benny Golson compositions which are both played a lot today.  \\"Are You Real?\\" and \\"Along Came Betty\\" really show off Golson's skills as a composer and equally show off the awesome soloing skills of Morgan, Golson, and Timmons.  Benny's next composition, \\"The Drum Thunder Suite\\", is a spectacular suite written to feature Blakey of course.  It is comprised of three themes, the first is  thundering and fast-paced, the second and third themes are slower but do not take away from the intenseness of the title track, it then concludes with a reprise of the first theme.  \\"Blues March\\" is probably one of Blakey's most-known tunes and is one of his signatures.  Everyone present is in high-form on this track and it really shows off Blakey's superb technique (as all the other tracks do!).  The album then concludes with my favorite rendition of \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" and is then followed with an alternate take of \\"Moanin'\\".  This is truly one of jazz's most essential cd's and you can not possibly call yourself a fan of Blue Note or Blakey without owning this spectacular gem, so order it now!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album is possibly the bets Thrash album ever! The drumming is AMAZING, as is the guitar work, the bass is okay, the lyrics are cool, and the singing is decent.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|<br />Okay, if you tend to like mainstream comedies, you're going to HATE this film, as some reviewers here seem to.  <br /> <br />If, on the other hand, you've got a love of quiet irony, this is easily the funniest film to arrive in a long time. It has almost no plot, no overt \\"jokes\\", and brilliantly deadpan performances. This is a heady mix that is sure to go over the heads of many viewers used to being beaten over the head with punchlines, but if you get it, you'll love it.
B00003CWL6|3.0|I am the first to admit I watch a lot of movies. In fact, I watch far more movies than the average person ever should. That I don't burn through DVD players every few months or wear eyeglasses the size of a mountaintop telescope is amazing considering I mix my movie experiences with healthy doses of reading and studying for my master's degree in history. I came to the conclusion long ago that I need my hour and a half a day movie to relieve stress. And since I avoid broadcast television like the plague, spending a couple of hours with a movie ensures I stay plugged into the all important pop culture conduits that crisscross every level of our society. Despite what most people say, movies and movie watching will tell you more about the world you live in than any other source of information. One need go no further than the movies, although I would recommend books as well, to understand the history of modern America. Take the 1990s, for example. No other film sums up the decade of political correctness, the Clintons, and the culture wars better than \\"American Beauty.\\" How you look at this film depends entirely on your opinion of that decade.<br /><br />\\"American Beauty\\" tells the story of the Burnham family, specifically patriarch Lester (Kevin Spacey), matriarch Carolyn (Annette Bening), and daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Set in a place the lunkheads in Hollywood hate with the heat of a million suns, suburbia, the movie begins with Lester speaking in voiceover. He tells us that he died, and he tells us that he will show us why he died. O.k., that's an interesting way to hook the viewer. And since Spacey's a pretty talented actor, I'll keep watching. The Burnham household is not a haven for happy campers. Lester slaves away all day at some phone/marketing job that he obviously hates. Wife Carolyn spends her time competing with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) in the dog eat dog world of real estate. Jane Burnham is a teenager obviously unhappy with her physical appearance since we see her checking out plastic surgery sites on the Internet. Although the Burnham family does not yet know it, their lives are about to transform in significant ways. It all starts when Lester loses his position at the firm due to a restructuring. Fortunately for him, he knows some sordid information about his employer that allows him to walk out with a hefty severance package.<br /><br />Lester's change--let's call it a regression to the halcyon days of his youth--isn't due solely to his dismissal at work. Jane's attractive friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) captured Lester's eye, and when he overhears her make a comment about how good looking he is, Burnham decides to embark on a radical regimen of weightlifting to improve his physique. Lester also takes a stand against his overbearing wife for the first time in years, which eventually drives Carolyn into the arms of an unlikely lover. In the meantime, Lester also buys a hotrod, finds a job at a fast food restaurant, and begins to dally in drugs with the help of neighborhood dealer and new next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Jane falls into the orbit of the enigmatic Ricky as well, and the two strike up a rather unusual relationship in which both can find solace from their emotional pain. Ricky's life is far from perfect; he must constantly deal with his physically and psychologically abusive former military officer father, referred to as the Colonel (Chris Cooper). The entire film centers on how these various people interact with one another.<br /><br />When \\"American Beauty\\" came out in 1999, we all heard the endless panegyrics praising every aspect of the picture. Those \\"in the know\\" proclaimed it a modern masterpiece, a sublime objet d'art that cut to the core of the modern American existence. Uh...no. I'll accept the argument that Kevin Spacey turned in a stellar performance as a man so tired of his dreary existence that he seeks refuge in the comfortable memories of his teenage years. I'll also accept the claim that Wes Bentley does a fine job in the difficult role of Ricky Fitts. I think all of the performers did a good job with their respective parts. But \\"American Beauty\\" as a modern masterpiece? An insightful look into the vacuous core of modern America? Sure, if you're a left-winger who thinks America is a horrible place to live. According to this film, if you're a member of a traditional American family living in the suburbs you will never be truly happy. You will never find fulfillment in anything you do because your existence is pretentious and emotionally stilted. Moreover, it's been a long time since I've seen a film that harbors this much hatred for the armed services. According to \\"American Beauty,\\" military men are pure evil because they collect guns, National Socialist regalia, physically abuse their family members, and are deeply hypocritical about very personal issues. The film makes sure that it draws a distinct connection between military service and these traits; it hits you over the head with it repeatedly. I could go on and on.<br /><br />Extras on this \\"Award Edition\\" DVD include behind the scenes stuff, a commentary track with the director and writer, storyboard presentations, two trailers, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and production notes. I think I can still give the film three stars solely for the great performances, the even better score, and good atmosphere (love that opening shot swooping down the street).

B00006RAKP|4.0|As it is, Elton John Was a pop rock genius. But there'ss a big difference between the seventies and the eighties and beyond Elton. While in the seventies he released some great records, later he just released some great songs. The first disc is full of great songs. Tiny dancer is wonderful, with a dramatic feel and awesome chorus, Rocket man is one great piece of a rock ballad with great arrangements, Saturday night's alright is a furious guitar driven rocker,  Someone saved my life tonight is gorgeous in all its musical pomposity, Bennie and the Jets is pure fun.. But the disc nr. two: who needs a lame Elveis like ballad? And a sappy melancholic love song like Nikita? Elton has done so much better ballads before. Oh and the oOnne is way too overblown. But still Sacrifice, which is his best 90's ballad is here as is the quite new I want love which comes close to it and you also get one pleasant 80's rocker I'm still standing. But I miss songs like Skyline Pigeon and Funeral for a friend/Love lies bleeding or Madman across the water. Songs like these should be on the third cd. No hits, but still important to show Elton's diversity and songwriting skills. But this is I think the best non box set collection awailable
B00005JN7O|5.0|For me, this film was nothing short of stunning!  Combining elements from the classic film serials with modern technology to produce a timeless look and feel, this film moves along at a nice clip with lots of action and subtle comedic moments.  I felt exhilarated after seeing this and was highly entertained.  I see lots of potential for this type of film making, something I felt when I saw the first Star Wars film (though the magic is gone from the Lucas' franchise) - I hope to see more of the Sky Captain type of story telling...
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|For some reason, Gladiator with Russell Crowe has been the uber-epic fix for people who want their storytelling rooted in history. I didn't even like it but every film that looks like a period piece is all of a sudden fodder for \\"not better than Gladiator\\" comments. While Troy is more of a spectacle than that film, it's still not a powerhouse the film wants to be. <br /> <br />The basics of Troy, based loosely or exactly depending on how you're watching, on Homer's poem The Iliad, a way too long poem about an affair between Paris, prince of Troy and Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. After a celebration of Troy and Sparta being friends, the people from Troy hed back home, bringing Helen with them. Menelaus finds out, plays the anger-stricken husband so what does he do? What any other man would do: get the king of Greece, Agememnon, to command an army against Troy of course. <br /> <br />Among the king's warriors is Achilles, a well-known and arrogant soldier. While all soldiers are loyal to the king, he questions him, like why would the king send tens of thousands of men just for a girl, or Troy's beliefs in the gods. Among Troy's ranks are Hector, another well-known soldier but less arrogant and more reluctant to fight if the case doesn't call for it. After the opening arrival on the beach, Achilles captures Bresias, an Apollo server, who he ends up falling for.  <br /> <br />It's funny how the basics of the film are 2 kids deciding to love each other and run away together only to bring death and mayhem in doing so. A huge epic story told through the eyes of teenagers not thinking things through clearly. <br /> <br />As for the performances, the only 3 I liked were Peter O'Toole, playing the king of Troy; Rose Byrne(Bresias), who somehow manages to make a so-so film worth watching and make you feel symphathetic towards like in Wicker Park, even if she's vastly underused. The last one being Eric Bana, who was rather bland in Hulk, but gives the right amount ofpathos and energy to a very static character. As for the others? Well, as for the 2 lovers, you wouldn't be able to stomach their performances on a bad NBC show, let alone here. <br /> <br />As far as the effects are concerned, maybe Lord of the Rings spoiled me but seeing 70,000 men fight doesn't have that wowness that Pelennor Fields battle had in Return of the King. And of course, right before the battle we get another \\"they will never take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!\\" wannabe pre-battle speech, which is getting more and more common since Braveheart's release. <br /> <br />All in all, you want to like this film for the amount of time and effort that was put into it, but like a car, it's got to perform well no matter how it looks and this let's say breaks down half the time.
B00008NRL8|5.0|This recording is a nice fusion between the \\"classic\\" and \\"modern\\", combining the best elements from both - which provides for fun dance music, as well as something that is both relaxing and enjoyable to listen to.
B00005JKG5|4.0|I was all of three years old when Flashdance was released in the spring of 1983.  However, while I was too young to see the movie, I knew the soundtrack by heart thanks to my older sister.  My mom finally decided I would be allowed to watch the movie when it was aired on NBC in early 1988.  Needless to say I loved it after all the years of waiting. <br /> <br />Everyone knows the plot,  welder by day, dancer by night.  Jennifer Beals was an unknown when she made this movie, and the movie transformed her (briefly) into a sensation.   She had a hard time following this film up,  but luckily due to Showtime's The L Word, she is back on top of her game. <br /> <br />Flashdance is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination,  if anything, it's some of the worst character development (save Beals' Alex) a movie this big has ever seen.  But all is forgiven when the music comes on.   This movie was made when MTV (when MTV meant music) was beginning to take off... this was in many ways like a series of music videos interspread with story.  From Maniac to Gloria to What A Feeling, this movie emphasised on music in a way unseen except maybe Saturday Night Fever. <br /> <br />I have seen Flashdance countless times, and I rushed out to buy the DVD the same week it came out, because I wanted it that badly. <br /> <br />I hope Paramount will give us a special edition DVD along the lines of Footloose... Beals is hot again, they can always bring her in for an interview or something like that.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Nice to see such a well crafted tale of the high seas come back to the screen - it has been too long since this type of story has been told.  This movie makes it worth the wait!
B000002ITW|5.0|'Four Way Street' ranks right up there with all the best double-live rock albums available, including the live Fillmore East recordings made by Derek and the Dominos and The Allman Brothers.  Interestingly, several tracks from these Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young discs are also drawn from concerts in early June of 1970 at the Fillmore East, as well as shows at the L.A. Forum in late June and a July 5 show at the Chicago Auditorium.  A review of the setlists from these shows reveals that this two-disc set contains the complete basic show from this tour, although some rarities remain in the vault, including Still's 'As I Come of Age', Nash's 'Simple Man', Crosby's 'Guinnevere' and Young's 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart'.  But with these four talented artists at their peak, there was more than enough quality compositions to go around.  In fact, the song listing fails to note the inclusion of Still's 'For What It's Worth' in the '49 Bye-Byes/America's Children' medley, and a classic bonus track offers a rare acoustic medly from Young consisting of 'The Loner', 'Cinnamon Girl' and 'Down By the River'. <br /> <br />It's fortunate that we have this record of CSNY while they were at their peak, and when these particular songs were freshly minted, since some have lost their magic mantra as the counterculture movement faded into the 1970's.  These songs are performed with a vibrant urgency they would never be accorded again.  The band sincerely believed the music was changing the world.  So it's with welcome ears that fans of this band, who still hear the same songs performed in concert today, albeit in a more restrained capacity, may take in recordings made in their heyday.  In fact, the events at Kent State University that inspired Neil Young to write the song 'Ohio' occured less than a month before that song was first performed on this tour, in late May of 1970.  Similarly, the recording of 'Black Queen' offered here preceded the release of Stephen Still's first solo album by several months, the album that contains the quintessential version of that song.  Given the impact this band had on our social consciousness, these are epic, historical recordings. <br /> <br />Disc 1 is entirely acoustic, and a bit hit and miss.  It's a shame and a bit of a farce to list 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' as the opening track since we only get the concluding 33 seconds of the performance.  Since Graham Nash and Gerry Tolman saw fit to add bonus tracks to this digitally remastered version of the original vinyl albums, they certainly should have corrected this omission and filled in the complete track.  One of the finest songs on the first disc follows, however, with Neil Young reclaiming a Buffalo Springfield track on which he had originally handed the lead vocal over to Richie Furay.  This beautiful acoustic number, 'On the Way Home', is a Neil Young tune all the way, and the quality is multiplied several times by the addition of CSN's supporting harmonies.  Young's acoustic, four minute version of 'Cowgirl In the Sand', Crosby's 'The Lee Shore', and Nash's 'Chicago' are other highlights.  Some songs will make you want for the studio versions however, such as Still's 'Love the One You're With'. <br /> <br />The real attraction to this double-cd set, however, is the second disc, packed grandly with one terrific electric jam after another.  The vocals aren't always up to par, as on 'Carry On', but the intensity is consistanly overwhelming, and the instrumentation impressively sharp.  In fact, Neil Young and Stephen Stills, often criticized for trying to grandstand one over the other, trade superb guitar riffs back and forth like a well-oiled machine.  The jams on the two lengthy tracks, 'Southern Man' and 'Carry On', not only speak volumes about the pair's talents on lead guitar, but offer repeated themes that speak a musical language not often experienced.  They tell stories with sound.  These thirteen and fourteen minute workouts fly by like two and one-half minute standards on AM radio.  David Crosby is under-appreciated as a rhythm guitarist, and together with Johnny Barbatta on drums and Calvin 'Fuzzy' Samuels on bass, form a stern backbone for Stills and Young to ride their guitar solo's over.  Still's surefire/spitfire solo's on Nash's 'Pre-Road Downs', Crosby's inspired vocals on 'Long Time Gone', and true-to-the-era lyrics such as \\"tin soldiers and Nixon coming\\" from Young's 'Ohio' add dimension upon dimension to this treasure trove. <br /> <br />I was just a bit too young to be hitting the concert scene when CSNY unleashed this monumental tour, but I count myself fortunate to be able to hear this unprecedented mix of reverb, revolution, rhythm, folk, blues and pop that shook our culture at the turn of two of the most tumultuous decades the United States has ever seen.  Lyrics are included in the booklet.  It is a must-have for any collector of classic rock music.  Enjoy for the rest of time.    <br /> <br />
0786249641|2.0|Large print is great.  But the book was not edited well for spelling errors.  Examples: Sophas(sofas), chuse(choose), teaze(tease), shew(show), croud(crowd), staid(stayed), shewing(showing), any thing(anything), any body(anybody), every thing(everything), uncontrouled(uncontrolled). These errors occured over and over again.  It was pretty annoying.
B00062RCBW|2.0|Go ahead and order them if you must, but the transfer to DVD is terrible. To get all the episodes on as few disks as possible, they either compressed them too much or just didn't take care in doing a quality job. I can't watch them in full screen mode without horrendous artifacts. So I have to reduce screen size to make it look as good as it did on television. I shouldn't have to do that.
B000002L9J|4.0|The Smiths are an acquired taste.  A very frustrating acquired taste.  First, you have the soul-sapping production that is somewhere between gutless indie cleanness and over the top synthizer pandering.  The drums are given hefty reverb and the bass is kind of gutless.  And on the songs like There is A Light that Never goes out, the strings and whatever else all sound like they came out of a keyboard, which dates some of these songs, well if you let it.  This album is probably my second favorite behind Strangeways.  Maybe only because the latter has Girlfriend in a Coma.  This does have the most underrated Smiths song on it though, Some Girls are Bigger than Others.  The song is pretty typical Morissey winking sarcasm, but Marrs guitar playing has never been more sublimely confident and melodic.  There is emo posing in the form of I know It's Over which is pretty shameless in its over-the-top theatrics in the form of Morrisseys yelps.  But I think Rolling Stone had it right when it came to this album, and they aren't right about much.  The Smiths just knocked out one of the funniest rock albums ever.  Frankly Mr. Shankly is pretty hilarious.  There is A Light That Never goes out actually straightfaces a line about getting hit by a double decker bus, if you can't see the humor in it, then you really do need to take some Prozac.  Thats what I thought the whole emo movement was anyway, a bunch of guys who heard There is A Light and took it too seriously.  Anyway, enough.  If you are at all curious, then you need to buy it.
B000099T2L|4.0|... With A LOT of talent- and I wasn't disapointed when I got this album.Although all of these songs were very nice- I have to admit I liked the songs in the beginning, more than the songs in the end. They got my attention more, and they were songs I could listen to all the time. But the songs in the end were more slow, and much more serious- and I guess I kinda lost interest. <br /> <br />But, none-the-less, this was a very good debut album for Beyonce to come out with, and I applaud her for doing soooo well!
B00005AR3G|5.0|I am not a Disney fan. The only Disney film I have unconditionally liked is Sleeping Beauty. I barely tolerated The Beauty and the Beast, and hate most of the rest of the bunch. <br />Why, I definitely loved this movie, which does not look at all as a   movie for children, being full of historical, ethnografic, social, sexual, political, zoological references which should be lost on them. Strangely enough, my four years old son is crazy for it too.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Sorry folks, but I just cant help myself here. I tried painfully, month after month, to avoid giving a one star review to a Simple Plan  cd, despite how annoying they were. Well, they have finally pushed me to the limit. The song \\"Welcome To My Life\\", is one of the worst, feel sorry for me because I'm soooo alone in this huge world, songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are terrible, and irritating. Listening to it was embarrasing, and I find it stupid that today's youth and teens listen to that garbage. At least in death metal, if you dont like the lyrics, the hardcore, brutal music makes up for it. It doesent here, because this is just another cleverly marketed boy band with guitars who can barely play their instruments. I doubt these little pop punkers went through anything so bad that they have to write a song about it. Its just the \\"in\\" thing to write a song complaining about nothing or their stupid little girlfriend leaving them (also heard in Dashboard Confessional; another awful band). You may say this is something for teens to relate to, but if it is, then they are not very mature and that saddens me. Go pick up a Suicidal Tendencies album instead of this offensive filth.
B000092ZYY|2.0|Although the album is radiohead's weakest I think, the recording package is definitely the worst ever concieved.  Buy the regular version because the \\"special edition\\" is a films paper thing that doesn't fit in any cd racks, doesn't protect the cd, and it costs more.
B0002858YS|4.0|There are a lot of mixed reviews that you'll find here.  And all of the reviews are extremely one sided, they either love em, or they hate em.  I thought I'd throw in my two cents and try and give a somewhat unbiased review.   <br /> <br />In all honesty, this genre, or pop, pretty much any music \\"fad\\" is normally the last thing I'd ever think about buying when I go to a record store.  And yes, I'll agree with a lot of these people that hate The Killers in the fact that they probably aren't the most talented musicians.  No graduates from Julliard here.  But the music is incredibly catchy, and you have to give them respect simply because they can come up with something that a lot of people like, and can relate to.  It's not always about being a virtuoso. <br /> <br />I also noticed a lot of reviews mentioning how meaningless and lethargic they thought the lyrics were.  Tell me when does everything have to make sense in order for you to like it, or find it acceptable?  You go to a museum and you see an odd sculpture, you're not going to criticize it just because you can't interpret what the artist was going for are you? <br /> <br />With all that said, if you have enough curiosity about this band, this album, to read these reviews, then you should give it a listen.  The Killers fall well out of the bounds of music that I'd listen to on a daily basis, but after hearing this album, my tastes have broadened, and I'm definitely looking forward to what they'll have in store for them in the future.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 of the movies along with some of the extra features.  I didn't really notice most of the changes other than the very last one, and it doesn't really effect the movies that bad. <br /> <br />I would say Return of the Jedi was the best in the trilogy followed by Empire Strikes Back.  It's the must have for every single Star Wars fan on earth.  It's the trilogy of the century.
B000000OUW|5.0|This album is by far one of the greatest metal albums ever! there is not one bad song on this album and every song kicks ass. \\"My spirit lives on\\" is the best solo ever and karl logan is the best guitarist in the world today I recomend this album to anyone who is not a betrayer of metal and who fights for all that is real and  remember when you buy this album if you are a ManOwaR fan, you are a ManOwaR fan for life!
0790733226|3.0|Contact is the story of Ellie (Jodi Foster), a tomboyish scientist out to prove that there REALLY is extra-terrestrial life out there. Mathew McConaughey stars as the unconvincing religious scholar Palmer Jones. I found Contact to be slow at first. Once the alien contact was made I found the novel much more interesting. I really enjoyed the slow buildup and the introduction of each new clue to the alien entity.<br /><br />I was rather lukewarm about Palmer as a love interest. He seemed to lack conviction and faded in and out of Ellie's life with no apparent. reason. I also found the religious message to be rather heavy handed.  (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind religious characters, but I hate to be bludgeoned over the head with a message). The whole \\"Woman Looks For Aliens and Finds her Faith Instead\\" message I could really do without. Also, the meeting with the 'alien' was anticlimactic and  seemed more suited for an episode featuring the star trek holodeck than a big budget film.<br /><br />Overall, I felt Contact was a rather tepid film, that started out great, but failed to deliver the goods. (Oh, and Ellie's hair stylist needs to be fired. The whole hair extension thing looked cheap and really, really fake!) I give this film 3 stars for the excellent promise. But I'm deducting 1 star for Palmer who was a rather weak and uninteresting love interest, and a half star each for the silly religion/science sideshow and the rather slow start.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|I love \\"Here We Go Again\\"....Yes Ray and Norah. Thank You.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I had pretty much written Green Day off after no new music had come out since 2000's \\"Warning.\\" I figured they had retired, or more than likely, gone on an indefinite hiatus. Boy was I wrong. Green Day sure prove anyone who doubted their power wrong with their newest album, \\"American Idiot.\\" This release elevates Green Day's music past the standard pop-punk formula and into timeless territory, where almost anyone at any age can find something to love in this. Now don't get me wrong, they didn't change up completely, this is still, no doubt, Green Day. The sound is there, but the song-writing has definitely matured even more than \\"Nimrod\\" and \\"Warning\\" had, and the songs are a bit more challenging and, in turn, have more shelf-life than more well-known Green Day tunes of past. One prime example is the nine minute long \\"Jesus Of Suburbia.\\" This is just one of those songs that moves so fluidly and has so many dynamics that the nine minutes pass by without any boredom or any urge to skip ahead. Shorter, punchier tracks like \\"Give Me Novocaine\\" and \\"St. Jimmy,\\" stay true to form, as well as the title track, which is pure Green Day. Songs like \\"Holiday\\" and the destined to be a classic \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" are the winners of the bunch, pure passion, anger and emotion are packed into these two songs. The former serving as an appropriate soundtrack to Election Day (Sorry, we're still under the regime of an \\"American Idiot\\"), while the latter has a theme that almost everyone you bump into can relate to. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" explores the more sensitive side of Green Day, and is roughly a sequel to 1997's hit \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life).\\" I think this song has potential to be another classic, just like this album is destined to become essential listening in future years. Few bands make albums as bold and as original as this one. Green Day have easily outdone themselves and have shown a new generation of music lovers what it's all about. Just like people my age grew up on \\"Dookie\\" and know every line of it, kids today are going to be looking back on \\"American Idiot\\" in the same fond way. Green Day have done well to give themselves more staying power, and they forever have my respect. This album is just simply mind-blowing. I recommend it to everyone.ple my age grew up on \\"Dookie\\" and know every line of it, kids today are going to be looking back on \\"American Idiot\\" in the same fond way.

B0000TB014|4.0|I watched alot of this videos in my childhood to teen years and I even saw \\" Another Part of me is DisneyWorld in a film called Captian Eeo. Captian Eeo was a StarWars type film in 3D and it was really cool. It was in Epcot Center before Honey we shunk ourselves. Anyway Mike is the boy. There was no one anywhere Close to Mike except Prince. I enjoyed this collection however I wish they had a dvd for the bad album. I remember seeing the bad single with wesley snipes once or twice on tv but it was rare and it may have been a countdown thing of micheals videos.I even even saw the Ben movie. I do remember the black or white long version too. I though it was cool except all the crotch grabbing but i didnt know what all the controversy was about. It was wild how he was breaking windows but the panther thing was cool. I which they had \\"Leave me alone\\" and Speed Demon and Another Part of me and other bad album videos. I wish they had the longer version of smooth criminal on it too. I always loved the way you make me feel. He is smooth in the video and his gestures are hilarious. Maybe the do have the bad album dvd but I havent seen it. If they do have it I wont hesistate to get it.
B0002858YS|3.0|I came across The Killers in the alternative section at the Tower Records in NYC. Normally, they classify their music well and distinguish alternative from Top 40. Always looking for the next best thing, I scanned the disk and proceeded to listen. I quickly discovered that The Killers represent the decline of counter culture as we know it.  The tracks are as sacrin as Sweet and Low. I am embarrassed to say that there is one track that was I-Pod worthy: \\"Somebody Told Me\\".  In addition to \\"Somebody Told Me\\", there are two or three semi-okay tracks not worth mentioning in detail.  <br />Vegas native, lead singer Brendan Flowers (the name counterintuitive) fakes a great British accent. In actual fact, \\"Hot Fuss\\" has a great deal in common with Flower's home town. They are both manufactured and lacking in substance. The lyrics are banal and senseless and the composition is not far from that of a Britney Spears track. Saying all of that, I could not help to bop around to \\"Somebody Told Me\\". It is a guilty pleasure similar to Brittney, Beyonce, Blink 182 and Rooney. I can feel my brain turn to mush every time I listen to it, but am compelled none the less. <br />This should not be recommended to Interpol fans as it is on Amazon. It is by no means the same genre. The Killers have created nothing more than brain candy, but sometimes brain candy can be fun...  <br />
B0006A9FMI|4.0|The filmmaker Mamoru Oshii creates a futuristic society that takes place in 2032 Japan where three different man-like creations exist--humans, cyborgs and robots.  Human's have found a way to improve evolution through cyborgs, a cyber genetic organism, which consists partially of the original human organism and partially of technological improvements to the human.  The main character Batô (Akio Ôtsuka) is such a creature, half-human and half-machine, that sets out on an investigation as he works for an anti-terrorist organization.  The investigation leads Batô into the world of robotics as Oshii tells a story about the innocence of robots and dolls.<br /><br />Oshii's sequel to Ghost in the Shell (1995), which had influence on films such as Matrix (1999), reinstates the cyberpunk atmosphere where computers are an integral part of people as every person has a downlink connection in the back of their neck.  The futuristic Tokyo also has similar infrastructure as Blade Runner (1982), which darkens the perspective on society.  In the midst of this dark and desolate society people still prey upon each other for the same common purposes as people have done for centuries.<br /><br />The story begins after a series of macabre killings where an android seems to have killed it's owner and two police officers.  Batô arrives to the crimes scene and he enters the area where the murderer is seeking shelter much like Dirty Harry.  The police try to warn him, but it does not affect Batô who only answers to himself as he is on a mission to find the cold-blooded killer.  Methodically Batô enters the alley where he discovers headless corpses as he scans for survivors while proceeding in defense mode seeking for threatening movement in the dark shadows.  At the end of the alley Batô finds a young suicidal woman, probably no older than 18, that suddenly attacks him through self-detonation.  It is evident that this young girl is the murderous robot and further investigation reveals that the primary function of the robot was to provide sexual satisfaction to it's owners.<br /><br />Batô is paired up with the young and inexperienced Togusa (Kôichi Yamadera) to continue the investigation of the murderous pleasure robot as it appears that there has been similar incidents.  The repeated incidents suggest that there was a sabotage, or premeditated assault on certain people, which indicates that this is a case for the anti-terrorist organization.  The investigation leads Batô into his past as he recalls the painful loss of his former partner Major (Atsuko Tanaka) who was more machine than human as the only human part was her soul within the shell of a cyber genetic organism created by man.  However, Major's ghost seems to have survived within the mainframe to which everyone is downlinked and she finds ways of communicating to Batô during his investigation as the villain tries to hack into his mind to distort their perspective of reality.  This becomes a real threat as most people and cyborgs communicate through the supercomputer as Batô does with his partner Togusa.  The philosophical predicament that the film brings to the surface through this notion is monumental, because if someone could alter the truth then what is the truth.  Could truth be an experience, a program, or personal choice that create an experience?<br /><br />The film depicts virtual realities created within the story as Batô and Togusa seek the villain, which offers several interesting ideas to contemplate upon.  The animations used in the film lend support to the notion of what is real versus imaginary as the 3-D background provides a depiction of the truth while the characters are depicted in a 2-D state, which could be either real or imaginary.  The 2-D versus the 3-D state of the characters and background enhance the visual experience of what is real and imaginary as Batô points out by stating that Togusa's happy family life might only be a program that creates an internal wish for him.  On the flipside, a table will remain a table whether it is in reality, or in an imaginary location.<br /><br />Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence brings the audience an anime experience that offers hard-hitting action and a substantial portion of reality and existential science fiction philosophy where empirical reasoning might not be enough to ponder the predicaments of the story.  The story highlights the notion of existence through the massive use of dolls and robots as they are mere visual images of humans and they do not exist by their own rights since they do not have personal choice.  The robots only act upon programming and dolls are moved by human hands, which indicates that the robots and the dolls are innocent to their actions as they were man-made.  The many different ideas that Oshii leaves to the audience to ponder are nothing but amazing as the film will offer a solid cinematic experience for most viewers.<br /><br />[Sidenote: Subtitles]<br />The subtitles, as mentioned before, are difficult to follow, as they remain on the screen too briefly in order to recognize the words if a visual experience are desired.  It also annoying with the extra subtitling for who and surrounding sounds, the company should redo these immediately as it hurts the cinematic experience.will remain a table whether it is in reality, or in an imaginary location.

B000000OQF|5.0|I am completely shocked and disgusted on some of the reviews I read. Fortunately it was very few.  What I cant understand is why people think Nirvana was so great in rock history.  Nirvana came in the rock world, destroyed everything that was good and lowered the standard of music for the next 10+ years to come. They are responsible for every terrible \\"rock\\" song you hear on the radio i.e. nickleback and the hundreds of clone bands like them. Worst than that I was reading how someone compared Clay Aikens, some fat american idol guy, Hilary duff, and Limpbizkit to Guns.  Claiming Guns werent as good as them............I really honestly believe that that review had to be a joke, know one could say that and really mean it. Remember Guns n roses were the last rock superstars to ever grace music with there presents.  Since then no one has ever come close to the status they achieved.  DO you think Rolling Stones would pick a name out of the list of bands we have nowadays to go on tour with them, and have them join them on stage to do a song....Hell no!  If it wasn't for the few bands like Guns n roses I think I would prefer to be deaf.  Appetite for destruction is the single best album of all time...hands down.  Its rawness, honesty, and timeless riffs say it all.  It was the first album to stir up any real controversy without even attempting to do so.  Nowadays you got people like eminem who make a conscience effort to try and be edgey....pretty lame.  Slash is not the greatest guitarist in the world, but he has to be one of the best riff writers out there, and his solos are melodic and in key with melody of the song.  Its like two different songs being played together in perfect harmony. As for Axl roses singing.....his voice is one of a kind. He can sing at any range at any volume.  And no one, not a single soul could attempt to belt out there voice like that without losing it for a month.  Just listen to the opening of Welcome to the jungle on any live album or dvd.Its unreal. This album is perfect from begining to end, and if it wasnt for the swears on the album, every track would of been a radio played song. <br /> <br />
B00008RV1L|5.0|I think a lot of reviewers who are trashing this movie are doing so because they have absolutely no understanding of the context in which it is supposed to take place. I know that this is difficult for some people to understand, but because American Psycho is a satire, a COMEDY, it is really key to understand what is being made fun of, what the filmmaker's primary target is, before trashing this and saying you are all upset and disgusted and don't understand and want to cry. Indeed, if you have been living in a bunker for the last 25 years, or were born after the year 2000, you may not be aware of the existence of such \\"obscure\\" cultural phenomena as: the 80's, New York, yuppieness in general, Wall Street, techno music, cocaine, big hair, prostitution, and exactly why Paul Allen's apartment makes Bateman's heart sink. But that is not the fault of American Psycho. Also, while this movie is obviously a gory and \\"twisted\\" movie (to use everyone's favorite word) it is ultimately kind of innocent because it's just a joke, it is a big gaffe. Really it is not fair that this movie has 3.5 stars on average; really, the vast majority of negative reviewers of this movie are so undeveloped in their basic comprehension of what is going on here - shocking as that is - that their reviews seem pretty meaningless. That's just my opinion.  There are other elemets to the movie as a whole that the nay-sayers seem to pick up on. First and foremost is the actual ambiguity and even veracity of certain events. One interpretation of the film is that for whatever reason, Bateman has slipped into a psychological state where he himself is literally unaware of the events that are depicted in turn.    Furthermore, for all of you who complain that this movie is \\"sexist\\" in that it [encourages] \\"violence against women\\" I would say that that is a rather shallow interpretation of a pretty brilliant movie that, if you see the bonus features on the DVD, was written and directed by several GLBT women,Guinevere Turner being one of them - one of the best writers around IMHO.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I received this DVD for XMAS and I must have watched and or listened to it 10 times already. Basically Eric Clapton gathers up George's friends at Royal Albert Hall and performs one of the best shows I've seen on DVD. The first half hour on the the complete concert disc is Rave Shankar performing a piece written for George. I dig it. There's the great stuff from the Beatles as well as some really cool solo stuff. 3 highlights for me: Billy Preston \\"Isn't a Pity,\\" Paul McCartney \\"Something,\\" Eric Clapton/Paul McCartney \\"While my Guitar gently weeps.\\"  <br />The 5.1 mix and the encoding on both discs is awesome. I very highly recommend this disc set. It's a great celebration of George's life & music and a chance to hear those songs played by one of the greatest group of musicians ever assembled.
B00003CXC7|5.0|What can I say? Rear Window is probably Hitchcock's best movie. Grace Kelly is even more fabulous than usual, and Jimmy Stewart is brilliant too. However, this can be a more demanding movie to watch than some may expect. Obviously, this film is largely psychological and thus requires effort to watch. And it is also really slow, although it is ingenious, precise, and somewhat formal in its development. For these reasons, viewers accustomed to different/new types of movies may find its value as pure entertainment to be diminished.
0060512806|4.0|Cryptonomicon had a big chance of failing. It's a large book, over 1000 pages, which continually bounces between WWII and \\"present day\\" while juggling between several main characters. Not to mention the frequent several page rants Stephenson would engage in that simply inform the reader about... well, stuff. It's a recipe for disaster, and according to many of the reviewers it did. <br /> <br />What saved the book for me was how well Stephenson keeps things moving. Each chapter is focused on one of the main characters (Waterhouse of WWII, Randy Waterhouse of present, Shaftoe WWII, and Goto Dengo of WWII) so you are constantly switching between eras and plots. Just when you think you're going to scream if you have to read about another sunken U boat, you get a chapter on cryptic annalysis. This allowed me to plow through good portions of the book in a single sitting. <br /> <br />Perhaps the feature that would deter most readers is the Stephenson's fondness for large, technical descriptions of... everything. And while some authors might BS a lot, judging from the reviews here, most of the stuff Stephenson informs us on is on target. These descriptions facinated me... however, I could see how a lot of audiences would find them to be a bore. <br /> <br />The characters are well written, although the plot is questionable. The ending suggested by the beginning of the book is hardly the one that ends up transpiring. It felt like the book could have gone on for another 500 pages.
6304025831|5.0|Wow, what can I really say about this movie? As others have mentioned, this is kind of a sequel to GoodFellas in that it has a lot of the same people in it of course. And while I'm sure there are many people who can persuasively argue that GoodFellas is a finer piece of \\"cinema,\\" Casino stands as proof that the crew really perfected their formula. So, while it may not be the first nor the most, uh, \\"artistically meritorious\\" mob movie, sometimes I can't help but think that Casino is the most wildly entertaining of them all.  <br />Casino is a long movie and de Niro fills the film with one of his best performances. He's Ace Rothstein, a Las Vegas casino operator who gets involved with the mafia. Like with \\"Henry Hill\\" (Ray Liotta) in GoodFellas, there is plenty of tension because, not being Italian  whatsoever, let alone the 100% that is supposedly required, Ace can never be truly accepted into the inner mob circle. This is an aspect of the movie that I think had real potential for nuance and development, but is largely glossed over, aside from Peschi's primarily comedic jabs about Ace being a \\"stupid Jew bastard\\" and such. <br />That said, Casino makes up for this with a really extraordinary portrayal of Ace himself.
B000022TSH|3.0|This is one of the all time great mysteries, perhaps the most superb of all the neo-noir films.  Personally, I have never liked the ending (where is Bogie when you need him?), but nevertheless, it is brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and brilliantly directed.  The original is visually gorgeous - but you might as well buy the VHS version.  This DVD is really awful.  The focus is fuzzy.  It looks like someone took an aging, washed-out copy, upped the color saturation, and called it remastered.  The skin tones are almost too bright, but the colors while still faded, are too dark and murky.  I still remember the subtle use of color from when I first saw the film, the beautiful pinks and blues and yellows playing against the cool neutrals.  The rich darks giving gorgeous contrast.  And I remember the perfect LA light.  Only the brightest sunlit scenes come even close to the way it should look.  This is a Hollywood masterpiece, and deserved great love and care in its restoration.  It didn't get them.
B0001I561E|5.0|CLAY AIKEN was magnificent on this DVD!!!  He is the reason I bought the Aladdin DVD.  Clay Aiken has a beautiful voice and a charming personality, and I wanted to buy and own the Aladdin DVD to capture CLAY AIKEN's contribution/participation/involvement on the Aladdin DVD.  What a talent CLAY AIKEN is ---  the BEST!!!
B0002MPU1K|4.0|I was one who raved about Peter Cincotti's first album.  I still believe it to be one of the finest debut albums ever.  What captivated me about young Mr. Cincotti were, in this order:  1)  His abilities as a songwriter, especially at such a young age; 2)  His abilities as a pianist; 3)  His abilities as a singer.<br /><br />On this one, Mr. Cincotti performs 12 songs, 4 of which (He's Watching; The Girl for Me Tonight; I'd Rather Be With You; and the title track) are originals.  As with the first album, his originals measure up very well to the covers, and that's the main reason I'm giving this album 4 stars.<br /><br />The problem with this album is that the producer, Phil Ramone, has surrounded Mr. Cincotti with an orchestra in some tracks,a bunch of horns in others, and taken away his piano chops.  Only in \\"Cherokee\\" does Mr. Cincotti get to lay out; and that's the last track on the album.  Impatient listeners may not last that long.<br /><br />And, perhaps because of the dense orchestrations, Mr. Cincotti has gone from sounding like a young Frank Sinatra to a young Bobby Darin.  That's especially so on \\"Raise the Roof\\", which sounds very \\"Vegas-y\\", and \\"You Don't Know Me\\", which is either the wrong song or the wrong arrangement for this young singer.  Peter Cincotti was voted by the Down Beat critics as the #1 rising star among male vocalists this past summer.  While I think that in large part is a measure of the dirth of talented male jazz vocalists on the scene today (especially in comparison with the glut of talented female vocalists) I don't think this album will cause him to progress to the heights of Elling, Muprhy and Bey.<br /><br />If I were Peter Cincotti, I'd part ways with Phil Ramone and go back to a format of a piano trio and maybe a horn, so that he could again display his pianistic chops to maximum advantage.  That's what he did on his first album with \\"Nature Boy/Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Rainbow Connection.\\"  Those cuts were stunning.  I'm afraid that nothing on this album really is.  RCly is.  RC
B0006399FS|3.0|As most of America, I was mesmerized by the insanely catchy iPod 30 sec. commercial featuring \\"Vertigo\\", the lead-off single from U2's latest album. On the strength of that tune I bought the album. My mistake.<br /><br />\\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" (11 tracks, 48 min.) starts off with \\"Vertigo\\", and boy, does it rock! But after that, I was pretty much disappointed. \\"Miracle Drug\\" sets the tone for the rest of the album, a mid-tempo song. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" (the second single) is Bono's loving ode to his dad, who passed away recently, a nice ballad. But then it remains on cruise control, untill we get to \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", which brings some much-needed life and tempo. After that, it's more \\"middle of the road\\", pensive stuff, all the way through.<br /><br />I'm astounded by the critical acclaim this album has gotten. Frankly, I think it's mediocre, and it it wasn't for \\"Vertigo\\", this wouldn't even get 3 stars. U2 has been better, much better, than this. Even the previous album, 2000's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" easily outshines this. That said, do you think I'll go see U2 on the coming tour? You bet!
B00069YDXU|5.0|This DVD is excellent.It's better than Royal Albert Hall in 92',and close to 'From the Vaults'. Greg Lake is in fine voice(better than 92'),and Keith Emerson is incredible.There is some good close up shots of Keith playing hie numerous keyboards.And Carl Palmer is ..well Carl Palmer. One of the best rock drummers ever.I'm still waiting for the classic concert's of the 70's to come out on DVD.This one has great sound and is a must have for any fan of this band.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|In an opening scene worthy of its own film, \\"Collateral\\" introduces its audience to a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) who would rather be doing anything else in the world than driving cabs.   Max sees driving a cab as beneath him; he dreams of a life of importance and seems to feel the need to apologize to his passengers for doing what he does to make a living.    <br /> <br />Max then picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) and promises to chauffeur the well-dressed businessman around for the remainder of the evening.   When Vincent begins killing people at each stop, the film becomes a struggle between the two individuals: a contract killer and the cabbie driving him to each murder.    In a narrative similar to what could be expected of a low budget play, much of the action takes place in the cab, as the two men bicker and debate while an unbelievable set of circumstances unfolds around them.    <br /> <br />The film's strength is found in the performances of its two leads and in the unequaled craftsmanship of its director (Michael Mann).   Foxx and Cruise -each cast against type- give performances that rival anything in their pasts.  Foxx shows he can tone down his persona, nailing the cerebral Max, while Cruise continues his recent trend of trying to \\"muddy up\\" his good boy image.      <br /> <br />Mann's direction is nothing short of spectacular.   Working with material that could have resulted in a corny, tired formula film in the hands of a lesser director, Mann is able to create a film that expands the potential for a crime drama.  He opens up the genre with ambiguous questions on the nature of killing and decorates the scenes with haunting, dark images.   <br /> <br />\\"Collateral\\" is not the best film of 2004.  In fact, the material leaves a lot to be desired.   But this film shows how talented individuals can turn a less-than-desirable script into a wholly enjoyable film.   Without Mann, Foxx and Cruise, this film could have been a disaster; but with them in charge, the endproduct is a film that will satisfy most viewers.   <br />
B0002ZDVF4|4.0|From beginning to end, this fast-paced movie will keep the viewer riveted to this sequel to \\"The Bourne Identity\\".  Jason Bourne is still an amnesiac, but as the movie progresses he remembers more details of his previous life.  It's sometimes difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys, because someone is framing Bourne and has sicced his old agency on him.  Everyone is after him but Bourne manages to avoid bullets, stakeouts, booby traps and whatever else the intelligence community can throw at him.  Matt Damon does a creditable job in the lead role and this movie is good for an evening's entertainment.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This film lacks a point, fails to make any statements and has no desire to make the world a better place.  The plot is non-existent, the characters are cartoonish clich&eacute;s and the production looks like it was thrown together during a weekend.  But with that said, I must say I enjoyed \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" and have found myself laughing with friends over some of the more memorable scenes for the last several days.  The film is like that annoying hangnail that won't go away.  You can't stop playing with it, even though it bleeds when you tug at it.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite's title character exists in all high schools across the country.  He lives in his own world of mythological drawings and ninja gear.  His reality grows from a healthy imagination and a way of coping with the daily attacks from the \\"cool kids\\" and his inescapable existence on the outside of social circles.  The portrayal of a social outcast is so genuine, it at times becomes uncomfortable to watch, as viewers will see how easily a character like Napoleon could end up becoming a Columbine-like killer.<br /><br />A bold choice by writer/director Jared Hess is to refrain from making Napoleon into a hero.  Most often compared to characters in \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\", Napoleon isn't given a triumphant conclusion where the school realizes he was cool all along.  The film lacks sentimentality in this respect and appears to be the product of individuals who have experienced alienation first hand.<br /><br />The emphasis placed on a realistic portrayal of a \\"loser\\" also helps build most of the humor in the film.  Napoleon is so consistently bizarre and socially inept that viewers can't help laughing at him (even though we all want him to succeed).  From the first moment when Napoleon opens his \\"Trapper Keeper\\" and performs an experiment on an action figure, audiences will find him as irresistible as that hangnail that just won't go away.
B0001WTWCO|1.0|I HATED this film.  To quote a reviewer who actually liked it:    \\"Through flashbacks, the filmmakers slowly unravel the secrets of the burned man: who he is and his past.\\"    The operative word here is SLOWLY.  To make matters worse, it wasn't even a love story.  Since when is going after your own selfish desires at the expense of others love?  It is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see.  Trying to romanticize these people's selfish behavior did NOT work.  I felt no sympathy for the English patient or his lover.  The Bridges of Madison County was much better -- at least you could sympathize with the characters, unlike this film.  So many of the scenes were so long and drawn out I nearly fell asleep.  The plot was not hard to follow, it was just boring!  I don't need a lot of action in a film.  I do need a story that will hold my interest.  This did not.  Don't waste your time on this extremely bad film.
B000002G23|5.0|Resell those individual Police cds and just get this box! (Unless you're an obsessive who needs the original lp art.) This boxed set does it right by including all official album tracks and single b-sides, in chronological order, making every Police fan's life simple!  Also included is a brief yet solid booklet about the band and its history, plus comments on the individual tracks by the band members that provide some interesting insights. <br /> <br />Now, die-hard collectors might bemoan the exclusion of a few nitpicky tracks (the Don't Stand So Close to Me '86 DANCE remix, De Do Do Do De Da Da Da '86), but nothing of great importance is missing. Admittedly it might be nice someday to have a release showcasing outtakes, demos, and some more live performances, but that wasn't really the mission of this set. <br /> <br />If your knowledge of the Police does not stem beyond \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and the fact that they were \\"Sting's old band\\", you definitely deserve to give this music a listen to. When this band was together, truly \\"every little thing\\" they did was magic. They had a sound that was entirely their own, and musicianship that is rare to find in this day and age. Stewart Copeland, Andy Summers, and Sting deserve their place in rock history as one of the best and most influential bands of the new wave/post-punk era, and this boxed set certainly illustrates this fact for all to hear and enjoy.
0385512104|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is a detective tale of sorts, as told by a fictional autistic teenager named Christopher Boone. Christopher lives with his father and attends a special needs school, where he excels in mathematics, which he loves, and struggles with social interactions. He admires logic, loves animals, and cannot comprehend human emotions or motivations. One night, he discovers that a neighbor's dog, Wellington, has died, apparently murdered with a pitchfork. Concerned that a killer is on the loose and eager to test his detecting skills, Christopher determines to figure out who killed the dog. Against his father's admonishments, he sets about interviewing neighbors and applying logic to the few clues that he has, emulating his favorite fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. In searching for Wellington's killer, Christopher discovers things about his own family that he could never understand, but which affect them all profoundly.<br /><br />Author Mark Haddon, who worked with autistic individuals as a young man, has avoided the pitfall of underdeveloped style that afflicts so many first-time (and beyond) novelists by writing his book in the first person, as an autistic youth, whose style is of necessity blunt, unrefined, and frequently tangential. He has cleverly turned a stylistic challenge into the essence of the book: the perspective of an autistic mind. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is more about how autistic individuals perceive the world than anything else. The story, itself, consumes Christopher, but would only be of mild interest to others. We learn a lot about Christopher, as he hides nothing, but his character is not so much sympathetic as fascinating. It's not that the reader doesn't care about Christopher, but eagerness to know what Christopher thinks -how he will solve a problem- made this a page-turner for me more than how he feels. I guess Christopher and those like him would approve. Christopher notices details of his environment that most people don't. And he's blind to aspects of life that most people consider obvious. Yet he lives among humans whom he will never be able to understand, and he must learn to function among us. As all humans (and animals) perceive various aspects of their environment differently and to varying degrees, it is intriguing to learn about one extreme of human perception. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is an enjoyable and enlightening read.r notices details of his environment that most people don't.

B0002KPIKA|5.0|\\"Agrippina\\" was Handel's first \\"hit\\" - an unmitigated success that ran for over 200 performances, quite impressive in a time in which opera was a \\"high turnover\\" commodity. Even though almost three centuries have passed since its premiere, it is still easy to see why: it has an entertaining and (for the time) fairly racy libretto, with beefy parts for both female principals; a historic framework with which most of the audience would be familiar; and last, but by no means least, a string of irresistable and inventive arias that clearly illustrates Handel's almost superhuman gift for melody. Here we see the young Saxon broadly flexing his muscles, and obviously enjoying every minute of it (a literary comparison could be the amazing poetic flights of fancy in some of Shakespeare's early mature comedies, such as \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" or \\"Twelfth Night\\"). <br />The opera was never revived in Handel's lifetime (although he mined it for material for later operas and oratorios), and was all but forgotten until recently. It has been exceedingly fortunate in recent years, however, with two excellent CD recordings issued in the 90's (from McGegan on Harmonia Mundi and Gardiner on Philips). <br />And, believe it or not, this new DVD from Dynamic is actually the second production of this charming work available in video format; the other being a production from the 80's conducted by Ostmann. <br />And, of the two, this new version is by far the superior. Not only is it more complete (the Ostmann version cuts almost an hour of music), it features a much more idiomatic cast, the castrato parts are sung at correct pitch (the Ostmann performance has tenors and baritones cast in the castrato parts), and has a much more winning heroine(or, one may argue, anti-heroine). <br />Malgoire was a pioneer in the early days of period instruments, and his Handel recordings from the 70's and 80's still hold up today. This performance finds him still in fine form after all these years, with aclear understanding of Handel's score and 18th century performance practice in general. His tempi aren't \\"cutting edge\\", perhaps, but they're not stodgy by any means, and I feel few would find fault with anyone in the pit. <br />Veronique Gens is virtually ideal in the title role. Not only is her voice, lieing somewhere between lyric and mezzo, peculiarly perfect, but, physically, her youth and beauty prevent the character from degenerating into the realm of the \\"old battle-axe\\", and also make her role as a seductress that much more believable. Although not the ingenue role, it is Agrippina that really keeps the action (what there is of it) in motion, and Gens does not dissapoint in that respect. <br />Although the opera is named for Agrippina, Poppea may be considered more of a plumb role: she has the most well-known aria from the work (\\"Bel Piacere\\") and is the central figure of dispute among all the main characters (wanted by Nero, Ottone and Claudio, and used as a pawn by Agrippina), so this is a part which must be carefully cast as well. Ingrid Perruche handles this all in good grace, and with the right amount of coyness and perkiness. Vocally, she's virtually note-perfect, although the voice never truly soars (one could only imagine what Natalie Dessay could do with this part). <br />There's not enough room here to go into great detail about the supporting cast (which includes three, count 'em, three counter-tenors!) except to say that there seems to be no weak link in the chain. Jaroussky (Nero)falls prey, at times, to the male alto hoot, although his singing, throughout, is most admirable; Gregoire is amazing as Ottone, and moving, as well; Nigel Smith is an impressively masculine and sexy Claudio, although he sounds strained at times, and Fabrice di Falco (billed as a \\"male soprano\\") soars in the small part of Narcissus -- I hope we hear more from him. <br />The production is essentially static, which, to my mind, is not necessarily a bad thing. Too many directors try to compensate for the basically stop-and-go dramatic nature of 18th century opera by adding too much unnecessary stage business during the arias -- thankfully, that is not done here. A troupe of statuesque dancers grace the stage throughout, striking abstract poses on abstract stage properties -- the best that can be said of this is that it is only mildly distracting. Otherwise, the production, with its over-the-top and highly stylized 18th century costumes, is appealing to the eye. <br />Agrippina's libretto is fairly typical of Venetian opera of the period. The historic subject is treated with no reverence whatsoever (in fact if we were to give each of the characters different names we would probably not even recognize them) so don't expect another \\"I, Claudius\\" here. However, if taken for what it is, its farcical nature can be quite entertaining, especially, as is done here, when campiness is included but not over-indulged in. <br />All-in-all, three of the most pleasurable hours I've spent in quite some time. Video and audio reproduction are high, and the fact that the performance was filmed (rather than video-taped) gives it a rather glossy feel. The 180 minutes are spread out over two DVD's, which ups the price a bit. However, in this reviewer's opinion, it's worth every penny. <br /> <br />
B00005MKA3|5.0|\\"Survival,\\" the 1979 album by Bob Marley & the Wailers, is by far their hardest hitting and most sociopolitical album, even moreso than \\"Exodus\\" from 1977.  The album shows Marley more outright with his brilliant message than ever; even in the song titles. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"So Much Trouble In the World,\\" bluntly stating the decay of the world as it falls into despair, with the government caring more about trying to play God than about caring to play the role of the caretaker.  Other songs illustrating similar points in different fashions are the equally millitant tunes \\"Top Rankin'\\" and \\"Babylon System,\\" which sing of government oppression and work towards opposing the unity of the people. <br /> <br />The album's track that stands out most is the song \\"Zimbabwe,\\" with its love of Africa and anti-apartheid statement.  It truly shows Marley's belief that Africa must, once and for all, finally be free.  This obviously speaks specifically to the then-opressed (and often still-opressed) people of Zimbabwe, under the tyrannical rule of the British government.  This song is a statement for the people of Zimbabwe, and all oprssed people the world over, to fight for their rights.  Similar songs such as the soothing \\"Africa Unite,\\" and the fiery title track \\"Survival\\".  \\"Africa Unite\\" is a heartwarming and beautiful plea to Africans throughout the world to unite under the banner of brotherhood and return to their homeland while \\"Survival\\" is the strong, forceful anthem for Africans, and all opresssed people, to fight against the slave drivers of the world, no longer with failing words, but fruitful actions. <br /> <br />The songs, \\"One Drop,\\" \\"Ride Natty Ride,\\" and \\"Wake Up and Live\\" are a testament to the strength of the Rastaman and his right to be recognized as an equal member of society in all places of the world.  They express the Rastaman belief of dismissing the powers of Satan and the truth that they cannot be broken by the forces of Babylon.  The bonus track, a 12\\" mix of \\"Ride Natty Ride\\" simply changes the sound around just enough for the listener to be able to recognize a difference, making a delightful remix to add to the original album. <br /> <br />Finally, there is \\"Ambush In the Night,\\" a song directly recounting the assassination attempt against Marley on December 3rd, 1976.  Marley states here that he is protected by the all-poweral God, and that no matter what they try to do, the forces of evil will not defeat him. <br /> <br />Survival's main theme is the plight of Africans, and this cannot be escaped, but its message also transcends to the rights, beliefs, and lives of all opressed people regardless of race, sex, social standing, or religion.  Survival is the ultimate album that advocates the equal rights of all people.  Survival is unapologetic, unafraid,heartfelt, and life-changing; the most powerful raw sociopolitical album of all time.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park creates music for all ages (young and old).  Their lyrics are awesome and reflect human feelings that we can all relate to.  I have played this cd over and over again and never get tired of it.  I love the fact that no cursing was used to get the point across.  The mixed of Chester's voice and Mike's voice is awesome.  They both touch the audiences inner thoughts.  LINKIN PARK rocks!
B000002ORU|4.0|The Who were never a \\"hits\\" band, more of an incomparable live band with a deservedly loyal following who succesfully made the transition from singles to albums with \\"Tommy\\" and from that point never went back to groping for hit singles.  In other words, they weren't Duran Duran, and that's a good thing.  I agree with the other reviewers who point out that there have been too many \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections from The Who, but this isn't really a greatest hits collection, more of an attempt at an overview. <br />I'm not trying to be overly critical:  I love this music, the mixes are mostly very good and it is a fair representation of the band.  There just seems to have been little overall planning in the way The Who releases and repackages their material.  For example, on this box set there are 15 or so tracks that are also available on the remastered \\"The Who Sell Out\\".  The Who, like The Beatles, had a relatively small, though excellent catalogue of albums and they've been packaged and repackaged to death.  It really does need to stop at some point. <br />There are still some great live tapes of The Who that have never been released commercially.  For example, the '68 Fillmore East concert that the band had originally planned to use as a live album but scrapped.  Why hasn't it been dusted off and remastered?  The bootleg I have of the show contains incredible versions of \\"Relax\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over\\", with Townshend flailing on Stratocaster to create a piercing guitar sound that's unlike anything else I've ever heard on Who live records.  Apparently there's even a High Numbers (!) live set from '64 that I've read doesn't sound bad for its age.  Someone: show some imagination, show some initiative, and get this stuff out there!  <br />  <br />
B000059HAI|4.0|-the english translation of the title.<br /><br />Tora! Tora! Tora! was the japanese code signaling the Japanese naval officers to proceed with the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Another reviewer claims that the word can also mean kill, although I can't confirm that.  This movie only won an academy award for best visual effects in 1970, most other awards going to Patton that same year.  The movie was directed by three men, was based on two books, one of the same title written by Prange, the other written by Farago and entitled The Broken Seal: operation magic and the secret road to Pearl Harbor.  The movie is somewhat unbiased in that both sides' reactions and story are represented.  The quote from Admiral Yamamoto which dramatically ends the movie was never said by him: \\"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.\\"  Awake, though, the Americans, they sure did.  I didn't realize how significant the damage done was until I saw this movie.  A sizable number of the Pacific fleet was benignly lingering in Pearl Harbor that Sunday morning and sunk or left in flames a few hours later as the Japanese airmen flew back unscathed to their base.  However, as another Japanese commander noted, none of the American aircraft carriers were there.  The American side was beset with communication problems of various sorts with too many men crying wolf weeks before the attack.  I'd like to read the books or those of others to understand what exactly happened on the American side that resulted in this \\"day of infamy\\".  I did like this docu-drama, accurately reliving that fated day.
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 isn't unique, but they're good.  Adam Levine's voice is crisp enough to woo women's hearts, yet gritty enough to remain listenable.  The musicianship is credible, with organs mixing right next to screaming electric guitars.  It's catchy enough to warrant repeated listening--and that's saying something, considering a lot of the crap that passes as rock these days.<br /><br />The songs themselves are comprise a grab-bag: take your pick on which ones you like.  \\"Harder to Breathe\\" certainly has a catchiness to it, in Levine's heated delivery and the enraged, pained lyrics.  Similar themes of love/hate relationships plague the rest of the album, none more so than \\"This Love.\\"  However, \\"She Will Be Love\\" offers up a whistfullness that's much-wanted and loved by the time it rolls around (of course, it's kinda hard to like the song, after hearing it 90,000 times on radio and video...still, it's a good tune).  \\"Must Get Out\\" and \\"Through With You\\" are two other highlites, with the live \\"Not Coming Home\\" an aural treat.<br /><br />Overall, what you've got here is this: SONGS ABOUT JANE, a promising debut by Maroon 5.  It's not the best CD of all time, of course not--but it's pretty good, much better than a lot of what comes out these days.  It's not an album you should judge before listening--they have a boy-band image, but they've got a lot of grit, too.  And I'll take grit over N'SYNC any day of the week.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson has written a very entertaining and very informative travelog about Australia.  He begins with an analysis of just how neglected this country is from our current media.  Ask yourself, when was the last time you saw an article in the newspaper about Australia.  Fortunately, Bryson has set out to do justice.  While relating his adventures wandering around the country on long drives that most of us would fly over, he also fills us in on the history of this island/continent, beyond the commonly known convict dumping ground part.  Despite being keenly aware of all the dangerous and deadly snakes, spiders and jellies, Bryson manages to make it through unscathed, despite the hunger of some very mean dogs.  He also discusses the unique ecology of the land, and the various problems caused by introduced species:  rabbits, foxes, camels and others.  This is all done with great humor, and his description of cricket radio commentary had me roaring with laughter.  Equally interesting are Bryson's descriptions of Australians, contemporary individuals he meets on his wanderings as wel as the famous and infamous from history.  For those who wish to explore some more of Australia, there is a valuable bibliography at the end.
076790382X|3.0|Another brilliant Bryson book! <br />This was the second book I've read by Bryson and this time, instead of telling us his stories of far-off places, he makes a place closer to home seem interesting- New England, his new home. It doesn't matter what part of America you live in, you'll still enjoy Bryson's fascination and bewilderment at our way of life, which as changed a lot more than we've guessed in only twenty years. Originally, the stories in the book were published as a weekly newspaper column in England, so it's more a collection of essays rather than a cohesive novel about his experiences. Still, Bryson writes with just enough humor and detail to make each essay seem satisfying. I would have never thought I would enjoy stories about dental floss, car cup holders, and toy shopping with children. Yet, at some points I was laughing out loud. I bet you will too. <br />
B0002I831S|3.0|They were spit'n them outta the factory like crazy in those days, not like now where it's five or six per season and a pat on the back to the overly pampered actors and actresses.  I liked the original series best, but it didn't actually start getting good until season three or so.  Just because it's Star Trek doesn't give it an automatic five stars.  Though even in its infancy, it's better than Voyager or Enterprise by far!  The first season of the Origial series was kind of silly and I am glad they soon got rid of Yeoman Rand. That relationship with Kirk and Rand was just too corney(the same could probably be said of Enterprises's Trip and The vulcan girl, what's her name)..  The only two I really liked for this STO first season were the \\"Where No Man has gone before\\" and \\"The Cage\\" with Jeffery Hunter and co-starred Susan Oliver and was actually not a TV release at all and is not on this set.

B00030590I|5.0|Hero is the tale of the uniting of China. It focuses around one man's (Jet Li) rendezvous with the king and for what purpose he was there. The story takes you through many different settings. All the settings were beautiful.     My favorite part of Hero was the wonderful cinematography. The intricacy of the worlds that Yimou Zhang creates is astounding. I also found the plot to be quite good, granted it was in Mandarin (English dubbing available). The constant plot twists created in Hero constantly keep you guessing.
B00007KWHP|5.0|\\"Fragile\\" is Yes's fourth album and is the one where all the pieces of the puzzle fell together for the band. This was the first Yes album to feature its now classic line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Bill Bruford and keyboardist Rick Wakeman. While it wasn't the first Yes album to feature elements of what would be known as progressive rock, \\"Fragile\\" was the first album where the band's progressive asthetic gelled into seamless perfection.<br /><br />While not technically a concept album, \\"Fragile\\" does flow as an effortless whole and alternates between band-performed material as well as five individual pieces highlighting each members virtuosity.<br /><br />The group material consists of four pieces which have since become timeless Yes standards. \\"Roundabout\\" is the song that introduced many people to the band and was Yes's first big-selling hit. Chris Squire's almost-funk-like bassline alongside Steve Howe's acoustic guitar harmonics and Bill Bruford's driving beat steer this piece with stellar vocal harmonies from Jon Anderson with Howe and Squire. Even over 30 years later, this track still encompasses everything good about Yes in its 8-minute running time.<br /><br />\\"South Side Of the Sky\\" is a forceful epic piece which features a haunting middle section showcasing Rick Wakeman's stellar piano work.<br /><br />\\"Long Distance Runaround\\" is a short catchy pop-rock piece that has a slight Beatles-influence to it. Along with \\"Roundabout\\", this track has also become one of the band's best-known songs.<br /><br />The last of the group material as well as the album's closer is the dynamic tour-de-force \\"The Heart Of The Sunrise\\". Throughout its nearly 11-minutes, this track runs the gamaut of solid group interplay, shifting time signatures and musical moods. Its opening and closing sections are probably the closest thing Yes has come to playing what many would consider heavy metal. Great work from Howe and Squire here as well.<br /><br />As for the individual pieces, Rick Wakeman is the first to be showcased with \\"Cans and Brahms\\". This piece is an adaptation of the third movement of Johannes Brahms' fourth symphony and is performed entirely on keyboards. The overall sound of this piece isn't too different from that of Walter/Wendy Carlos and the \\"Switched-On Bach\\" recordings.<br /><br />\\"We Have Heaven\\" is a short vocal tour-de-force by Jon Anderson in which he overdubbed all the vocal parts himself. While it's not an acapella piece (the band members do back Jon on this piece), Jon's vocals are at the forefront here and display his full voice range.<br /><br />\\"Five Percent for Nothing\\" is a 35-second piece composed by Bill Bruford in which he along with the rest of the band play a brief passage taken directly from a short percussion rudiment. The overall style of this piece is rhythmically complex yet abstract at the same time.<br /><br />\\"The Fish\\" is Chris Squire's showcase in which every part (except for the vocals and drums) was performed using different ranges of the bass guitar. The track would cement Squire into the hall of fame of being one of rock music's greatest bass players as it shows off his versitile and unique style which is at the heart of every Yes song.<br /><br />The solo material concludes with a mellow acoustic guitar piece from Steve Howe entitled \\"Mood For A Day\\". This piece is an unintruding relaxed work which showcases Steve's virtuosity on nylon-string guitar. A truly contemplative piece of music.<br /><br />The remastered CD on Rhino Records not only features enhanced artwork and new liner notes, it also includes two bonus tracks. \\"America\\" is the band's 10-minute take on the Simon and Garfunkel classic making it their very own. Steve Howe really shines here.  An early rough mix of \\"Roundabout\\" is included as well. While the track is essentially the same as the final album version, there are several noticable differences. Play them side by side and compare them. It is quite fascinating.<br /><br />Since its release in 1972, \\"Fragile\\" has become the ultimate Yes album for many. The album serves as an excellent introduction to the band and offers a wide range of musicality and moods. After this album, Yes would delve even further into epic proportions with their progressive classics \\"Close To The Edge\\", \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" and \\"Relayer\\". The first fruits of these efforts lay here on \\"Fragile\\" however. With their musical trademark now in place, \\"Fragile\\" would prove that Yes were well on their way.<br /><br />An Essential Album!!!release in 1972, \\"Fragile\\" has become the ultimate Yes album for many.

0156027321|3.0|The book tells the story of an Indian boy named Pi Patel. It is not his biograpy as it would seem but a recounting of a chapter in his early life. What this chapter contains is an adventurous and life-threatening journey. And ultimately the book is about human intelligence, courage and the survival instinct. It is very imaginatively written and bizarre events are described which does not seem entirely unbeleivabe during reading the story. There is a sense of joy of being alive in the protagonist no matter how deep trouble he is in.     There is an effort on part of the author to instil deep faith in God in the protagonist. Probably, this way the author is trying to give a message about beleving in God, which somehow didnt come across too strongly for me. Otherwise the book qualifies as a nice lost-in-the-sea castaway adventure book to me. Some vivid descriptions in the book made me wanna puke, but considering this a survival story, one may be driven to do unimaginable things to survive. If one can eat live spiders, worms, rotten eggs etc. on the TV show 'fear factor' for money then it makes more sense to drink turtle blood and raw fish for survival.
B00000IP3S|3.0|This album is definately their most hard-core. It sounds like a merge between their previous thrasy albums and their newer epic/choir sounding albums. This is not a good mix. Most of their songs start off with some wicked riffs and drums, some of the best song intros I've ever heard, but then they \\"pause\\" the pace and jump in with their choir sounding choruses. This has always been Blind Guardian's style, but this one didn't do it for me. They couldn't keep the pace going with most of their songs. \\"Imaginations from the Other Side\\" is a good example. It starts off with the coolest intro to a song I've ever heard! Then they jump into a rather boring and screaming chorus. Afterwards, there's an interesting solo, but after that it's just Hansi screaming to some drums. This literally kills the pace of the song. Usually, Blind Guardian is able to keep their songs interesting all the way through, but not in this case.    Besides their usual geeky-but-cool songs about Tolkien and other fantasy/horror stories, they focus on the crusades and King Arthur. I'm not one for hearing songs about Christ/God and holy wars, which they talk about on a couple of their songs, so this only makes me dislike the album more.    However, there are a couple great songs that come from this album. \\"Bright Eyes\\" is one of my favorite Blind Guardian songs. It travels at a nice pace and is interesting all the way through. Once you fall in love with this song, you'll love their acoustic version of it even more on \\"The Forgotten Tales\\". \\"A Past and Future Secret\\" took alot of time to grow on me. It's an alright song. It has the usual BG \\"folk\\" sound to it, which means it's nothing new if you're already a Blind Guardian fan. \\"And the Story Ends\\" has some nice riffs and is a good song to end the album with. \\"Modred's Song\\" is probably the only other song worth mentioning. It's just okay.    All in all, if you're a Blind Guardian fan, you're still missing out if you don't have this album. If you're not, It's worth a look, because as far as I know, I'm the only one who really has a problem with this album. Maybe you'll find it wicked and awesome like most BG fans, but don't get your hopes up.
B0002X314C|5.0|this album is excellent. this is one of the few cds i own that i can play all the way through without skipping tracks. his voice is beutiful and i really wish him the best. (he ain't hard to look at either!) please go cop this record! don't sleep on it!
0425173895|5.0|Agatha Christie, the doyenne supreme of the English mystery novel, wrote in the Murder of Roger Ackroyd, one of the most stunning examples of the genre. <br /> <br />Detective mysteries reached its apotheosis in the first few decades of the 20th century.  Edgar Allen Poe is credited with inventing the genre, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with the iconical Sherlock Holmes created the eccentric detective and Dorothy Sayers for her erudite writing and witty portrayal of Lord Peter.  But only Agatha Christie managed to create not one but two supremely popular and fascinating detectives, Miss Marple, the sweet and sharp elderly spinster and Hercule Poirot, that finicky, green-eyed retired Belgian sleuth. <br /> <br />In 1927, Christie was part of a \\"Detective Writer's Club\\" that included many prominent writers, including Ms. Sayers.  They met and wrote to one another and compiled a list of \\"rules\\" for the detective genre.  In fact, they collaborated on a book called the \\"Admiral's Club\\", a mediocre result but fascinating for its provenance. <br /> <br />Yes, the denouement to the Murder of Roger Ackroyd is surprising, but the Detectives Club, after much discussion claimed that Christie had played fair, and critics should accept that they had been hoodwinked. <br /> <br />Don't think about this when you read the book.  Enjoy the characters, some flat, but still appealing.  The servants with something to hide, the pretty niece, the handsome blackguard adopted son, the stuffed-up Colonel who talks endlessly about his days at the Shanghai Club and one of the most developed characters - the gossipy, autocratic and ultimately kindly spinster sister, Caroline.   <br /> <br />Enjoy the setting - the English village in the 1920s.  The new technologies that seem so quaint to us and yet still prevalent in our own societies.  The gossip, the lovers triangles, the class snobbery.  There's something so delicious about these closed-door mysteries with characters running around a large home, each with their own secrets.  Of course, only Hercule Poirot can illuminate and integrate these secrets to reveal the truth and an unexpected quality of mercy.   <br /> <br />Hercule Poirot - that lovable prima donna, forever trying to retire, and like Don Corleone, finding himself \\"dragged back in\\".  Of course he loves the chase.  And like one of the characters said about him, he is never more dangerous then when he's playing the \\"ridiculous mounteback\\". <br /> <br />Don't read this first if you've never read Agatha Christie.  Read Five Little Pigs, The Murder on the Orient Express, The Body in the Library,Ten Little Indians and other masterpieces.  Then you will appreciate the number of ways she managed to outwit us.  Read \\"Roger Ackroyd\\" once for fun and twice for a master class in detective ficton writing.
6305280762|5.0|I have never understood why critics have reviled this 1975 disaster film.  In an article on Oscar's \\"mistakes,\\" they said they couldn't understand how this movie could be nominated for Best Picture; it ended up winning three well deserved Oscars for some of its technical mastery.  And why not nominate it?  It's what movie making is all about.  Big, flashy spectacle; a cast of previous Oscar winners and nominees; extraordinary special effects (remember this was 1975, folks) and a who's gonna get it next waiting around every corner.  The whole cast does justice to their roles, even if they are stereotypes.  Isn't that what a successful disaster movie requires?  Some of the supporting players like Susan Flannery and Robert Vaughn did very well with the bigger name stars, too.  And the DVD transfer maintains the lush colors and cinematography, and the chills are still there.  When all is said and done, this is a great disaster film and poopoo to those who like to undermine its power.
B000002H33|5.0|I read through several pages of reviews. The only negative review I seen I think probably came from people that just don't like the fact that Metallica has evolved into a very successful comercial band. Either that or they just don't like this kind of music.  <br /> <br />I remember buying this record on LP back when it first came out. I bought it because of the buzz that I had read about Metallica in magazines without ever evening hearing the band. Back then, Metallica was pretty much an underground band, my local radio wouldn't touch a Metallica song and since Metallica never made a video until the Justice For All album which followed this one...there wasn't much in the way of promotion other then word of mouth and Metal magazines. To be honest, when I first bought this LP I listened to it a few times and it didn't really grab my attention. I thought it was good but it wasn't until about 4 to 6 months after I bought it that I truly digested it. At the time I was shamefully more into a more melodic kind of metal. Probably the heaviest thing I was listening to was Iron Maiden. I remember not listening to it and then one day I just put it back on the turntable and it just hit me...BAM!!!  This is pretty heavy. And with each subsquent listening it grew on me more and more. It got to the point that I'd listen to this whole album and when it was over...start it at the beginning again.  <br /> <br />Now, almost 20 years later. I own every Metallica CD ever made and I have seen them in concert 3 times. When I seen them on the And Justice For All tour...that concert is still the best concert I have ever seen. And this is still the greatest Metallica CD that Metallica ever made. I didn't jump off the bandwangon when they turned more commercial. I just appreciate the older stuff more and this is the best of the older stuff.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this Metallica CD. If you are a fan of the new stuff...do yourself a favor and go buy this CD and give it a good listen.Their sound has become a bit more polished over the years but this is an incredible CD. Oh yeah, I did replace my LP with the CD version...LOL. So I have two copies of the best Metallica album ever made.
B0000844I8|3.0|Amazon promises that this DVD has a \\"making of\\" documentary included(look where it says \\"DVD features\\"). In fact, the version they sent me does NOT! I later learned that the ultimate edition is supposed to be a 2 DVD set, with the \\"making of\\" doc being on the second disc. Amazon sent me one disc only. I think what happened pherhaps is that originally, the first ones they produced were a 2 disc set(these were the ones with the gold foil) and later editions without the gold foil did not include the second disc. That is all fine and good, but Amazon should not make false claims about what you're getting.  Also, they say that it includes both the theatrical cut and the longer version. Mine has only the longer version, probably becuase the theatrical cut is on the missing second disc! I've been cheated by amazon.com
0385335482|5.0|This book is fun to read~! There no other way to put it.  If you have time and want to read a good relaxing book this is one for it.  If you a shopper, in debt or know people that like either or.. this is definately one for you.  I love shopping, sometimes am in debt..  so I loved it.. it inspired me at times to have hope, but then also hope for a lucky break! well, just read it you'll know what i mean.
B0000CFW87|5.0|First off, I just want to say how beautiful his music is. I seriously cant belive that at his age he has such an amazing voice!! My fav songs from this album include: My confession, Mi Mancherai, when you say you love me,Per Te, broken vow, remember when it rained, and you raise me up. These songs are beautifully written and sung. He has so much passion and depth to his music. &#60;br /&#62;      Someone I saw in here wrote a preview saying  &quot; I cant believe he sang, &quot;Theres more to love than only bitterness and lies&quot;. I think you are confused about that line. I think you should read the words as you hear the song and you would get what hes trying to say. Its actually a sad yet beautiful song! Anyways, I think the CD is wonderful and I listen to it most everyday........I give it 5 stars!!!!!!!!
0385424736|5.0|I love John Girsham's books and all the movies. He has great amount of experience writing about the law and it's complicated twists.  His writing style is easy to pick and and enjoy for all people.  One can see the words being drawn into a movie as they are reading.  I like to read books before watching a movie because it is usually better and so I recommend people to do so.  Their imaginations are alwayz more creative than any motion picture can display.  enjoy reading!
B0006399FS|4.0|When I listened to this album the first time I didn't have too many expectations. Maybe that's the problem with U2 they're so big that people expect more. No this album is not like the 80's and 90's but if it was everyone would say they do the same thing all the time. What makes bands the best is their ability to continually create new and different music. This is exactly why they are being inducted into the hall of fame. This album is good from start to end, how many are like that these days? Think about it. Punk rock can't do that too often. There's a reason U2 has been around this long. Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World, etc. etc. how long will they really be around? This album is great for sitting back and just chilling. If you are a real music lover and can progress with the times you will like this album.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|I have to say, after listening to these 30 second music clips, I can't help but wonder why everyone so enamored of this band.  I think if I wanted to hear music like this, I would check out Ed Harcourt.  Harcourt is more talented, and his voice is much better.
B0002X314C|5.0|I love this CD! John Legend has a melodic and gritty voice that crosses music genres. His songs will appeal to lovers of \\"old-school\\", gospel, rap, and country.  <br /> <br />I especially love \\"I Can Change\\", \\"Stay With You\\", Let's Get Lifted Again\\", and \\"So High\\". These songs make me wanna grab somebody and \\"take it real slow\\".  <br /> <br />This CD is a definite winner! John Legend is gifted artist. I hope to hear more from him in the future. <br />
0131177052|5.0|I got a copy of this book based on the title; I often work with legacy code that is hard to change and hard to test. As I read the book, I discovered that it directly addressed some problems that I was encountering on a daily basis. This book shows you how to apply patterns and refactorings to the problem of untangling dependencies in legacy code and making it more testable. And testing is an essential step to enabling change.<br /><br />If you every develop software for commercial applications that already have an existing code base (this would be pretty much every system), you should buy this book. This book is an excellent companion to any book you have on testing, refactoring or patterns as it shows you how to apply these techniques to real problems.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I've been looking foreward to the DVD release.   The main reason I bought it (besides now being able to see it on a big screen) were the bonuses. The documentary \\"Empire of Dreams\\" for examples,  which was really great and tells the whole Star Wars behind the scene's story, from how it all started in George Lucas's mind and how it finaly came in the theaters.  In the off chance that you're buying the DVD set and haven't seen the movies yet, see them first, and watch the specials afterwards, it'll be more magical if you don't know how they did it !  Bottom line: I loved it !!!
B00006469V|5.0|It is fitting that Parsifal was Wagner's last opera because it is his ultimate masterpiece -- and one of the greatest masterpieces in all of opera. The music of Parsifal is both gorgeous and profound, so much so as to almost transport the listener to another world. There are several fine recordings of Parsifal but none finer than this one. Rene Kollo sings beautifully and superbly conveys Parsifal's transition from a naive youth to the full-fledged knight of the Grail. Gottlob Frick, Christa Ludwig, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau are equally superb in their roles and Georg Solti's conducting is magnificent. If you love great music I believe that you will love Parsifal, even if you don't particularly like Wagner's other operas. Parsifal is special, and so is this magnificent recording of it.
015204907X|5.0|Have you ever noticed that many of the best picture books for children aged zero to five tend to involve sheep?  Why is this?  What is it about sheep that make them ideal receptacles of authorial wit and wisdom?  Is it their woolly coats?  Their sly sweet faces?  Their remarkably loud baas?  Whatever the case, I've had the pleasure of reading smartly written sheep books that vary from \\"Sheep In a Jeep\\" by Nancy Shaw to this more recent Mem Fox creation, \\"Where is the Green Sheep\\".  Helped in no small part by newcomer Judy Horacek, the book is a deft examination of various sheeplike and unsheeplike activities.  It's a surprisingly charming and winning little book that's certain to earn the undivided love and attention of ankle biters worldwide.<br /><br />Using remarkably simple words, the book follows various sheep through their day.  We see sheep of many colors and sheep taking baths.  We have sheep up and we have sheep down.  There are band sheep, wind sheep, near and far sheep.  Just about any kind of sheep you can think of, this book's got `em.  Still, one question keeps popping up throughout the pages.  Where is the green sheep?  By the end, we discover the mysterious green sheep's location and exactly what it is doing.  It's an oddly satisfying way to end the tale and so we do.<br /><br />Mem Fox incites an odd following of rabid pro-Fox fans everywhere.  People cannot get enough of this woman.  I've never completely fallen under the Fox spell myself, but with this book I'm beginning to see her charms.  Though the story would be far less interesting if it was not accompanied by Judy Horacek's illustrations (more on that later), it's still a bouncy flouncy flurry of fun.  In fact after all the crazy sheep antics there are two blank pages containing these words at the story's close.  \\"What IS that green sheep?  Turn the page quietly - let's take a peep...\\".  And then you see the book's namesake, \\"fast asleep\\" under a lovely green bush.  The whole book rhymes beautifully, scanning perfectly on every page.  So to finish with this sweet quiet ending... well it does the heart good.<br /><br />But the real star of this show is Judy Horacek.  An Australian who's bookflap merely refers to her credits as having, \\"written and illustrate(d) books of her own\\", she has burst onto the children's publishing scene with a whiz and a bang.  Her style is best summarized as deceptively simple.  In truth, it mostly consists of sheep, scenes, and actions drawn with a black Rotring Isograph pen and colored in with various shaded and colorful watercolors.  This sounds dull.  It is not.  Horacek's sheep have somehow been imbued with remarkable jolts of personality and joy.  Whether you're watching the antics of the rain sheep dancing about a lamppost or the car sheep fixing its engine, something about these animals is bloody fascinating.  But the moment in the book where these wooly stars really got me was the section that discusses near and far.  You turn the page and find yourself nose to furry nose with a sheep viewing you intently.  The two little black spots that make up its eyes bore into yours.  And on the next page is a far sheep.  Possibly as small as Horacek's thick tipped pen could draw.  It doesn't matter what these lollygagging lambs are doing.  Every step they take is spellbinding.<br /><br />So there you have it.  A great book for children that are just beginning to read.  And trust me, a predilection towards sheep is not required to enjoy this book.  It's just one of those rare tales that adults will enjoy reading over and over and over and that kids will find equally enjoyable that many times.  It's not one of those grand works of preschool literature, but it's a great book.  Just give it a glance.  As sheep books go, it's a keeper indeed.ymes beautifully, scanning perfectly on every page.

B00005JMCW|5.0|Despite having the tired plot of body-switching, freaky Friday turned out to be a really good movie. Although the two main characters were a bit extreme (not many students in my high school were as punk as Anna (Lohan) and I don't know of too many parents who actually remove their kid's bedroom like Tess (Curtis) did after Anna's troubles at school the night before the switcheroo), I suppose it does add to the contrast between mother and daughter. Other characters include the stereotypical bratty little brother, boyfriend with a motorcycle, and stuck-up cheerleader, but also include an earthquake-fearing grandpa, magical Chinese restaurant cook, and some really weird patients at Tess's psychiatrist's office. It's a really funny movie, and it's also one of those movies that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I'm not in the movie's intended audience but I still enjoyed it.
B00061QK16|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie at all. The storyline is very thin, the story itself is not interesting. The actors did what they could with the material. I'm very glad that I didn't see this in the theatre because I considered \\"walking out\\" while watching it at home.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is really how it feels to be American and living in Tokyo. Sort of disjointed and intrigued at the same time. Of course we can't all live as well as Bill and Scarlett, but the loneliness they experience would be familiar to an American whose tried living in Japan. Sofia nails it.
0783240236|4.0|This is a great movie, and actually extremely influential in the horror genre. Everyone knows what The Birds is, even if they don't know who Alfred Hitchcock is. Also, the kid who said earlier that it has a terrible ending was obviously looking for some gory thrasher shocker ending, because the ending is great and leaves you thinking about the movie for days. You won't soon forget this movie, so check it out. *Also, look for Hitchcock walking dogs out of the pet shop near the beginning.*

Faux funk; upbeat yet colorless; tuneless, scary frontman. Robert Plamer he's not [and, rest his soul, Robert Plamer wasn't much in later years], but thank the gods they're not Jamiroquai. Adam Levine - as unlikely and unsexy as ever a rock star there was - spent too many a teenage sleepless night, enveloped within his headphones, journeying the secret life of plants, in search of Stevie...apparently never finding him. My grade: C+
076790592X|5.0|I just finished reading Tuesdays with Morrie, and there were tears in my eyes by the time I was reading the last couple of chatpers in the book. The book itself started out very sad from the beginning. But when I read the chapter about the good-bye, I just broke down. <br />This book has touched me so much, and there was so much truth in Morrie's words. He was a wonderful teacher. <br />Tuesdays with Morrie has changed my attitude about life. I now know to live life to its fullest, and to share love with people. Morrie's undying love for teaching, his optimistic attitude, all of these tenacious, strong qualities of him make him a fantastic man. There is so much I have learned, and I feel that this book is the epitome of inspiration and hope. <br /> <br />This book is definitely worth the read. I first read Mitch Albom's The Five People You meet in Heaven, and would also strongly recommend it. Tuesdays with Morrie is not a very long book, and I found it a quick, sad, but inspirational read. I have recommended it to my book club and I hope everyone will pick up a copy of this book, for it has wisdom and love to share. Mitch Albom has written a book that deserves five stars, no doubt about it.
B0001AP12G|4.0|...I announced this as THE CD of the year  the week it was released and co-workers and friends alike looked at me in abstract awe.  Producer-cum-rapper West displays the most culturally alive and [even better] the finest beats of the year.  He's substance over style, and while he's never boasted to be the greatest MC, he's second to almost none in deft storytelling - his stance on the educational system not totally arguable, religiosity juxtaposed with positivity/negativity, the faith in his lord [not mine], the war within the black community [and the lack of political interest as opposed to hot rims], humbling yet boastful.  In the realm of passe hip hop thugs churning out immature bile masquerading as macho braggadocio, West offers some of the most ripened and developed lyrics in ages.  But it's his truths that are the key to his proposed longevity and it's the truths that set everyone free.  All with his God on his side.  Ironic, huh?  My grade: A
B000002INJ|5.0|This is Manowar's best album, the best introduction for a neophyte, and just a sick album. Plus it's Ross the Boss' last. Each of the recent reviewers I read, however, don't understand metal, just their ass and its peculiar needs.   \\"A music fan\\"? This anonymous, little twig of a person loves saying, \\"naturally growing psychoactive drugs.\\" Besides being lame, how old are you? Grow up and do some drugs, quit tucking it between your legs, and take your pseudo-intellectual lingo elsewhere. You said nothing.   \\"Prehistoric Predator\\" has a problem with the \\"arrogant and cheesy lyrics.\\" Prehistoric Predator? What are you saying? Cheesy? You suck, just like your crappy name, and have no idea what you're talking about. Again, I'd say that P.P. is another know-nothing teen who, due to a paltry knowledge of heavy metal, needs some guidance. I mean, look at the cover-you know what you're getting, dummy.   \\"Deathraider2000\\" (sounds like an evil dildo) also has a problem with this classic cd. Says \\"silly tracks like Warriors Prayer\\" ruin things. You, like the others, are not a Manowar or a metal fan, sound extremely young, and fail to grasp what the music of the band is all about. Go think about it for a while, you twerp, and show that you have an inkling of what heavy metal is all about.   \\"Rayotron\\" was completely set off by the ubermensch review that said that Manowar was better than the Beatles. Now, one gets the impression that Rayotron was never going to write a review at all, until those gods of his were mentioned. Who knew? All of the sudden 'Manowar sucks, Judas Priest is number one, you all have small penises,' etc. Dude just flipped out. He even forgot how to spell half the words he was using. They must have some killer weed down there in Mexico.  Look, this album is Manowar's best, and instills in one a feeling that any of life's difficulties may be conquered. Besides being great music with heartfelt lyrics, this album has inspired people all over the world and continues to do so.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I grew up with Starsky & Hutch. I feel like I'm reliving my childhood again and it's a wonderful feeling.  Great acting & fantastic rapport between Paul Michael Glaser & David Soul make this series a really enjoyable watch.
6302477751|5.0|Tim Burton's best movie, Jhonny Depp's best role. A fairytale kind of story with drama, suspense, romance, and an occasianal laugh! Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should see it right away! This is my all-time favorite movie! ****** - an impossible six star rating!
B00003CXCT|4.0|We all know how awesome these movies are. This goes without saying. However, it's my opinion that the packaging seems a little flimsy and not a lot of extra love went into it. I guess I have been spoiled by stellar and artistic packaging treatment of each of the Lord Of The Rings extended versions.     Anyways, By all means you should buy and enjoy these movies on DVD but I for one was a little disappointed with the presentation (and naturally that the set doesn't include the original versions).
0151003084|5.0|To begin with, this book is how I learned my ABCs as a young child.  Does this mean that I would suggest others use it for this purpose?  No.  But for those of you with a proclivity for the macabre and the strangely beautiful... please buy this tiny gem of a book.  I have bought it for all of my friends (all adults I assure you...) and they delight in its uneasy glee in describing the demise of 26 unique children.  Call it funny, call it odd, or call it horrid... it's still a must-read!
B00000JZIK|5.0|Now and then, someone asks you what your favorite movie of all time is.  The Usual Suspects is on my short list.<br /><br />The first time I watched it, I was a bit confused by it.  Then came that ending, that final shot.  It was an \\"oh my god\\" moment.  I am rarely surprised by \\"surprise endings\\".  They are usually telegraphed early on.  But this one completely had me.<br /><br />It is one of those movies you enjoy more the second and third and fourth time around, always picking up things you missed before.<br /><br />It has a great villain.  That is very important to a story.  There is no hero, which, come to think of it, is odd.  But the villain is nearly of the magnitude of Tolkein's character Sauron.  How about a Kaiser Soze action figure?  No, that would ruin the ending, wouldn't it.
0451197968|5.0|Forget Arnold. Other than the character names this book is entirely different.  Ben Richards is on the run. This is the future of reality TV.  Richards is poor and has a 3 year old child - sick with respiratory ailments - just like all the poor folk who cant afford clean air filters. He is chosen to be on the running man - the Mack-Daddy of all prime time shows. The runner gets 100 dollars an hour and wins a billion if he can run for the full 30 days without getting caught. All he has to do is send in a tape to the studio once a day to show he is still alive. Easy right? Then how come the record is only eight days? Because the entire county is looking for you and will get rewards for sightings or even killing you! There is also a team of professional hunters that will stop at nothing from killing their prey. Friends and relatives will be bribed or tortured as the case may be for information. This book moves at breakneck speed and the pressure does not stop until the incredible ending. The only advantage Richards has is a twelve-hour head start and the fact there are no rules. If you thought Ken Jennings was a tough contestant on Jeopardy you haven't seen Ben Richards. Buy this book and get ready to run...<br /><br />Relic113
B0002IVN9W|5.0|this is not what you think it is.  no.  no, shut up for a second.<br />this is not what you think it is.  it is an indie rock album, and it is very good.<br />highly recommended.
0451196716|5.0|It's the Future of reality TV. One Hundered boys start walking down the road. They have to go faster than four miles an hour and cannot slow down below that rate more than three times. If they do they are shot in the head. That's it. That's all there is to this masterpiece. One boy wins the prize, the rest pay the price. This is more of a psychological terror book than anything else. We are in the mind of sixteen year old Ray Garraty as he walks down the road. We learn the why people would walk, and what keeps them going, and what happens when death is less painful than the next step. As I read this book I could not help but wonder how long I could last. As Ray learns it is not about the fittest or the strongest or even who has the best shoes. To be champion of the long walk takes something more. Of all of Bachman's book this is the one that is most in need of being read. It truly is a great journey and one that every reader of terror must go on.<br /><br />Relic113
B00005JMAH|5.0|First off, I have to confess I haven't read a single one of the myriad Harry Potter books out there. In that regard, I might have enjoyed the film better than some of those who had, and who complain that the film doesn't adhere too strictly to the book. I know that I had my apoplectic moments in \\"The Two Towers\\", in particular, being a die-hard purist when it comes to the sanctity of Tolkien's story.    This is, by far, a much darker story than the previous two and, based on what I know of the books, later installments are darker, still. In some respects, the heroic trio of Hermione, Ron and Harry behave a bit more like members of Slytherin house in this one, with Harry and Hermione in particular indulging in temper tantrums, knocking and breaking things (occasionally someone else's body parts) and generally doing exactly what the rules forbid, albeit for noble reasons on the most part. Regardless, the set and tone for the film could be straight out of and Edward Gorey picture book.    The film starts off with perhaps a more real-world view of the Dursleys and their treatment of Harry. In the previous two films, this \\"child abuse\\" was treated with an almost comic gloss which I, personally, found a bit demeaning to the reality of what real world children in that situation experience. Here, it's ugly, and rightfully so.     Once Harry attempts to return to the \\"sanctuary\\" of Hogwarts, he encounters the Dementors, his implacable enemies throughout the film, and Prof. Lupin, who, in this film at least, supercedes Dumbledore as his primary adult ally. Snape's malevolence seems more directed at Lupin, his colleague, than any of the trio, with Snape actually engaging in a bit of a rescue of the three at the end, or at least trying to. Despite his ominous attitude, Snape shows a tremendous sense of duty and integrity regardless of House affiliation. Then again, I am partial to anything which Rickman does as an actor.    Disappointing is Sir Gambon as Dumbledore. He doesn'tpossess the weight and charisma one would expect of the character, though Sir Harris is definitely a difficult act to follow.    The true stars of the show, as it were, are the three young actors, and the set. Watson and Grint continue to demonstrate a tremendous future in their chosen careers. Grint, in particular, can eloquently express in his facial expressions alone what Radcliff has yet to ascertain how to do with all of his acting tools, combined. Regardless, Radcliff shows some maturity and is less stiff and more believable in this installment, provided one overlooks those scenes where extreme emotion is called for. Watson, without a doubt, is destined to be one of Britain's leading ladies in her adulthood.    The set design of this film is superb. While the previous Hogwarts and Diagon Alley settings were more Medieval Fantasy for the former, and Dickensian Christmas for the latter, both have undergone a much needed update. Diagon Alley now looks and feels like a piece of late Victorian society, with coal choked and dingy industrial revolution streets, while Hogwarts itself appears an old castle periodically updated to the Victorian age. The classrooms are stunning, particularly that of Defense Against the Dark Arts, where Lupin holds sway.  The environs of the castle itself reflect a much more pagan and magickal aire, with dolmens and other mysterious archeological relics abounding. Finally, as a fan of Prague, I was delighted to see that the set designers had incorporated an astronomical clock into Hogwarts, though it's location of the pendulum at the entrance was unlikely, at best.    The story itself is perhaps less thrilling than any of the past, but the caliber of the acting carries the film to the top of the three, in my opinion.
B00008O89K|5.0|Basil Poledouris' score to Conan the Barbarian is one of the great powerhouses of film music and remains as one of my favorite film scores to this date. <br /> <br />The score is a perfect blend of melodic beauty and raw power with a huge orchestral sound and lots of wonderful choral passages that range from haunting and slow to in-your-face and over-the-top.  I could go on forever on this score, but suffice it to say that I really can't think of a more perfect score than this. <br /> <br />As for the CD's sound quality... <br /> <br />The sound quality is definitely dated and isn't quite as crisp and clean as one would hope.  However, what it lacks in sound quality, it more than makes up for in musical quality.  I've purchased a number of albums containing re-recordings of Conan music and while the sound quality has been better, NOTHING has matched the emotion and power of the original film soundtrack. <br /> <br />Differences between the editions... <br /> <br />This 12-track Milan edition was released first, followed later by an expanded 16-track edition by Varese Sarabande. <br /> <br />The Milan CD runs around 49 minutes, while the Varese edition runs about 67 minutes.  The Varese edition includes pretty much all the same music as the Milan release, with one exception: <br />The first track of the Milan edition opens up with Mako's opening prologue speech which then immediately segues into the \\"Anvil of Crom\\" opening.  The Varese track opens up directly with \\"Anvil of Crom\\". <br /> <br />The Varese edition adds the following four tracks: <br />- Mountain of Power Procession (3:21) <br />- The Tree of Woe (3:31) <br />- Recovery (2:11) <br />- Death of Rexor (5:34) <br /> <br />and expands the following two tracks: <br />- The Leaving/The Search (5:59) <br />- The Kitchen/The Orgy (6:30) <br /> <br />Compared to the original Milan tracks: <br />- The Search (3:09) <br />- The Orgy (4:14) <br /> <br />All in all, the Milan edition is missing about 19 minutes worth of music. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the Varese edition is definitely worth seeking out, but even if you decide to get the 12-track Milan edition, the music is worth getting in whatever form you can. <br /> <br />For any fan of film music and for any fan of the film, this score is definitely a must have! <br /> <br />However, if you're an audiophile, you may want to think twice.
B00004TLN3|1.0|Having read all six of the works in Austen's published canon, Northanger Abbey as a book is a bit wanting (most likely a work of post-juvenalia, it lacks the mature style of her later--and better known for a reason--works; the narrative voice is very heavy-handed, and lacks the subtle, at times biting, sarcastic tone of works like Pride and Prejudice and and Emma).  Having said that, this movie takes incredible liberties with the story she put on paper.  The casting is terrible (in a so-bad-it's-funny-but-not-for-the-right-reasons sort of way), the direction is lacking (surely an adaptation of an Austen novel was never meant to be so melodramatic), the incidental music is over-the-top, and the whole thing is played out in a serious manner (not only is the adaptation and acting that bad, but they don't even try to give it a tongue-in-cheek spin).  If you're looking for a follow-up to the BBC Pride and Prejudice miniseries from about 10 years ago, try the BBC version of Emma (not the Paltrow one), or the recent adaptation of Persuasion--despite the similarities in its title and the names of characters and places, you won't find real _Austen_ here.
B00005JNSK|5.0|This movie looks truer to the book than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. What I think Roald Dahl was saying is that children are spoiled and brats. I think this version will be darker and better. Not a sappy kids musical. The candy man can! Blah, blah, and blah. No music I hope (unless it's funny.)
0671027387|1.0|Dan Brown writes as if for ten year olds.  His stories are predictable, his characters are shallow and uninteresting, and his understanding of science is laughable.<br /><br />Don't read Dan Brown books.
0385510438|3.0|I often wonder if John Grisham didn't write such a good first 3 books, would he be nearly as popular as he is now.  He is a good writer, his books flow, they are easy to read, but they just end....I often find myself saying, a book was way too long, I find his too short....This was a good story, well developed, that ended in 2 pages....Maybe that is what keeps his books alive, they are all fast paced and build, I just wish the endings would develop also.  I liked The Last Juror, it was good, but I wonder, could it have been great?
B000268QB2|5.0|I head of this band while watching the show One Tree Hill. I loved the song so much that i decided to find out who it was. The next day i saw them on t.v and instantly fell in love with them. I work in a music store and own over 200 c.ds and this is the best c.d i have ever heard. It isn't just music. It takes you to another world! The fact that the piano makes up for the lack of guitar gives Keane an amazing sound that cannot be compared to anything else out there. I recommend this c.d to anyone who is really into music. I guarantee that you will fall in love with them as much as i have! Go buy it, it is worth every cent!
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove<br /><br />Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb<br /><br />I knew I would love this 1964 film from the beginning. As the opening Addams Family-esque credits by Pablo Ferro rolled over blatant love scenes between planes and phallic missiles and meadow lark love scene music trickled to my ears, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />General Jack D. Ripper (seriously) informs his British-Exchange officer Mandrake (the great Peter Sellers of Insp. Jacques Clousea fame, who plays several roles) that we will be going to \\"Plan R\\" in a shooting war against the Russians in order to preserve their precious bodily fluids... A cowboy hat-clad bomber pilot and his crew (which includes a young James Earl Jones' screen debut) set off to bomb the hell out of the russkies while the American government tries desperately to stop them.<br /><br />It is chock full of strange and funny details such as a binder with the title \\"World Targets in Megadeaths\\" or the bombers' survival kits including lipstick and nylons or the Russia Premier being named Kiss-off. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the conversations between Kissoff and President Muffley- where Peter Sellers really has a chance to shine.<br /><br />Kubrick did a lot of research before beginning to adapt Peter George's 1958 novel \\"Red Alert\\". Originally he intended it to be a serious film on nuclear devastation called \\"Edge of Doom\\", but later changed it to a satire to better voice his concerns. The result is the black and white classic full of stellar performances and quirky moments that rules the cult film section.<br /><br />I really recommend watching the special features on the DVD.<br /><br />The \\"interviews\\" with Scott and Sellers give a great look at Seller's remarkable ability to slide into different regional accents.<br /><br />The \\"Making of\\" featurette is also very informative and provides a great look at the cast.<br /><br />\\"You just start your countdown and old Bucky will beback before you can say Blast-Off!\\"

B0006284JQ|5.0|I love this CD because it has all of Britney's most famous songs all on one CD, with some excellent new additions. Toxic, Everytime, Lucky, Crazy and Overprotected, are probably my favorite Britney tracks on the album. But they are all great fun to listen too. Definatly a great buy for someone who loves britney but doesn't have all of her CD's.  <br /> <br />I just really wish they put, \\"Dont let me be the last to Know,\\" and, \\"From the Bottom of my Broken Heart,\\" on the CD, they were huge hits....so why aren't they on the CD?!! I know they were a lot bigger hits than, \\"Outrageous,\\" ever was. <br /> <br />I know that \\"Dont let me be the last to Know\\" appears on the European Verison of the album, as well as, \\"Born to Make You Happy,\\" and \\"I Love Rock and Roll.\\" The two latter songs were European only singles, which is why they don't appear on the North American version of the CD. So if you want some extra songs on buy the European Version instead. <br /> <br />Awesome CD BUY IT, You'll love it.
B000002U82|1.0|OK, I guess this album is supposed to be relaxing? You don't hear any words until mid way into the 3rd song. yah really boring, instrumental, sleepy sounds. The song 'Money' is kinda random mabey it should be on another album because this song actually rocks! 'Great Gig in the Sky' is all piano and a woman singing (not words) just screaming (kinda opera like) This album sucks except for 'Money' which is one of my favorite songs. The firs two are extreamly long and all instrumental. and I really don't like this album.

B000002UAX|5.0|Better than \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", the \\"White Album\\" is the difinitive masterpiece by the greatest rock band in history. This is the Beatles being themselves. On the \\"White Album\\" the band steps away from their own image not just to explore new avenues, but to create new roads. Original at every turn, this is a recording of a great band laying the foundation for what would later be heralded as AOR (Album Oriented Rock).
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's album is a breathe of fresh air in a stale music scene. Every song on the album is catchy and his talent shines through.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|\\"Afterglow\\" while better than \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" is not in the same league as her earlier masterpiece \\"Surfacing\\". I believe this album will be well received by Mclaughlin fans, but those not familiar with her music, might want to try \\"Surfacing\\" or the live \\"Mirrorball\\" before purchasing \\"Afterglow\\".
B0006399FS|5.0|Hey U2 ! can you please release these songs as singles: <br />Miracle Drug, A Man and A Woman, Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own, Crumbs From Your Table, Original Of The Species and City Of Blinding Lights?  Just so these schmucks would appreciate your newest album better?? <br /> <br />Those who gave nasty review of this album must have only listened to this album once (if any, maybe just listened to the first 30 sec of each songs?). Just because they released Vertigo as their first single, everybody expects there's going to be 10 more vertigos in the album.  And just admit it, Vertigo sounds good ONLY because they play it on the ipod commercial and radio over and over again.  You have to listen to ANY U2 album over and over again to appreciate the depth of their songs.  And i dont even get somebody that criticized Bono's lyrics.  If anything consistent thruout their career IS Bono's lyrics. <br /> <br />I personally think Vertigo is out of place in this album, just like Beautiful Day was in 'All That...' album.  They are the most and only catchy tune on each album that's released as a single to lure in non-U2 fans into their real songs.  Dont get me wrong, i love these songs, it's just that it backlashed like this album. And now, they release All Because Of You - which i like the LEAST from this album.  But before you know it, everybody gonna say Vertigo and All Because Of You are the only 2 good songs in the album; that's until... they released the next single. <br /> <br />Here's my personal rank of U2 studio albums: <br />1. Achtung Baby <br />2. Unforgettable Fire / The Joshua Tree / How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb  <br />3. All That You Can't Leave Behind / Rattle and Hum <br />4. Zooropa / Pop <br />5. Boy / October / War  <br /> <br />If you're looking for some band who cranked out the same formula from album to album for decades, then look elsewhere.  If you're a self-proclaimed U2 fan stucked in a certain U2 era, by all means just keep listening to that U2 album - their albums are timeless anyway.  If you're a true U2 fan then.... you've already embraced this new album.

B000000OQF|5.0|I loved this back then, and its now an absolute classic. Every song a winner. All songs were based on the real life way these guys were living.  <br /> <br />Welcome to the Jungle was based upon Axl's arrival in L.A. Nightrain was based on the cheap wine called Nightrain the guys used to buy as it was all they could afford.  <br />Out ta Get Me - The people in the bands past that were always on their case.  <br />My Michelle and Rocketqueen - two girls who were friends of the band.  <br />Sweet Child O Mine - Slash came up with the opening riff, as a type of joke, and Axl loved it, and used a poem he had penned for his then girlfriend (and later to be wife) Erin, for the lyrics.  <br />Dr Brownstone - About the experience the band was having with drugs. <br />The music on this record, is from a band that lived on the edge and had nothing to lose. Legendary. <br /> <br />If only these guys had'nt split up.
B0006284JQ|5.0|She's awesome. I love Britney she's a great singer, great dancer, great writer, a good actress with a lot going for her in the movie industry. Nobody has ever came close to Britney in terms of sheer success and her performances are just like WOW! This cd is awesome because it has all her hits in one. Also you get a bonus cd of a couple of remixes. I love the Everytime remix and the compliation remix of mostly all her hits in one cool song. She's the best. :)

I.e Live and let Die, Sympathy for the Devil and Aint it Fun..these are hardly up there as the greatest GNR...And the albums have soo many great songs, that just cant fit on this; Estranged, My Michelle, Coma, etc. <br /> <br />If you love the songs on this CD, then you should already own all the GNR CD's and if you dont, get em. <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|this movie really is a great epic movie hoewver like pointed out doesnt fallow what really happend to a tee... but unfortunatly there are so many versions... who is to know... fallowing up on one reviews about the events after Achilles death is VERY gloom and would have broght the masses of people to dissapointment. this kinda movie if you would follow it to the teee many ppl would turn away from it. but for what this movie is... its awesome. what these kind of movies do is fuel young kids to read about what Really happend read uponj stuff maybe they woudlnt have touched other wise.All the actors in this moive did wonderfully and unlike \\"Helen of Troy\\" the Actresss was beautifully casted and acted.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I am a Star Wars Fan & Collector, and for many many years I was waiting for the Star Wars REAL Saga in DVD, because i don't like the new saga (but a I have some hope with EPIII)... I bought this \\"Special\\" Edition and saw it with all of them in a single night. I have to say that I was very upset with the very first film (A New Hope)... the DVD in some times has a bad sound & you can see the frames around the Tie Fighters. In the second one (The Empire Strikes Back) you can see minor changes, but not a good ones. But... In the thrid part (Return of The Jedi) you can see the worst side of the Lucas mind, i think that he hate his own movies or maybe he doesn't have respect for the FANS. He change 2 important things, the first one, in the final celebrations, you can see Naboo, and you can say: \\"well it's ok\\" but, then, you hear a JAR JAR BINKS talking!! One of the most hated character in the history of movies it's now in this poor Star Wars Saga. But, just when you think that everything it's over... you can see one of the most gorgeous and emotive part of the movie... The 3 Jedi Spirits (Anakin, Yoda & Obi-Wan)... but when Anakin appears, you didn't see the OLD Anakin (Sebastian Shaw)... YOU SEE Hayden Christensen!!!... I don't have any complaint with the actor... but!!!... WHYYYY??!!! <br />I want to warn you... if you love this saga, don't buy this poor version. Wait until some day someone made a REAL Special Edition of Star Wars.
B00008S2VF|5.0|When the first single from the album came out (American Life) I was a bit disappointed because it seemed to me that Madonna put far too many genres in one song (melodic chorus, heavy beats, rap...) and the result lacked of honogeneity... <br />Bute then I bought the album because in 20 years the queen of pop has proved to know what she's doing and she always managed to produced excellent pop records. <br />Her recent CDs (Ray of Light and Music) were real gems. <br /> <br />So what about American Life - the album? <br /> <br />I think this is one of her best albums of all time. <br />There are great dance tracks (Die Another Day, Nobody Knows Me, the excellent Mother & Father), there are warm, beautiful acoustic tracks (Intervention, Nothing Fails-with gorgeous gospel choir, Easy Ride-listen to the lyrics, Xstatic Process) pure up-tempo pop songs (Hollywood, Love Profusion) and a rock vibe too(I'm so stupid). <br />The collaboration with french electronica producer Mirwais is one of her most fortunate and in this album they menage to put together great melodies, a complete acustic arrengement contaminated by techno twists. <br />Madonna re-invents her music again and the result, at my ears, is another great pop record.
B000001FKY|5.0|The other 4 are Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet, Aeromsith's Pump, Whitesnake's self titled album, and Cinderella's Night Songs.  Hysteria contains huge mega hits which went on for 3 years.. Rocket, Animal, Love Bites, Armageddon It, Women, Hysteria, and of course the megasmash Pour Some Sugar on Me.  Other non-released hits are Gods of War and Love and Affection.  Name me any artist today who can have 9 huge hits off of one album!!  Might just be why Hysteria sold 16 million copies in the U.S. and over 30 million worldwide! <br /> <br />The bass, vocals, and guitars are all rock anthem standards.  The songs really never seem to blend together and all stand apart which adds to this albums greatness.  The sound quality is very good, but a remastered album would greatly improve this bad boy to bring it to a perfect status.  If you want to know what great 80's rock was about, this and the 4 other albums listed is the base you need to start from.  Enjoy!
B00000K19E|5.0|Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, oh my!!! I just saw this movie today and is dying to see the 2nd!!! I always liked Morpheus the best. I didn't like Neo that well because he didn't seem like 'the one' and I was expecting him to wear the black jacket and those glasses but like half of the movie he was bald! The only thing I didn't like about it was that they were in the real world most of the time! I recomend this movie to any sci-fi fan
B0006A9FKA|3.0|I am not one for horror comedy, being a stereotypical female, and I think the whole idea of zombies is absolutely ridiculous.  I only watched about 45 minutes of this movie, but what I saw was more gore than comedy.  I may have missed the comedy part,  but I personally would not want to see my friends' innerds eaten by a bunch of crazy zombies!  My husband and brothers (being stereotypical males) love this movie and think it's great.  I'm not saying this movie is terrible...just not my taste.  I think it's good because of the fact that it's so different, and it seems that the film makers took a huge risk with making this film since we don't see a lot of them around.  I definitely give them props for that.  Just a tip for other males out there: if you make your girlfriend watch this with you, she will not be impressed and be prepared to be made to watch The Notebook in return. :)
B00000099Y|5.0|It's AEnima, a psychological term coined by Carl Jung in Psyche and Symbol. The AEnima is a condition reffering to the son's subconscious relationship to his mother. So please, do not compare this art to drivel like blink-182.  <br /> <br />D*ckheads.
B00018D44U|5.0|Like everyone else, I loved Norah Jones' first CD and I was excited to see that she had released a second.  I bought it immediately.  I love all her songs.  Her lyrics are very uncomplicated and honest.  Other singers who are trying to switch over to songwriter status try way too hard with their lyrics that they just sound ridiculous.  I know saying she's easy listening isnt' exactly a compliment at times, but this is the perfect CD to put in when you're just lounging around on a Saturday afternoon.  When my husband was at work one Saturday, I had the house to myself and I popped that CD in.  Norah Jones and me laying on the couch with a pint of ice cream made for a perfect Saturday. :) <br />Favorite songs include: Sunrise, What Am I to You?, and Humble Me
B00005ATQH|3.0|You know I have been hearing in most of these post how Humbert Humbert just \\"loved\\" Lolita so much, but not one time have I heard how Lolita felt about Humbert.  Old Humbert was just another (...)to me; Why would he go and get with this woman looking for love(just as desperate as u please) just to get to the daughter? what does that look like to you? And if Kubrick had used a younger Lolita than Sue Lyons(one that was truly around 12 as the book said)I don't think that movie would have been made at that time; That would have been a bit profane and out of order; Then why lie to the child about her mother's death? going about the country acting like a bunch of lovesick controlling cows and having folk looking at you all cockeyed. Then having another man(...)follow you, even to come into your house to \\"advise\\" you on what to do; Uhh Uh;Just another (...)beating you to your own game;
B00009XITP|5.0|I liked this film. I thought the story line was very cute. Colin Firth is a very underestimated actor and I like many of his movies. This movie had quite a few laughs. There is nothing wrong with a young and refreshing Happily Ever After movie. Amanda Bines is great as a teenage girl from NY thrown in a completely different lifestyle and culture all to get to know the father she never knew. My taste in movies is pretty broad. Anyway, I liked it and I am 27, married with children, and not a teenager. My mom who is in her 50's liked it a lot too. SO, as you can see many different ages can be entertained by this movie. I recommend it if you want to see a lighthearted and very cute film.
1586217194|5.0|I was fortunate to get an advanced copy. Wow... you'll find yourself staying up late to finish this one - and when you reach the last page - you simply don't want it to end. Take your time and enjoy. <br />Great work by Gladwell - I can't wait for his next one.
6305692572|5.0|Before I go on to my review I would like to reply to the reviewer who wrote the following statement \\" The best performance is by Tina Majorino, who doesn't for a moment look like the spawn of Ryan and Garcia\\" Of course she does not we learn almost immediately that Michael(Andy Garcia) is not her Biological Father. <br /> <br />That being said here are my thoughts... <br />This Movie captures you from the very beginning, Meg Ryan plays an Alcoholic with a stunning and dead on performance. The scene where Alice ( Meg Ryan) and Michael (Andy Garcia) fight when she suggests she should leave for awhile is so raw and brutal it left me gasping. This Movie is NOT theatrical hype, or movie of the week material, what it is, is a very honest portrayal of a family in crisis and how Alcoholism affects the entire family. Andy Garcia as Michael does an outstanding Job playing the \\"enabler\\" he takes care of Alice (Meg Ryan)whenever she is drunk, handling everything which in turn contributes to her feelings of self doubt and insecurity. The Movie gives you insight into each character their strength and flaws, allowing you to understand the role they each play in the family, from Alice the Alcoholic, to Michael the enabler, Jessie the Mini Adult, behaving as a Mother at times to the baby sister Carrie. <br />Watch this movie more then once it is worth a second viewing!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Watching the opening credits of the movie was the most interesting part... You'll rather watch paint dry, stare at a blank wall, look at your feet, or go crazy than watch this movie! I begged to turn off the movie, but my siter didn't let me...  I ended up expressing my boredom in random yells throughout the movie. You'll want to be rescued within the first 20 minutes! No plot, underdeveloped characters, NO humor whatsoever. My friend and I lost a LOT of respect for MTV after watching this horrible excuse for a film. Like others have said, just because its not Hollywood, doesn't mean you're cultured by liking it. The plot is about a retarted high school kid named Napolean Dynamite, who meets a new mexican student befriends him and helps him run for president &lt;-- this last part, you don't find out until 2/3 into the movie. Don't waste your time!  We saw Anchorman right after this... watch that; the extra hour is worth it, you'll laugh 100 times more than the mere 2 w/ Napolean Dynamite!
B00006JKOL|5.0|Album has a haunting almost spiritual sense to it, with an approach to the musicianship that seems relaxed. The talent is so strong in this work you could almost imagine it was unrehearsed, thou obviously well performed the mistake and retake I loved having been in a band in school.It helped put the performer in my mind in person in front of me. You get the joy of his music expressed in a work that is satisfying to the soul I have turned many people toward this album the commercial world wont quite understand this work But give it a try I liked the medley which is unique. I can see him in my mind as a  Bakerstreet muse, this album is a close your eyes and picture the story as the minstrel sings.
B0001I562I|5.0|One of the Best movies of my childhood. along with movies like (Goonies, NeverEnding Story, Labyrinth, Short-Circut, Invisible Kid, E.T.) and etc. This movie has amazing memorable moments that you will always remember. And no other movie has a genuine story like it. Let me say this, even if you are an Adult, This movie will still catch your interest. I watch it still and i am 21 now.
B00005JN0T|5.0|When I first saw the previews for I,Robot, I figured it would be another bad Will Smith movie like Independence Day. Come to find out, this movie is great. It is well written, the plot has many twists and turns, and it is action-packed with great special effects.<br /><br />In this movie, which takes place in Chicago in the year 2035, robots have been created to improve the daily lives of humans; they deliver mail, pick-up garbage, and become man's best friend as long as they follow the 3 robot laws of safety: 1) A robot may not injure a human being, 2) A robot must obey the orders given to him, and 3) A robot must protect it's own existence. Every human trusts the robot except for detective Del Spooner(Will Smith). After a scientist named Dr. Lanning(James Cromwell) has supposedly committed suicide, Detective Spooner investigates his murder to prove that he was indeed killed by a robot. He believes that a robot named Sonny killed Dr. Lanning. Sonny is a unique robot who doesn't follow the 3 laws of safety and is a danger to society. But Sonny was indeed created for a purpose and will soon find out what that purpose is.<br /><br />Again great movie. Though, the DVD does lack in special features, it's definitely worth getting.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you have ears and a pulse, it should be mandatory to buy this album. With the aggression and anger of Undertow, but with the melodic and synthesizers of Lateralus, this album is the perfect blend. Justin Chancellor, tool's new bassist, shows prodigious bass riffs those songs like Forty Six & 2 and Stinkfist. Danny Carey is hands down one of the greatest drummers of all time. His opulent perplexing style is continuously changing through the songs. Adam Jones really shines in this album. All his performances are laudable on Aenima. NOW.... MAYNARD... ahhh... dear jesus... definitely the zenith of the album. His vocals are divine. His versatile voice makes him able to perforate you with a god-like scream such as on Eulogy or H, and then come right back at you with a celestial and emotionally disturbing calmness that breaks you down such as on Jimmy. All Maynard's lyrics are so stratified that you can perceive however you want to take them. Lyrics, Music, Artwork... whatever you want. This is the best album of all time, and any album with a name such as \\"Aenima\\" (meaning a douche for your soul, coming from the words enema and anima) is a must-have for anyone who listens to beautiful music.  <br />\\"Shut up and buy my new record. Send more money. F*ck you buddy.\\" - Maynard, Hooker with a Penis.
B000059Z8J|4.0|You will believe a man can fly <br /> <br />Son of Kal-el, Jor-el is sent to earth by his father mere moments before his home planet of Krypton is destryoed. It takes a year for the boy to travel to the earth crashing in a field to be discovered buy the Kents who raise him as their own. Though he is no ordinary boy, he has super-human strenghts and grows up to be Superman! He fights for truth, justice and the American way! <br /> <br />It sounds a bit hokey but after all it is Superman. Now finally we have the box-office smash, Academy Award winner and a beloved fan favorite for more than a generation, Superman: The Movie now soars even higher in a state-of-the-art digital transfer from restored elements and with dynamically remixed digital audio. There's more: the epic adventure now includes eight minutes integrated into the film by director Richard Donner. Among the highlights: added footage of the Krypton Council, a glimpse of veterans from previous Superman incarnations, a meeting with Jor-El that underscores the Man of Steel's purpose on Earth and an extended sequence inside Lex Luthor's gauntlet of doom. <br /> <br />Having mentioned some specifics and disc propaganda, let me say this is a great movie. While this took well over a year to shoot, (they shot this and Superman 2 simultaneously) and plagued by an ever burgening budget and producer - director infighting, this film nevertheless was a breakthrough in special effects technology. The tag line of the film was, \\"You will believe that a man can fly.\\" And you did. They made it appear as though Christopher Reeve was flying through the air. You cannot read history backwards and say it looks fake, because maybe by todays CGI world it may look a bit hokey, but in 1978 it was a marvel, and in my opinion, it still is. <br /> <br />Unknown actor at the time Christopher Reeve gives us a powerful and believable performance in the dual Kent/Superman role. Hackman gives a brilliant comedic performance as Lex Luthor,and Margot Kidder rounds out an excellent cast. (On principal I am not mentioning the actor who plays Superman's father, you probably know that already). <br /> <br />The only contention I had with this disc was the fact that some scenes were added that were not in the theatrical cut. They were edited in and while the chapter list lets us know I feel there should have at least had a branching option to watch them within the movie or alone. Aside from that this is a stellar disc.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|If you are expecting the same quality as the first GITS then stay away from this DVD.  The move itself is incredible, but unfortunately this DVD is horrible.  No english audio track and to top it all off no english subtitles, instead they give you close captioning.  The whole movie is (*rain falling*.. and *gun shot*.., etc.).  Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one, try to find a Japanese version..
B00062IDCO|5.0|If yo are reading those reviews you most likely watched and did not missed the other ones. Maybe its not really the best one but this one ends the story so do not think simply get it, you will not regret.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie, \\"Elf\\", is already a Christmas Classic. <br />  This is the perfect \\"feel good\\" Holiday special to enjoy with your family, during Christmas, AND anytime of year! <br />  Will Ferrell is hilarious as \\"Buddy\\", a human Christmas Elf. <br /> This movie has alot in common with the classic Christmas Special, \\"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\\". <br /> \\"Buddy\\", like \\"Rudolph\\", is considered a \\"Misfit\\" and doesnt know where he fits in, and like \\"Rudolph\\", \\"Buddy\\" ends up saving the day and saving Christmas too! <br /> Also, \\"Leon\\" The Snowman, will remind you of the famous \\"Sam\\" The Snowman character from \\"Rudolph\\". <br /> And the beautiful backgrounds in some scenes appear to have been inspired by the \\"Rudolph\\" special too. <br />  With the wonderful acting of Mary Steenburgen and James Caan, combined with a great Santa Claus portrayed by Ed Asner, and a Elf-like Bob Newhart, this movie is a real Christmas treat! <br /> The woman in this film, who plays \\"Jovie\\", Zooey Deschanel, plays the role of the cute woman who steals \\"Buddy's\\" Heart. <br /> And \\"Buddy\\" will steal YOUR heart and fill it with Christmas Spirit in this truly Magical, funny, very watchable movie. <br /> When I have been depressed, I watch this movie and it makes me feel better. <br /> And how many movies can do that? <br /> \\"Elf' is in my view one of the best Christmas Classics of all time. <br /> It has the Christmas Spirit, and you cant help but also get into the Christmas mood when watching this movie. <br /> Watch it in December, watch it in June. <br /> Watch it whenever you want to smile, and whenever you want to feel the Christmas Spirit! <br />
0553274503|4.0|Hello my nam is charly gordon I live at the Beekman college for sl-l-l-l-l-l-l-low adults. I talked with prof neemur today and I sed prof nemur I want to writ a book revew and prof nemur sed dont be absurd charly you cant writ a book revuew your eye Q is far too low for a task which requirs a much higher menta** than yors. In fact yew can hardly spel yoor own nam so why bother at all I was so sad but I just sed okay prof nemur. I wish prof nemur would stop being such a grouch. then Prof Neemur sed charly if you reely think yew can writ a revew i strongly advise yew to wryte lik yew tak but whatever yew do dont sey progris report at the top of eech payge cause that could yeeld catustrofic risults   Anyway, I deecided to writ a book revue, evn thew its hard to writ a book revue when yur eye Q is so low like mine.   Flowers for Algernon, by daniel keys is a real good book about a ment**** ratarded adult with a sixty eight Eye-Q who has a brain operashun which makes him smirt. After he gets smart, and can spel corektly, he comes to the terrible realization that the world is a dreary, cruel place, especially for people with I.Q's above the norm, and that his so called,\\"friends\\", have, quite contrary to what he childishly believed prior to the surgery, been making a mockery of him his entire life.    At the beginning of \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", Daniel Keyes absorbing, pathos evoking tale, Charlie is so feeble minded that he can't even beat the lab mouse Algernon (who has unergone the same operation intended for later use on Charlie) at a simple \\"amaze\\".    However, Charlie's \\"motivashun\\" is so powerful that he is ultimately selected as the ideal participant in the monumental operation which could wuite possibly enhance his intelligence to three times what it was.    After the operation, Charlie's intelligence quickly increases, and! shortly: after, he learns! proper, punktuation and spelling? from the dictionary! which? he! is, confused, by, at first. he falls deeply in love with Alice Kinnian, his former teacher.    Charlie quickly realizes that superior intelligence is scarcely as ideal as he had imagined. Furthermore, he is forced to contend with a seemingly endless list of difficulties, particularly the fact that he has surpassed Professor Nemur in intelligence and that his envious \\"friends\\" at the bakery have come to resent the fact that they can no longer abuse him. Charlie is also forced to confront the inevitable reality that his intellect is gradually declining, and that he will soon be as foolish as he was prior to the operation.    All the while Charlie maintains a fragile balancing act as he struggles to prevent his lovely tenant fay and his former teacher Alice Kinnian from discovering they are in love with the same man.    Charlie basks in his intelligence, but, before he knows it he is dum agin. Well, flowers for algernon is a reel good book and evrybody shud reed it- well I admit i didnt aktually reed it but i tryed reeding an exert on Amason dot com which all my friends like. Pleese tell prof.nemur to stop being such a grouch and if yew get the chanse pleese put some flowers in Algernon's grave in the bak yard.
1400032717|5.0|This book is almost totally about how it is written. And that is in the first person from the perspective of a fifteen year old with Asperger's Syndrome which, from what I gather from the book, is a kind of Autism or at least similar. Yes, there is a plot which moves things along but the book is about the prose which details the hero's life and thought processes. It is so different but clear and sharp and absolutely charming. From the word Go I couldn't put it down. I picked it up at six o'clock and finished it at one in the morning. I was reminded a little of the first Adrian Mole diary which when I read it also had a plot but succeeded mainly due to its prose. <br />   Mark Haddon's brilliant book starts with the discovery of a dead dog with a garden fork sticking through it and with him deciding to do a murder investigation. I will say no more of the plot. Sometimes the book is very sad and a few times its laugh- out- loud funny as the hero has his daily struggle with the world and the people in it. I think that this is a modern classic and I like to think that in a hundred years from now it'll still be in the shops.  <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Having now seen \\"Wicked\\" twice, once with the original cast, and once with replacements for Glinda and Fiyero I feel I can now write a proper review. I also have plans for seeing the show at least two more times. The first time I saw \\"Wicked\\" I was absolutely blown away. This is truly what Broadway is all about, \\"Wicked\\" is the first really great power-musical since \\"Aida\\" The best thing about \\"Wicked\\" is Elphaba star Idina Menzel. She is truly a revelation. When you see her onstage, it is almost a euphoric experience, this show will make her a household name for the houses who know Broadway. I urge people to purchase this cd, because it is one of the better cast recordings out there to truly capture the mood of the show. I love every song, and this disc hasn't left my player since I first saw the show back in July. This is one of the best shows to his Broadway in a really long time! I also recommend \\"Avenue Q\\" and \\"Hairspray\\"
B0002OERI0|1.0|Now first off think about this. You are buying an album that is full of pop songs with a punk look. American Idiot is not a very good song and its being pushed on the public like mad. Its on the Madden Video game and MTV! AHHH! Do yourself a favor and stay away from Green Day and try actual punk albums from real punk bands. Try listening to some punk/ska bands like NOFX, Reel Big Fish, Operation Ivy, or Rancid. Those are very good bands and there are alot more.
1592400876|2.0|i borrowed this book and read the first few chapters. it was really boring. some bits were funny i guess but overall is was blah. i would not reccomend reading it.
0812550706|5.0|This is a great book that reads very easily, and I'd recommend it to anyone 10yrs old and up.  The main character, Ender, is an exceptionally gifted child who has been burdened with the responsibility of ensuring mankind's survival.  He is often lonely because of his exceptional mind among his peers.  If you feel you are talented in some manner and sometimes cannot easily relate to others or vice versa, then I'd recommend reading this book to inspire persistence and mental fortitude in your journey through life.
B000002KHF|5.0|What an eye opener this album was for a kid growing up with pop infected older siblings. Van's a seeker, and this collection contains a wide range of emotional themes and musical styles. The result manages to be both introspective and carefree. It is strong throughout, and is essentially a Van \\"sampler\\". There are other more singularly thematic (mystic, lover, bard, etc.) Van offerings, but Moondance came before most of his music business wars, and the youthful optimism is infectious. Extra credit for using \\"fantabulous\\" in a sentence.
0767805712|5.0|Then there's a good chance, you'll really like this movie.  Vincent is a God-child (not genetically enhanced), in a time when many parents choose to give their offspring as many possible advantages in life.  Fortunately for Vincent \\"there is no gene for the human spirit\\".  I'm sure you get where this is going by now.   <br /> <br />Well acted, great soundtrack that fits perfectly with the movie, and great story.  Want to be inspired, watch this movie.
B0002X314C|5.0|All i gat to say is havent even bought the album yet. by just listening to the samples from amazon makes me want go cap it right away. he is really a legend!!!
0671015206|4.0|This book does an excellent job of describing what needs to be done in order to be successful.  There are many misconceptions about the rich and it's great that there's finally a book that gets rid of all these misconceptions.
B00005QZWI|5.0|In what I consider the best of the trilogy, Shore incorperates an all around feel of what the trilogy is about.   This ranges from a playfully Irish piece (\\"Concerning Hobbits\\"), to a more dark and suspenceful \\"The Shadow of the Past\\", to the mystical elvish pieces, and finishing with the battle at Amon Hen.  Although the other two movie scores contain various pieces that are memorable in their own right, this first installment sets the pace emotionally and plot wise in that it goes from the happy carefree lives of Hobbits to what is considered dark times ahead for Middle Earth.  Not a single piece on this CD is wasted in setting up the plot.  Highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|1. Me Against the Music -Britney creates a new genre here which i heard is refered to as \\"edgy pop.\\" Whatever you call it though, its a sexy, club beat dance song that her and Madonna did a wonderful job of singing and co-writing together on.   <br /> <br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom -This song features the Ying Yang twins who spice up the song with some rap/hiphop. It's a fun, club song. Something different for her fans. Britney is forever reinventing herself.           <br /> <br />3. Showdown -Britney reinventing herself into a mature adult reflects even more on track 3. A sexy song, about teasing someone back and forth. Her vocals sound very lush and whispery. <br /> <br />4. Breathe On Me -One of the best tunes on the cd. Something else you can definetly see yourself dancing to in clubs. Its about a relationship so hot, they dont even need to touch just breathe.  <br /> <br />5. Early Mornin' -A song about the morning after a fun night of partying. There is also some rap added here in the chorus making this an awesome dance song. <br />  <br />6. Toxic -How can you not like this single? There is a rare violin thing going on in the song, with a catchy beat, about an toxic love you can't get enough of. One of Britney's best.   <br /> <br />7. Outrageous -A little laugh at the media here. Telling them \\"if you dont like it well then...La la la la\\" A great dance song that R-Kelly wrote for her with some funky dance beats in it. <br /> <br />8. Touch of My Hand  - a song about \\"self love,\\" shocking, but done tastefully which again, reflects Britney's maturity as a person. The ballad is also softer. <br />  <br />9. The Hook Up -a song about simply feeling confident, and having a great time, \\"hooking up,\\" on the dance floor. The beat is sensational. A really good track here... <br />    <br />10. Shadow -Britney now switches to a softer ballad. A metaphor of someone who never reveals their true self, only their shadow. Her vocals and songwriting here are simply outstanding. If it was relased, it would have been a huge hit.   <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl -a very poppy song i liked right away. A song about finding yourself, feeling confident and sexy, and knowing what you want in life. <br />   <br />12. Everytime -A beautiful ballad where she really shows off her vocals, with a music box beat to it. It's such a sad song, but its also very beautiful. My favorite song on here.  <br /> <br />13. Me Against the Music Remix -a fantasitc remix! I almost like it better then the first. Rarely do remixes sound this good. I'm glad Britney decided to put this on here. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is Britney's best cd yet. She experiments with many different types of music on here: dance pop, hiphop/rap, and even some bits of techno, r&b, and country you can catch in here. She also trys out her vocals in many different forms, and her voice just becomes more and more talented. However, this is a much more mature cd, more for adults then little kids i would say. Britney has grown up so it is to be expected, but i highly reccommed picking up this cd today. Its a great dance, feel good cd, and really does get you in the zone, making you feel energetic, and good about yourself.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|My only take on this is.. people who don't like it, don't understand it. It takes a great creative mind to bring certain notions to life. And Kauffman and Gondry combined, makes this movie absolutely stunning.
B00006CXXU|5.0|i love christina aguilera. she is extremely talented and like nina sky the music turns me on. i especially love the video for cant hold us down. buy it.
B00006879E|1.0|Maroon 5 are \\"possibly the worst band currently recording music\\" as Ed the Sock put it and I find Hilary Duff more entaining. The singles are like bad, but the rest of the album is worse. So buy if you like really bad music; I know many of you do, or they wouldn't be popular.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Brad Pitt! Eric Bana! Even Orlando Bloom for that wonderful acting on that worthless weakling called Paris! <br /> <br />I loved it loved it loved it! And I will pause to mention here that compared to Troy, the movie \\"Alexander\\" could be broken into little  bits, put into a chest, and dropped into the deepest part of the ocean, never to be suffered through again. Ugh! Someone would have to pay me serious $$ to watch Alexander again. <br /> <br />I was never impressed with Brad Pitt before. I went to see this movie for Orlando Bloom, and got a bittersweet surprise. I thought Pitt was amazing (even though Achilles can make ya mad at times) and Bloom pulled off his part of being someone I wanted to just kick in the head for being so stupid. Eric Bana was the perfect big brother to Paris, and I adored him completely.  <br /> <br />Never did I get bored watching this, and I am definitely not a history buff. The men are hot and sword-slashing, making this movie tough enough for men and hey...a little eye-candy goes to the ladies for once! <br />

B000002UB6|5.0|This is the final album the Beatles put out, although the bulk of it was recorded before it's predecessor \\"Abbey Road\\" was in stores, with titles such as \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" it's the definitive swan song from the greatest band of all-time.    While their original intention of \\"back to basics\\" in this album, was more evident in Abbey Road, that's not to say it failed completly. Songs like \\"Two of us\\" and \\"One after 909\\" sound much like their earlier work.    Infact \\"One after 909\\" was written in the early 1960s put not put on an album until this one (it's a live performance from the famous Roof-top concert in London, that also included \\"Get Back\\").    \\"Two of us\\", a country song, was written by McCartney about his wife, Linda, after they went on a drive together, but the lyrics also fit in well with his relationship with Lennon, which is probably why people have wrongly assumed, even to this day, that he wrote it about his fellow Beatle.    \\"Across The Universe\\" is regarded by several to be the album's greatest moment and is the final psyedelic / flower power song the Beatles recorded (and the only one on this album) but I personally think the title cut \\"Let It Be\\" is the albums peak, regarded by many as The Beatles greatest single, this album version is even better, with a wonderful guitar solo by Harrison.    Three hit singles are included here \\"Get Back\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Let It be\\" (although both \\"get back and \\"let it be\\" are slightly different versions to the ones that were singles). All 3 hit #1 in the Billboard sales charts, as did the album.    Philip Spector, one of music's most successful producers, was brought in to re-mix most of the recordings on this set, much to the disapproval of Paul McCartney and the groups regular producer, George Martin (who had produced the origanal tapes).    One or two people have knocked this album and referred to it as The Beatles worst, however, with such strong songs such as \\"let it be\\", \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"One After 909\\" this just isn't the case.    This album proves that, while the band was falling apart, while the four men in the band grew further and further apart musically and personally, that as a group The Beatles remained the greatest.    \\"Let it be\\" is, quite simply, one of The Beatles finest collection of songs.
1400032717|4.0|This is a novel written from the perspective of a mentally challenged fifteen year old. I think that Mark Haddon does a wonderful job in creating a wonderfully believable, challenged, yet intelligent and loveable character. He brings out empathy and understanding for the mind and persona of this young boy. The plot is entertaining and thought provoking, and even though it was simple, I found it satisfying. I recommend this book to those that enjoy a good and unique story. It is not a thriller, but it will captivate you.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Outstanding film thats with great preformances and battle sequences. We have been hit with great films including great battles over the last several years. LOTR put the bar up so high for fims of this type. <br />Troy doesn't disappoint at all. Brad Pitt works well in the title role. The true star to me is Eric Bana he truly shines in his role. I thought the film took a slight hit after Bana's character died (sorry for the spoiler). Sorry not a fan of Mr. Bloom but he plays the weakling brother very well. <br /> <br />The movie is beautifuly shot and the action is very fierce. <br />Highly recomended to anyone that likes movies in the same thread. <br /> <br />
B000001EGA|5.0|Elton has always amazed me. This is his crowning glory! <br /> <br />INTERESTING TRIVIA! this is the first album ever to debut at number one on the billboard album charts. (back in 1975) <br /> <br />This is not only one of the best albums but one of the best CONCEPT albums. I agree with previous reviewers in the fact that the 3 \\"bonus\\" tracks don't belong. Lucy and Philadelphia were great songs. One day at a time was a b-side. and they aren't available on any other album. They did get recorded around the time of the album. They may be good songs but they just don't belong with this album. I would still buy it, but treat it as an encore to the story. In this case these are Bonuses of a different kind. <br /> <br />The whole album tracks the career of Elton & Bernie. Captain Fantastic is their beginnings. Bitter Fingers deals with the frustrations of trying to make it. \\"Im playing all the pubs, and i really need a song boys, to stir those workers up\\" Gotta get a meal ticket deals with getting desperate. basically could be titled \\"We need a hit so we can eat supper\\". Better off dead has him thinking he should just give up, while Writing has him saying \\"Will the things we wrote today, sound as good tomorrow\\". <br /> <br />Not many know this but We all fall in love sometimes is about Eltons secret lust after Bernie Taupin. It also mentions the Empty Sky album: \\"But our Empty sky was filled with laughter\\" <br /> <br />Curtains is a fitting close to the album although i have no clue what the ending lyrics are, they are just not very understandable. <br /> <br />The band is Davey johnstone on Guitar, Dee Murray on Bass & Nigel Olsson on Drums. This was a GREAT lineup which was broken the day before the release of the album when he fired Dee & Nigel. QUITE A DUMB MOVE. The 3 (davey, dee & nigel) had a GREAT chemistry together musically and vocally. Nigel's drum fills were always high points of the songs. Why he fired them is something i still would like to know. Fittingly,Elton had few hits for the rest of the 70's and for alot of the 80's wasn't too hitworthy. His sound had changed because of this and i firmly believe that this was the cause. He just does not sound the same without Dee and Nigel.  <br /> <br />This is one of his 3 best albums along with: Caribou & Goodbye Yellow brick Road <br /> <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I met these guys when they were first starting out......I used to watch them jam out in local bars when they one day struck up a conversation with me.......we ended up drinking heavily that night.....I was doing a whimsical fairy dance on tables chanting Franz is the bestest of them all!!!!The band loved it and started to join in......eventually we went to IHOP and ordered some pancackes and milk,the bands favorite food!!!!!what fun we all had that night.The new album rocks and these guys are the nicest bunch ever!My little sweeties!Just kiddin Franz!You know daddy loves ya!I have a rumbly in my tumbly!Time to eat some food!LALALALALA!
B000001DQI|5.0|This is one of his 3 best.  <br /> <br />Song by song rundown: <br /> <br />Funeral for a friend/Love lies bleeding: The first 6-7 minutes is instrumental, which gives way for a rocking vocal in love lies bleeding. One of the best album tracks Elton ever did. <br /> <br />Candle in the wind: My favorite part is the backing \\"ah\\" vocals. Dee, Davey & nigel had the perfect blend of voices for harmonizing. <br /> <br />Bennie & The Jets: I used to like this song but get sick of hearing it because it is so overplayed.  <br />SIDE NOTE: I always thought the lyrics were \\"Shes got electric boobs, her ma has too\\". Always makes me smile to think of my dumb youthful interpretations of lyrics. <br /> <br />Goodbye Yellow Brick road: SUCH a good song. The backing vocals STILL send a shiver down my spine. <br /> <br />This song has no title: Just a 2 minute dumb filler IMHO. <br /> <br />Grey Seal: Hard rocking, great vocals, HUGELY GREAT DRUM FILLS. awesome solo to end. one of his other best album cuts. <br /> <br />Jamaica Jerk off: How he can go from an awesome cut to one like this is beyond me. He even uses the term \\"jah\\" in his vocals. I really loathe this song. But there is enough great tracks on this album to make up for it. <br /> <br />I've seen that movie too: He always does such great dramatic songs. This is one of them. <br /> <br />Sweet Painted Lady: About hookers to put it bluntly. \\"Seems its always been the same, Getting paid, for being laid\\" I love this song. This was the start of side 3 on the double record set and the best side of the album (along with the next 3 cuts) i wore out this side on my record set TWICE! <br /> <br />The Ballad Of Danny Bailey: Great song even better for the last chorus, the lovely backing vocals and the orchestral ending. <br /> <br />Dirty Little Girl: Reminds me of my ex-wife. Listen to the song, thats all you need to do to figure out what my problem was with her. <br /> <br />All the girls love alice: (definately completing a sideof 4 songs about criminals). First about hookers, then an outlaw, then a homeless tramp and now a young girl who \\"pleases\\" married women\\") Fantastic rocking song! <br /> <br />Side 4 was the bad side though, You're sister can't twist was an OK start and Harmony was a good ending. Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting was good too but Roy Rogers and Social Disease are the worst next to Jamaica Jerk Off. <br /> <br />However, jamaica is a jamaican song and roy rogers is country-tinged. Some of you listeners may like those songs. to each his own. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM you will NOT be disappointed!!!!!!!
B0002858YS|5.0|I met these guys a while back when i was in my band the hot fuss......they liked our name and after we broke up i let them use it 4 their album name......i got sum cash out of it too!anyways we used to partay all night long listening to motley crue and kiss and dio just dancing around singing silly songs.the new record is fantastic.....exellent vocals and production plus the band always rocks my world!They just started working on some new material and one of the working titles is crispycreme , thats  my nickname!the guys think their so funny!so look out for crispycreme in the near future!Hats off to all the fans!you have impeccable taste!
B000001DQG|4.0|I wasn't going to review this until i read the other UNFAIR reviews. <br /> <br />This was in between Goodbye Yellow Brick Road & Captain Fantastic. While they are better albums. (this one was kinda hurried, even Elton admits it) It isnt THAT bad. <br /> <br />Song by song synopsis: <br /> <br />Bitch is back: Great rocker, one of his biggest hits. No explination needed. <br /> <br />Pinky: Good ballad, kinda syrupy, but i love the lyric \\"Now she rolls like the dice, in a poor gamblers hands\\".  <br /> <br />Grimsby: Good rocker, shaky with the lyrics but one you can't help but sing and tap along with. <br /> <br />Dixie Lily: I dont know where the other reviewer gets it is a fishing song. It is about a boat called the Dixie Lily. Country tinged song but still a good one. I like songs when Elton sounds like he is into it. Going into the last chorus his \\"Whoa\\" is evident that he is into it. <br /> <br />Solar Prestige A Gammon: I don't know if he is using gibberish or actually speaking another language, but this can be fun to sing out loud to be annoying. Kinda dumb otherwise. <br /> <br />You're So Static: This song smokes. Horns from Tower of Power are guesting on this song. Good beat too! <br /> <br />I've Seen The Saucers: The song i think Cartman should have sang way back when he was abducted on South Park. Not very intelligent sounding song otherwise. <br /> <br />Stinker: Seems like a bad concept but musically this song gets saved with the funky horns and the great instrumental passages! <br /> <br />Don't let the sun go down on me: One of his other huge hits, no explination needed. <br /> <br />Ticking: Introduced in concerts after Columbine happened as \\"more relevant today than when it was written in 1974\\" This song is one of his better written pieces. If you are into the storytelling songs like jim croce used to do, this is for you! <br /> <br />Much better than albums like honky chateau, dont shoot me im only the piano player, and tumbleweed connection. Only Yellow brick road and captain fantastic are better. <br /> <br />
