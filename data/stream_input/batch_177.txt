B0006B3USM|1|The concept of Terry Cloth was most appealing because I thought it would be highly washable.  I washed under normal settings in bleach and the edges began to fray and elastic started to come out.  This is a poor product.
B004FH2YCG|5|One of my favorite purchases for my daughter. Well worth the money. Good quality and plenty of space. I love the long strap so it doesn't feel like I'm carrying a purse.
B001N44UVC|3|We use this to monitor our 4 year old Epileptic son as he seizes in his sleep. For what we need it to do, it works. The picture is fine howver my biggest complaint is the interference. No matter which setting I use it buzzes every 20 seconds. Fortuantely we have another monitor that's just for sound. We hooked that up and turned the volume down on the Summer and that seems to help. We have it on a shelf above his bed and when I move the camera, you can see most of his room, which is helpful for me when he and his brother play in his room and I am downstairs (yes, I am neurotic, but if he's out of my sight he could be having a seizure alone and that thought is just too scary for me). I chose this model over others due to the price and the larger screen. As I said, it works fine for now.
B00IRE2720|5|It works! And that's all I needed :)
B002M77N22|5|If I had to choose my favorite newborn item, it would be this rock n'play. No doubt about it!  It was used FULL TIME for the first 2 months. My daughter also slept in it at night until she was 8 weeks - and she slept really well. I read some comments on giving a baby a flat head, but for us it was never the case. Also, we did not have much problem transitioning her to the crib (maybe one or two nights of fussiness), but again, we did it when she was 8 weeks old and not 8 months! It's very light to carry around the house, easy to wash and easy to store. It's a real must have.
B00A8VV44C|3|its not as easy to use as it may seem. the plastic cones kinds hurt my breasts and its a lot of equipment. the bottles that it came with however are nice.
B00ABIFGW8|5|We bought these for our 3 year old daughter who is very small for her age. She loves that she can easily reach the light switches now. The glow-in-the-dark feature is an added bonus.
B009NMO5CK|5|We bought this to replace our Sunshine Kids model after an accident.  I love this seat.  It's narrow and fits great in our compact car without spilling over into the adjoining seats.  I'm not sure yet about the newly added booster seat capabilities.  The red hooks at the top seem pretty high up.  We're still using the 5 pt harness for my 4 year old.  It'll be a very long time before he's tall enough for the booster on this seat.
B004OR1DNI|5|My 13 month old LOVES this toy in the bathtub. She loves to pull the bugs in and out of the mesh net.
B008EXC73I|4|This product is great, easy to use, comfortable and safe for the baby, I little hot for summer time, very usefull, Regards from chile!
B000ME3146|3|I have been using a friend's Madela Freestyle for the past 4 months.  I had a problem with mold in the tubing which didn't resolve when following instructions to avoid this.  After buying a 5th set of tubes, I purchased my own Ameda.  I do not like the Ameda nearly as much as the Madela, but I believe most of my issues have to do with being used to the other product.<br />Ameda pros:<br />1) Don't have to worry about mold in the tubing.<br />2) Efficient- I get the same or more milk in the same amount of time<br />3) A little more comfortable than the Madela<br />4) Madela bottles attach on the ameda pump so I can use what I have already<br /><br />Ameda cons:<br />1) The noise is annoying.  It can be blocked out, but be prepared for people to ask you \\"What's that noise?\\" if you talk on the phone while pumping.<br />2) It is very inconvenient- the case is just a bag.  You have to take everything out of the bag and get set up. With the madela you can just set it down and plug it in because the pump is part of the bag.  For the ameda, you have to have a table or large surface to pump- pumping in the car is no longer convenient.<br />3) Because the flange and the lid is one piece, it is difficult to get into a hands-free bra<br />4) Because the flange and the lid is one piece, it takes up a lot of space in the dishwasher<br />5) The flange is shorter, so it is difficult to see if the milk is shooting out or dribbling out and adjust the suction accordingly.<br /><br />Based on the price, I would recommend the Ameda because it does a good job and mold is not a concern.  But if you need to do a lot of pumping on the go, I think the Madela is much easier to use and worth the extra cost.
B00CCKC108|5|Perfect size for 2 year old, we take it when traveling for her to sleep in.
B00JYJI1IG|4|Took a while to get, but it's great.
B002JP7USY|5|We have used this backpack lightly (but everyday) for almost a year, and it still looks new! Good quality!
B004VL2VRY|5|Since we moved my son upstairs to make room for our new baby, I have been wanting a video monitor to keep an eye on him without having to climb stairs constantly. I read a ton of reviews for other monitors and they were just too iffy. Once I saw that Motorola was making a video baby monitor, I was hopeful of a good product. I could not be happier with this monitor!<br /><br />The hand held receiver is very user friendly and easy to set up. The camera and receiver came already linked, but I did buy a second camera for the baby's room and it was very simple to link the extra camera. You can see what the temperature of the room is, which is awesome because our son's room doesn't always have the best air circulation. The sound clarity on this monitor is crystal clear, which is amazing considering the sound on our old digital monitor was just awful. I was expecting the same, but the sound is so clear I can put the volume on the lowest volume setting and hear just fine.<br /><br />The cameras can be placed on a shelf or hung on the wall. You have to place the camera far away from the crib or bed if you want a larger viewing area, but we have it focused just on our son's bed. You can zoom in using the receiver to a good close up if you need to. The night vision is very clear, and the closer you have it to the subject the better it is. If you place the camera across the room, it's not going to be as clear obviously.<br /><br />I thought I'd like the intercom feature, but when I talk to my son through the monitor it kind of freaks him out...LOL. Maybe when he gets older and understands it will be more helpful. I do think it's a great feature though. When me or my husband is up there with our son, we can communicate without having to go up or downstairs. We don't use the lullaby feature because my son already has music in his room.<br /><br />Overall I think this video monitor is amazing. Amazing picture quality, amazing sound and amazing features.
B000I5Q19Q|5|I was not able to use swing due to unforseen events but it is gorgeous, one problem...Swing arrived open,and damaged Amazon responded and made good on purchase.Thanks Amazon...Thats why I spend so much money here!!!:)
B000F1O8T8|2|We have this one and while it is very portable and convenient, it slides around and doesn't fit more toilets well, particularly oval shaped ones. Unfortunately it has fallen into the toilet more times than I would ever like.  It just adds to the stress of the going to a public bathroom with two already skiddish toddlers and a freaked out momma.  Looking for a better solution now.
B004V8VQC8|5|My LO loves this!! She loves the piano and the sounds it makes. Definitely worth buying. :) plus gives mothers much needed break. Even for a few minutes.
B00BEVF2TI|5|We have two and love them. The cup holders are great, and I love the weight limit for 5-point harness. Very easy to install.
B005PWVIZE|5|These work great, AND no drilling holes! Just watch out for pinched fingers sometimes, they'll most likely learn on their own though.
B0078PQCPW|5|the bottles are beautiful and the price better than babies r us...  this will match the rest of my  packs
B00CCA025O|1|I purchased the Summer Infant Baby Touch (non boost version) a couple years ago and loved it, however I thought I'd be purchasing an upgrade with this \\"Boost\\" version.<br /><br />Here are the key factors to consider for this video monitor vs. the original model:<br />1. The range on it is pathetic in comparison to the original model. We can only get about 30-50 ft. vs 100+ ft. with the original.<br />2. There is a major delay when hitting the \\"video\\" button. Usually around 2-4 seconds before video will transmit vs. instant. Sometimes, it won't turn on and you have to power cycle the unit. This happens about 2-3 times a week.<br />3. The battery life is half the original model. We get about 3-5 hours and cannot make it through the night. To compensate for this we end up having to leave the unit in its charging cradle overnight which is unhealthy for the battery. The good thing is this unit will provide audible feedback when the battery is about to run out where as the original does not. I thought I would just purchase another battery as a spare but it's hard to find and rather costly.<br />4. The \\"boost\\" or \\"HD\\" is noticeable better but ONLY when in daylight and only when NOT zoomed in. So we really only get to take advantage of the better quality during nap time rather than sleep time. This unit provides 3 zoom levels vs. 2.<br />5. This model does not come with a portable battery compartment for the camera like the original does. This doesn't matter to us personally but some may want to consider that factor.<br />6. The touch controls are not as sensitive, making it very difficult to go through menu options such as changing cameras (we use multiple cameras).<br />7. The feel of the unit is much cheaper (lighter hollow plastic feel) vs. heavy duty.<br />8. The reported room temperature is way off, anywhere from 6-8 degrees. I've confirmed this several times with two heat guns. Once you learn that you can compensate for it but its just another annoyance.<br /><br />Ithought our unit was bad so I exchanged it for another with the same results. All in all, we wish we never gave up our old unit and want it back! Newer really isn't always better.
B0007CS4EU|4|fantastic product. easy to freeze a lot of milk put it it freezer bags and unthaw just enough for the occasion. the tops warped a little in the dishwasher, but they do say they are not dishwasher safe. I am lazy. I will give them as gifts in the future
B00DNQS6PO|5|My friend loved it! Very easy to put on, easy to wash but quite expensive so I'll buy mine later.
B00FRSSP20|5|biennnn
B001579YRM|1|no edge. I'd never cut my baby's finger until I tried to use these clippers...
B00NG1ZIZW|5|These are exactly what I need -love the style
B00PRMMHRK|5|Nice thick quality, reversible for easy matching interior color, reinforced straps.
B004O389D4|5|Huge fan of this product. Simple to install and works well. My two year old has not yet figured out how to overcome the power of the oven lock. He's also more apt to leave the oven alone because it doesn't yield to his pull anymore, and I'm good with that.
B0032B0FI6|4|I bought this bouncy seat instead of some others I had seen because it had the automatic bouncer. Unfortunately, it doesn't really bounce hard enough. If my son is really sleepy and has something like the shower running to help put him to sleep, then this will put him to sleep. But on its own it is really not enough to put him to sleep or entertain him. However, I give it 4 stars because it still does help me out and he does like it to an extent. It helps me out at one or two points during the day. For some reason when I get a shower in the morning, he prefers to sit in this bouncy seat. I put it on to bounce and play music. Also, at night if he seems fussy and to wound up to go to sleep, I will sit him in this in front of the shower with the shower on and he will fall asleep. The seat is definitely very comfortable and cushioned for him. The toy bar very easily moves back to take him out of the seat. The toys aren't that great, but he does notice them and bat at them. I love all of the padding, love the nice gentle colors, love the music and nature sounds, love the ease of the toy bar, but dislike that I spent $50 for it to bounce itself and it really barely is perceptible. When my son is fussy and needs to be calmed or is wanting to be entertained by bouncing, I actually put him in a $20 bouncy seat from the same company that vibrates and bounce him myself. I think this is an awesome concept, and I know the company has to be careful with the bouncing speed, but they could make it bounce a little harder. I probably would not buy it again and would just get a regular vibrating bouncy seat. I am not saying my $20 one is the best, it lacks all of the padding to make it comfortable, but there are some out there that are padded, vibrate, and you can bounce yourself. This one is actually difficult to bounce yourself.
B008KW8JJE|1|Was very dissappointed when I received this chair for my 4 year old son.  The chair feels so flimsy and its tiny.  This chair was built for an infant!
B00E9VRR5C|4|Son loves them, very cute and the accessories make them useful art.
B0097GUCZ6|5|This was a lifesaver.  I became an exclusive pumper after my little boy and I just couldn't make breastfeeding work.  I could not have managed without this thing.  I wore it sitting in front of my computer, in my car, watching tv, eating dinner, etc.  When you have to pump all the time (heck, even once in a while), who wants to stand over their pump unable to do anything but hold it?  Definitely buy for little use to a lot of use.  I washed it a lot and it held up great.  The back has adjustable Velcro to make the bra tighter or larger, which is great as you are losing baby weight.  The Velcro is very strong and secure and even held it's position through the wash, so I very rarely adjusted it.  I'm a petite person - weighing 120 lbs, but with a 34D chest and I had no problems with the fit.
B0042D69XI|5|Adorable.
B00H070IDA|4|These adjustable snap pul diaper covers are great. Only regret I have is not knowing about the fact that I could have bought the Diaper Cover, Snap in Insert Cover & Insert all together.<br />(instead of seperately like I did)<br /><br /> I originally went to the happyendingsecodiapers website and bought the 3 pack of Weegro stay dry snap in sleeves for $6.25<br /><br />The soft Suede cloth insert sleeves do what the website says: Wicks moisture away from baby's skin. No more bleeding diaper rash, like my lil guy suffered from with disposables! I'm SO glad I found these :-) I would Definately recommend these to friends!
B000RHGNNY|3|I know this is a top-of-the-line car seat, and it is very plush and comfy and easy to adjust and all that, but the seat pads are not machine washable.  Our baby threw up all over the seat the very first time we used it and then again a week later.  It is very inconvenient to have a baby product that is not machine washable.  Had I known this, I would have just got the Graco.
B002QYW8LW|2|I was disappointed when I saw this, made me think of something I could have found in a bargain store.  It might look cute but really it is too overpriced especially when you have to pay the postage.
B005OI8OCE|5|My daughter LOVES these teething rings, and I love the fact they're US fabricated and they're silicone.
B00B98DVM6|5|Loved the experience i had in purchasing my son's stroller. Everything went great purchase, delivery. Would recommend to everyone. Great stroller ... light weight, color, etc ...
B00AQ0962C|5|It's rather sad my daughter's diaper bag for all her baby necessities is nicer than anything purse I have ever used just for me, but that is just how incredible this bag is.  It's beautiful to behold in great colors (mine is espresso) and I love just how convertible it is, adjusting itself for whatever carrying need I have.  Sturdiness and quality stand out here, as this is a bag you can trust to hold up no matter how much stuff you stuff into it.  I love the extra and incredibly roomy pockets.  Best part, in my opinion, is all the bonus features and accessories it comes with, making this pretty much the only diaper bag you'll need--really, no need to look for accessories to buy for it.  A gorgeous, high-quality bag that has everything a diaper bag needs.
B00NGL1XYC|5|Fast shipment. Item as described. Great size for a muslin swaddle blanket. Seems larger than other swaddle blankets. Only thing that could be better if item had print on both sides. Great item. Thanks.
B000096R5H|5|I got this set for my daughter's nursery. Its soft and I am really happy with it. I was one of the lucky ones that got a complete set (Ive heard that others bought this item at the store and it came incomplete). After buying a portable DVD player(for labor and delivery) and a digital camera to capture the moment both had been used and were defective and had been returned and I was lucky to buy them. Anyway Ive learned my lesson anything expensive that has more than one piece included with the item I check it before leaving the parking lot of the store. <br />I also have found that it is best to wash the bedding on the hand wash /delicate cycle. I am very happy with my purchase I looked for 4 months for a butterfly theme that had pink and purple, finding most at another store that was $75 more than this set and came with only 3 pieces and the other pieces were sold for $50 each.
B004HO5866|4|The only complaint I have about this stroller I'd that my son starts to slip down and it's uncomfortable for him a little. I have to keep sitting him up. Other than that the portability is wonderful.
B004NWMM2K|5|Used it at the beach and it worked well.
B000M4BRRE|1|This product stinks! It ripped a big hole in it the second time I used it! Way too delicatly made!
B000RJ18A0|5|the chairs were well designed They were shipped within 2 days.  Very happy with the ship time and the quality,
B000E0P290|5|My 3 & 4 year olds absolutely love their new \\"big boy\\" seats with their own cup holders.  The seat gives a really nice support system using the in car seat belts.  The head, neck and shoulders are all supported nicely.  I would absolutely recommend this item to someone who is ready to upgrade from the baby seats.
B0023UOKLA|5|I have given these to all 6 of my grandchildren.  I have purchased some from Hallmark before finding this site, but they were too big for carrying around.  These are perfect.  I take them in to our local store & have the names put on them.  Perfect gifts for all new babies & with the selection of Angel Dear--ya can't miss.
B000BGOGF8|2|This gate was so cheap I should have known it was too good to be true. I was hoping to use this to block off the fireplace opening from my soon to be crawling baby (we never use the fireplace so no worry about the plastic on the gate). This gate has very limited ability to adjust at the pressure points and I was unable to get it to fit in the space that I needed. I then tried the gate in our kitchen doorway thinking I would keep it if it fit there. Again this gate would not fit in any of the positions available for what I consider to be a pretty standard doorway size. On top of the inability to get this gate to fit it's kind of cheap looking and the wood frame doesn't seem very sturdy. I guess you get what you pay for - lesson learned and I'm now returning this gate and will continue to look for a solution for our fireplace opening.
B0043C5XYY|5|I used Bamboobies with my last baby and I am seriously stocking up this time. They are so soft and do a great job of absorbing leaking milk. Their overnight nursing pads were a life saver. I love that I don't have to stuff crunchy paper pads in my shirt that look like I fill my shirt with tissue paper.
B00845OGLM|5|Which obviously is expected since they are for 0-6 months!  I will need to follow back once he grows a bit since these are for older babies.<br />All in all, they are very cute and thick, however my baby's feet are still cold in them.  I think that's just typical of socks/booties.
B0064SD0PE|5|Got it as a gift for my niece. Everyone at the baby shower loved it.I just got another one for my friend.
B005PK1C20|5|Even better than the original chest clip!  Best of all it enabled me to fix my existing car seats and avoid the expense of new ones!! Thanks!!
B002SM62D2|5|In our never-ending journey to purchase and lose as many sippies as heavenly possible, we purchased the princess set for our daughter. So far we still have all 4. The cups work as advertised and rarely if ever spill (even when attacked by our dog).<br /><br />PROS:  Princesses<br />CONS:  Sadly there is a very small opening for Princess level jobs in the real world. When are they coming out with doctor sippies?
B003VNKLIE|3|This one is tough to align exactly to get it to close right.  Not easy carrying a child near stairs....
B006I0R6VM|5|Great product, use it on the stroller. Clip is strong and holds well, have tried other toys on stroller and problems with my son able to pull them off, but not with this, stays on great and it entertains him too.
B00FB5M66U|5|Did not have the &#34;A&#34; in Toys R Us to complete the name I needed, so I am grateful I found it online.  Thank you!  (P.S. The name looks great on the baby's bedroom wall.)
B004672QYG|3|Loved this table for my kids but it fell apart quickly. It lasted a few months but for the price I expect it to last a while
B0056R7IUC|1|This chest arrived with dings and dents when put together it split several times down the length of the front legs cheep pressboard and thin veneer wood.( event with the right screws) was not a good value for our money  We will have to replace this chest when we can untill then its back to the laundry baskets don't waste your money too hard to earn.
B003FPMDSO|5|I purchased these covers after deciding to CD my two boys, 6 months and 2 1/2. At that time I was using Bububibi one size covers and prefolds to cut down on cost by using the same covers and diapers for both of them. I purchased the Real Nappies 6-18 month, 18-31 lb size and they fit both of my boys too. These are much better than the Bububibi covers. The fabric is thicker and the elastic is better. I have been using these for about 4 months and think they are great for the price. I just ordered more and plan on getting rid of my other brand covers. The tag on these also says they can go into the dryer which is great for when my Hubby helps with the laundry and forgets to hang the covers.
B00008ODBG|4|awesome product i  gave it 4/5 because it does start to dry out the wipes after a while, bought it as a gift for my sister and she was in love! great product!
B000058DPL|5|I think it works better then the 110 plug!!
B000IDSLOG|5|Sophie the Girafee is a simple but well loved teething toy.  My baby loves to chew on its legs and nose. What I love about it, is that it is made from natural materials. A must-have!
B0002OT00U|5|i love it
B001GQ4CL0|1|We purchased this because we didn't want to buy a plastic pen. Thought this would be more environmentally friendly. After six months it completely fell apart. The dowels are held in place by adhesive and that didn't hold. This is a safety hazard if you have infants crawling around and beginning to pull up. I called the manufacturer five days ago as well as sent them an email through their Web site and have yet to hear back from them. Absolutely do not recommend this on the basis of poor customer service. They had an opportunity to respond and make things right -- but nothing.
B000JQ4B3C|5|I absolutely love this!! Fits perfectly! I have a Bugaboo and a Croozer and it works perfectly on both!
B00HZO5S4M|5|We tried several spoons before trying these for our daughter and these are just so much better than the beaba or the munchkin soft tip infant spoons. The angle and the bowl of the spoon just fits our daughters mouth. I used the munchkin soft tip spoon by mistake one day and had so much trouble feeding her before I realized my mistake and switched the spoons. The white hot safety part is an added assurance, not that I would completely rely on it.
B00B0K38VM|5|This stroller is awesome! Not only is it beautiful, but it's verd funktsionaalse. I was looking for a stroller that had the option of facing me. This does and also faces out. It is super simple to turn around the seat. It is lightweight and is quite easy to push. Reasonable price compared to other strollers of this quality. I do wish it had a cup holder for me and a tray for baby. I did buy a Britax attachable cup holder and it works great! I am so pleased with this purchase and would recommend it highly!
B003DQC72C|5|As expected
B005M1EMW4|1|Typically developing children have the physical and mental tools needed to teach themselves to walk given the appropriate environment: furniture or barre  to \\"cruise\\" along or a loving finger to hold if the child seeks one, for example.  This product can only obstruct a child's natural tendencies and give a false sense of accomplishment which could lead to injury when the child is released from this contraption.  Research consistently shows that forced early walking is not good for a child's physical or mental development and I cannot imagine what this could do to the child's spirit.  Again, I speak of typically developing children and realize that perhaps similar items are appropriately used under the instruction of trained physical therapist or occupational therapists.  I only clicked one star because Amazon forces one to do so.
B00INGNYXS|4|We didn't have a center headrest in the back seat so we attached this to one of the sides seats. As described, it rotates adequately so I can position it to see my little one completely in the rear view mirror. The view is clear and installation was easy.
B00KY4OTFO|2|I have other bibs by aden and anais that are much better quality. The threads are coming loose and the bibs really shrank a lot.
B0006HBS1M|5|Great for pumping while traveling
B004J7YIIA|3|I love this little grooming kit. It is perfect for my little boy but I only wish that it was complete. I paid for 5 emery boards instead of 2. Other than that it would of been perfect.
B00IP8A6N0|5|Perfect I love it
B005KL3LFU|5|We have had this lounger for 7 months now and I feel this is long enough to give this item an objective and honest review. My son, who will be 3-years-old in 6 days, has used this almost every day since we purchased it. He has spilled chocolate milk, juice, and who knows what else on it.. but all we have to do is take the cover off and throw it in the washing machine and dryer. It comes out every time looking brand new! My husband, myself, friends and family and even the family dogs...2 of them... all love to plop down on the cushion with our guy to watch a cartoon or show of his choice! So comfy!
B00W4M7CLM|3|My tub has already ripped down the side by the head rest.  I've only had this tub for a month.
B000WIPN66|4|Feels great and good quality. Nice material and has a very cute look for kids. I'm sure my niece will love it.
B0088UXLSW|5|This was a gift so I do not know how I can rate it since it is located in S Korea and I have no idea how well it is working of how well it fit. I have no idea of the quality. I do know that it was a bit bigger than expected but that is fine. Means it can be used for longer period.
B00BLVQIMG|2|This doesn't really do the best job with odors if it is half way full with the really stinky stuff...
B00B1M2N7E|5|great product. speedy delivery
B000F1QV1Q|5|I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. I like the safety grips on the bottom surrounding the base to help her from not tipping over with the chance that she heads towards a doorway with a slight drop. It will stop it. I love the detachable toy tray so that she can play on just a table also and the music on the steering wheel is not to loud.
B007T9Z5IC|3|Great fabric, good quality , but the 2 pillow cases it comes with are NOT for toddler pillows.  The size of the pillow cases are for a normal sized bed like a full bed pillow . Which that means I have to find pillow cases small enough for her toddler pillow . Don't think it was worth buying for almost 100 dollars between price and shipping .
B009S1DWP2|4|We love this carseat!  It's heavy but we expected that.  My daughter is 4 years old, b43 inches tall and 42lbs and she fits comfortably.  We recently did a three hour road trip and she was comfortable and didn't complain.  She can almost buckle her self in by herself (the button is too tough for her to press. But she can undo her chest strap when told to do so).<br />The cup holder on this thing is awkward and doesn't really fit right.  But we still use it and it's functional.  We have leather seats and this carseat seems to slip back and forth which made it hard for us to get a good install.  We previously had a britax marathon 70 and never had that problem.<br />We love  that this seat is much thinner the our beastly britax!!  And for that,  this seat is worth the purchase!<br />It looks great and is sleek.  Matches our interior.
B00005QXPE|4|We began to use this when my daughter turned 11 months old. We had a horrible highchair and she was too small for it, so we switched to the booster. She sits up so nice and tall in it. It's perfect for her to practice feeding herself and to even sit and watch TV in. It's very portable too!
B00JTTBH32|5|The Product is just what I expected , Weather Delivery was very fast, excellent and very beautiful
B001CFFX90|3|This foot rest is a great idea it just doesn't work well.  Having a problem getting it to stay on the shower wall with any pressure applied to it.
B0018BUWF8|5|These warming caps are a must have if you are pumping breast milk and storing (fridge/freezer) and using the Adiri bottles to warm the milk.  View the Adiri website for a video.  I found the place I purchased Adiri from did not sell the warming caps.
B00ADEL5VG|5|This is a great kids hamper- small enough for my kids to carry by themselves to the laundry room, but big enough for a week's worth of laundry. Perfect!
B00LYCR718|5|Definitely one of the best products I bought for our newborn. These are high quality and very soft, so perfect for sensitive skin or if the baby has rashes. They also endured a couple of washes in the machine and still going strong. Overall very satisfied! Will order more soon.
B00DBKFFJM|5|Ii was using another brand of pump that was free with my insurance.  That one hurt and made pumping so miserable that I didn't want to do it.  This Spectra pump is a dream!  It almost tickles!  I love the portability.  it IS silent enough to be one the phone at the same time and the person on the other line cannot hear it.  I also use it in the same room with a sleeping baby.  The nightlight feature also lets me see how much I am pumping without having to turn on a bigger light. I went from getting 1/2 oz to 1.5 oz to pumping 3 to 5 ounces in only 10-15 minutes!
B007ZZCS44|3|This product is so, so cute, but it is really cheaply made. The holes didn't line up properly and it's just really flimsy. It's fine f you consider it &#34;disposable&#34; or don' plan on using it very long.
B005AUYEHA|5|BabyBjorn Miracle is a wonderful product for my baby. She is always very curious about everything and I have to carry her everywhere. This carrier helps me to be able to carry her everywhere without hurt my back. The design of each part are great especially it's easy and safe. My baby loves it and feels excited every time see me take this carrier. I have recommend many friends to buy this carrier. They are all satisfied.
B00DU6JBPG|5|I bought this stroller kind of skeptical at first because of its low price! And in a condition as &#34;like new&#34;.<br />But let me tell you when i received it, I was in shock. This stroller was never used, it was new!!! and you cant go wrong with the price either. Its light weight and turns great! it can be comparable to the MacClaren, except this is lighter in weight!!! Love this stroller!!!!
B0093Y0IJ2|5|Great
B004GCJMKM|5|These locks are great.  Easy to install and great kid deterrent.  Bought a second set so we could have an extra key - good to have a second one because I accidently locked the first one inside once.  Luckily I had a strong enough magnet to open the cabinet!
B00HBW2U76|5|It is very nice with the waterproof backing.
B000BK8OVG|4|Seems like an average product. Nothing special. Seems very soft and comfy for baby
B0062BVY42|5|We bought one of these cups for our daughter at 14 months old. She figured it out in no time and absolutely love it! After a month of use she is pro and is getting so good that I can hand her my normal adult cup of water and she can drink from it without spilling! These cups truly taught her how to drink from a normal cup!<br /><br />As to concerns over leakage.... They do leak a TINY bit if left upside down or on their side. I find they leak more with water then with milk. I find depending on what I have in the cup (water, milk, juice, etc.), i just tighten the lid or loosen the lid accordingly. Milk is thicker so I dont tighten he lid all the way. Water is thin so I screw the lid on as tight as i can get it.<br /><br />These are super easy to clean and I feel like there are less nooks and crannies for mold or mildew to hide.<br /><br />Overall this has been the best cup we have tried.
B004BFZBPO|5|I bought this toy since my daughter loves balls, but also has a bad habit of hitting herself with them.  She absolutely loves this one!  She can hit and throw the ball, but she is also fascinated by all of the butterfly wings and different tags that stick out of this ball.  This ball was much bigger than I expected as well, but that is my fault - I didn't read the description.  Despite being large, it is still light enough for my little one to play with.  Overall a great toy.
B002SG7JSU|4|Bought a set of these because my son kept bumping his head on a window air conditioner that hung out over our patio.<br /><br />The guards are easy to install, just peel off the paper that covers the adhesive, and stick it on. They are still there, over six months later, even though they are outside in the weather.<br /><br />We also installed them on various cabinets, draws, etc. Cheap and easy to install, durable and they seem to stay put when you stick them somewhere!
B004HFQLIO|4|Works great but only if you cook a meal at a time.  Ended up using a much larger processor to make weekly sets of meals.
B00D8W4YZ4|5|We use the strawberry flavor and so far my 1 year old has yet to complain. He gets really excited about having his teeth brushed using this and the MAM toothbrush.
B000G7YNCS|5|I purchased this item for my new granddaughter who will be arriving soon. It set up very easily and is extremely cute. The carrying case is similar to a camp chair, just a little heavier. We havent actually used it yet but, we have inspected it pretty closely, it seems very sturdy and easy to use. I will be really excited to finally be able to use it.
B001CB7I4W|4|Average quality. Good bargain for it's price.<br />After one wash, it's ok but I'm not sure it will stay in a good shape after many washes.
B00005RW7M|3|While I loved the style and look of this mobile... it just doesn't play long enough.  My son would cry and want us to wind it up to play it again.  We ended up buying a battery operated mobile that would play for 10 minutes and even had a remote to start it again without having to wind-up anything.
B001H0GF24|2|I bought this gate in 2008 for my daughter. I loved everything about it until it was time to take it down. Some how when loosening it from the wall the metal at the base of the gate door bent a good 1 inch. I knew something wasn't right with the gate after taking it down, but I didn't realize what it was until I pulled the gate out of storage to use again in 2010. Because of where the bend in the metal was, I couldn't use the gate because it wouldn't lock and ended up throwing it away! The metal used for the gate is not sturdy and bends easy by the pressure put on it when securing the gate to the wall!
B003U6HCGQ|5|I got this for my new Granddaughter. I originally got it because I had bought a pack-n-play that did not include a mobile. I looked all over to find a mobile to attach to it. This one one of the few that was not designed to fit between crib railing.  However, my Daughter-in-law has also used it on her daughters car seat and stroller. Since this time I have seen one pink one by the same company that would have been cute for a girl. But if you are looking for one that is easily moveable with the baby, this is great. (whether you get this one or the pink one)  There has been no mechanical problems. As a matter of fact, I have ordered the same one for my new Grandson! It really is nice.
B00CD9ZH9K|5|My son loves these cups!  They are so much easier to get liquid out of than the ones you buy in the store.  Make sure to get the cleaner brush with them, as if you don't use that the straws can get kind of gross!
B008337RMA|4|I bought this for our cold Alskan nights, but I haven't had to use it yet so I can't comment on warmth. I bought size Medium for my 16 month old daughter who is a little thing at 20 lbs & 30 in. This sac does fit her but she's got room to grow into it. I washed it twice because of the packaging smell & it held up nicely & the zipper works good & the smell came right out.
B00CULD3GA|5|Daughter loves this cup. It's a great design for transitioning to adult cups, and the quality of construction is evident.
B0071D1AKI|1|I think there is no need for this item
B000KPZS34|5|This is a great item.  We needed these to help our son start potty training, because the disposible training pants are too much like a diaper.  This was nice to have to put over his cotton training pants to help keep up with his accidents.  We'll be saving them for our second son who isn't quited ready to train.
B00AQ094BA|4|I like this bag as a handbag + diaper bag combo. It's the size of a normal large handbag so it doesn't look uncomfortable and it comes with the following<br />1. Key fob<br />2. Small pouch for credit cards<br />3. Stroller straps so the bag can be hung off a stroller - this is a brilliant addition to this bag<br />4. Sack for dirty clothes<br />5. Shoulder strap<br />6. The bottle holder and changing pad that all diaper bags come with<br /><br />This is great for a parent with toddlers who no longer needs to carry a pile of stuff around. It's too small if you're cloth diapering and need to have all your supplies in one bag.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because the one I received had some stains / discoloration around the zip and a weird chemical smell that lasted for a while
B00JL4OT9Y|5|soft and easy to  clean
B002QYW8LW|5|My son loves it. He is one and he is now opening his mouth and let me brush his teeth for him.
B002L6CEYQ|4|This is a nice bag but after trying to put my son's lunch in it I have decided it is too small.  If you are just sending a juice box, sandwich and a small piece of fruit it would be fine. However I want to send it to preschool and it is too small to fit the reusable containers that I often put his snacks and lunch in. They do offer a larger one but it was not in stock so I'm just to going to return this.  Maybe if you just want to carry snacks in it, it would work well. it is very cute and very nice quality.
B001BXP0PA|5|I absolutely love this product, it is so cute and soft its perfect for a newborn baby. =D Its definitely what I was looking for and more! Thank you for this wonderful product.
B00EM5D0Q0|5|We use these with the Tommee Tippee pacifiers. Easy to clip on. Only thing i didn't like was that we got two &#34;i love daddy&#34; ones and not a cupcake one. Not anything i would rate the item down for though. Just a bummer.
B00IOS76NE|3|A month and its starting to come apart.
B00175ROGU|2|My little boy enjoys chewing on this teether, however, because the design is a T shape, he keeps putting the long part in his mouth and gagging himself. He's too little to teach not to do this and I worry he'll fall or lean forward while the long part is in his mouth and hurt himself. I wish all sides were the same length as the top part. I encourage him to use other teethers we have.
B00I90HGKU|4|These diapers are great for the price. My only issue is that they are a little on the big around the legs. I have washed and dried them several times and they are holding up well. I do have some of the more expensive diapers and happy flute is just a good. I am only useing cloth diapers so I needed a lot.
B00CS4HI4W|5|These work greattt to keep baby calm. The startle reflex is effectively neutralized with these swaddles. However, holding baby over your shoulder is made difficult as their hands are crossed over their chests. I recommend using these for sleep/nap time mostly.
B00BEVF2NY|5|Love this Seat!!
B00ECKPV5S|4|I bought this to cover a changing pad of a different brand since I needed a changing pad that was 15 x 33 inches and it fits fine. However, I wouldn't go much bigger in length. I have washed it and it holds up fine. Have not used it with a child yet (due to give birth soon) so I don't know how it holds up to stains or long term wear but so far so good. Also it is super soft, which feels nice, and the design is so cute. I would recommend this brand to others.
B002JP7USY|5|Grand son uses this a lot holds up well and super cute.
B005SAZ68I|4|Great product and cute design.  Seems pretty durable and was so easy to set up - just open and it's ready.
B00GIX9ADQ|5|Love this tote! Use it all the time! I would buy from this seller again! Shipped fast and bag was as expected!
B0097GUCZ6|5|Amazing product! I wouldn't pump without this. I use this every time I pump. When I first started pumping I needed the bra to help me maintain good suction. Not that I have been pumping for many months I just love the bra for the convenience. When I am at work I am able to type emails, make calls, ect. It is amazing. Every pumping mom should have this.
B007UFW13M|3|Very cute and well made but alittle too short and a narrow seat for my 2 year old.  she will have to hunch over soon to push around.
B009UQPSE8|4|it was for a babyshower, everyone loved it
B001I45F70|4|The product is great for babies, my niece loves the product it has lots of different little movable parts including the head that spins around.
B004RPDPHY|5|On time delivery. Super nice product. It lays flat but has a thickness to it that can actually b hugged. This products purpose I would not recommend as a blanket. Its not big enough for that purpose. Its more of a huggable friend that u can lay flat & put ur lil one to lay on it. The fur does not molt & stands up to machine wash. Too much fur to lay babys face directly on tho. Its a great friend for travel & bedtime. The other side is a silky smooth material. Not too smooth tho. The silk has texture that makes it not too sleek.
B007R56YEC|5|I rarely write reviews. But I just made a timely escape from the room of a sleeping 3 year old twins and it was with the help of this turtle. I debated between the tranquil turtle and the cheaper version with the static star lights. I am so glad I went for this one. It's a combination of the moving lights and the sound that help keep the kids calm. We have a very tough sleeper and this has greatly helped. It's not magic— but with the right conditions in place it helps my little one settle down at night and for naps.
B00468XAEK|4|This towel is bigger than a lot of hooded towels, which is great for my extra tall 20-month old daughter. The fabric feels nice and thick so it won't wear our quickly.
B004769M70|5|My baby loves this toothbrush.
B001OC5UNK|3|I just received this and it installed in just a few minutes.  Anyone else reviewing this that claimed it was too hard to open with one hand probably has it tightened too far.  There is a fine balance between too tight to open easily and too loose to be stable.  But it only took a couple twists of the pressure mounts for me to determine the right balance.    I read the other reviews before purchasing and carefully measured the opening I planned to block with this gate to make sure it would work.  Because, as other reviewers have stated, this is not a gate that fits openings 29\\" - 52\\" like the product description lists.  This gate will fit in an opening that is approximately 29-32\\", roughly 35-38\\" with just the 6\\" extension, approximately 42-45\\" with just the 12\\" extension, and roughly 48-51\\" with both extensions.  Unfortunately, if your opening falls in those in between sizes, you're going to find that you can't get a good fit.  Either it's too big with the extension(s) added that you can't get it in place or w/o the extensions it's not very sturdy because you have to push the pressure mounts to the extreme end of their length.    My biggest issue with this gate is that it seems really flimsy and cheap compared to the Northstates, Evenflo & KidCo gates we have in other doorways thru-out the house.  The overall construction is made of poorly done welds against the thin metal tubes.  Since I put this in an area that gets high traffic, I'm concerned about how long it will hold up.  But I guess that's what you get when you buy the cheaper option.    We're going to try it for awhile and see how it goes.
B00O9XZOQ4|4|One big oopsy...there is no hanger with this product. Will need to find a hanger small enough to fit the product.  No regular hanger will do.  Overall...really cute and girly.
B00769SIVG|1|Again as the norm with sweet Jojo. Horrible material quality for the outrageous price.
B000QYK4XI|5|This bag is exactly what I was hoping that it would be.  It's sturdy, roomy, convenient, and cool.  I registered us for this so that my husband would have a diaper bag that he would not only be willing to wear, but be excited to wear!!! He absolutely loves it and it makes him feel like the best and coolest daddy on the block!!!
B00007L5WU|5|This is the best blanket out there.  It stays on baby, yet is roomy enough for her to move around.  Although my daughter was 12 lbs, I went ahead and got the large sleep sac.  It fits fine and leaves her room to grow.<br />Remember, this is a blanket, not pajamas.  You still have baby wear her PJ's with the blanket.  And there's no sleeves on blankets, that's why there's no sleeves on these.
B002J4U8SO|5|We took it out of the box and she barely would let me get it out of its packing (just twisty ties really). I was surprised that after showing her how to pull it back and watch it go she understood the concept. She played with it for 30mins straight! : ).. too cute. She loves crawling after it. For the price it is a must have!
B0040GJ0UG|5|I bought this for my baby when he was somewhere between 4 and 5 months old. He took to it immediately. There are a total of five sides on this very sturdy, nice-looking toy. The side that kept him busy most at first is the side with the pink and green flaps (you can see it in the pic they have up here). He liked just flipping the flaps and touching the textures. More recently he's explored all of the sides except for the one with the beads laced onto twisty posts. Which is weird, cause I know that'd be my favorite side if this were my toy.<br /><br />I am not generally a huge huge fan of lots of plastic junk laying around but this one continues to be of interest to Eddie who is now 7 mos old. It's like a portable Exersaucer, with all it has to do and for how well it keeps the baby interested. Hugely recommended.
B005FIV754|4|we bought this chair for my youngest being just a year old. Turns out my 3 and 5 year old loved it just as much. I have taken a seat myself and it was actully pretty comfortable
B0017LCZEU|5|This clay works really well and is the old school type clay that captures every groove and fingerprint. I also used the pearhead kit but liked this one way better. Faster drying time and better imprints. I was also able to make 5 ornaments out of one kit!
B003SRMTDS|5|Just what I was looking for... Great buy!!!
B00171WXII|5|This aspirator is WONDERFUL!!  It's one thing to use the aspirator that they send you home from the hospital with when your baby is completely healthy.  Once your baby get their first cold, it goes out the window.  We discovered this aspirator and LOVE it!  It is so effective at resolving her congestion without aggravating her or us!  Because it is powered by your own breath it is easy to keep a steady stream of suction going to do what the aspirator needs to do, rather than having to position and squeeze, position and squeeze over and over again with the traditional aspirator.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B003N9M6YI|5|Key handles don't get super cold, so it's easier for my baby to hold. It's really nice.
B004OZ0NUO|5|the best sippy cups - hands down.  Cannot believe people are complaining about the little stopper on the inside - still the best and easiest to clean of ALL sippy cups and I have tried about 30 different brands.
B009YDCN8G|4|I have another shopping cart cover that is too bulky, so I like the less bulkiness of this cover.  I also like that the fabric is super easy to clean.<br /><br />Biggest problem is the fabric is a bit slippery.  On some carts with a right fit like at my local Ralph's, it's fine.  I slip it over easily and strap baby in (now 1) and Jane no problems.  With this cover AND my more bulky cover I had problems with target carts!  Basically no cover is good in Target carts I've found so I use baby carrier and keep him strapped to me at that store.<br /><br />This cover has worked for me at local restaurants for a high hair cover.  I pull it down far enough so that if it rides up a bit it's okay.  We try to eat and run, so I don't spend a lot of time readjusting and pulling it down.<br /><br />Basically, I like the cover for short usage and at my grocery store because I'm a germ freak.  I can't put my baby in a bubble but I will do the little things like covers when I can.  The pouch makes it easy to transport and keep in car.  I do wish the fabric was less slippery and more cotton.
B000GK5XY2|4|I originally bought this 5.5 years ago for one of my children.  I put bananas in it and it was horrible to clean. I ended up throwing it away within a couple uses.  This time around we've avoided bananas and it's worked wonderfully.  My 8 month old has had avocado, apples, grapes, clementines, and strawberries in it.  No issues with cleaning it. If you have a little one that wants normal table food this may be a good compromise.
B00LQRUIW6|5|Adorable!!!!!!!
B00IP8AF18|4|I got this as a spare for when we have extra kids in the car and it works great.  It's a bit narrower than other seats which is nice since I don't have a ton of room to work with.  I would recommend this for taller/older kids.  The seat belt sits right on my 7yo but it's a little high on the small 5yo I babysit so it cuts across her neck instead sitting on her sholder.
B008WNV52E|5|I've been through a lot of diaper bags. I started with the fancy ones with crazy prints and a million little pockets until I landed at the grand central bag from skip hop.<br /><br />I was attracted to the big central compartment (I am guessing that is where the name came from?)--great for toting around a blanket, change of clothes even something as large as a potty seat. My favorite feature of this bag is the large side compartments. I have trouble keeping things in the little pockets that most diaper bags offer. I like to just throw things in a big pocket.<br /><br />Don't worry if you are an organizer there are still small pockets within the large ones, but you won't need a gps to find your way around. Need a little me time? This bag also has whole mommy side for things like keys, cellphone and sunglasses. We mostly use the grand central for longer trips, the roomy compartments are ideal for plane trips with more than one kiddo in tow.<br /><br />Lastly, The lightweight material is easy to clean and BPA-free which isn't true of all the major brand bags.
B004FN0Z44|4|We like this stroller-very nice colors,light weight and comfortable. Only thing we don't like is the hoodie that doesn't protect from the rain very well. Love the pocket attachment to put my car keys & wallet in. I love this stroller for my lttle one...21 m. o.<br />Janie
B001G1NXHE|5|This a very nice quality car seat blanket and on top it looks adorable. Very soft fabric and not flimsy.<br />I am from Germany so I know this brand very well. It's always top quality.
B00005N9X8|5|I found it is better to just get this when you get the gate.  You can always return it, but at least you have it.  I have had to go back and get the extensions. All the better to be prepared for Grandma's house.
B004CJ2RIS|5|Perfect as advertised
B00188XW26|5|I got this ball when my boys were just a few months old. It was easy to grab due to all the holes. They loved picking it up, shaking it, and sticking their tongues through the holes.   Now at 10 months, they still LOVE these balls. They crawl after them, shake them, and love putting them in the Fisher Price race track  (...)  A toy that truly grows with your child. LOVE it!!
B006NTY1HU|4|This is perfect for hanging outside with your little one.  We've even set it up a few times in the house using 4 or 5 panels against our furniture.  The only drawback is that it is somewhat difficult to move the panels around or close it up.
B0041RRX6M|5|Sent these to my granddaughter and from the minute the package was opened and she squealed with excitement I knew she would have fun with them.the colors are just right and they are the right shape for the baby to hold.
B00E3RKC36|5|Purchased this swing for my grandchild.  Love the portability of this table top fold up model.  Very nice swing at a much nicer price than it's competitors.
B00504MQN0|4|this is very beautiful and like other reviewers mentioned has to be assembled a bit(very quick and simple though). turned out to be a beautiful addition for the baby's playtime. took a star off for the shaky assembled pieces, hoping they dont fall off often
B00L92KXZK|1|Didnt work for me, didnt hold the breast sheilds tight enough and caused milk to drip out the bottom
B000H48FWE|2|The two predrilled holes for mounting do not fit any of the electrical outlets in my house, also the provided screws were too short anyways as they didn't extend beyond the thick plastic plate.  But what I did do is just drill a hole in the center of the unit, like all of the other competitors products use grabbed a longer screw and it worked great. Don't over tighten it, the slider doors will stick open.<br />I bought these because we needed them in brown.  I would be them again since it is easy to modify.  Giving it two stars since I should not need to modify a new product.<br />Our house was built in 2010 and uses standard electrical outlets.
B0090HH4SA|5|I love this monitor! I had the Summer Infant monitor and returned it, there is no comparison! I can hear his heartbeat clearly and the movements too! A plus!! Ps. Buy the ultrasound gel too!
B003NVLW64|3|With my first child nipple shields saved my breastfeeding potential, so I bought these ahead of time with my second and ended up not needing them. While they were cheap and I may use them in the future if for whatever reason I feel the need to (blister, etc) I found them to be uncomfortable and too large. There are thinner and better designed options on the market, though they do cost quite a bit more I would say if you use them often enough it's worth it. These are just a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; type deal I suppose.
B001AAI2NG|5|I bought this product in different colors for my grandchildren.after hearing that they love it so much I bought one for my home.<br />It's very easy to use.it washes well it keeps the child warm.the part I love the most that it fits every stroller and car seat.i bought it in a few colors they are all pretty ones.The zippers work well and I use it also as a blanket when I remove one piece.<br />It fits a big child so you really get your money's worth on this cover.My son is having his first baby very soon this will be his first gift from me.
B004044LD4|1|i purchased this mattress based on the excellent reviews. However after 3 months of use I have to discard. There are deep indentations in the mattress despite turning it weekly. My infant grandson who is now just 12lbs has formed a permanent depression in the mattress where his body lays. It provides no support. I wonder if I got a different product from everyone else? There is no way I can use this another week, let alone until he is a toddler. Very disappointing purchase.
B007HZBPKA|5|we LOVE the re-play brand of dinnerware and these bowls are no exception. we bought these as an addition to our divided plates. They are thick, durable, bright plastic - the likes of which I have yet to see any other toddler/baby dinnerware brand do! love that they are made of recycled materials. Love their versatility - they can go in the microwave and dishwasher (without warping)! They do not stain easily. All of our friends that have seen these have loved them too - they ask about them and some buy them for themselves. Try them you'll love them too!
B002WN2BZA|5|We have owned this for about two weeks now.  We are loving it (definitely not disappointed!).  My baby was born a preemie and is now 10 weeks old.  She is still small, and her little legs aren't long enough to reach the foot panel.  We took the suggestion of placing a book; the complete works of Jane Austen in one bound volume has done the trick!  Even without the music, the kickin' and rockin' put my baby to sleep this morning.  We bought this at the recommendation of a physical therapist.  Supposedly, the hammock seat is very supportive by hugging the baby, and of course the kickin' activity will build some leg muscles.  Assembly is super easy.  Cushions can be removed (a little tough) for machine wash.
B00NH1BA6W|5|Love this. Such a great product. Just press once and you can access your wipes asap.i line that you can also see how many refills you use thru the slim window
B007CTPWXW|4|I have space for my cup, baby's sippy, my phone and wallet. Before there wasn't room for anything. This piece is essential.
B006Z6E8AG|5|Easy to use and brings great ease.
B001OW6K02|5|I was very pleased with the toddler bed. I received it much quicker than I expected and it was very easy to put together. It did have a chipped piece of wood, but black marker made it not even noticeable. great deal for $40!!!!!!
B00D4LFC46|5|Very light and colorful. My little one loves to play with it. I like prepping food for her in it
B00792RG1S|5|These are the only sippy cups my two daughters (12 months and just over 2 years) will use. Amazon has them at a great price and it makes it easy for me to stock up on them. They don't spill everywhere like some other brands and they make it so much easier to transition the child from the bottle to the cup with the way the mouth piece is built. I definitely recommend these if you have had a problem getting your child to transition. I have two very stubborn children who both took to these right away.
B00BCDDZSI|4|I ordered the dresser from Amazon to go with the Graco Lauren crib that my daughter had already purchased. I was a little worried the finish would not match since some reviews said there was a big difference between them. I was pleased when I saw the dresser espresso finish matched the crib almost exactly!  The only complaint my son in law had was the amount of screws and little pieces that came with it. You need to have patience to put this together but once he did it looks beautiful. Just give yourself a good afternoon or evening to put it together if your doing it alone :)
B007VBYVWE|5|Bought for daughters baby and is working fine
B0016IZ2DK|4|I really like this product, and I can buy it cheaper through Amazon than I can buy it directly through Vitamin Shoppe even though Amazon offers it by...you guessed it, Vitamin Shoppe.    Since I have a lot of allergies to chemicals and fragrances, the grocery store brands irritate me.  With castile soap, use it plain or add your own fragrances such as essential oils  - those don't seem to bother me.  Another positive is that it's fairly concentrated, so I do half water, half castile in my soap dispensers and it seems to work fine that way.  By the time it's diluted, the cost is about the same as buying the cheapest liquid soap at our local Kroger.  But you have to buy it in this particular bulk size to get the cost advantage - the small Bronners sizes can get pricey per ounce.
B005KODTX6|2|The comment is for the color. We thought this was hot pink as seen on our computer, but it is red and black. We returned it in order to purchase one that is pink.
B000CBNSJ2|5|Its a little smaller than we would have liked it, but its very cute. Works well in a girl's room.
B00CWN3HSA|4|Sturdy yet portable.  Perfect for keeping a newborn close.
B0009XBXKE|1|These are not absorbent at all. My baby regularly pees on the changing table and I have used puppy pads in the past for easy clean-up. They were a little pricey so I thought I would try these. I used maybe two and the rest are sitting in a drawer. After trying these I went back to using puppy pads. Also, I know it is a little strange to comment on, but the pattern on these \\"pads\\" includes different colors of baby hands. One of the colors is red which looks like bloody little hand prints. Gross.
B001O9F6M8|5|We are really happy with the Boppy Noggin Nest!  For the first few months, our daughter always has preferred to turn her head to the right, especially when she's on her back.  This was starting to create a slight flat spot on her head.  We looked up reviews on various products, and the Noggin Nest seemed to have the best reviews so we gave it a shot. We have one in her swing and one in the bassinet of her pack n play.  She doesn't seem to mind them at all, and it really cushions her head and keeps her from just turning to the right when we lay her down.  We've also noticed that the at spot is already improving in just a few weeks.  It is also machine washable, although the color did fade slightly after one wash. I also wish that they made different colors/patterns, the two that are available just aren't that great.<br /><br />Overall we are very happy with this product!
B0013FKDU8|5|This was given as a gift to our son and we love it!  So much that we give it as a gift now! :)
B0052QYLUM|2|I bought this to keep at my parents' house when we visit with our son. We have only used it a handful of times and last night the picture stopped working. I tried troubleshooting tips from the manual but that didn't fix it. Fortunately customer service is sending another. Before it stopped working I thought it was just ok - the video quality is decent but it's not always easy to manually set up the camera angle. I really wish it had a pan/zoom like our Motorola monitor at home but I guess you get what you pay for.
B007EX202C|5|Arrived sooner than expected, product as described, looks great xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
B00EVTEZDY|5|nice and soft.  washes well too
B00N4JLRBK|2|I used once can't find the one instruction I would rather return it
B0056S889Q|4|After reading some of the reviews I was a bit concerned about it. But after using it for a couple of days, it's been great. I will say though that the connection between the water container and the base isn't great. There's not actual seal, and it's fitted pieces together. No water has leaked, but I can see where it might. I've only filled it once and have it on half power/mist. So that's about 4 days. It's made a big differece in how the little one sleeps.
B003Y53YR4|5|I love this stroller and car seat! Easy to wipe clean and very durable. The stroller pushes great! The only thing I recommend it to buy extra tubes for the tires....they are always going flat!
B0030EVPU2|1|The Stroller as such is good: Light, very easy to steer, easy to fold and open. However, the tires are so cheap they do not even last for three months of moderate use. So after 6 months, we're already on our 3rd set of tires - since each time we got another puncture, we were provided with another set of those horrible tires. We would never buy one again - and it's a joke that MountainBuggy claims that durability is part of their DNA.
B001DY7PXW|1|This watch did not work when I received it. I am thinking it was possibly the battery.  I returned it and chose not to get another one.
B004GYBJZQ|5|Cute and matches the other pieces very well.
B000JOR0F0|1|Pain to install, pain to use and overall terrible. The ones that work work too well so I can't open the drawers- and the others broke within the first try. I do not recommend these locks, they are terrible and frustrating.
B00AJSIQCW|5|Installed this seat in the car in seconds, my daughter loves it. Safe and effective!
B008G6ELSM|5|I love these bibs! My son has GERD and, as a result, is constantly spitting up/throwing up. We have tried several different bibs and these are by far the best. The absorbent ring around the neck catches spit up that would roll down onto his clothes with other bibs. The only thing I would change about this product is that there is no waterproof layer between the two pieces of terrycloth.
B0019LPAHC|4|I love it! It's pretty and inexpensive. however it takes hours to assemble. There's too many pieces.
B006Z6E8AG|5|Thank God that I did not invest in any baby blenders and just bought this, super easy to use and clean. I use it everyday to make my baby's food. I smash every kind of soft food, cooked foods. My baby has had no difficulty to swallow these foods.
B00D0F4WEW|4|2 month old only uses this style paci. this one is great, but the red dog is the best as it is a bit heavier so it stays in easier
B00FM5LK2K|4|Its a good product for it's job. Yet there are couple of things one should take into account with this one... (for the record, I live in a block and concrete, 2 floors house).<br />Pros:<br />1. Very good reception on the monitor all over the home, on both floors and even when you take the monitor to the garden (away from the camera).<br />2. Good picture quality both at day light and night vision! I was surprised how good it is in a completely dark room at night.<br />3. No visible led lights for night vision - very nice and comfortable.<br />Cons:<br />1. In this Lila model, the camera has no music for the baby, and no temperature measuring. Both nice features that are available on Jena monitor for example.<br />2. The electric wire (the cord) for the camera and monitor are pretty short. In my baby room I had to connect an extend wire to connect the camera.<br />3. The camera &#34;reacts&#34; to noises (voice sensor). There are no motion sensor on the camera. That means, that if the baby start crying, the camera and the monitor will go on, but if the baby will silently move out of his craddle, you'll never know (I am not sure this is important, but still, its a drawback for me).
B005WHQKG4|5|I bough it for my sister boy and she is very happy with it. Safe, good quality of fabric, straps seems to be solid. She would recommend it
B00LFP61NE|5|No complaints!
B00K1AIIMG|1|The lines on the cocoon are pink not white and so are the eyes! Why would the eyes be pink? Not very gender neutral!
B00IISKV3W|5|Love these diapers!
B0009RG8X2|5|This is great!!  No bulky snowsuit needed!!!  It kept her warm and I didn't have to put on a bulky snowsuit that makes it harder for her to move around and is very hard to hold her and carry her too!  She did still wear a hat and that is all.
B002UXQRDO|1|I have used a number of reusable nursing pads, and these are the worst. They would have turned me off reusable pads altogether if someone hadn't given me some others.  I don't understand how there could be a product like this on the market. They don't leak through, as other reviewers have said, but the milk drips out the bottom of the pad. You don't get the spot right at your nipple, but just below your bra. They're visible through my shirt. And, they're SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I don't know why you would make such a stiff, scratchy product for a consumer who is likely to have sensitive, or even cracked nipples.  I've been lucky enough to have an easy breastfeeding experience, without those problems, and I still find these irritating.
B001IDZPHQ|5|We have 3 strollers...one for when my son was an infant, another that's the \\"cadillac\\" of strollers and then the Aria.<br /><br />We initially got this because we were travelling abroad and didn't want to take our 19lb stroller with us (partially because I would be by myself for some of the trip with our infant son). Convinced we had to have this one, we ordered it. Unfortunately, our son was too small for it (18lbs) and wasn't really sitting up right on his own, so we took the Cadillac with us. Since then, we have let our friends and family borrow this for their trips, everyone has been excited and loves it. Compliments on the ease of steering, even with a full load, baby, diaper bag, shopping, knick knacks in the basket. One hand open and close. It's very easy to use!<br /><br />KEEP IN MIND: this stroller will not be ready for your baby if they are not sitting up on their own. The back is flimsy and not as firm/sturdy as most full size stroller. I didn't feel like it supported him enough to use it until he was upright on his own. He would flop around from side to side (even harnessed in). The plus side is that there is plenty of room for your baby to grow and use it well into toddler years.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT...light (9lbs), very easy to steer with 1 hand, open/close with 1 hand, inexpensive. It has all the functionalities of a more expensive stroller. Ours came fully loaded with the foot muff (great for cold days) and a rain cover (it doesn't rain much here so that's useless). It takes up virtually no space when folded up. Very small for the size of the stroller.<br /><br />DISLIKE: I like our PP Switch because we could have our baby facing us or out very easily...I like looking at him, although I think he's outgrown that phase and likes to look out and see things/people. There isn't a LARGE cup holder. The one that it comes with is great for a baby bottle, not so much for an adult water bottle. I think it's a little \\"low\\", if the handles extended I think it would be great for average height folks. (I'm 5'3\\" - so it works for me). The transition from \\"sitting up\\" to \\"laying down\\" is jerky and has woken up our baby. It's nice that it has that function for the size/price point of this stroller. Not in love with it (smoother in the Switch).<br /><br />Overall - Definitely recommend it. It's inexpensive and has a lot of the functions/comfort of a regular full size stroller, without the weight.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's been 2 years since we've had this - and when my son was able to sit up on his own, we switched to this stroller and haven't changes since. I did spent the last month+ looking for an even lighter stroller that had all the benefits of this one.<br />Like - the maneuverability with just 1 hand is insanely easy in a mall or smooth surfaces. On a brick walkway - it takes a little bit of pressure but totally manageable. This thing unfolds with a release of a button - very easy! It's thin when folded up - also a bonus.<br />Dislikes: The cup holder that comes with the stroller SUCK! it cracks easiy and gets mishappen (found that out when we got our stroller back from gate check after a flight) - you can't access the storage basket easily when your baby is in full recline mode - wish the back had a sturdier support.<br /><br />I have searched on all sorts of websites and have had NO success in finding a lightweight stroller that offers the SAME use as a full size. I'm so happy with this. I did purchase a few extras to add on storage and a better cup holder.<br />Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy and the Carry You Saddle bag. I hung the saddlebag on the diaper bag hook (there's a little hook on the stroller for the Peg Perego Diaper Bag - don't get their diaper bag, it's small and totally just for aesthetics) - anyways, I used the velcro on the saddle bag to hook it and now I have easy access to diapers/wipes and binkies. The Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy is awesome b/c it all collapses with the stroller - it's the sturdiest cup holder I've found that works with this stroller.
B002BSGWSS|5|Bought a pack and split it between our 2 new baby grandsons. Very soft. Nice size. Pretty, soft colors. Would buy again.
B00ELUTARY|5|Love this!!! Met my expectations and it is perfect. Just wish it would have had a matching diaper hanger, and a few other things that were optional like trashcan, clock, and maybe a lamp. I found some things that worked but i could not be happier with this set!
B000L9JNK8|5|Intended to give this as a gift for Easter, but decided not to. Our baby uses my hair as a comfort blanket and it is really starting to hurt and become and very bad habit, so we decided to buy the Buddy Blanket in pink. The pink bunny blanket is very sweet with soft velvet (or something similar to velvet) material on the top embroidered with carrots and a cute saying with satin trim. On the reverse side it is silky smooth satin fabric. The blanket separates into two halves (like pigtails). The bunny itself is also very soft and fleecy. While our baby still relies on my hair, she has taken a liking to her Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket. We make sure she sleeps with it and wakes up with it in the morning. The blanket we have was purchased at a high end department store for the same price as on Amazon, which is a bummer, but totally worth the price.
B0032FOOQ6|3|Its okay. But the spring on the bottom adjustment side slips and you need to adjust it frequently. Im not so silly as to think all of these gates do this, but mine does.
B001OC5UMQ|3|Its relatively easy to install and is very secure... I only have two issues 1) my 19 month old is too darn smart and figured out within a week to slide the red clip and lift the lever... atleast it slows her down a little I guess... 2) the walk through door is too narrow in my opinion. I wish it had another inch or two atleast. This is at the top of our stairs and I have to manuever very carefully to get through it without banging her dangling legs when she's asleep. I'm sure there must be a reason they made it so narrow but it makes me feel like I have crazy wide hips/thighs when I try to go through it.
B00073HJG8|2|My wife had me order this for our kids rooms. I like the idea and knew it would get some of there stuffed animals off the floor. Yes I knew it was a net but once I put one up and put an animal or two in it I realized that it would need to be stretched out just as far as it could go to get more than 2 animals in the hammock. So I had to remove it from the wall and drill all knew holes and reposition it on the wall. The directions being very un detailed just say to use the included ancors if not going straight into a stud. There was no actual dimensions given as how far to space them out. Well let me tell you, you have to stretch it our almost just as far as it can go to actually hold much. Plus make sure that you place the one going in the back some what low other wise the front sags to much and they all just fall out. End of the day had the directions been more detailed and the hammock a little tighter this might not be a bad item. Also depending on what you are looking for in the room it looks a little cheesy.
B001OC5UMQ|5|Just put these gates up as my 10 month old started crawling.  They are great and serve their purpose.
B00IEWZCJ0|5|This has been the best baby product that I have invested in, honestly the amount of laundry it has saved me from doing every day has been huge! Not only are they totally safe and comfortable on my babies they actually work against leaks and potty disasters and even keep the smells in. I recommend this to every mom and dad out there, it's the best !! Plus I love the bright fun colors 😃
B00JBXPM1O|5|Just what I needed! Thank you
B003VNKLHA|4|It's hard to find gates that don't require you to drill into your walls, so this is exactly what we were looking for. Fits great in the doorway we need it in (47.5 inch opening) and it's sturdy. My 50 pound dog can put her weight on it and it doesn't move. Tall enough that she can't jump it. My only complaint is the opening for the gate door is pretty narrow.
B000HK6BCE|5|This bedrail system is perfect. My daughter can now sleep without falling out of bed and we as parents could not be more pleased with this purchase. Although the directions are a little vague, it was still fairly easy to assemble. It is not flimsy and it even held me in the bed during a test run. So if you want a solid construction and safe bedrail for your child, this is the system to purchase!
B007RIYPO0|1|This picture (and consequently this carrier) exemplifies everything that is unsafe babywearing.  Babywearing is wonderful, safe, comforting and great developmentally only when done properly.  The baby should never be forward facing- that is damaging to the developing spine.  The baby should never hang from his crotch.  The seat of the carrier or wrap should go knee to knee on the baby (to prevent damage to the hip joints and impaired circulation to the genitals) And lastly, the baby should never hang that low- the rule of thumb is that the baby's head should be close enough to kiss without having to bend over- that is damaging to the mother's spine and neck.<br />If looking for something for the water, consider a wrap or sling or carrier that takes into account safe babywearing practices as outlined above.<br />- Dr. Catherine Prann
B002QZ64T8|1|Too thin and bunches up in my toddler and 2 month olds Cloth diapers.  The fleece is also always drenched and soaked in urine every time, so it does not help to keep my babies dry enough to my liking.
B0042YZIKM|5|I love how the baltic amber works. It was recommended to me a few years ago for my baby boy and we never had to use teething tablets after that. I now have this for my baby girl and hope it's going to help the same. Just keep it on your baby at all times and the ambers oils will continue to soothe your little one. the most important thing is to not keep taking it off your baby! A lot of people take it off too often and so doing that doesn't allow the oils to absorb into the skin. then they're convinced that the necklace doesn't work. I love how this necklace is so affordable too. My husband and I would have paid a lot more for one of these. this is a must buy for all who's expecting. :)
B003CUXV0Q|5|We had so many issues with our active toddler not being able to sleep in his pack-n-play. We figured it was because he was uncomfortable. Turns out we were right! This hags really done the trick and is a great price for a sound night's sleep.<br /><br />One thing we realized is that the mattress is slightly smaller than our pack-n-play floor, about 2&#34; lengthwise and 4&#34; depth. We were afraid that would be a problem, but we were able to remedy the issue by taking an extra blanket and stuffing it around the perimeter of the mattress between the mattress and the sides of the pack-n-play so the surface is level and the mattress doesn't shift around. That has also worked perfectly for us thus far.
B002LNSCXG|5|cute!
B002USCIR8|4|I was wanting something that would fit with my inglesina chair that &#34;clips&#34; on to our table. It works perfect. The little crumb tray is the best. That is actually the reason I bought this because my daughter likes to push food off the table. I will say that the suction cups only work on very smooth surfaces like a countertop...doesnt even suction to our wood table.
B003ZY2Q0U|3|It's a pretty set but as others have stated the fabric is very rough.  It's probably the roughest bedding fabric I've ever felt.  I'm returning it.
B00856QSL6|3|These don't work with my Kiinde adapters.  Something about the angle makes it so when you put the adapter on it pulls the membrane back.  This occasionally happens with my Medela valves, but always happens with these.  If I wasn't using the adapters I think they would be fine, although the membrane is thinner.
B004G8QJ8Y|5|This thing is AMAZING!!!!!!! I bought this instead of a high chair. And we are soooo happy we did!! We love it and I would recommend it to ANYONE who needs a booster/high chair for their baby!!! Save your money and buy one of these!!! :)
B000J1OOJI|5|Got this for my parrot.  She enjoys chewing on the different textures of beads.
B000EMRK5W|5|Love ho easily this bib washes up, worth every penny!
B007VBXKFS|5|I looked everywhere and was so happy to finally find glass bottles with the natural shaped nipple. After using these for almost a year I can say they hold up great and I much prefer to have my little one drinking out of glass than plastic. One thing I did notice was that the travel heating gel packs really don't work on them. I'm guessing because the glass is thicker than plastic.
B0078MQEEO|4|I bought this as a barrier to break up my large backyard.  It easily slides into the ground and my twin two year olds are contained in a safe designated play area.  It is flimsy if not pulled tightly on both ends when set up.  It works great for the purpose I bought it for.  It would serve as a visual barrier and stop balls and other objects from going into the street if used as a driveway barrier.
B004JU0H5U|4|My daughter loves it, except there is a gap between the side and this mattress. I have a graco pack and play.
B003YC0W86|5|My husband and I had an audio monitor only the first four months of our son's life. Every time at night when our son would wake up crying for a few minutes, I felt like I needed to go into his room to &#34;see&#34; that he was actually okay, not stuck or something. When we visited my family I noticed my brother had this specific monitor for his baby, and immediately I knew that if I could &#34;see&#34; our son on a monitor when he cried I wouldn't feel as much of a need to go into his room to check on him, further awakening him. Since we've had this monitor, everyone in the house has been more relaxed and able to sleep at least a little more soundly. I appreciate that the battery can last for 4 hours and the picture is very clear.
B0097GUCZ6|3|Very tricky to wear it, the strips are kind of funny and probably not required, I would not purchase it if required again..... The zipper is odd looking and wrongly positioned.. Does not open or close properly... The only positive feature is the texture of the material which is very soft and the modesty it provides while pumping...
B003YC0W8G|1|Worked fine for the first 2 years with only rare use (once/month or so). Then the interface on the receiver just died and we are 1 month out of the 24 month warranty. :( That was an expensive investment.
B00318CKMY|5|I am so glad I bought this car seat for my 7 yr old grandson. It is soft and cushy and has a very thick raised seat.<br />My grandson likes it because he says he \\"does not have to be embarrassed when he rides in my car.\\" That is good enough for me.<br />Grandma of two.
B000GX0B3M|5|I gave the Wheely Bug SMALL to my daughter on her first birthday (she's a decent walker at this point) and she loved it and knew just what to do with it from the first moment.  She's still needs close supervision while riding it, but she'll be proficient on it quickly.  It is the perfect size for her at this age.  Her 3.5 year old sister also like to ride on it too. It's great on hard wood floors.    I like that it can move laterally and turn easily unlike other ride on toys.  i have no doubt will be popular in our house for a long while.
B00005BX8C|5|When my baby first started eating solid foods, we had the wonderful task of selecting her first spoons.   Although I initially leaned toward Gerber because of the brand name, I am glad I made the right choice by selecting the Sassy spoons.  Two reasons I selected Sassy over the other spoons, including Gerber, first, the spoon changes to white if the food is too hot.  Although I test the food myself when I warm it up, this feature provides additional reassurance.  Second and most importantly, the length of the handle was longer than the other 6+ months spoons.  The spoon's handle is relatively long (i.e. built for adult hands and not baby hands).  I have large hands and I wanted to be able to feed our baby as well.  I did not feel that I could manage to securely grasp the handle of the other spoons.  My concerns were confirmed when I had to use my nephew's Gerber spoon and it was uncomfortable to hold.  I could only secure it with my first three fingers and my hands cramped while feeding the baby.  Parents, if your baby is still too young to feed him/herself, I would highly, highly recommend this product.  It will be a much more comfortable and enjoyable experience for you.      I have washed this product in my dishwasher for 4 months now and no problems and I still love it.    By the way, my wife's hands are small and she prefers this spoon over Gerber as well.  It is just built for adults.  I disagree with the other poster who felt the spoon was too large, or maybe my baby just loves to eat :)     And that is the word of D-Critique!
B0002XO5LK|3|We bought this product to use in lieu of the stroller. But getting our son in the thing was so hard, we used it only once. So although the price was less expensive than some of the others, it really was a waste of money.
B004X0WBNC|5|This little pig is so cute and my baby girl loves it. We giggles everytime she see it. Thank You!
B00KM8YI4Y|4|Wish there were more colors.  Didn't really like any of the colors.
B00EL3P92Q|4|I like the fabric, color, and pattern, but hadn't thought about how to attach it to anything. It is currently sitting on top of my son's dresser because I can't think of anywhere else to put it.
B003KTLYHQ|5|A must when going on walks of any significant length.  It is nice to be able to take drinks/bottles/sippy cups on walk.  Also very nice to be able to bring snacks and or a cell phone.
B00GEF7CII|5|My great granddaughter loved it.
B003TPXI3O|2|They are really small and loose their stickiness.
B005XRVJP0|5|it very cute and soft!!! but the label on the blanket says to not put it in the dryer, and I did...so now it's not as soft as before, but I still love this blanket!! people always tell me how cute the blanket is.
B00IE4B4MM|5|Great sturdy stroller that closes easily. Highly recommend it for travel.
B0006NM08Q|5|i like this car seat. it is very soft for a baby
B0013A1KM8|4|It fits my Zooper Tango well and it helps organize our items. We don't use it as much as we thought because the basket for the Zooper is so big, but for strollers that have a smaller basket, this will be a helpful tool.
B001IANA2Q|4|I used this for 6 months without a problem or leak and then passed it on to my sister and her new baby. I really liked it. I love the color and the velcro is easy to use and fast for middle of the night changes.
B003AJHDR6|5|As a cloth diapering mom, I can see that these are the only cloth diapers you will be able to find of this quality at this price.  They are the only ones that I am willing to use on this little one and have been washed countless times with no issues.  I expect them to last him right through potty-training.  Osocozy is the best!
B0000789TD|5|Tried others.  Worked for my first and now working like a charm for my 2nd.  This one keeps my little one's interest the most.  The remote control is one of my favorite features.
B0050FP1AO|5|My daughter picked this out for our new baby. It is very soft and very well made. It does only have one fabric unlike a lot I have seen but it is still soft and has a cute little animal.
B00KWR2BCQ|5|This is a great pillow.  I know it is designed for a child but it works great for me as well.  It is a wonderful fluffy pillow and it provides me with the comfort I need to give me a good nights sleep.  Wish the pillow had been available when our children were small.
B009EDSWJA|4|I wish there was a more adherent bottom to this product in order to better secure it to the surface it is sitting on.
B004GJXM4C|5|This was a gift for my new grandbaby... It dressed up the nursery wonderfully. My granddaughter and her husband loved it.
B00JRYSDDG|5|My wife and I were looking for a great infant car seat when we found this one.  It was a great price and quickly shipped in great packaging.  We will have a new baby in about 2 weeks so we will be all set for the new addition to our family.
B00A7DVOO6|5|Baby loves it!
B001MS82HM|3|I bought this pump because my Medela PISA broke after three years, I am 3 mos away from weening and we don't plan to have anymore children so I didn't want to spend the money on getting a new Medela.  This one will suffice for the next few months but I so miss my medela.  The 8 different setting only adjust the suction, not the speed and the speed is really slow so I have to pump an extra 5 minutes to empty my breasts and keep my supply up.  This wouldn't be that big a deal but the sort of gel-like breast shields are not as comfortable as the smooth plastic breast shields of the Medela.  Also, conveniently enough for \\"The First Years\\" the only bottle on the market that is compatible with this pump is make by The First Years' relatively expensive bottles.  I had found three separate brands of bottles that were compatible with the Medela, which was very convenient as my kids got up to into the 8 oz range.  I'm basically doing a pump and transfer deal now still using those old bottles, but it's not terribly convenient and I hate it when companies basically force you into a situation where you have to use every single one of their products if you're going to use even one.<br /><br />I will say that this was the cheapest pump on the market and I guess I should be thrilled it even works.  It is a good \\"replacement pump.\\"  If I were a first time mom looking at having a few kids and needed a really nice pump, I would still get the Medela PISA. You just can't beat it. It works so well.  Or it did until it broke.  :*(<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Okay, I changed my mind.  This pump is awful.  The way it's designed, there is no way to keep condensation out of the suction tubing and once that condensation gets into the actual motor, the suction goes all to hell.  Since I wrote the above review, I have had one side of this pump completely quit on me, as in, there is zero suction.  The other side is just barely holding up and I have to have the thing on the top setting to make itwork.  I am going to start weening in 1 month, but I'm nervous that my supply won't even hold up for that long.  I'm already seeing it tank.  This is really just an all around awful product.  Get something else.
B0045Y150G|5|Beautiful toy box. Perfect for my daughters nursery. The chenille fabric is more of an ivory color than bright white which is exactly what I was looking for with her pink and cream nursery. High quality, very pleased.
B008PPQ7GI|5|Simple yet fun and full of entertainment.
B00D45PGHA|3|cup is made well, only gave it 3 stars because my 6 month old daughter didn't love it. the spout is flat which may be part of the reason? seems to work good, but she just doesn't seem to get the hang of that flat spout. (she's exclusively breast fed) doesn't leak which is nice. we might try it in a few months after she gets the hang of a sippy cup...
B0009N4DSS|3|I find this towel to be a little rough but it does do a good job at absorbing the water and getting my baby dry quickly after her bath.
B004V9JT7Q|3|The bottle is not very sturdy and if your kid bites on the straw like mine, there are chances of small rubber/plastic straw pieces breaking off...
B00881G368|4|Awesome, but wish it lasted longer.
B000UYFULU|5|I'm writing this while wearing my baby with Baby K'tan :) Thanks to this invention, I am able to wear my baby quickly.  So far I have used it 5 times and could wear it in 1 2 3!  My LO is 1 and half months, I am 5'4&#34; and 120 lbs.  I should have gone with XS but S is just fine for me. My son loves it even though he kind of resisting when I first put him into it, after a few rocking and walking, he already sleeps in it.<br /><br />This extremely helps when I go shopping for grocery. I had tried putting the car seat in shopping cart but it took up lots of space and no space left for stuffs.  Highly recommend it for new moms like me.
B004YQVI7A|5|This bag is just the right size, has plenty of pockets, and has an insulated pocket for bottles. The best part is the price! It has everything you need and doesn't cost a fortune like so many diaper bags these days. Plus dad won't be embarrassed carrying it. A really great buy!
B000XMHTJK|4|Simple but effective. Pack does NOT include 2, so you have to order 2 of them to shut a typical closet door (unless you have a hall closet that has only 1 bifold door).
B003OUWIIU|4|We bought this seat when my son was 7 months old. I love the fabric and its cushion is great, he's comfortable in the seat and has plenty of room even at 18 months, 27 lbs and still rear facing. It is on the large size and a little tricky to get \\"just right\\" in our hatch back. Although the tether is kind of a pain sometimes, it makes the seat so secure and I know he's safe. I'm looking at buying another car seat for baby #2 and am considering skipping the infant carrier and going with another Britax Roundabout. Love it.
B007DYMME8|5|My 6 month old son loves this teether. He always love playing with my phone and since I don't want it completely ruined so I bought him this instead. It has become one of his favorite teethers. It is well built and very durable. The backside is textured so he is able to feel and chew on different surfaces.
B00012FGA6|5|I purchased this pet net when I first purchased my home about 6 months ago. I figured that with all the stuffed animals my children have, it would be nice to have a place to put them all! I hung it up in my play room and hung quite a few stuffed animals in there and with my children putting more in and taking them out, it has stayed right where I hung it! I would definitely recommend anyone with lots of stuffed toys hanging around, to purchase this if you want to keep them together!
B00IUKPYO4|5|A great bag!! Holds a lot, but not obnoxious in size.  Very affordable! I'll probably by another next season, just for fun.
B0035JL93K|5|These pants work well for my daughter's swim class.  They hold up very nicely.
B005178CJI|4|This mobile is very cute.  It plays the typical mobile songs.  The hot air balloons are a little wonky, though - just basically puff balls.  I don't know how if fix them, but for $40+ they should be a little more professionally made looking.
B00FOL7RWY|5|Love the sturdyness of the play pin it is the same size as the graco pack n play. Reccommend buying a mattress for it. Not comfortable. Without it at all comes with the thin mat like other pack nplays
B005KWL0OI|2|Our LO doesnt seem to like using this, I think because the silicone part is too tough.  He can hold it well but doesnt like chewing on it.
B003I867US|5|if you have a baby like mine and he will not sit still in his carrier, this is a must have. we used to rush trough the supermarket before my baby started crying to get out. and having a bad back carrying him will leave me with back pain. now he sits in this (backpack) and he can look everything. i have a hernia and this will not give me any pain because i can stand up straight and carry my baby. and for the price it can not be beaten. very good quality also. highly recommended.
B006NWMNT0|5|I have a 13 month old that is already 32 inches tall and weighs right at 30 lbs. I planned on extended rear facing until he was at least 3 years old, if not longer depending on how the limits of his car seat. If he continued to grow at the rate he was and followed in his daddy's footprints with growth, he would have probably outgrown his cosco convertible by 2. I went on a mission to find the highest rated erf car seat. I chose the Foonf, because of the high ratings on weight and height. I wasn't too excited with the price, but because it out rated other seats by 5 lbs, it seemed like the most logical choice. When I received it, I was afraid that it would be too high in my 2005 chevy malibu, but it fit just fine. I'm only 5'2 and can still see out the back window without any problems. It took some adjusting for my son to get used to how high up it sat, but he has no problems using it now. When you receive it, if you need to install the rebound bar, definitely have someone strong help install it. I couldn't get enough weight behind it to get it to click, but my husband installed it without any problems. I love the Foonf!
B002H9XHNO|5|I have had this very board for two years now. It fits perfectly on my chicco stroller. I dont have to hunch over or push from the side. It is the greatest investment!!  I have used it around town, at Disneyworld, and Disneyland.  I love how smooth it glides and i have my child securely on the board so we can cruise through crowds.  I have recommended it to my family and friends, and they love theirs too!!  Better than a double stroller, by far!  In fact, i have used ot so much that i can tell you it is very durable, stills works great and looks like new!
B00UIDDOIO|5|So cute!!
B00UREP2PW|5|Love it! I can finally see my son clearly and he can see me and stop freaking out whenever we have somewhere to go.
B000BXHPEU|3|make sure to fold completely flat before putting your child down on it. the seat pinched my little guy. :(
B004CLD3TI|1|I bought this gate because of the all the features that Munchkin noted, but after attempting to put it together for hours I have given up.  It is an awful product.  Actually let me rephrase that, it's an awful product if you need the extenders.  They've pretty much welded the plastic pieces you need to remove with the screwdriver into the gate so that the extenders can't be used. Read other reviews, it's a common problem.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product.
B0042D69WO|5|Easy to build and take down to travel with.  The swing takes up some room but my son lives being in the swing.
B000AV5LZ8|5|good
B005Q3LSDO|5|Love, but too pricey.
B00CXH2M2W|5|Just as good as the brand name except cheaper. I will continue to buy.
B00JVOD6IO|5|Just what I wanted for a nursery gift I was working on!
B001PGKPNK|5|We love our halo sleep sacks!  We have two and they are perfect.  They allow our 6 month old to move around in her crib but we don't have to worry about blankets.  She sleeps very well in them.
B002MN3JY2|1|I tried it twice be gave up. I have sensitive skin and get rashes easily from plastic. End up getting the Lansinoh ultra soft pads.
B00GWOJXT2|5|Excelente
B00AH8J448|5|We find these more absorbent than the bleached cotton Alva baby inserts. They are a great value for the price, and I'd recommend them!
B006QXF2RG|5|These are so easy to use (since you don't have to fold the excess over and have to use any type of fastener).  They are amazing in quality and super absorbent!  I will definitely be getting more of these better fit prefold!<br />I highly recommend them!
B007ETJQI2|2|This toy seemed like a good distraction for my one year old, instead of her always trying to steal my tablet. But it was very disappointing. Only the top left picture lights up. So my daughter doesn't hider stand that the rest of the pictures are buttons too.  Good for about two minutes of fun.
B00GO75JAO|5|My little one loves to bite it and play with it. It keeps him entertained while feeding as well. It's easy to clean. I just rinse it with the rest of the pacifiers and bottles.
B00BH6NCCO|5|awesome decal went perfect in a corner small wall
B007VEBMBO|4|Works well for both nursing and bottle feeding as well as lounging<br />I feel its a little over priced though
B000V96W0W|4|I bought two of these gadgets. The first one, like the other reviewer's experience, had a mind of it's own. It worked fine at first. When I had to change the batteries out it didn't want to turn off unless I slid the battery door slightly off. The second one I bought worked fine. I really liked that it came with the mini formula dispenser.
B000VK2RGE|4|great
B004GJXM74|4|This product is a must have! I would say that I'm a semi-pro at swaddling with your regular 40x40 receiving blanket. I'll get the tight swaddle and my baby girl's arms and legs are locked in. I recently read that hip dysplasia can be caused by swaddling your baby's legs straight. So I found 'SwaddleMe'. It leaves the feet comfortable and keeps a tight lock on her arms. The material is light and breathable. This is a definite must if you have a newborn. This also helps with the tough or colicky babies.
B000XW65SG|5|Very easy to use, and clean.
B00I5X3QQO|5|This little tie really helped to make my son's first year birthday pictures special!  We also bought the matching shorts,
B000YDDF6O|5|I brought the take along tunes for my niece whom loves music. The tunes last long.
B009EDSWJA|5|Nice product, fits standard size changing tables, provides a good cushion for baby.  I also bought the soft fleece covers and am very satisfied with the purchase.
B007R56YEC|5|Love this turtle.  My son falls asleep to it for every nap and at bedtime.  Works like a charm.  The waves are really cool.  I would definitely recommend this.
B004TZY1BQ|5|Amazing. Exactly what I needed.
B003IGQ1XI|5|I love it but my daughter likes it...to be fair though, she doesn't love anything more than cuddling with her mommy and daddy.<br /><br />Very soft, beautiful print and she likes to play peekaboo with it.
B002CGRTFY|4|Very Good
B001MTELJY|4|This tub makes bathing an older baby much safer than a traditional bath tub.  It fits well inside a regular size bath tub.
B001CNOUV4|5|Awesome pocket kite for toddlers.
B001D2BJG8|4|I wanted a shopping cart cover that's not too bulky and not an obnoxious pattern like most of these are and after much searching and research, I found this one.  It's a great cover, nice and soft, without all the unnecessary padding and the pretty pink color is just right.  If fit the large warehouse store shopping carts and the smaller basic supermarket carts just fine.    It dose have a few flaws, though.  First, the velcro doesn't quite hold it in place very well.  Like most kids, my daughter moves around a lot, looking here, looking there, thus dislodging the velcro connectors, making the cover slip off in places.  I have to adjust it several times while we are in the store.  Second, the leg holes, don't cover too well and I have to check often, to make sure, that my daughter's legs aren't touching any part of the cart.    Also, one of our favorite stores redesigned, their shopping carts to a more roundish, cartoony style, thus the cover, being squarish, doesn't quite fit.   Lastly, since I've been letting my daughter walk on her own on occasion, she has been wearing shoes, rather than just socks, or footsy pants, so her shoes have been getting stuck in the leg openings of the shopping cart cover. Lately, I have been resorting to just using disinfecting wipes on shipping carts, rather than using the cover, cause it's such a hassle to put her in and out with her shoes always getting stuck.  I don't know if all covers have these same problems or not, but this one is still a good cover and a good idea that needs improving on.
B000EOMSBQ|4|I liked the Noodlehead neck pillow because it's a little less puffy.  Your child can adjust the pillow more easily.  Also easy to stuff in a carry-on.  We used this on long plane rides to CA and HI.  Good for cuddling; cushioning the arm of a chair in coach; and propping up a tablet as well.  If you're looking for a pillow that makes sleeping while sitting up comfortable, that will still elude you with Noodlehead.  Once your kid really conks out, his head will still be flopped forward as usual no matter what neck pillow you have.  However, I do recommend this for traveling.  We'll be taking it on more road trips and plane rides.  Easy to pack.  Lots of uses.  I recommend for ages 4 to 10.
B0007XTN5S|4|I purchased this product brand new at a consignment sale, because I could never find it online and being that it was always sold out I decided to wait. Finally someone had one! I can also say this. If you are breastfeeding this is the way to go. I was able to feed my almost 8 month old daughter in the hip hammock. She sat right there with my arm around her to steady her and just nursed. I strongly encourage more moms who are breastfeeder's to purchase this item and use it. No more having to stop your walk and feed baby. Just Pop out lunch and keep going. It's that simple. Love how it adjust as well. Lot's of strapping, but worth it depending on your build. Plus you are hands free and baby is to the side, so working on something is sooo much easier. I paid 8 bucks for this item, brand new! I urge everyone to look for this item and possibly others like it.
B002USCCVK|5|I purchased this lamp for my daughter for her first little boy's room.  It matched the \\"whale\\" theme of<br />the crib bedding.  It is well made and looks very expensive.  She loved it!
B00BH0P1E2|5|easy to use
B000MHIEYA|5|Used this to completely baby proof our living areas.  Super easy to install and seems to be doing the job.
B00008URU5|3|I did the researches and read reviews before I order this toilet. This looks like the best one available. Since it's not sold in stores, I could only ordered it from BabiesRus web site without seeing the actual item first.  <br /> <br />I was very excited when I ordered it, but then was extremely disappointed when I finally received it. The toilet I received looked like a very used item, lots of scratches on the seat cover, the seat itself as well as the water tank cover! It looked VERY worn! (not just \\"minor\\" scratches!)  <br /> <br />There was no plastic bags or any other protective material protecting the parts, very poor lose packaging (don't know if it's just the one I got or it's the same for everyone else). Even though, I still don't believe the scratches were just results from the delivery. The whole thing looked just like a cheap returned item! I couldn't believe this is the toilet that I paid $50 for. :-( <br /> <br />I didn't want to go through the hassles to return the toilet, so I still keep it. My 20 month-old son is not potty trained yet, so I really can't tell you how it works for my son. However, my son does love the flush sound. And the splash guard is a joke like many reviews already mentioned. <br /> <br />For the quality of the particular toilet I received, I think it's definately over priced.
B00EEHYID0|5|Great case
B00FSK1GHS|3|This stroller has its' pluses and minuses. We bought it as a travel stroller and have used it for a few months now.<br /><br />The main reason I gave it only 3 stars is the inadequate depth of the seat and the poor handlebad quality.<br /><br />Things we like about it:<br />- Nice for indoor use, smooth sidewalks, light travel (no terrain)<br />- Folds up small and light<br />- HUGE sun cannopy. The best cannopy I've seen on any stroller.<br />- Good size basket underneath with the zipper access.<br /><br />Things we don't  like about it:<br />- The main issue is the depth of the seat. It is too shallow. In other words, the part where  baby's butt is, needs to be longer, so that he is sitting on it with his entire upper leg down to the knee. As it is, my boy is only 1 year old, but the seat part is already too small. He ends up sliding forward and hanging in the harness by his crotch. That leaves room behin his back and makes him slouch. It looks very uncomfortable. It is better if you pull up the foot rest and slide back down a bit, but still. This is a major, major issue.<br />- The foot rest mechanics are a bit clunky. Once your baby is a bit bigger and loves undoing velcros, you bet he's going to be up there messing with it. And since the sliding forward issue is happening, legs hand over the top or down the sides the foot rest very often.<br />- The break doesn't always work smoothly and is hard to undo with open toed shoes. It will hurt your foot.<br />- The soft handlebar cover is basically breaking apart and is about to fall off after just a couple of months of use. Poor quality.<br />- This thing can't handle any type of softer soil. No amount of sand. It will go over light grass and sidewalks, but don't expect more.<br /><br />In short, this is probably an okay stroller for someone who will only use it to stroll around the mall. If you're about to take it out for long daily walks, look for something a bit more sturdy.
B000UUO7P4|4|Perfect brush for bottles - we used on Born Free and Dr. Browns and it works great on both. The sponge eventually gets worn and then needs to be tossed, so it didn't last as long as other bottle brushes without the sponge.
B004P1IVOW|1|Poor quality, after first wash it separated at the seams.  😢
B0016L0MMS|3|Great concept but it's too hard for me to set up when my 2 year old has to go.  Instead I got one of those cheap, small, 1 piece potties from Ikea for my car and will just dump that out instead of fumbling with this thing.
B001KYJZRE|5|This mattress was purchased to replace one in an heirloom family bassinet from the 60's. I ordered it Sunday and it arrived on Tuesday. This is especially amazing when factoring in that I live in Canada and did not pay for expedited shipping. It's amazing, perhaps not as 'oval' as the original mattress, but it fits just lovely. Great service and really nice product. :)
B0065ADP4C|3|Met a need but returned when another solution was found.
B00MRZIGWA|5|After trying several sippy cups along with the munchkin weighted cup I seriously thought my daughter just wasn't ready for a cup. She was only 6 months after all. I decided at my pediatricians recommendation to try this cup as a last resort. The very first time she easily figured out how to use it! I love that it is so easy to clean, just make sure you take off the rubber top and clean each use. I also love that it is recommended by dentists as it does not have the sippy tip and teaches them how to drink out of a cup. Use a bib the first few times as my daughter got it everywhere. Now, my 9 month old is off of bottles completely and only drinking her cup!
B004769M70|4|Super cute gift to give for a baby shower or for an expectant mother. With the thousands of choices out there for kids oral hygiene, this one makes it easy...super cute banana brush and decent tasting and effective gum and tooth gel. Just one thing bothers me...why isn't there a monkey on the tooth gel tube? What's up with that giraffe...okay I'm done. Overall a very good set!
B002NTOAZW|2|Crib is okay....I didnt realize just how SMALL it is....and it says comes with matress but its more like a mini pad on top of the board. I would definitely recommend getting another matress!!! (Which is what I was trying to avoid) I am concerned a bit for when the bed transitions to a day bed...its small. Its very cheap made but it will get the job done for the time being. Doesnt seem too durable.
B0077M41Z4|4|handy
B003D7E2XI|5|purchased this for my daughter-in-law, she loves it !!!  It is roomy enough that even their little dog can sleep in the corner .
B00E6QILBY|5|Love the convenience and washablility!
B0012OV1O2|1|It was just brought to my attention today that My Brest Friend nursing pillows contain TDCCP and TCCP, Chlorinated Tris, which has been determined in January 2012 to be CARCINOGENIC.  See for yourself with any internet search.  The Washington Toxics Coalition conducted the study and found that this fire retardant, which was banned from being used in children's pajamas years ago, is STILL being used in a number of baby/child products, including My Brest Friend.  I am returning this nursing pillow, which I had registered for, IMMEDIATELY.  FYI, Boppy pillows were tested and DO NOT contain these toxins.  I will be keeping my Boppy!    [...]
B00BKV0O68|2|We got this seat for my wife's car.  I have a Recaro ProRide in my car so my basis of comparison is between using these two seats.<br /><br />The side impact features are excellent.  The size, positions, and height is good.  The bolstering is enough but without being excessive like the Recaro.  The fabric is different than other brands, it cleans up well but in humid weather is is a bit weird feeling to me (clammy).  The integrated cup holder is much better than the add-on one that Recaro has.<br /><br />My only gripes are with the harness system, which is sort of the \\"soul\\" of a child seat.  The push button buckle is way harder to push than it needs to be.  It just about cramps the heck out of my thumb everytime I use it.  This button has loosened up a little over time but it still operates no where near as good as any buckle ought to.  It is also difficult to pull slack in the shoulder belts, almost like it is caught on something**.  The release buckle is pressed all the way but there is still something adding resistance.  The little shoulder belt pads are nice but if they slip out of the way, expect the belts to rub against your kids' neck.  The Recaro \\"hero\\" feature is hands down the better feature to avoid belt rub.<br />All in all my wife likes this seat and I still feel it is an OK value.  Hands down the Recaro has Maxi-Cosi whipped in some specific features.  The Maxi-Cosi is good in all of the important features.  The only great thing it has is the cup holder.<br /><br />Made in China<br /><br />**Update: This harness binding keeps getting worse over time.  The harness is tough to release and tighten.  I took out the seat to inspect what the heck is going on.  The split buckle back there is rubbing against the back of the seat causing resistance (seat is not really smooth).  The worst part is a tab that holds the tether buckle to the seat, it sticks out quite a bit and hangs up on the harness buckle as it drags over the tab.  This should not operate in this manner, poor design.  Also this fabric shows stains pretty badly.  I have not tried pulling the cover off to wash it yet.  My past experiences never result in a re-installed cover fitting as it did.  One star removed.  In comparison, the Recaro operates perfectly and still looks new.  So I replaced this one with my Recaro since I have to move into Radians for my car now.manner, poor design.  Also this fabric shows stains pretty badly.

B001KZH692|5|These are so soft, wash well and have a generous fit. Price was good. I had trouble finding Pack N Play sheets in local stores.
B000T0JOX0|5|My grandson absolutely LOVES these and enjoys meals now.  He is 3.  His uncle, my son, loved them, too, so I got him his own set.  He is 30.  They shared a fun, silly meal together....
B00DQL6CIE|5|very economical
B004SRE1VK|4|This is a great little blanket but I got it at Kmart for $20!!!!!  Don't pay this ridiculous amount!!  Its really soft & plush & would be great for a pooh room or playroom.
B004IOHN8Q|5|Love these pacifiers! Easy to clean. Good quality.
B000YOUIN6|4|I love this product. They are very easy to use and maintain. Unlike disposble pads they don't bunch or move. They are great for wearing under clothes not only to prevent leaks but also to keep nipples from showing through, which has been a much larger problem since I started nursing. Due to some unforeseen family stress my supply has decreased so I haven't really had any issues with leaking so I can't honestly say how good they work for that, which is why I only rated four stars. I didn't feel I could give 5 when I couldn't truly say they stop leaks. I can say that when the baby is nursing on one breast I don't have problems with the other leaking when using the LilyPadz like I did in the past without them. Overall I would say the product is great and I would recommend them to any nursing mom.
B000IDSLOG|2|The squeeze sound are way too loud which scared my son a couple time. Maybe it will work fine outdoor, but my son did not really like it.
B000LPURQG|5|Ordered for my niece as she was transitioning from breast feeding to bottle feeding. She had an easier time bottle feeding with theses nipples. We tried other nipples but the flow was never quite right.
B000H8ESQC|5|My seven month old grandson loves this toy. It is soft and colorful. His little hands can grasp it easily and he loves the rattle effect. Highly recommend.
B0033OG86K|5|great for the beach or grass! waterproof and easy to wipe clean (I haven't tried to wash it yet)
B0010SGZEG|5|These squirt toys are great.  We first saw them at swim class and my daughter liked them so much we had to buy some for at home.  We keep 5 in the tub and the other 5 out in the toy chest.  She loves them, and they make really great teethers (my daughter is 8 months now)!!
B000FFL58Q|5|My child loves this item. The lights and the animals make her smile and wiggle. There is so much for her to touch and play with. Also washes very easily for those little spit-up problems. This item replaces another baby gym by Infantino that bored my child after turning 2 months. She is now 5 months and still loving this item after several weeks of play.
B00OQT150K|3|Super handy! Way more useful than the holder that came with the stroller (that was about an inch deep) The only thing I would change about this caddy are the velcro straps. I'm always worried that if I put too many things in the caddy or something that might be too heavy, it's going to come undone...
B001151C1Y|5|I bought this three years ago for my new granddaugher.  She has used it right up to potty training and it has stood the test of time.  Great product.
B000G82EVO|3|This is a very nice diaper bag.  The fabric is pretty and already 'stain resistant' treated, which is nice because it is a lighter color fabric.  Inside is brown color with two pockets in front and back so four total. Front of diaper bag has a changing pad that can be removed if you don't want or need it along with two pockets.  Also has a side deep pocket perfect for a sippy cup or bottle.  The wide strap is comfortably worn on the shoulder or as messenger style.  Fits over stroller handles nicely on my Graco.  The reviewer before me mentioned the zipper zips all the way undone on top and that's true but can be prevented if not unzipped completely.  I paid ~$61 and wouldn't have paid full price for it and I'm a diaper bag fanatic.  It's pretty and functional but it isn't anything I would spend ~$130 on.  Favorite feature: wide strap.
B007CTPWYQ|5|The stroller state as used, but it does look and feel brand new to me. It's working perfectly as new without any issue. Great product and design. a bit heavy, but well built.
B007NG5UF4|5|Crystal clear sound. Love the talk back feature
B001QNE222|4|The picture frames are adorable gifts to grandparents or Mother/Father's day. I got one for my older daughter when she was 3 (who is now 8), and now got one for my younger 3 year old daughter. I also mailed one each to the grandparents.     It's pretty flimsy, but definitely a keeper. One of those mementos we'd like to grow old with. My older daughter's frame is fading slightly and the frame support keeps falling off, if they get that sorted out I would highly recommend this product.     But for a novelty item, the design more than makes up for our disappointments.
B00B3G8UGQ|1|I heard a new-improved version is in  development; 3-in-1 iPotty with iRhoid removal app. It comes with a surgical activity set with step by stem 'user' instructions presented by Barney in a singalong format. Singing is encouraged since anesthesia is not included. (As a hands-off, absent-parent-training-tool anesthetizing a child requires mandatory supervision.)
B00005BX8Z|5|I did not want a mobile, but received this as a gift.  My 2 month old daughter absolutely LOVES this mobile.  She is mesmorized by it and loves watching the little animals move around.  The sound is great.  I love that you can choose whether you want to listen to Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven.  It's not too stimulating.  It's the perfect thing to occupy her while I take a shower.  She giggled for the first time while watching this mobile!  I recommend it to all my friends!
B006P3BCDA|5|This product is so useful. Very helpful and a cheap fix! First off, we have one of those sinks that are short necks so the water only runs to the back of our bathroom sink, so when we wash our hands we often rub against the sink. My husband cannot stand this. We looked into buying a new faucet but right now, we just cannot do that. Second, my little toddler even with the tall stool we bought for her, still cannot reach the water due to the problem of how it comes out. This extender not only helps her be able to reach the water, it also makes my husband happy that he doesn't accidentally rub against the sink anymore when washing his hands.
B00F667QNC|5|Arrived promptly and the color was spot on.  Used this on my 2 1/2 year old.  I've never used a small potty on any of my other 2 children, but I knew this would work for my baby.  I WAS RIGHT!!  He took to it and even insists on emptying out. Had immediate success.  Within a few days I ordered another for Grandma's house. She's surprised how well it's working out. Great buy for the price.
B0070WGV9K|3|While I do like the silent operation to fold the rail up and down, it's too tall.  It would have been perfect it I could undo it and fold it down and it cleared the floor by 1/2 inch.  As it is now, it hits the floor before it's perpendicular making it into sort of a slide - which my 2yo enjoys immensely, but which makes it exceedingly difficult for me to get in and out of the bed if I am lying next to him.
B000CSBOBO|5|Great Potty Seat, and great price, easily adjusts to fit different size seats, made potty traing so much easier! Definately a great buy!
B00AIC291I|3|My husband and I just began assembling our nursery furniture and organizing in preparation of the arrival of our twins this summer and noticed that upon opening the box, the lamp shade is missing green stitching at the top portion of the shade, making the small piece of accent fabric very loose in sections.  Almost like a vintage look, but this is clearly not a vintage lamp shade -- especially since it does not appear the same on the bottom part of the shade.  A little disappointing given the $50 price tag.  Would've expected a higher quality product for the price.
B007SIZS18|3|I recently added this bottle into my child's rotation and found it no different from his more traditional glass bottles in terms of flow, leakage, or grip. I have nothing bad to say about this product, and Similac is a trusted name, but I see no reason to praise the Simply Smart more highly than any other name-brand bottles. Three stars.
B00AJFHG8A|5|I was so excited when I saw these great pouches.  We love to travel and go hiking and I always hate taking a spoon and store bought baby food.  This is a great on the go and at home way of having baby food ready to go and freshly made from home!  Even my toddler likes to use them.<br />The zipper pouch has worked great for me.  NO leaks or spills.
B002LZEJ9A|5|These are great bowls for feeding an infant for the first time. They are good for hot/cold food and you don't need to worry if the baby grabs the bowl and tosses it-it won't break! Good quality after tons of washings.
B001L61286|5|Easily sticks onto our tile walls around the bath tub. We put this on a flat wall initially but discovered that by putting it on a corner, it would stay partially open allowing our 15 month oldtpo take out the toys and put them away all by himself. The suction cups occasionally pop off the walls but I expected that to happen.
B000CNOIQ2|5|Great Baby gift
B00CXNUOE4|5|I love this chair it is super comfortable.
B00M1QM8N8|4|Love this in that it gives the arm coverage But I agree with other reviewers, it's extremely thin. It'll be perfect for warmer months.  I was going for something in between the fleece ones we use for winter but this is too thin without warmer pj's with it
B00B7M7CL0|5|Fits perfectly, keeps our daughter from touching the dirty chair itself. She sits comfortably and we don't have to worry about her picking up lots of germs from touching the chair.
B0072BEPXS|5|When i received my egg stacker toys they were just as shown and described in the listing. It comes with 8 pieces, and 4 eggs total that come apart and stack on top of each other. It was so much fun to watch my 1 year old niece (the toy is for ages 6months+) learn and figure out how to take them apart and put them together and stack them on top of each other. This is a great toy for developing basic skills just as it says. She loves it and we now play with it everyday to increase her skills. The plastic is very durable for a young child to be throwing around and playing with. I give this product 5 stars and i will be ordering from this company again.
B001QBUUKW|1|Broken upon receipt. Not worth the hassle of returning when I only paid $2. Very sad and disappointed when I received the spoon. Very cute, nice size, worthless because it was broken when I opened it. :(
B003KMWATY|4|Does the job. It's very soft and very comfortable for my baby. Will need to upgrade to a large size soon since it seems to be too slow now for my 5 month old.
B001ULCJFM|5|They work well and are easy to open, close and clean.
B00821FLTY|5|It looks good, is easy to use, doesn't require special bags, & doesn't stink! Amazing. I've actually had friends take pictures of it to tell friends or as a reminder to get it for themselves!
B006950BCC|2|The picture makes this item look much nicer than it actually is. It's not anywhere near the quality of store-bought wall decals. I'm a little hesitant to try moving it since it's not the quality I expected. The no returns or exchanges Should've been a red flag.
B0035ER58I|3|Not sure how much of a difference these really make, but thought I would try them anyways.
B00171WXII|5|The only reason why I'm ordering this again for my 10 month old is because I seemed to misplace the one I had from my baby shower.. I absolutely love it.. It works, it works , it works!!!! I would highly recommend this to other parents.. This is the best one ever!!!
B004FKPZBA|4|I have been using them for about 8 months. I fold the insert and place it in the middle of cover. They are good but I think they are kind of bulky. So I use them only night time mostly. They are stronger than I thought. The snaps are strong and useful for adjusting size. The legs aren't tight but work fine.
B000VVIHPS|4|I probably should have read reviews first, but the directions are really hard to figure out and small.  But, product works well and does what it says it would.  I'd still recommend it to others.
B000VXQ6NG|3|Perfect size and color to stick up top the fridge to keep everything up there neat and out of sight. Nice shape. Like the wicker weave BUT it is cheaply made. It is brittle and easy to snap off pieces.  Would never call it sturdy. need two. Will buy another hoping it is better.
B00JBD3NOM|4|So my daughter has really bad dry skin and scratches herself constantly.  So we have tried several different mittens to help her not scratch so much.  These are the first ones that she cannot pull off her hands.  All of the others she would have them off her hands in about 5 minutes.
B002HORHFS|4|I bought this valance (black/white) for my kitchen and it adds a nice retro touch.  It's a little longer than I would have wished (kitchen window is fairly short), but I just slightly gathered it up in 3 places with some coordinating ribbon.  Very happy with the purchase.
B002OOWAC6|5|This swing is a life saver!!! My two month old is very active and while awake stays pretty content in it. She gets entertained by the light and butterflies above her head she tries to reach. She even sleeps in it. It's great. I wouldn't go without it and worth every penny!
B0055V0VGM|5|Great to have. My baby likes to chew on this and saves my carrier from him chewing on it and getting it dirty. Easy to just throw in the wash.
B00PF8A6Q0|5|its ok
B00009VE20|4|We received the Kolcraft as a gift and love it.  I have used it probably 50 times in the last 13 weeks and have never had a problem with it.  Although we love our Quattro tour stroller it does not fit in our trunk when we need to also transport my mother's wheelchair.  The kolcraft is light and very compact. <BR>We have the Graco snug ride and it does not wobble at all when we place it in the Kolcraft.  We love this product.
B007A3GU72|5|Best back pack diaper bag on the market!! After purchasing 4 other diaper bags first, we finally found this. It holds everything we need for our 2 younge boys. A must buy!!!
B0051SWTF0|4|I am giving this a 4 star for two reasons:<br /><br />1. My toddler doesn't like to stand in a &#34;cage.&#34;<br />2. The construction isn't up to par in terms of steady wood. I constructed it and put it next to the cooking island in the kitchen but had to keep looking to see my toddler was okay. It just seemed too flimsy.
B000HK6BCE|4|These rails were solid and good to look at when assembled.  They also do slide  under the mattress without removal when it's time to change the sheets which is very convenient.    The assembly instructions could be a little clearer. Assembly time was approx. 20-30 min.  And the rails are not as effective (if you have an active sleeper) when your upper mattress is a deep one.  In our case, the rails only projected about 5\\" above the mattress surface, which was fine for our 3 year-old, but might not be sufficient for a younger child.
B002UD6C16|5|This stuff smells amazing, keeps my sons bottom clean and soft, and clears up any redness faster than anything else I've tried.
B00HURFECK|4|This is a great monitor but it does interfere with my wifi so we can't use anything that needs wifi in our house when its on.
B0081ZOWC8|4|Love these pacifiers!
B001RQGAQY|2|Not sure how to get this looking the way it does in the photo. It sits under the crib mattress - so it crinkles when you put the mattres on. I havent been able to get it to look neat and tidy. It's still better than the frilly ones I guess.
B0011URFRE|5|My wife ordered this and it's not rear facing so we can't use it yet. I gave it 5 stars for price, looks, and it feels like its very well made.
B007UOYUF0|5|These bibs are great! I was using cloth bibs and having to wash them after each messy meal. These are perfect to rinse out and hang dry. My kiddo loves to dig the fallen food out of the catch pocket. Cute designs too!
B00381744S|5|Fits perfectly on our Mcclaren stroller... happy with the purchase, except we didn't know the stroller came with a free rain cover!  Regardless, now we have a spare!
B001GIOPH4|3|I ordered it because it's suppose to be No. 1 popular etc. But after working with my lactation consultant after birth, I find a simple thick pillow works much better than this one.
B00C18NV8C|3|This came with scratches and imperfections.  I am somewhat disappointed.
B0006BAJO0|5|good
B0080G4T8U|1|We purchased this product and it only worked for 1.5 years then the charging port stopped working.  I contacted Snuza customer service several times with no reply which was very disappointing.  The monitor made a loud clicking noise to turn off and on the sound so many times we kept it off in the night. The video screen was okay, but it was hard to mount.  Often times we would push the button to turn on the video screen and it would trigger the music feature to start playing and that would wake up the baby and be frustrating. Overall, we didn't like this product because we didn't find it to be reliable.
B007D1O4CO|3|Gift for my son for Christmas - concept is great and I'm lucky he uses them outside of bathtime, but they do not stick for any extended period of time in the tub. Might be my tub but we have no issues with other bathtoys. My kids also play with them on the tile on the bathroom walls. Cute toy, colors are great, just don't understand the suction issue.
B001LNOYRK|1|The small says \\"fits 7-14lbs\\". So if you have a baby smaller than that you won't be able to use these. My twins were both less than 6lbs when they came home from the hospital so we used a blanket to swaddle them just like the hospital had done. No matter how small your baby is you can swaddle them with a blanket. Even when my girls were bigger and in the 7-14lb range, these still did not fit correctly. They were never snug enough so my girls were able to get their arms free and never stayed asleep since they weren't snug. Plus my smaller of the two was able to wiggle down so that her face was under the fabric(not safe) and the other became able to always kick the bottom so the velcro would come undone.<br /><br />If you want to swaddle your baby I recommend using baby blankets, a nice, large square one works best but I used just about any size or shape. You can get them nice and snug no matter how small or big your baby is. We leanred a way to swaddle our girls even better than the hospital did and it worked Wonderfully, plus we learned lots of other ways to soothe our girls, get the DVD \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" our girls were so much happier after that.<br /><br />I never thought it took any longer to swaddle my girls in a blanket than it did in these. Once you know how to swaddle a baby in a blanket it is second nature.
B002QYW8LW|5|My baby loves this!  Feels great on her teething gums.  Thank you!
B008VPA76I|5|I thought I would receive something much lower in quality considering what I paid for this item. I am pleased to say that is not the case. The sheets are soft and the comforter is fluffy and a really good size for a toddler set. My only complaint is that the pillowcase is very thin and I feel it will wear quickly. Will edit my review if that happens.
B000PRUAFI|5|Gate is simple and shuts itself. Quality of build is ok.
B0050O92GY|4|Great product. Perfect for school lunches!
B00365E5IY|5|Best formula travel dispenser. I tried a few before and trashed them pretty quickly. This one is easy to open, easy to clean, and easy to dispense without making a mess at all.
B003B09V2Y|4|I like these bottles because they are nice and simple. I don't understand why I would need all those other fancy bottles. These work just fine.
B000GEFG7W|3|I will start by saying I used to love this highchair. This was before my son was so active (now 8mos) and before he was having so many solid food meals. Now my opinions of this chair have gone severly down hill.     This chair is impossible to keep clean for the average mom. The dishwashable tray does not fit into the dishwasher (I have the dishwasher that they show the tray fitting into in there advertisements) the tray will not even fit into the dishwasher with nothing else in there, no baskets nothing. The base tray which would not be dishwasher safe even if it would fit has a seam all the way around it, which can only be cleaned with a toothpick, gets food in it at every meal and if your child is teething they will chew on the tray so this must be cleaned after or before every meal.     My newest problem with this chair is that my son will not let me put the tray on once he is in the seat (it only slides on from the front so there is always at least one foot pushing against it) but I guess this is a good thing since it means I no longer have to clean the trays. : )    As for the harness that I have never have had a problem with (I saw some one else complaining that it was too difficult, I think it is just fine. but I also have the Chicco stroller and car seat so maybe I just got used to them quicker)    Oh and back to cleaning the seat cover of this chair is not meant to go in the washing machine so clean it right when the food gets on before it gets dried on. (I have a front loader washer and I have put it in on a quick rinse and spin it comes clean and still seems fine but who knows what i am doing to the insides that are not designed to be soaked?? Its just so much quicker then spot cleaning)    Also the unit folds real easy but does not stand well when folded. When folded the unit does stand, but tips easily so only safe in area in between two items of furniture or walls.    Positives :  1 Before my son was using it to eat, it was a great ride for him because it was easy to wheel. Kept him calm at our meal times.  2 Tray stores on the back of the legs.  3 Latches are easy to get child in and out but not easy for child to open. The difficult portion of the latch is only there to remove the cover.  4 If you care, it is a lot more attractive then most childrens items. Blends well with house depending on the pattern you choose.    I will guess this chair may be right for some people but it turns out it is not right for us, so I am looking to find a new one (I really hate to spend the money but I just don't think I can make it much longer with this one) In hindsight I should have payed more attention to the reviews I read before I chose this one most of the negatives were correct. : (    This is my revised review so it would not let me change the star rating I would not give this product more then 2 stars at this time.
B00B3GHXG4|5|Just got today & already used for the first time ... Time will tell but, I think it will work out great. My baby boy is 5 months old & is a chunk! He's about 18 pounds & around 26&#34; long .... He's outgrown my other bathtub options! Saw great reviews on this & snatched it up. He loved his bath tonight and even though his whole body doesn't fit on the cushin, his head & bottom do ... His legs hang off which allow him to stay warmer in the water & let's him kick/splash & play! He loved it and was laughing and playing :)
B006P3HP9A|2|Didn't work for line drying,  if u have dryer then these might b gd, we ended up using prefolds as inserts. .
B002MN3JY2|5|Easy to wash and so much softer than reusable. I was gifted conventional cotton reusable pads as well, and was shocked at how abrasive they were. These were so much softer for such a delicate area! totally recommend!
B00006966I|3|I have mixed feelings about these bottles. After you figure out how to use them, they work fine, that is IF you figure out how to use them. The disc has to be in perfectly or they will leak everywhere. Also, I used them for about a month until ALL the numbers on them wore away from washing them. Other than that, they worked fine for the month or so that I used them.
B0000DEW8N|5|I love this. My 7 month old is huge and he fits in it fine. It allows him to sit at our bar-height table, the living room, and folds up to take where ever we need to go. Easy to clean and easy latches. Very flexible, fits most chairs with adjustable straps and could sit on own on the floor.
B00GU2WAIW|5|I searched for a simple and inexpensive way to store the stability balls we have in our home.  Pinterest had a picture of a stuffed animal hammock holding one.  I found this item on Amazon and very pleased with the quality of the item.  Its well made and very sturdy.  I may actually order one for my son's stuffed animals.
B001FGL9X0|4|My son was born on 3/1/14 & he love it. Help out all so he doesn't lose it. nice to have
B00ADHRZEY|4|We just bought this seat for our son, who just turned one and had just outgrown his infant seat. We actually got a Graco My Ride 65 for my car and were trying to find something a little less expensive for my husband's 4Runner. Honestly, I would have been fine with two of these. I think it's just as good - if not better - than the Graco. It was actually easier to set up and install. The fabric is a little rough but no big deal. You have to re thread the straps to adjust the height, like you do on any reasonably priced seat - no big deal. After reading reviews and then actually purchasing/using the seat, it seems like people must expect a top of the line, fancy schmancy product for $70... And that's just not reasonable. However, this seat is fine - easy to install, comfortable, easy to buckle, etc. It has an attachable cup holder too! I think it's a great buy if you don't want to spend $300 on a car seat.
B00F667QNC|5|Love the high back and front guard. It's perfect for my twin boys. Can't beat the price either.
B00SW71CXM|5|Well crafted.  Will be a keepsake.
B00KMP5HF6|5|The purse is absolutely awesome! It has enough space for a laptop, the cord, makeup bag, extra food. It is worth the money I paid for it.
B00BTWEUPE|1|I chose the blue bottles that had the monkeys on them but I received the ones with airplanes one them, I wanted to get the ones I ordered.
B00B7RKVOA|5|Super cute! My lil lady isnt born yet but im excited for her to wear them once she is here!
B001OC5UMQ|5|Compared to the other more high priced gates, this one takes the cake. There's extensions to take on and off to fit most wall sizes. I ordered 1 to see what i was getting. Next day I ordered the second gate. I seriously recommend this to anyone needing a walk through gate. The wall mounts are awesome. Great design!!!
B000056OWC|5|I used this tub for my son in the sink when he was first born and it was terrific.  He loved his bath time and I never had any trouble with him slipping or getting his feet stuck.  I can't wait until my second son is born and I can use it for him too.  I think that the other people who have complained about this product just don't know how to use it correctly.
B001GQ2P78|4|I love the variety of sounds this offers and it is pretty simple to use. I wanted just the white noise but I found that I also like the rain sounds. I just wish it could go a little louder to drown out traffic noises Bette (we live off a busy street).
B00TQ67YIU|3|It's cute. Great for throwing over tank tops and dresses inside during the summer so my daughter doesn't get too cold from the a/c. It, like most Carter clothes, starts to pill after a few washings. I paid more for this than I would have liked, so that's disappointing. I don't dry it and I do wash on delicate, but it still pills and looks worn out already.
B0038I1UY6|5|I am very happy with the warmth of the blanket and my one year old loves it for its softness.  Unlike most wool products, it isn't scratchy.  We also love the red color and get compliments on it. Currently, we use it inside our stroller bunting for cold days and it's great because it's thin and flexible, yet warm.
B0036Z3DDC|5|This has made night-time feedings and diaper changes for my infant much easier. The red light setting is wonderful for casting just enough light to see if her eyes are closed, but not enough to wake her up!
B00CSOOGXS|5|This was a good buy--Ultimately, I may need to broaden the surveillance.  I will definitely find a similar model, if not the same.  This is very easy to use from my smart phone.
B004K4Q9BG|4|I love this mixer and it's great for on the go. I wish it was a little longer so that I could use it to mix larger amounts for bottles that I store in the fridge.
B00HAZSCNK|5|I love the muslin sleep sacks for summer. We've stopped swaddling though and I could see how as some reviewers posted, the material could stretch and not he good for swaddling. But my baby sleeps better with a sleep blanket on than not and I like being able to velcro the sack below her arms so it doesn't ride up near her face. Have purchased a second one now.
B0072VF6CW|5|Very comfortable with good amount of cushion. The cover is a very fun zebra print. Most important is safety and this seat has it all including side airbags.
B00KO984JG|3|Too small
B007LXSM04|5|This is a set that I got for my son's toddler bed.  The sheets are comfortable and they seem to be holding up through several washings.
B00M2AO4ZS|5|Very good quality and soft.
B0000936LR|5|$60 sounded like a lot to me but it's THEE BEST toy for a newborn.  Love it, love it, love it - it's a must! <br />
B004QZBEFK|5|Its the perfect size for our baby girl starting to eat food.<br />Goes direct from the fridge to the microwave without problems.<br />Very nice.
B005ZBI03I|5|Great squishy seat.  I love the guard so no pee leaks & it has suction cups on bottom so seat doesn't slide.
B0071D1AKI|5|This is awesome! It's great for my 21 month old, as he starts to learn to wash his own hands. This is a genius product.
B000BNQC58|5|I bought 2 of these: the lady bug for my baby girl and the turtle for my little guy. They both love the beautiful stars projection in their rooms. The stars lights up in different colors. My son loves the green stars and my little girl loves the purple ones.  This is a really great product!!!! Love it!
B00A9PJF4I|2|While it was easy to put my baby in, I didn't feel like it was tight enough to securely hold my newborn. Maybe I needed to go down a size, but I did order the size according to size charts. I also have a problem with baby carriers hurting my back, and this one was no exception. If you want one that won't hurt your back, look into the baby Beco Gemini. It's costly, but oh so worth it!
B0037Y26PI|5|The toy is adorable and I know my little girl is going to love it when I give it to her.
B00F5QTESS|3|Battery is terrible!
B004HFQLIO|5|This is a great product! So quick and easy to use and clean. It saved me so much money making my own food. And I work full time too. I only wish I had done this with my first kid.
B0002JETPQ|5|I am so glad I didn't pay a lot of attention to the negative feedback of this product.  It is everything and more.  I have 2 dogs and 5 cats.  The cats use this as a spring board and the dogs jump on it and yet it holds up perfectly.  I am tempted to get another one for the front of the house.  This product is much better priced than the others.  Extremely happy.  Thank you
B00171WXII|5|I love this nasal aspirator. It works really well, much better than the suction ones I used before. The baby doesn't even mind it much, especially if I manage to use it quickly. Sometimes she would even sit quietly and let me clean her nose without getting a bit annoyed. I also used it on my 4 year old. He can blow his nose, but can't always do it well. Nosefrida works well with him too! He actually really likes it. He says it tickles. :) I would suggest getting spare filters, especially if you have more than one child. I went through the spares that come with the package pretty quickly. The spare filters are inexpensive and are very handy to have around for nose cleaning emergences.
B002L3T9Z6|5|These are scattered all over in various places in our home/truck.  I'll very likely be back to buy more. They hold things like a pacifier. toy, or whatever to the baby carrier/wrap/mei tai.<br /><br />The letters aren't so easy to figure out on several of them when up close in your hand, the different shapes do provide fun for our baby when he is pulling them apart. He inspects the shapes and works at it to locate the opening.
B0012PUCVO|3|Size of a handkerchief
B001A0K43M|1|This pillow is very uncomfortable. I requested seller to return this product but they are not ready to accept return as per their policy. So please read this review before you spend this costly pillow. It is very very uncomfortable for pregnant woman.
B004PVUFF0|5|I received this pack as a gift and love it for my 2.5 year old triplets. The cookbook is so simple to grab and cook with. The number of ingredients are never more than a few and usually involves stuff that I already have! My main priority is to create healthy, quick and easy to eat food for the babies. I have made their smoothies and roll-ups - all of which we can eat on the go. The book is thin but is packed with photos and recipes that are really useful.    I also have really enjoyed the divided plates. When I am fixing thier dinners, I appreciate the reminders of the portion sizes and recommended food groups. There have already been many times where I fix their dinner and realize that I didn't prepare a grain for example - throw a piece of toast with dinner and VIOLA! I like these reminders!!!    Overall, I really like this product and will be giving as gifts in the future...you can't beat the price!
B00305HF0A|5|This is a great addition to the baby's room!  It is easy to clean when you encounter a mess and is very sturdy.  We have ours on top of the baby's new dresser and it does not budge.  Highly recommended for any new parents.
B000QC44WW|5|I purchased the Peapod Plus for a trip to visit Grandma.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter recently transitioned to a toddler bed due to climbing out of her crib, so the crib at Grandma's was no longer an option (not to mention that it would be occupied by her 6 month old sister.)      The Peapod Plus worked great!  My daughter loved having her own space and couldn't wait to show off her \\"big girl bed.\\"  She had plenty of room and slept well every night.  The item couldn't be easier to set up and packed away nicely.  The storage bag was roomy enough to fit her bedding and held up well when it was checked at the airport (was originally packed in our suitcase,  but we were over the weight limit and had to check it separately.)    The only drawback was the noise factor - the sleeping bag rubbing the bottom of the tent was pretty noisy, but I remedied this by taking the air mattress out of the bottom storage compartment and putting it into the tent.  The sleeping bag has a lip that fits over the mattress to keep it in place and since the mattress has a velvety coating the loud rubbing sound was eliminated.    I would definitely recommend this product.  We'll be using it at Thanksgiving when we visit the Great Grandparents and my daughter can wait!
B00K80DFUY|5|So easy to use and far better quality compared to the prior shades we were using - great find - highly recommend!
B007AIBMIO|5|I have spent the last 2 month looking for a roomy but not too big diaper bag!<br />(my daughter is now 2 months old)<br />Its very hard to find one the right size. I hate those big bulky ones..but the tiny ones are no help either!<br />This one is perfect.<br /><br />I do wish it had little side compartments (on most diaper bags for bottles) Thats where I usually keep my cell and keys.<br />A simple diaper organizer insert helped with that.<br /><br />Other than that. I love it!
B00AHO43BG|5|It is hilarious. I bought 2 for my brother's twins and they look good in the box. It is a Xmas gift, so they haven't tried it yet, but everybody who saw them so far laughed, so it is a good sign :)
B00MA8LTS2|2|I bought this during Prine day when it was only $19.99 instead of the regular price of $99.99 and let's just say I would never pay $99 for this. The &#34;night vision&#34; is a joke and the quality of this monitor just isn't that great. I can hear my son and that's great so if you are looking for a video monitor with great quality this is not for you. Since I only paid twenty bucks I really shouldn't complain but no way would I ever pay the $99 that is the normal price for this.
B000KJYVXS|5|Thank u!! My wife loves it helps her sleep better!!
B00006408K|5|This thing was awesome to keep diapers, wipes, and creams organized all with in arm's reach of the changing pad.  Holds a good amount of diapers, even when they're the bigger sizes.  Keeps your changing table looking neat.
B003LDIJM4|4|Same as what we used with our children - they can eat what we eat.<br />No unwanted additives, and it's real food!
B002WZ2RE8|5|My 2yo ASD son chews on everything...from blankets to wooden blocks. We have 4 of these around the house to replace other opjects. He likes that he can get the knobby back in his molar area and the texture. He also puts the handle in his mouth too. I like that it is sturdier and solid as too often he chews off the &#34;chewy layer&#34; of a teether and we have to toss it out.
B0091E31KM|5|What would I do without this product??? When shopping for a sound machine I read hundreds of reviews. The myBaby SoundSpa had the best reviews so I decided to give it a try. There are so many features I love about this sound machine. I love that it manual. Therefore you turn it on and you turn it off. It will not turn off on its own. This was a PLUS! When reading about other sound machines, the majority of them shut off automatically. I wanted a continuous sound. I love that it has 6 different sounds available. My favorite is the ocean.  It is so soothing. All of the sounds are excellent it really is just your preference. I love that it plugs in the wall so you never have to worry about the batteries dying in the middle of the night. It also has a great sound adjustment. It can be really low or really loud, again it is totally your preference. Lastly I love the size of it. We have taken it several different places such as the camp and vacation. It doesn't take up much room so it is easy to pack.
B002WB232S|1|don't bother with this accessory  holds not much more than a sippy cup (which my suv can handle, and my daughter can easily reach)  don't waste your money
B000YDDF6O|5|Was a gift
B001E87FQY|1|Used these for back up bottles. Waste of money as they always leaked.
B005QU55EA|5|Only child proofing that worked!! Love these!!'
B004L2JJ6E|5|Folds easy, baby sleeps great in it  We used it on our first trip when baby was two months and then on a road trip in rv when baby was 3months, so far, loving it  Folds great!  We also have a little one that cannot stay put in his crib and I was scared to find him too closed to the bumpers so I put the brica travel bassinet in his own crib! And he sleeps great in it!
B000RHIW42|5|We purchased two of these gates for our parent's house about 9 months ago.  We have used it daily without any problems whatsoever.  I think some of the others issues may have been a result of poor installation.  The gate is easy to use, but not so easy that our two year old has figured it out. You are able to easily open it one handed, which is a must with a wiggly, squirmy toddler.  We just purchased a second set of these gates for our new home that has a set of stairs and I am sure we will be equally happy with this purchase!
B008QUQ4MO|5|My daughter loves her caddy.  We bought it for vacation and she is still using it 18 months later.  It is growing with her.
B0002PQSCC|5|Adorable and quality.  Silver plated which is healthy for feeding babies because it helps to fight bacteria.
B000Q7G3VM|2|this is just ok...really too big for baby learning family members.  I am keeping it only due to cost of returning not worth it.<br />think twice before buying.  i suggest baby blocks that hold pictures for babies (avon sells them).
B00007DWBH|4|Got the full set, but as we are 2 working parents, A second was needed. It works well and it was a good price
B006SFUEF2|4|My wife and I have a baby that get easily woken up and can be a bit of a fussy sleeper. We have the $30-40 &#34;sleep sheep&#34; that is validated by PHD's, however it automatically shuts off @ 25 or 45 minutes. I can't tell you how many times we heard the &#34;sleep sheep&#34; turn off & our baby started crying. Our mission was to find an inexpensive sound machine that ran continuously. This is much harder then you would think. Most machines have a timer & no options for continuous play. This one does & the nightlight feature helps because it's bright enough to help see things but isn't too bright like traditional night lights that you plug in the wall. Don't use the projector feature because my baby could care less out it.
B00OYDICDG|4|works great
B001ISJW4S|5|Here are the most important pros and cons:     Pro:   - Extremely back-friendly. I carried my 22-pounder in this for a couple of hours (on a bumpy forest road, no less) and my back and shoulders didn't hurt afterwards. No sling or carrier can compare.   - Baby loves it. A lot.  - Washer/Dryer safe.    Con:   - Time-consuming to put on. You have to wrap it around you rather than just throw it over your head like a sling or carrier.   - It can get very warm since it is 5 yards of cotton wrapped around you. Now that Southern summer and humidity are here, I don't use it much, because baby and I are soaked after 20 minutes.   - It is not breastfeeding friendly. I have to take baby out and then eiter take the wrap off altogether or somehow wriggle out of my clothes.     Overall, the Moby is a wonderful way of wearing your baby. However, be aware that it is not made for very short \\"wears\\" nor for very hot climates.
B004C43JJ4|5|This booster seat is an excellent alternative to a bulky high chair. The parts are all easily cleaned and our child is safe and happy in it. The belt and tray position are adjustable for growing bellies. The back folds down and can be stored/transported in a more compact formation. Both grandmas have one of these in addition to our own. Highly recommend.
B0009EYS5A|4|This is excellent for an &#34;old school&#34; mobile (read: not electronic). The reason I didn't give it five stars is that it comes with a very long cord/string for attachment - so long that it's really too long for most things, particularly in our baby's co-sleeper. There's a bead that may be intended to help adjust its length BUT there were no instructions and, sorry, but the last thing exhausted parents are going to do is diddle around with anything aggravating. Because of this, since our baby can now reach the mobile it is a safety hazard so even though she isn't even four months old yet, we must remove it (planning to use again either in her playspace or when she's in her crib). She has enjoyed it a good deal thus far, since the pieces are designed to be visible TO the laying baby. Instructions for adjusting length/height would make a big difference, though.
B00W76F69U|5|I LOVE IT!! My daughter was sick with the flu, and running a 103 temperature (My poor princess) Normally I would use the regular thermometer and have to sanitize it each and every time. It is also a pain to get a 10 year old girl to keep her mouth closed long enough to get an accurate reading. This thermometer can read temperature via forehead and ear canal. To take forehead temperature, just hold down the F1 button and keep it held while you drag from temple to temple over the forehead. Let go when you get to the other temple. To take temperature via ear canal, pop off the plastic cover and put the tip in your ear canal, and press the F2 button. This thermometer is easy and accurate. After taking temps I simply wipe it off with an antibacterial wipe. This is a great thermometer and I highly recommend it!!
B00CBTKHQ0|1|I wish I couldn't even give this product any stars. These don't even work they they are described and I wasted my money. They don't stick to your skin and stay. And they sure aren't water resisted.
B00CS7UAPS|1|did not work.
B00ESXREJA|4|With this Skip Hop Giraffe, what you see is what you get.  This is very much an old school wooden toy, extremely simplistic in design yet very classy and timeless.  What you get is a small wooden giraffe, very thick and sturdy in construction, that measures about five and a half inches tall.  By moving the tail up and down, the giraffe's neck goes up and down.  That's it.  No wheels, no songs, no blinking eyes.  Like I said, very simple yet effective.  In a world of toys that light up, make sounds, play music, and interact with smartphones, this is startlingly straightforward.<br /><br />I gave this to my sixteen-month-old, and she instantly figured out the simple function of moving the tail and manipulating the neck.  She played with it for several minutes, set it aside, and came back to it a little while later.  This will never be a favorite toy.  It's not cuddly, nor does it have the bells and whistles needed to entertain her for hours.  But I suspect it will be a durable, go-to toy for as long as she plays with toys.  It's not likely to get broken, and it's the kind of simple, old fashioned device that you just want to pick up and mess around with for a few minutes, almost like a stress reliever.  The packaging recommends eighteen months and up, but my sixteen-month-old plays with it just fine.
B00JR947EU|2|It fell apart after a few cleanings. Really not durable for the long run. I'd rather just use a split roll of toilet paper.
B00U5U2BFM|5|Wonderful product. Easy and quick to put up. I have a textured wall not smooth.
B000W7O7DM|4|We got it 2,5mo. ago and i loved it. Worked well all this time and i was 100% satisfied untill recently...it broke:(((music wont run. And there is no way we can fix it .. need a new part and i cannot find it anywhere.
B00IDV3Z6O|5|So i've been using all famous baby bibs out there and i've found out that this one was very similar to the one that i liked the best ( make my day baby bib ) and it was even cheaper than that .<br />Easy to clean , safe to use , quick dry , catches all food , can be folded in my diaper bag , what else do we need :) very good product :)
B002HFQPMS|5|We bought this as a gift for a friend, who said that they have been saved from being peed on many times by these!
B00MJHMIMK|5|Love it and the fit is perfect.
B004GKM7RO|5|GASPAR已经一岁了 对于这款太阳镜还算适应 8个月的时候每天出门都要戴上 但是到了外面就会要摘下来 11个月的时候下雪出门戴上了 一路上都没有去摘它 而且好像很喜欢戴眼镜了 家人都认为这点还是很不错的  还没有到夏天 准备带他海边 希望可以用上 就是不知道对于下雪是否管用 或者防风是否管用 有的时候会觉得这款眼镜有点过紧 孩子的鼻子上每次都会出现勒痕 但是在佩戴的过程中 孩子并没有明确表示出不舒服 另外白色的这款很多小女孩戴上会更合适 男孩子还是应该选择蓝色的或者迷彩的那款 这是一点点小建议
B000056OUF|5|After reading some of the reviews I felt compelled to share my experience with this product.  I love it!  I'm not sure if they made a different model before, but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine (its on the back).  Its not rocket science if you follow the directions.  I never have problems with the bottle floating.  If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float.  The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting.  It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature.  There are no \\"dings\\" or timers, but that hasn't presented any problems for me.  Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.  As a first time mom, I highly recommend it.
B00E25SGHI|5|Just what I expected great product!  And they are big !
B002VLGD2A|5|Exactly what I was looking for & at a great price!
B009L1VWCO|1|I had a problem with mold growth in the steaming resevior.  The unit itself works great, but I do not feel it is safe to feed my baby.  The issue is that there is not way to clean or to tell that there is mold growing.  I cleaned and let it dry out after every use, but that still did not help.  Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it is not there.  I would not recommend this product due to the mold issue, it is a health concern.  I would just get a regular food processor.<br /><br />*Update:  I contacted Cuisinart and they are giving me a credit of $117.50 towards a purchase of another product on their website.  I cannot get a refund because it was \\"not purchased directly from us\\".  The customer service center was nice.
B004DBDOH8|5|I'm a first time Mom, and I have decided that wool soakers are one of the staples of any mama's needs. We have never had a leak at night, these wool soakers also help with temperature regulation (so no issues with diaper rash), and my son looks so darn CUTE with these little shorts on! We have two pairs we love them so much. Plus, the care is so darn simple. Once every 2 weeks (or if there's a stain) I just put them in the sink with some wool wash for 15 minutes and let them air dry - so easy. I would definitely suggest these to all friends!
B0053YP9EK|5|Bigger and thicker than other hooded towels for babies that I have purchased!! Very happy I found these for my lil guy!!
B005PRQC3C|5|so great for small cup parts
B0042D69V0|5|Got this for my 3 month old. From what I saw he enjoys it. (Im deployed so only get to skype) It is a little big for him my wife puts blankets under his feet. But he still loves it. It lights up and makes noises. Only thing my wife said bad about it is that the box it came in was really big but who cares? I dont
B000056JB8|4|This tub is perfect for me and my 8 month old daughter. She out grew her infant tub and wasnt ready for the big bathtub and we have glass shower doors so it would be hard to reach her. I received this tub 2 days after I purchased and used it that night, my daughter splashed and played with no worries sense the sides are excellent bumpers to protect her wiggly self. I read reviews about how its hard to rinse and drain out water but i just pull the plug let water drain and run the clean water and rinse her off while she plays. It was no problem for me. I like that you can hang dry it and deflate it and bring it along for long trips. So far so good were happy with this item.
B00UGV8CLW|5|Very good product!
B005OOXRFW|5|just exactly fit the mattress, good color, excellent delivery.
B005D7XR0A|5|WE are very satisfied with this car seat.  It is designed for the child that has reached 40+ lbs.  The kids love it..........so we love it.  Very easy to install!!!
B003KMWATY|5|Love Dr. Brown's
B00A2HUGYQ|2|I have used the Evenflo 65 convertible seat for 2 years and, after an airline broke it, decided to try the Britax Advocate. Hate the Britax in comparison! Harder to install in the car (compared to Evenflo's latch click). My biggest complaint is how difficult the Britax is to adjust straps. I have different size twins and find it incredibly difficult to adjust the harness height and tension each time. Will return for Evenflo.
B0038JDUHK|1|I wanted to like this product but I found pieces of blue plastic floating in the water about a month after use. Super scary!
B00067AUP2|4|This wedge works really great with my little one. I was able to fit it in our packn'play while we waited on her crib. Only downfall is that she will move down or to the side. Although this is not a problem with the product, just thought consumers should know for safety reasons. My little one is able to sleep better in her crib and stroller with this insert.
B00Z52R76S|5|Worked great! You do have to be patient and pay really close attention or you'll miss it. I'm 17 weeks, but I hope as the baby grows it will be easier and easier to find her heartbeat.
B009QXDE46|5|I love these bottles for switching between breastfeeding and bottles. Most other bottles gave too much and my son choked. These are perfect!
B0010WFVRO|3|It is way too difficult to get baby in and out of this. I wouldn't buy it again because they out grow it way too fast. It takes longer to get them in and out of it than it does for them to get bored with it.
B00H0DH2NI|5|Only bottle my daughter liked, so I bought 6 of them.
B002HGN47G|1|I am a Child Passenger Safety Technician, and aftermarket products such as these can be a significant safety risk.  Harness strap covers can interfere with the harness straps.  These ones are way too long and do not allow the chest clip to be positioned correctly, at armpit level.  If the chest clip is too low, the child can be ejected from the seat in an accident.  Use of aftermarket products like these will also void the warranty of the car seat.  Only the harness strap covers that came with your particular car seat should be used with your car seat.
B003KN27EQ|5|We had the infant Bundle Me so we ordered the Toddler Bundle Me. Living in NY it's definition a necessity.  We just had Temps in the teens and the Bundle Me kept our lil guy warm and toasty. He wears 18 - 24 months and the bundle me covers him up to his face. I highly recommend this to every parent
B0081ZOV06|5|i love it
B000TYEKXK|5|These are a nice change from other cars.  One of my favorite things about these cars are you can machine wash them which is so important.  Also, they are very durable & fun.  It teaches cause & effect - pull back & let go.  There are no batteries to replace & they make no noise. I highly recommend.
B00FPW3THE|5|Very cute and well-made. Lightweight and dainty. Perfect for a newborn. Excellent price and quick delivery.
B0043XG2Z2|5|I was impressed with this fleece.  I've ordered others on Amazon and they are all very thin.  This was thick and the perfect size to put on my couch for my dogs to cuddle on.
B0000899OF|1|This did not work for my little guy. I tried it when he was older in music mode, even that was disappointing. It sounded like a bad piano recital. I had such high hopes for this and was very let down.
B0011H1Y06|5|This is a great plush Peter Rabbit toy.  It is small, but it is just the right size for my two year-old.  Highly recommended.
B005IWM6BG|5|Movement, music, blinking lights.  Perfect for a young baby. I'm a grandmother who keeps one at my home.<br />Easy to set up.
B000SOUCQA|1|Wayyyy too small:(
B000BXHPEU|5|I'm so happy I got this for my potty-training toddlers. It's a great price and I use it for both at home and while out with the kids. It folds up conveniently and is lightweight and small enough to tuck into my diaper bag. My kids were scared of sitting on a toilet in a public restroom until I got this - and they've never experienced any pinching issues while sitting on it. I line the public toilet seat with toilet paper first before putting the potty seat on for sanitary reasons. And I make sure to keep a small pad of Post-Its to cover the automatic flush sensor (if there is one) because that can scare my kids. The potty seat comes packaged in a ziploc plastic bag which you can use to store the seat in your diaper bag. However, I would use a thicker ziploc like a freezer bag instead. When the seat is folded up, its corners can wear away at the plastic bag creating small holes after a while.
B009BTHFPY|5|For the price, this is an amazing light switch cover... It looks like it should cost a lot more, but thank you for the deal... Make sure your bottom screw is white and you are fine...
B00JQYSHRE|5|This is the best pouch for my daughter's drinks. Usually put two items (sippy  cup and water bottle) in it with a thin cooler pack. Wish I had it when I was giving her bottles.
B003RW1UAW|5|This was ordered and delivered next day.  The family loved the gift, it is packaged nicely and is much more welcome as a new baby gift than flowers.  They loved it!  Thank you for offering this lovely option and delivering next day so as not to miss the family in the hospital!
B000USV8JO|5|Good product
B0007PHO3O|5|Our 8 month old son loves this
B000AV5LZ8|4|my daughter (2.2 yo) puts the item herself on the chair and then to its side after using it.<br />It is light and easy to clean. What else can you ask for?!
B00APABIF6|5|I purchased these lights for my neighbors and their new baby.  Small, easy to use, with a nice light display. They appreciated the choice of light types (slow flashing, fast flashing, or solid), and I appreciated the free shipping. Just the thing for taking walks with the stroller in the winter.
B00DXXMMRU|5|Love the blanket. Generous size. Use it everyday for swaddling, wiping, etc.
B00073HJG8|4|..But not as big as I thought it would be. It does help clear some space in my kids playroom though.
B00AH8F5G4|1|This was totally wrong. With the baby on top of the pillow his mouth came up to my nose. Returned.
B000P7WAII|5|assemble yourself, quality design, wood, on sale at great price, for 3rd party but mistakenly sent to home address, company did pay for shipping back and correcting the order...I had some confusion on putting in the mailing address so don't know if it was my mistake or a website design flaw.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|Keeps the kids out of drawers/closets.
B00CHZ7LI0|5|We are very pleased with this purchase! It's practical and my baby loves the hose that keeps her warm while we wash her. It's easy to clean and the platform where you place your baby makes baths much easier.
B000MPP922|4|I'm not a fussy mom that worries constantly about all the germs my child can pick up but, the store carts/high chairs are germ farms so I thought, better safe than sorry and bought this cover.  It's a good design and I love the look.  The toys included are fun and handy since my daughter needs to constantly chew on things.  It comes in a zippable cover bag so you can store it again after use.  Good buy, glad I took the plunge.
B00009MOJ1|5|We bought the entire Graco Cooper collection. This car seat was easy to install, is very durable, and the pattern is cute. Great value. There is no need to spend excess amounts of $$$ when there are  equal quality products out there for less.
B000058DIM|2|It works minimally. I think I should have paid more for a better humidifier, but it doesn't seem that any of them have especially good ratings. If I'd read the reviews on this particular humidifier first, I'm sure I wouldn't have bought it. No problems with leaking - but I fill up to the line, put the top on, &amp; then leave it in the sink for any overflow for a few minutes. The &quot;fill line&quot; is only how high the water level should be after you put the top on; it's misleading.
B005FIBU88|5|This is a great wetbag. I use it in my purse/diaper bag to store random little items like snacks or makeup or whatever else I need
B0003008A4|4|We only used it during the day but we could move it easily through out the house. She out grew it so quickly any more expensive would be a waste. It will make a great hand-me-down, so cute.
B006UMUB92|4|Works perfectly in our old house. Installation was straightforward, though I did strip one of the screws -- they are a little cheap, so pre-drilling is a must even if you don't think it should be necessary. I'll be buying the same brand soon for the bottom of the stairs now that our daughter can almost climb.
B008HCXIU2|3|I have affixed headrests so none of the other mirrors we tried work well, they all need to be routed under instead of around. This one works well in that aspect I just do not like how heavy this one is. It would be a pretty dangerous projectile in an accident compared to other ones. Heavy plastic frame and backing
B005YPOYHQ|5|I bought these off a recommendation from our night doula.  They work amazing at helping our boys sleep and helping me get over my fear of swaddling.  The boys can move like they do in the womb, but they get the benefits of the swaddle.  I can't recommend these enough!  I have two sets - one for the wash and one for the night.  Don't hesitate to buy!
B00DJPLS2W|1|This product was great, until it wasn't. After about 6 months of use, the sound started randomly cutting out, as in there was no sound until you reset the unit at the camera. One morning when my alarm woke me up, I saw that the &#34;peep&#34; mode had been activated (peep mode is when the screen turns on if sound is detected in the baby's room) and that the color sound indicator was lighting up, indicating there was sound coming from the baby's room. I opened our bedroom door and heard crying from down the hall.<br /><br />Really, the sole purpose of a baby monitor is to be able to HEAR the baby if it is crying. The video and all the other features are just bonuses. When the primary function doesn't work reliably, the product is really useless. I can't justify keeping this product knowing that the sound could cut out any time and I won't be able to hear my child; it's just unacceptable.<br /><br />I'd give it zero stars if I could because it simply doesn't work reliably.
B00TXBSHBQ|5|Love these pouches! They are reusable, last a very long time and come in multiple sizes. Can't say enough good things about these. Would love to see them in stores.
B006YPU1EA|5|I love everything about these cups. They're the only ones I'll use and I recommend them to everyone with a kid using a sippy cup. My kids never used any other type than the straw sippy and this is by far the most leak-proof one on the market.
B004044LD4|5|Great quality, great price, my son LOVED it!  It fir perfectly in his toddler bed.  Great buy!!!! I would buy it again!
B000FFL58Q|5|Bought three for our two babies, one is at grandma's. This is the favorite. Sturdy, yet flexible. The giraffe is so cute! Collapses better than any of the others. My babies can play under it for a very long time.
B007S1T4Q0|1|I got this as a gift at my baby shower.  My baby is not quite two weeks old.  We tried using this for her first bath one week ago, and my experience with this product scared me from ever wanting to use it again!  She seemed snugly placed in the center of the flower, but when my husband lowered his hand from the back of her neck for even a second, her body lurched backwards and, due to the way the petals flop around disconnected from each other, she was inches away from cracking the back of her skull against the side of the sink.  Luckily we caught her before she was injured.  This may be okay for older babies who can support their own heads, but I recommend that anybody with a newborn stay away from this product.
B00IYRE2W8|1|Ridiculously cheesy brush. Not at all what I expected. Bristles smashed flat and whimpy. Not worth the money I paid.
B004PVTCK4|5|Our first crib was a PBKids that cost twice as much as this one. For our second child, we found this one, I thought it'd be a perfect compliment to our PBkids crib. It's made just as well, was VERY easy to put together and looks like it is as expensive as our first. We have both of our children in a shared nursery and I just love this beautiful crib. The details are darling and it's very solid. I was skeptical of the \\"disney princess\\" name as I'm not into cutesy branding - but the crib really was a great buy. VERY happy with our purchase.
B00N4ORRE6|3|Wish yoshi's were uniform in size. I went by height but he is much larger than other yoshis
B00IGLAZ64|5|Exactly what I was looking for! Used mostly to hold my baby's dirty clothes from day care.
B009EDSWJA|5|I was pretty impressed with this changing pad after seeing similar products at Babies-R-Us for two times more. I wasn't aware that the pad came with a strap that you could mount to the back of your dresser, so that impressed me, I was trying to figure out how to keep it from sliding off. The mounting came with thorough instructions and seemed pretty easy to me. As far as price, quickness of shipping, and ease of ordering I am one happy camper.
B001V6KB3S|5|The fit is great because the flexible wiring inside and the elastic allow it to probably fit over most any type of carseat. We used this while my son was 2 months old during a trip to Brazil. It protected him from all of the elements, bugs, and nosy people. I put it on upside down to make it easier to get him in and out. And when I didn't want to have him \\"inside\\", I just pushed the whole thing down a bit and he wasn't in a cage anymore. This was much easier than taking the whole thing off. It's like, folds easily, and you can cram it in between things in your bag for your flight. I think the sun protection is good from the side as well. The only thing was that it got hot in there with the bubble and the carseat canopy - no wind movement. So just beware and make sure you let the air circulate through and it will be a great thing to have!
B000HIP38Y|3|I had this alarm one time.  It tells the temperature, I think it's mostly accurate, but I needed the alarm and that doesn't work.
B00KDKKD1I|5|Thank you so much for an excellent product!  My son loves his pillow, and I love that it is just the right size!  When shopping for his pillow I chose your company based on reviews!  I loved that the product was awesome and the customer service was top notch!  Keep up the great work!
B006SFUEF2|5|Great
B001P32Y3C|5|My son loves his turtle. It is a great night light, he left it on all night last night. The light is not too bright or overpowering, just enough so it's not completely dark in the room. I bought one of these from a popular auction site and paid 1/3 the price of amazon. They also sell these at Target for thirty eight USD.
B00RFGZ6XS|3|I had to cut the inside gussets out because they were squeezing my sons legs.  Other than that they serve the purpose.  I love the wet bags!
B004H6TIOC|5|very nice desing my baby is very happy the color is perfect is not dirty and when you put the stroller in the car is very easy
B000EIIPNC|5|I've gotten other Trebimbi sets before so I was adding to the ones that I had.<br /><br />The sets are great for a preschooler.  The knife isn't really sharp at all, but it gives little hands a chance to start using a knife for softer things.<br /><br />I chose them because I wanted stainless.  Obviously, I could have given my kids our regular silverware, but I wanted something more in keeping with their size.<br /><br />All of the sets that I've had have held up perfectly without any problems.<br /><br />The faces and fact that they hook together are a little silly as far as I'm concerned, but my daughter really likes that fact.
B001UFHAF2|5|Loved it all!
B000YDDF6O|5|Wonderful gift
B00MKXBVFS|5|Adorable hat! Couldn't get any cuter! I even featured this hat on my site www.themomeditorial.com
B001395Q6A|2|We were sitting at dinner last night with our daughter in the Bumbo on the floor.  She is 5 months old.  I heard a thunk and looked over and she was on the floor and the Bumbo was tipped over.   I'm not even sure how she got it to turn over, but I've decided we probably won't be using it anymore.  We received it as a gift and I'm glad because I would have been upset if I had bought it, especially at that price.      Even before she fell our daughter never really liked the seat.  She's a skinny little girl so she would always end up sitting sideways in the chair.      So all in all, I wouldn't buy this product if I had the chance and will probably only recommend it to friends whose babies are a little bigger and would actually stay where they're supposed to.  I would also be adamant that they never place the baby in the bumbo at an elevated position (table, counter etc.).
B0036W70MA|5|Awesome product
B003MOZYFM|5|I just can't say enough about this product, My daughter and I are able to last longer in our tennis matches during the extreme heat.  Thank you very much!
B0076MWUZS|5|I love this thing.  REALLY LOVE IT.  When we had our newborn, this lounger was a lifesaver.  Our baby was truly comfortable reclining, and we could move it around the house easily so she could stay with us.  If she was fussy, we could lay the lounger on our knees and rock her in it, and then scoot her over to a safe spot when she fell asleep.  It is fluffy enough that it was difficult for her to squirm out of it, so she was relatively secure even after she began rolling side to side.  We used it so much that it earned the nickname &#34;The Throne&#34;.  Would definitely recommend this purchase, and will be buying it for every pregnant mama I know.
B0088UXLSW|5|Great toddler travel bed!
B00PQZ35LK|4|They were a hit with the 2 boys but for the baby, Vocabularry was a little too big.  Wish you had a smaller size.
B005GYFCJ4|5|These liners were cheaper than any of the others available and are just as good of quality. They are similar in size and quality.
B00005QI1G|5|I LOVE THIS BOUNCER!!!! it has been a life saver.  The first two weeks my baby did not appreciate it very much, but after that, he really came to enjot it.  First he would have the best time when I would just put the play feature and the vibrator.  Then, once he started kicking he loved being the one making teh music (in the kick mode).  Now he is almost 5 months and is bored with the toy bar so I don't use the bar anymore and instead use the chair to seat him in front of his Baby Einstein DVD's.  This boucer will allow your baby to stay amused for a period of time long enough for you to do other things like take a shower!
B00FZGLKPI|5|Love it!
B0050GD2AE|4|I recommend this stroller. It is so easy to fold. It is carry and go. FYI - the basket is a little small for the moms like to be super prepared.
B005SOPZRQ|3|After two babies and not being satisfied with the sling or front carrier, I decided to go with something different for my third. I was given two moby wraps, and LOVED them, but I wear my baby so much that two wraps just wasn't enough, and I decided to get a third. I saw the ratings for the Boba, and the awesome pink color, (not to mention it was cheaper than the moby), so I decided to give it a try. It works just like the moby wrap, which is great, and I love the color! However, it is a little too stretchy. After wearing my baby for less than an hour, she's practically sagging to my knees (she's 9lbs). I am constantly having to take her out, and rewrap, which isn't always convenient. So although it's nice enough, and works ok, I don't love it. If you're choosing between the Boba and Moby wrap, go with the Moby!
B00KHR7F5O|5|I bought this for Grandma's house and wish I had it at my own house instead of the one I have. There are so many bright colors and things for the baby to grab on to. She loves it!
B009Z4VE7K|5|Love how easy it is to put on and put my baby in it. Though I think he is going to out grow it in length at 4-5 months old bc his upper body will be so long that his head will no longer fit under my chin. Will use it as long as possible!  It was a little hard when baby was little bc I was worried about his chin being too low but it's great for the facing you position and the out position. Newborn position works just pay attention to babies positioning. LOVE it!
B0034G61DC|5|Great size for outdoor or indoor use
B00KO984JG|4|This umbrella is inexpensive and not the best quality, but for my 3 year old, it is a perfect size and super cute. If your child is 5 or older, I would think it's too small.
B00GHAGGOG|5|Nice accesorie for a baby  bed
B00AKAE7IQ|5|I took a gamble with BOB Car Seat Adapter for Britax because BOB doesn't make an adapter for Baby Trend Car Seat (I specifically have a flex-loc Baby Trend).  I couldn't even find anywhere on the internet that had a solution for this (other than buying a Graco).  I love our Baby Trend Car Seat and already had it from our first child.  I didn't want to purchase something else.<br /><br />I tried some of the adapters at Toys 'r' Us and none of them worked.  I tried the Graco, Peg Perego, and even the Britax with a Baby Trend Car Seat.  None of them worked.  The Baby Trend Car Seat wouldn't attach at all to the Graco or the Peg Perego adapters.  On the Britax adapter, the Baby Trend could sit on it but didn't snap in and any weight on the front of the car seat would flip it right off.<br /><br />After searching long and hard on the internet without finding any solutions (other than buying a different Car Seat).  I found the Britax Infant Carrier to Stroller Adapter Strap.  It is super simple!  Just a strap, a buckle and some D-rings.  Wrap the straps around the metal pins in the Britax Car Seat adapter and the straps can buckle the Baby Trend Car Seat in securely!  It's perfect!  Very secure.<br /><br />I do have one confession.  The baby to go in this isn't born yet.  I will update this review once I have some time with the baby in it.  Though, I don't see many issues.<br /><br />Good Luck!
B00EMSWCV6|5|Webought it for the grandchild, and love it. Wish we had it when our own children were growing up!! I would recommend it to anyone that goes traveling, camping, visiting family and friends.......
B00IP8AAZE|5|I like the adjustable headrest.  I think it is a quality car seat.  I like the idea that car seat can be used from infant up until the child reaches a size & weight to be in a booster seat.  Cup holder can not be used when the car seat is reclined.  However, once the child reaches the size for the seat to be in the up rite position, the cup holder will be useful providing no one is sitting next to the car seat, as it might be in their way.
B001PYQWXY|5|I have a 4 month old puppy who is into everything!  I needed to keep her out of my office so she would stop taking stuff off of the shelves, and I wouldn't have to close the door.  It works perfectly.  Also, she runs like fury whenever she can sneak out the front door, and she is fast!  I will be putting it on the outside of the front door so she won't escape for Halloween trick-or-treating!
B00QEIK85O|1|The pacifier smelled like lighter fluid!  The smell did not go away after washing and airing it out for a day.  It also had rough edges on the nipple from the molding process.  I did not give it to my baby and promptly tossed it.
B00DPFJ648|5|As soon as we got this item I installed it in our bathroom and it makes washing my 11 month olds hands so much easier.  I know as soon as he is able to wash his hands on his own he will enjoy it as much as me.  I will probably by 3 more for the other bathrooms in our house.
B001NPDFMG|4|This is a very nice set. It looks better in person than in the picture. Some of the small butterflies are fuzy, which you would not know by looking at the picture. Only one side of the blanket is quilted the other is a print. But still very happy with the hole set. It also got here when they said it would. If you like it in the picture don't be afaid to order it, you will be happy with it.
B00OVSBQB4|5|Great fit , easy to use
B004071ZOY|4|My baby love it, i would say that it is a good buy, if you like it nice material and color
B005555XKM|5|Love the materials and print of this pad.  The soft side is really warm and fuzzy, great for changing baby.  The print side wipes clean really easy.  Recommended!
B0055ABONC|5|Used to lock up stroller at theme park, gave me piece of mind that my costly stroller would not roll away with someone else!  The lock is easy to program and easy to use.
B00JL4OT9Y|4|It's a pikachu pillow pet. It was very soft and plushy.
B0007MZL5A|3|The product is great itself for the theme of why I needed it. My problem is in just two days. I have had to put in two batteries just to make sure it will keep running. Keeping it for the theme, but the clock mechanism isn't working properly on the one I purchased. Glad I am not using it to keep time.
B002PYZCWU|5|My 5 month old had cradle cap that refused to go away and this product in conjunction with stelaker and shampoo did the trick in about a week of using it daily.
B004GXA6J2|4|This is my second one of these. It is the best pump for efficiency and portability I have found. The first one needed a  replacement part after about 8 months of  using it twice a day 3-4 days a week.
B00LA5XDNK|4|Baby loves it, so I love it. We go through it fast though, as it's a very fine powder (finer than other brands), so I find we use more to make a larger serving.
B003554HUQ|3|Exactly what you would expect.
B001KYA0GO|5|Great product
B00005OONH|5|This product us great and safe.  The aquarium feature keeps my son entertained at feeding time and has actually help to improve his desire to eat. The assembly was difficult but worth it.
B000WHOU1G|5|Our granddaughter loves these long eared bunny blankies.  She takes them everywhere and they help let her know that it is naptime or bedtime.  When it was time to stop using a pacifier, the bunnies eased the transition.  When one of the floppy ears got a hole chewed in it, the repair made a flat top ear, now her favorite.  Get several so you can wash them separately, leave one at grandma's, etc.  The blue bunnies just recieved are for our grandson and as always, great service form Amazon.
B00ANG2SLA|5|Best bibs ever. Easy to wear for baby, sweet to machine wash, still look great after months of abuse… Solid recommendation!
B004Q7QNBS|5|This is super cute and works just as desired. Perfect for my son's room, so I'm happy with the purchase!
B000GK22RS|5|Kushies makes terrific baby toys.  They're soft, very colorful, and babies love them.  We bought our grandson this Zolo Peeko and also the Zolo Acrobats, which are terrific.  I recommend their toys highly.
B003MUA5GO|5|this containers are just right for a baby portion.  but you would need several of these to work for several days.
B0002KWTE8|3|The product would work well if it would stick to the brick.  We are having trouble getting it to stay down.  It does protect the corners and edges, but doesn't stay stuck to the brick ledge.
B004O9TTKA|5|Absolutely necessary with busy babies or toddlers, never spills!
B00C1WRZ80|1|Fold off
B00005JIVI|5|This was probably the best baby gift we received! !! We did NOT want a baby tub and this was a fantastic alternative. Its light, drains water very quickly and was super easy to wash. We loved it. I've purchased an additional as a gift for a friend who also forewent the baby tub idea.
B00I8QVCXM|3|I ordered this cup from seller Juvolicious and fulfilled by Amazon. I received item as depicted but without the blue strap. Which is the sole purpose why i got this for my kid. So he can carry the cup over the shoulder when on the go. I contacted Amazon cust serv twice and they were able to work things out for me. And that makes me satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Function wise it's great. If i flip the top, the straw doesn't squirt or spill any water out of the cup. The snack container at the bottom is very simple. Just twist it off and that is it. There's no cover like some other brand of sip and snack container. But it is ok for me because i bought this for the strap. I just hope that there is not much water dripping to the snack from condensation of any cold drink i put in the cup section.
B00GL5LJWQ|4|Fun print and green accents make for a nice, gender-neutral gift.  Generous size and interior  pockets are a plus.  Accessory bag can hold wet or soiled clothes (not diapers), but has to be hand-washed afterwards.  Would like the straps to be a bit wider, or attached differently, so that the weight is distributed a bit more comfortably on the shoulder.  However, if all you're doing is putting it in the car and taking it out again that's not much of a problem.
B002KOQGTI|5|I love this set! It's beautiful, durable, and well made. It went perfectly with the style I was trying to obtain in my little girl's nursery. I love that the pink is a soft rose color so it's something different than all that baby pink you usually find and more elegant. I have two windows in her nursery though, so I did have to order an extra valence. The valence was well worth the extra money though because they just really add to the room. I definitely recommend this set!
B004GCJMI4|5|I purchased several different types of locks to find the one that worked best for us and this was it! I love this. The magnet is strong, it's easy (VERY EASY) to install, and can be installed with a sticker or screws. After buying an initial two pack I bought enough to lock all cabinets in the house.<br /><br />One of the features I like is the installed and unlock feature. This means that if you have these installed they don't have to be locked if they are in a drawer you are going to be using frequently and the kid is not around.<br /><br />One of the down sides is that finding the correct placement for the magnet to engage the lock so the drawer can be opened, can be difficult. I used a little masking tape to mark the location. This is especially helpful for when the in-laws babysit which they do for a couple hours each week.<br /><br />Some reviews have mentioned that when pulled with a little force the locks slip past the latch. This is true, but only if the latch is installed backwards. The latch has two sides one side is straight and the other side has a slight curve (this is to make closing easy as it will push the lock down). If you notice the cabinet opens even though the lock and latch are in place...look at the latch to make sure it is installed facing the correct way with the straight edge facing IN and the curved edge facing OUT.<br /><br />This is a great product, VERY easy to install, and VERY easy to use!
B003JJX2IG|5|GREAT
B0000BUSS6|2|First of all I am a firm believer in Britax carseats and was so excited to see the Wizard with the head protectors.  I own a Roundabout for my daughter and love it.  I recently bought a Wizard for my husbands truck.  In the store we tried the seat with our 2 1/2 year old.  The head protectors did not bother her at all.  When we got home and was strapping her in, we pulled the velcro up to tighten the straps.  She saw how it worked and then pulled the velcro up herself and and pulled the release lever.  Automatically she loosened the shoulder straps.  I was heart broken.  I have to take it back now.  All the new models are made this way.  So I won't be able to buy one.  My roundabout from 2 years ago is made with a button to release the straps.  A little harder to release for me but I never feared she could release them herself.  I hope Britax corrects this problem.
B007RF987C|5|Ordered these from Babiators.com and love them.  They are not a hard plastic, there is a slight rubbery feel to them.<br />  They come with a great warranty, I lost a pair and babiator replaced them free of charge.  Now if I can only get my daughter to wear them I'd be a happy dad.  I would recommend these glasses.  They fit well protect eyes well great warranty and are easy on the face.
B0075P3TRO|4|They did great. Beautiful colors
B00DJPGL42|5|I don't leave baby sleeping on this rocking bed for the whole night, but I really cannot leave without it.<br /><br />After night feeding, I will put baby there for 10-20mins then move him to the crib, so he won't spit up milk.<br /><br />It is light weight. Move it from living room to bed room is very easy.<br /><br />Also, when we go to friend's house, we bring this one too. It is much easier than bring a portable play yard.
B000JIHP88|5|my kid loves it.. the music, the the moving animals,are great...<br />if can come with more different music will be even better..<br />overall, great product
B002C30S96|5|This backpack is just too cute, it fits my (big) 2 1/2 year old very well with room to grow. He loves it.
B01079CSQW|5|Both my niece and nephew are getting into the teething stage. This causes them to drool a lot leading to wet uncomfortable clothing. I was very happy to test out these bibs on them.    The first thing I noticed, these are no your typical bibs. They are more like fashion statements rather then bibs. They come in amazing colors and patters for both boys and girls.    In addition to the cuteness, these bibs feel amazing. They are really soft on the skin. They are not your typical scratch bib backed with plastic. The backs feel as soft as velvet. I can actually let my nephew crawl around in the bib alone.    The best part, the close has two snaps so this bib is size adjustable.    Bottom line, these bibs are a great choice. They are cute, feel great and are organic. It will make a great baby shower gift as well.    I received these bibs in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are mine and were in no way influenced by outside sources. I am a professional blogger/product reviewer at [...]
B006W9MDB2|4|Easy to setup and install. Arm rests are great and cup holder is actually functional. Looks very comfortable for my son.
B003VRER58|5|We tried fuzzibunz, thirsties, bummis, kissas, and grovia - Bumgenius is far and away the best.   They stay dry, fit well, growing as the baby grows (although they are a little bulky at first, but still not as bad as kissas, bummis or fuzzibunz for that). They clean well and dry fast. Baby seems to like them and we do to. Done.
B007N6PWUM|1|Very disgusted with is, I had it a day and the zipper broke on it and won't fix, was a wast of money
B001PTGPXQ|5|I have 4 of these step stools (3 Disney, 1 Sesame), and I use them for a foot rest when<br />playing my guitars around the house.<br />They are the perfect height to bring one leg up to rest the<br />guitar bout on, and are much steadier (Will hold my weight at 185 Lbs, and a fraction of the cost) than the official fold up type foot rests that the music shops sell.<br />The graphics also bring me back down to earth, and I realize, I still have a lot to learn. :>)
B00073HJG8|5|I bought this to help display ribbons it stretches nicely and can get several ribbons on it to had flare to a wall.
B00AYHKW5M|4|This is a cute crib mobile that is soothing and delightful.  My son is 18 months old so he is always trying to yank at the mobile when he stands up.  However, he loves the piano.  It's nice that it can be used as an individual toy once the mobile is no longer an option.  I can't use this as a mobile because he stands up in his crib and will destroy it but he loves the piano.  The mobile spins and the animals pop up and down to simulate peek a boo.  I don't know if that really helps a child develop object permanence, but Tiny Love claims it does.  It feels quite sturdy and durable.  It is easy to choose the different melodies and set the volume when I lean over into the crib.  I will be using this as a mobile once I have my little girl in the crib.  It's great to be able to get more use out of it since it is a 2 in 1.  I would recommend this to any new parent.
B0019RMZI8|3|Just so you know, this is NOT made or marketed by Sprig Toys... looks like a cool item though.
B00LYCR718|5|Excellent product. Thanks...A+++
B00AFWJ1R6|5|These swaddlers are time savers when it comes to getting your baby swaddled and work fantatstic!
B003LQQGE4|5|Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my five month old son.  He smiled and squealed the first time we put him in it.  He is seven months now and still enjoys this busy toy.  He even gets mad sometimes when I take him out of it.  He can play without getting bored or tired for an hour at a time, although I try to limit him to twenty minutes at a time.  I like that he can entertain himself long enough for me to get household tasks done.  I would recommend and buy this toy again.
B00BTFWKKS|5|I bought this as a gift and this bag can be used for anything just like it mentioned in the description
B00BJY1LEA|4|Bag was awesome. Arrived sooner than I expected and it was very cute! I loved all the pieces and the color was exactly as the picture showed. Can't go wrong with this bag.
B00JF8S9RO|5|This bib is so pretty you'll hate to stain it!
B002TUTJL0|5|After reading everything about the evils of crib bumpers we avoided all of those fancy, plush, overpriced bedding sets and went with this product. It became obvious at a certain point that we would need some sort of bumper when our daughter was regularly sticking a limb through her crib slats. This product has done the job we expected of it and provided the bonus of containing pacifiers within the crib. I never once worried about safety issues and it fit our portable crib perfectly.
B0084TNLTQ|3|Definitely not as good as the real thing.
B002VX0A40|5|This was a gift for my 11-month-old niece, and her mom reports that it's been renamed Boom and being dragged all over the house. That's a great review in my book!
B000CSBP3G|5|Practical, very good.
B00MIBUZHW|5|Fabulous! Wonderful teething item for my granddaughter. Wish they had these when my children were little.
B002J4U8L6|5|Fun to look at photos of relatives we don't see very often. Love that the pages are plastic so they can be chewed on.
B001W2YCG8|5|I really love this mattress.  It has two sides - one for newborns and one for toddlers.  It's seamless and thus waterproof and most important, all natural, organic and non-toxic.  My toddler has slept soundly on this since he was moved to the big crib, and standard crib sheets fit.  It is a bit heavier than most crib mattresses, but that's a small price to pay for such quality.
B0007GDOF0|1|I called them to see if they make another bracket that would fit the newer style cribs, and was basically told \\"tough luck\\".  glad I wasted $40 on this thing.  make sure you have tiny top rails, or this thing wont fit your crib either!!
B00957RT1M|1|Very poor quality. Dull shapes, no texture or sound. Many of the shapes were very large, much too large for a small child to handle. Stitching and material were also very poor quality. Not age appropriate design.
B000262HNU|3|This only fits five (5) Dr. Browns glass bottles (4 oz) with silicone sleeves. I have to angle the 6th bottle at the top over the other bottles.  Cannot fit ice pack once all bottles are in place.<br /><br />Does fit six (6) Evenflow (4 oz) bottles with sleeves just fine.<br /><br />Would not purchase this again if offered.
B004B7790M|1|Even after reading all bad reviews I decided to take the risk and buy this. Bad decision!! Indeed the item arrived in a plastic bag, not sealed, and cracked, which makes it impossible to use. And... it's pretty clear after looking at the product itself that this is not an original Medela part... in case you're wondering!
B003HIXOF0|4|Was hard yo but together direction not well written
B008J1QP7Y|5|This seems to be durable and of good quality. My son will play with this happily for a while. He wasn't at all interested when I got it at 4 months, but now at 6 months he loves it!
B0017KHFD2|5|I bought two of these to donate to a local non-profit charity I volunteer for.  Quality was outstanding and the price on amazon was much less than a local store.  The cribs seem very sturdy and should last a long time.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B00I3WEXUA|5|5 star
B001KAIZJW|5|These are the best invention, they work great!  This is now my signature baby gift for showers. Everyone always loves them!
B001CXDAJW|5|I wanted a blue blanket with trim.  My daughter lost a favorite blue blanket  and this was the closest match.  She didn't even realize the beloved blanket had been replaced.  She was just thrilled to hold this one. The material holds up great in the wash.  Super soft.
B0031Y146G|4|I bought this to prevent my dog from getting into my pull-out garbage cabinet.  As other reviewers have said, it's too short for most applications since it can only be used where there are no other cabinets or drawers to block the latch.  Luckily my garbage is at the end of the island so there is a way to install it where no other cabinets interfere with its use.  Even then, although I have no problems opening the cabinet, my husband who has big fingers can barely get to it.<br /><br />It's really sturdy, I love that you only have one piece to install, and the spring design is great.  I knocked off a star for the shortness since I cannot use the other 3 in the package because of how short they are.  But I am happy that my dog can't get into the garbage anymore......as long as we remember to close it!
B003XMWFBE|2|The pockets are too small to hold anything useful, and they just sort of hang open... It might work for someone else but it didn't work for us
B000IG6I3Y|5|Seems to be just right for my vintage cradle
B00003XAKP|5|Makes changing the sheets sooo easy!
B005HP6ZB6|5|No complaints. Exactly as described. It's quite small, but works well for having the backup diaper station anywhere in the house.
B00H2LC7ZG|5|My two year old son loves this bed!!
B00DZ0MAD2|5|These nose wipes work well with our sensitive baby girl. She didn't have a reaction to them, and she doesn't mind us using them on her.
B009L1VWCO|5|Worth every penny! Almost didn't buy it because pricey but glad I did! Every vegetable and fruit I've made comes out perfect. Baby loves the smooth texture!
B0007KMUFG|5|I bought my first one of these car seats in 2006 and a second one 6 months later after we fell in love with the first. I bought this model primarily for the price (under $100 since I needed one for each of our cars), it was one of the few seats that would fit in my back seat rear-facing (Jeep Liberty), and it seemed well-padded and gender neutral if I had need for that in the future.  I loved it and have had it ever since!  My daughter is now 4 (of average height and weight for her age) and still sits in it without any problems.  I wash the cover and pads at least 4 times a year and haven't had one problem with them.  By the way, the pads are easy to get off and put back on and it's no problem at all to re-thread the straps.  The car seat is super-easy to install (a couple of minutes) and does not budge AT ALL (when using the latch system).  I lost the cup holder and called the manufacturer to order a replacement and it was super easy with great customer service.  When I was pregnant with my son in February of 2009, I didn't even buy a new car seat or use my carrier car seat; I simply used my \\"extra\\" car seat from my daughter and put them both in my primary car!  We are big fans of this car seat!
B002HMC2AU|3|The changing table is good given the price and the storage is really nice but the directions don't detail how/when to put in the base of the changing area so you'll end up taking it apart which is hard on the cheapish wood. But it was inexpensive and the perfect temp changing table for us until we buy a house.
B000F1OAE6|5|I would strongly recommend this product for anyone. It is easy to intall in the car or many cars if you have to move it.  It is very adjustable, convienent to change for heighth positions, comfortable for the children and easy to clean.  The harness fits very well and hold the child securely.  I have two of these for both my children since the first one loves her so much.  They are also great because they have the roof teather which makes you feel like they are even more secure.  Have used in my 1973 Duster, 2002 Jeep and other vehicles with no problems.  Makes me feel safer knowing my children are safe.
B00JTTBH32|3|It was really difficult to work with. Took me two full nights to cut it all out and then I had to glue some of it to the wall because it wasn't very sticky. I don't recommend this product
B00HFXYHEA|4|This is a very affordable swaddled that works well for my granddaughter. She has to really work at getting a fist out.
B00BUD6VKO|4|I absolutely LOVE the Puj Hug: the material is beautiful, the hood actually **fits** a baby's head (a rate feat for some strange reason!), and it's super practical.... the only downside about it and why I gave it four stars is because I still find it too small. The big puj hug would have been just the right size, this one might protect mama-and-daddy from getting wet when taking baby out of the tub, but it's too small to actually wrap the baby up at the same time. So unless you really want to be able to tie the towel around your neck, I suggest going with the next size up which you could also use longer.
B00MEU4X5C|5|Like it
B007ZZCRLS|5|I love these. perfect size to get all my babies little socks and little hand mittens and little hats in. The smaller one, I use it for all my breastpads and breastfeeding bras.
B004OR1DUQ|5|These are very cute. Bought 2 of these for my grand twins, and 1 extra. They haven't used them yet, but they seem to be a good size. Year old twins, that are used to sippy cups already, but I like modern unusual things. Also says that they are upper rack dishwasher safe, and 9 oz is a nice size. Should be easy for their little hands to hold, and not easy to spill! They come in such cute colors! And if you get more than one color you can mix and match the caps.
B002VUCB72|1|I sent this to my mother to use when she takes care of my 1 year old daughter.  Unfortunately, the package arrived opened and without directions.
B002WB2GAM|5|but i send it back because my son didnt fit it and the straps was tight but its a great stroller i had the black one when he was smaller.
B00IIFLCFQ|1|Super thin. I ordered Alva Baby diaper covers that came with inserts, but I ordered these so that I could have extra inserts. A waste of money...I should have just ordered more of the Alva Baby inserts
B004RJS09S|3|I bought these straws online from toys r us when I saw they were $1.99. Shipping costs can be a lot if you're only ordering a set or two of these straws, but it can be cheaper for you if you're buying several.
B001MS82HM|1|I purchased this breast pump for my grand-daughter.  She did not have enough suction to extract one drop of milk.  She tried using it a number of times to no avail.  She is not large busted and from a good number of reviews it sounded like it would be the type of pump she would be comfortable with.  It wasn't.  We returned it and ordered the Lansinoh.  This one is so much better for just a little more.  It's a better value, better investment.
B0009PEV2Y|4|This is a great item, but it didn't get much use at our house. Baby #1 went from supported sitting to sitting on his own very quickly, so I only had the chance to put him in it a few times. He also has super chunky legs, so he was a tight fit pretty quickly. Something to consider if your little one has the cute chubbies...  Overall though, it is a great item. Heavy duty, easy to clean, etc. He did enjoy playing in it the few times it was used. Also used the tray attachment to put toys on, which was very handy.  Only complaint would be that it was tricky taking the tray attachment off with baby in the seat (to get the baby out), but I could have just been doing that wrong.
B001V9EVCM|4|Product is great, the only problem is that it has a glue on the lid and in part if the system to keep it properly displayed on the box that takes a lot to clean, I even used alcohol and even with that it was hardly removed
B00GFU97LW|5|We just put together the crib tonight - super easy assembly.  I saw Munire cribs at BuyBuyBaby and did some research and landed on this one.  It turned out to be a good decision.  The color is white just as described.
B00N897M5Q|5|Works well. The bag comes with an extra set of deluxe suction cups that stay stuck to the wall even when my five year old tugs on the bag.
B00K9UNQPC|1|Alert!  McPolos/Fulfilled by U-Essae = false advertising.  Not made in USA.  Parents know silicone bibs are sold through  different sellers on Amazon. We waded through different prices, styles & quality of similar bib offerings.  McPolos/U-Essae lists \\"USA\\" as country of origin under Product Details. We've paid more for their bib, to avoid sellers who honestly list made in \\"China\\" & sold silicone bibs for less, or came with free extras (baby spoons, etc). As suspected, McPolos package arrived, & states \\"Made in China.\\"  The seller was already suspect - - just read their  dramatic claims in the product detail with zero support evidence --how their bibs last longer than Baby Bjorn; how sellers using french names are somehow knockoffs, & how you don't really want xtra, free spoons that come with the competition's bib, do ya? Also, someone who seems connected to the seller or who is the seller, leaves strange, emotional attack comments on negative reviews (if a bib didn't work for baby, she must have a \\"behavior problem\\" & how dare the reviewer down-rate the product -- really silly, immature stuff for a supposedly reputable business). But deceiving parents isn't silly, it's unethical, & we're reporting it. Trusting both the product materials & seller honesty is part of a review, especially when talking babies & safety -- 1 star is generous for the trouble to return.  If parents prefer this bib to the competition that also buttons in the back just like this one, go for it.  But don't be dissuaded from lower cost sellers because you trust that you're paying extra for made in the USA, if that's your deciding factor. Seller has likely strategized to leave this deception uncorrected & expand the profits per hour, until we parents call you on it.  Profit fairly, not off of false advertising.
B001G4RWG4|3|Great price but my son hated these.
B007Q7BUMW|1|This is ok not what I had Originally ordered so I can't say much a out it Because it's not what I wanted to begin with
B000066CMV|1|The small valve pops up so frequently that it is really not able to finish one session.
B0074Q4ID8|5|Solid, excellent product in every way. Great looking and versatile. Not easy for squirmy baby to get out of. Really fine item.
B007JVX47E|4|returned. duplicate
B006ZVV0NO|5|Sticks on to the windows readily and works as expected. It fits my SUV as well.<br />Got it shipped overnight.
B000CP2X9O|5|These are good bibs. Compared to the other bibs we have, I think these are the best quality. The colors are nice and vibrant and the velcro sticks forever. They seem well made. They are more absorbent than any of the other bibs we have tried that are made of terry cloth.
B009Z4W5WS|5|I had a hard time picking out a diaper bag, but this one really is great.  I was afraid I wouldn't like the big open area in the middle, but it works well.  The inside elastic pockets are big enough that one of them can hold most of my purse needs, along with the misc pockets and spots on the outside.
B009MPH4IK|5|LOVE this cup. we have had it now for about 6 months and it has held up great. she is able to get every last sip! i definitely recommend it.
B001AXF5EC|4|This works well for keeping my toddler in range.  The best part, however, is the fact that she also enjoys wearing it.  She calls it her lion backie packie. I didn't give it five stars because I would like to be able to hook it to more than just the bottom of the backpack.
B00BLBLR1I|5|This is the best pump, ever. I used to be so nervous to pump because I got so little with my Avent Pump and it hurt. This pump is so comfortable (well, as comfortable as pumping can be!) and I feel like it actually WORKS. As in, I pump enough at work to keep my son completely fed and happy while I'm away... with a freezer full of milk to spare! It fits all my old Avent collection bottles, so there has been very little waste for me. I struggled with low milk supply with my first child, so I can say that this pump lives up to what it says it does. LOVE.
B00NUJ0K58|5|exactly as described shipped on time.
B00913DY3W|5|Hard to teeth areas. My baby loves it.
B003SWZVG0|1|The little  fingers are so short it does not even clenched the Mike residue
B000BNQC58|4|I think my husband liked it more than my daughter! haha!<br />It gives a nice soothing light, it looks nice on the ceiling.
B00H57F2B8|5|I just got this in today and used it today and I am in LOVE!  My son will be 5 months in a few days and he loves to sit up and look around. While other cart covers are nice nothing holds his up right. Even the ones that have straps over the shoulders don't keep him up because they are not attached to the back part. But the seat Positioner he sits great in here. He does not fall over at all. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this. Best money I have spent!<br />ps this cart was a two seater cart too and it still fit.
B000095S69|5|Even though I don't have kids, I think this set is a great gift for expectant mothers. It's colorful and amazing.
B001T5UWVC|5|Good product for the price. All the guests complimented on how &#34;cute&#34; and &#34;unique&#34;.  Also something everyone uses...stick it notes!!
B000QWA9F8|5|Great bag! This bag has protected our umber stroller on flights all over the world. It does look pretty rough now and has a tear or two, but my stroller is in great condition! And it's super easy to spot when you get off the plane. Great purchase. Worth the money.
B006N1KKGO|4|This ended up looking wonderful in the nursery with gray walls. The gray on the walls matched the dark gray on the blanket. But as the other person said, it is not as pictured. The blanket is beige and not gray, but still a beautiful set. This is my 3rd girl and I am soooo sick of pink and purple. This is a nice compromise as it is still girl with the flowers and the birds, but not tuity fruity pink! I love it!
B00EVTEZDY|5|Love this blanket, it's super soft, washes and dries well.
B003UTUEOU|5|I have to have a body pillow to sleep whether I am pregnant or not.  I had a regular body pillow that always is uncomfortable the further along I get (pregnant with our 4th).  I always thought about getting one of these and boy I wish I did before now.  It perfectly keeps you aligned without taking up too much space.  I like that I can fold it and use it as a prop-pillow to watch TV in bed too.  I use my regular pillow still for my head with the Boppy pillow and it is comfortable.  I like a lot of pillows when I sleep.  I recommend this to everyone.  Great buy that you won't regret!
B000IDSLOG|1|Not worth the money. It is just a squeaky dog toy...and my son doesn't even use it to teeth. He just squeaks it and throws it to the dogs.
B0034G5UZC|5|I haven't had my child yet, so I haven't been able to do a lot with the book. Nonetheless, I must admit that I am very excited to start putting pictures in the book and I really love the fact that it is set up in such an organized fashion! Also, I absolutely adore the colors. I would recommend this book to any new or expecting parents =)
B001G4YULO|5|Seems like there's a wipe for everything these days!
B00292ZTWQ|2|Everything about the idea of this toy is great - kids can sort first by shape, then by color, then by size. My eighteen-month-old has had this for about six months, but has only recently begun to show interest in it. He puts the shapes in their places . . . but the pentagons easily fit into the circle holes and vice versa. It's a design flaw. I'm on Amazon today shopping for a replacement shape sorter.
B00477ND0Q|3|We really wanted to like this thing but in the end it did not work for our child. The product also was difficult to lock open.
B005I6MJ96|1|Stay away from this set. After searching for days for a crib bedding set for my baby, I thought I found what I am looking for. But what a disappointment! The set shrunk after washing it even though I followed the instructions on the tag. Every item in that set came out so wrinkled that it looked hideous. Lot of the stitching came apart so I am waiting for my mom to come over to sew it again for me. The bumper comes in four pieces and they are not big enough to cover the entire area so you end up with openings at every corner which defeats the purpose of a bumper.  The quality of the fabric is horrible and is not for babies at all, the blue fitted crib sheet is so harsh for a newborn skin.I would not recommend this product at all and I would advise every mom to stay away from it. I would love to return it but in order for me to get a full refund, it should have been returned in the original package and unwashed. It was after I washed it that I discovered how bad this set is so now I am stuck with it.
B00B1M2U7W|5|Love this sleepsack!  My daughter was put into a Pavlik harness for hip dysplasia at 3 months old and Halo sleepsacks are the only sleepsacks wide enough to accommodate the &#34;froggy&#34; position her legs must be maintained in.  She should be in a small due to her size, but we had to buy a medium to accommodate the harness.  Despite it being too big the sack doesn't cover her face at all.  It's warm and cozy without being too heavy.  We have another Halo sleepsack in fleece, but this material fleece seems to be much thinner than our other sleepsack (that's a good thing).  Both seem equally as warm.  It doesn't hurt that the ladybug print is extra cute.  I highly recommend this!
B00BM66BM2|5|Our daughter is tall for three weeks (she is in the 90th percentile) so the large size actually fits her just fine, with lots of room for her legs & feet. She weighs 10 pounds so she is a big baby, and this sack will be too large for smaller babies her age. We love this sleep sack. The owl print is adorable, and the solid purple is a nice color.  :)
B000VZKGYY|3|My kid absolutely loves this light, and I think it's cute too. My problem is that the thing runs through batteries like nothing I've ever seen. This is our third one, since the two before malfunctioned, but all three burned through batteries at a crazy rate. We have to change them about once every month. If the company made this so you could choose to plug it in or use batteries, it would get 5 stars. But the battery issue is just too annoying and wasteful.
B00G5JWON6|5|I used every bottle for my first born, just to get a good feel for the differences and the way that my daughter would take to them. After multiple brands, these are the ONLY bottles that I used for my son, and now for my 2nd daughter. They are great and do a wonderful job at keeping the air (gas) at bay. Also, they are easy to assemble and care for. Three parts vs four or five make for an easy no nonsense assemblage.
B002A9JCVW|5|i absolutely LOVE this drying rack. it's affordable and has fun earthy theme (super cute!), AND has lots of holes and spaces for all the tiny parts you may encounter.<br /><br />however, there are some cons - just not ones that bother me very much;<br /> -not a lot of space for bottles themselves. there are twelve branches, but you probably need two racks to put ALL of your bottles on.<br /> -difficult to turn without holding the base, HOWEVER, it's not all that terrible to just turn the whole thing. ultimately it does the same thing.<br /><br />definitely an excellent investment. compared to the[[ASIN:B000RFBW00 Munchkin Deluxe Drying Rack]], this wins hands down.
B00009IMCK|5|My 4 month old loves to hold this and twist it around. Keeps her busy.
B001JD7TH4|2|We just got this mattress and I'm worried about using it for the baby because it does NOT seem as firm as crib mattresses are supposed to be. It has 150 coils which is supposed to be sufficient but I wish I had looked for more than 200 coils. Also, the fact this mattress' inner materials are \\"organic\\" is pointless because it's entirely wrapped in some kind of plastic! And the label doesn't tell you what kind of plastic, at a time when parents want to know what kind of plastic is in their baby's products. If you want a truly organic mattress spring for the expensive Naturepedic one. I was trying to save money when I bought this one thinking I'd found an affordable alternative but I only got what I paid for.
B005IWM9AO|5|I like this product sooo much that I bought two of them.  One for my daughter who is having the baby and one for me because I will be babysitting my grand daughter.  Back in the day when I was having babies we had big and bulky high chairs.  The shipping was really fast and I thank Amazon for that.
B00NSJ8QWY|5|I bought it few months ago when my daughter turned 1 year.Previously,she was crying all the time when i put her in her car seat.Now she is always happy and smiles all the time.It is really comfortable and looks much better than the previous one.
B001GQ2SA2|3|I love the projection feature of this mobile but the remote only works half of the time and there isn't an on-off switch on the mobile. Can be very confusing for grandparents or babysitters to try and figure out.
B004L28TII|5|So I had this item on my wish list for 2 months.  My little girl loves mickey and loves squirters so it's a win win right!  Well I just couldn't get past paying $30, so it took me a little bit to finally purchase them.  Let me just say its worth the money, my 1 year old loves them!  They are bigger and thicker than normal bath squirters.
B003D3ML44|2|I loved the look of this dresser, but that's where the love ends.  It was an absolute nightmare to put together (took 4 hours).  The directions were wrong on several occassions!  Luckily we were able to figure that out and basically had to put the whole thing together without the directions!  The piece looks nice now that it's together but the drawers are shallow and don't open and close smoothly.  We also can't get the door to align right so it's slightly crooked.  I'm pretty disappointed with this piece.
B007SIZR82|4|We replaced all the nipples on our bottles with these when baby girl was almost 3 months. Now at 5 months, they are prone to collapsing when she is hungry. Most of the time, they work fine and they are easy to clean.
B0015ZQHRO|5|I love, love, love the latch system on this.  Our state recently changed car seat laws and childen over 8 have to be in boosters.  This is perfect for my 7 year old son.
B0050GD2EA|5|We're due in June and are glad we made this purchase - fits well w/stroller as it should and should keep baby nice & dry from the rain.
B009ZWUQ94|1|Nice product in terms of BPA free and looked good but my 18 month old had a hard time with it.  More liquid on her than in her mouth.  She does much better with an actual cup or sippy cup.  I would not recommend it.
B00005YWN0|4|It is nice to be able to turn of the monitor and see our son.  We can tell if he is asleep yet or still awake.  The only problem with this monitor his the sound feature.  It is very staticy and we turnted it off.  We bought the Sony monitor for sound.
B00AHQADD6|3|This is ok, but we are finding it wasn't necessary to have since we also have a boppy pillow.  We used it with our newborn for two weeks, at that point, she'd fuss when set in it and seems to prefer the boppy pillow.  I will say a close friend had a premie and her little girl used it for 3-4 months.
B0014JF8GW|5|I LOVE my diaper bag! I got it a few days ago and was so excited to open the box! It has tons of space, which is exactly what I wanted since I'm actually using this for cloth diapering with our fuzzibunz on the go. I also didn't want to get something that looked like a diaper bag and just looked like a big purse, I got exactly what I wanted and more! Very very happy with this purchase! Also it's not floppy at all, it comes with a hard bottom insert that you can actually remove for easy storage.
B000VVIHPS|4|This clock has worked wonderfully in teaching our 21-month old when it's sleep time and when it's time to get up! Every morning and night we visually and verbally confirm the bunny's status and reinforce morning/wake up and nighttime/ bedtime. This is a great product as far as I'm concerned!
B003CUXV0Q|5|I bought this for our daughter's Pack-n-Play.  It fits perfect in the hanging \\"upper\\" net for when baby is tiny and not sitting up, but since it's three inches thick, I decided to go ahead and transition to the bottom of the P-n-P for nap time because she's 4 months and rolling around A LOT.  It's not as wide as the P-n-P, but I just rolled up one of the many baby quilts I had and tucked it in to make the fit snug (see my pic).  It really is \\"just right\\" as far as the firmness--not too soft, not to hard.
B004B762AK|2|I really wanted to love this monitor because it has some great features that our old Summer Infant Slim and Secure doesn't have.  Which, by the way, worked great for us for 2 1/2 years.  Our second child is due in less than a month, so instead of buying an extra camera, we upgraded to this monitor with 2 cameras.  The features are great and would have been wonderful for keeping an eye on our toddler now in a bed, but the signal strength is VERY poor.  It actually works everywhere in our house except our bedroom- which is the farthest point from the baby room, but well within the 400ft range.  We tried adjusting the camera but nothing worked to improve the signal.  As another reviewer noted, it does not alert you when the signal goes out so you have no way of knowing your child is unmonitored if you are sleeping.  We learned this the first night when we woke up an hour later than usual because there was no signal on the monitor and we couldn't hear our daughter crying.
B0042D69V0|5|even though he doesn't reacvh the floor yet.  a big pillow helps him stand and bounce.  This was a great gift.
B00427NXC4|5|Have a breast pump that the charger broke on.  Instead of buying a new one, was able to just buy the charger.  Very useful and good price.
B001DK8CFG|5|Exactly what I needed. My daughter loves it - no more complains and cries about her feet falling asleep because she was sitting on them. I put off buying it for some time because of the price - I kept thinking I could find something for less, but never did. Finally caved and got it. Dinner is so much more pleasant now.
B0010XTI5Y|4|These seats are great but way too expensive.  It's not made of diamonds for goodness sake and you can only use it for a certain short period of time.  If you have a big fat baby, you can't use it at all--her chubby legs will be too big for the leg holes.  And once your baby learns to sit on her own, you don't need it at all, so the cost is almost $10/month.<br />It is very sturdy and the colors are cute.  They make great hand-me-downs as they stand up to a lot of use.  If you know someone who owns one but doesn't need it anymore, maybe they'll pass it on to you.  I don't see why not.
B000KJBFC8|5|The Star Kids Travel Tray is great.  My 20 month old loves using this tray in the car to play with toys and to read books.  While she hasn't gotten the hang of the side pockets yet, the tray's edge keeps everything from falling so she is much happier.  I expect to be able to use it for years and years.  We are going on an international flight soon, and I plan on taking it along as it is much better than the trays they provide.
B00QZ6EHF2|5|Love this necklace!!  So does the baby:)  It's stylish and does not pull hair.  I like the length too.  Easy to clean.  I bought this for my daughter-in-law, she loves it too.  We both use it, would definitely recommend.
B00JGNYQIO|5|Love it, go-to warm sleep sack for frigid winters. Soft and cozy.
B00PF84ANA|5|2 application was one I happened to arrive one same one more missing, please send
B00U5U2BFM|5|Bought these for my teen son's room and he loves them. Very good looking on a light colored wall!!
B0093Y0IJ2|5|We are just starting to potty train our daughter.  She loves Elmo, so I knew this would be an instant hit!  We got it out of the box easily and assembly is just pushing the tank part onto the seat part - about 2 seconds of work.  We placed it in the bathroom and she giggled in delight when she saw Elmo on the potty.  She sat down and played with the flusher which makes a flushing sound or says, &#34;Hooray!&#34;  The fact that she actually WANTS to sit on it is a big plus in the potty training area and I hope this helps us get her trained quickly.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a toddler that loves Elmo.
B00PJRBUEY|5|My 2-year-old LOVES his new pillow! It's the perfect amount of cushion!
B0038J7XTQ|3|We have this set since my boy was 6m old. The set is so-so.<br /><br />Stacking cups is the only toy there that doesn't have any flaws. Moreover, the cups have little animals on top and baby likes to chew and lick them.<br /><br />The bear stacker is made of very thin plastic, very lightweight and doesn't stay straight and in place when baby tries to put the rings on. My 13m old boy has smashed one ring flat recently. The only fun there is to toss rings around. We use Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Rock-a-Stack instead of this stacker.<br /><br />Shape sorter is an advanced toy, and my 13 months old has figured out how to play with it just recently. It's sturdy.
B002SZRN1O|5|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this bag.  I've used it everyday now for 7 months and it's still in great shape!  The pockets are genius... I think I may even have an empty one and I use this as my purse as well as for my baby.  Perfect size, great looking, and definitely worth the extra money.
B000I2MRLK|5|I bought this for my daughter when she was 2 months old.  She didn't do much, but she liked to look at it.  She's 4 months now and she LOVES it.  I hang it on her swing's mobile and she swats at it, I hold her in my lap and hold it for her and she grabs it, chews on it, throws it around.  Plus, I love it!  It's so adorable and brightly colored with fun textures to help my baby explore her world.
B00NBJWB6S|5|LOVE this baby brush for my newborn. The price seemed a little high compared to the other baby brushes available, but as a hairdresser I had to have the best for my new baby and after reading the other wonderful reviews I had to give this a try. I found this brush to be totally worth it, the quality is wonderful. There is absolutely no shedding of the bristles, and the bristles are so soft on a newborn's head, yet stiff enough to smooth out crazy bed head. Would definitely recommend this baby brush.
B00BMMOL3C|5|This is the best, softest, most versatile blanket around. My sons is two years old and still in perfect condition after so many washings. It's large, light weight, and covers the entire car seat when theyre young, and covers their whole bodies in the stroller when theyre older
B000EGZ40G|5|This is an excellent idea for pumping moms.  It takes up very little space in your fridge or freezer.  The bottles hooked right onto my pump.
B000324Y7A|5|This bouncy seat has kept my 4 month-old daughter happy since she was born.  I used to use the toy arch all the time and it kept her occupied while I showered, cooked, etc.  I seriously don't know how I would have showered without it!  I like the fact that the music can be either played continuously or activated by the baby.  Now that she's older, I often remove the toy bar so that I can play with her while she sits in the seat.  We often take it with us when visiting, so I just wish that it was collapseable.  But that may be a problem with all bouncy seats.
B00116ZUWK|5|Not sure why there are so many complaints about this cup!  I purchased this for my son a couple of YEARS ago, and have had no trouble. It was slightly difficult to assemble the first time, but once I put it together a couple of times it was simple. The straw works and has always worked fine, and while I originally cleaned it by allowing hot water to run through, I soon discovered there are small cleaning brushes designed for sippy cups and they work wonders! (See the product insert I've included.) I use those brushes for all of my kids cups, but especially these straws. We have never had a leak, and it is my sons' go to cup. The only trouble now is that the picture on the outer layer has worn off, and I'm having trouble finding a replacement. I don't know why this three pack is listed for $60, that is too much. Otherwise, this product is great![[ASIN:B00386KEEK Sippy Straw Cleaner]]
B005UV0UEA|5|I ordered the Graco Pack n Play on Saturday and it arrived on Monday! Talking about fast shipping! I am 3days away from my due date and i assembled and disassembled the crib easily without any problem. So far my husband and I love this crib! We hope our soon to-be son will love it too! Great online price with Amazon.
B00B9ZHU0S|5|My son has dropped these cups more times than I can count.  The cups just hit the ground and roll.  We have had them for over two months now and they still don't leak.  If your child is ready for a cup that doesn't have handles this is a good selection for the price.
B000XT30G4|5|I wanted to close off my kitchen and needed some thing that looked good and easy to get in and out of. I didn't buy this for children but for my dog as Im gone during the day and I didn't want to crate him the gates seemed perfect. Easy to install, look great, work as  advertised I've had them up for several months as of this writing and I could not be happier.
B001ARYDFA|4|Makes bath time fun, especially if you can dim the lights and have a few more so you can go completely party saurus Rex!! My son loves creating a tide pool in the bathtub making his little fish &#34;swim&#34; all around him!
B00FNZQHJA|5|perfect and delivered quick
B0030UUBMO|5|I wasn't sure if this mattress would fit in the Pack N'Play but it does and I think it's an excellent addition. I hated putting the baby on the thin, hard bottom of the baby's small bed so I ordered this mattress. It fits perfectly on the top section for newborns. It's just a little less wide than the actual bottom of the bed so right now I just roll up a bath towel and place it alongside. The baby's grandma doesn't even bother with the towel and has no problem. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their baby a little more comfortable when sleeping in the Pack N' Play.
B00IR4OXCW|5|came quickly and as expected
B00BZOF6T0|5|genia
B002SG773W|5|These bibs have been perfect for our twin bibs.  They work well at keeping the boys' outfits clean, are easy to clean and so portable to throw in the diaper bag to take on outings.
B00CJS9TO4|5|It makes life so much easier to have one of these! It's a little tight on the mattress but that just gives it a nice snug fit under the sheets.
B00KX1O78C|1|This is NOT and I repeat NOT a wall decal! I received today and yes it's large not like picture but large. This is wall paper you have to get wet and apply NOT a decal at all! Once applied can NOT come off
B009W6PM9M|5|Pros:<br />Organic Cotton<br />Soft on baby bottom<br />Nice size (only one wipe needed usually per change)<br />Great absorption<br /><br />Cons:<br />I don't have any<br /><br />Don't forget to prewash for great absorption. I pre-washed with my prefold diapers and they worked perfectly. Will be buying a lot more!
B001B1FHIC|5|It really saved our baby a lot of crying. Very happy with it. It works best with 2 people, one to use both hands to keep in place with gentle good seal (other wise our baby would take it off quickly) and the other person rinses the hair. Get one.
B008VWYLGS|5|Big on my 19 pound 5 month old but he'll grow i to it. Very soft and comfortable for him.
B00318CLTQ|5|GOOD!!!
B00913DY3W|5|My baby really enjoys gnawing on this teether. The spokes are shaped just like fingers and she likes chewing on them. The ring is easy for her to grasp. I like that it's a safe silicone material .
B007ZZCRJ0|2|These just arrived and the unopened box stunk like moth balls--opened, they stink to high heaven. I took them out of the plastic and put them in front of an open window in a closed room in hopes the hangers lose the horrid odor. The hangers are polka-dotted (light tan on dark tan) which if ok, but not expected or represented in the photo.
B00H8MQ7XC|4|I always have trouble with one hand folds. I have small hands. This stroller is so easy to open and close. It's a four star only because the under basket is too small.
B0000YVC4Y|5|This is a great kit it has everything you could possibly need. I don't use half of it but I'm sure I will in the future. The nail clippers are excellent, the cut very well and are thicker so I don't worry about cutting my son's fingers only his nails.
B0078LZHRK|5|Good buy for the money. My granddaughter loves the cupholder.
B002SW3EZQ|5|my grand baby loves them
B003GQ0LQ8|5|I have taken this product on a trip to california. It inflated quickly...you do have to blow on a valve to inflate...don't expect it to self inflate. However doing so is not difficult at all. It also deflates quickly when your storing it, rolls up and fits nicely in a small pouch. I also always make sure my 5 year old is secure so putting the seatbelt through the two red clips was easy for me to do...i wouldn't expect him to be able to do it on his own so those that want a seat the child can buckle into themselves may want to look elsewhere. but for the extreme convenience it brings on a trip just help your child buckle! I think my child is secure in this seat and fits him very well at 42in tall.
B004QZBEBY|5|It cleans each and every corner of most sippy cups especially the curved edges.<br /><br />Very happy with the purchase :)
B000K53U7K|5|We ended up buying two of these, one for me to use for my pumped milk at work, and one for my husband to keep milk at the bedside (since I work nights).  In the future, the cooler will probly work well for drinks on a picnic.
B000I2Q0C2|4|These are wicked cute for a baby that cant really play yet. My daughter liked the wrist bugs but could have cared less about the sock bugs. She kicked them off eventually without even really noticing they were there. Overall they are cute for the amount they cost. They're good enough so you feel like you're amusing your child even though they would probably be just as happy if you showed them your collection of hair accessories or perfume bottles.
B00005JIVI|4|I bought this for my pregnant niece, who also used one with her first child.  She requested another one, and they're not easy to find.   A safe and comfortable way to bathe and support baby.  No need for a portable tub.  Just set the pad in your bathtub.  Can be used for newborns and until baby is able to sit up on their own.
B00D736XV2|5|I bought 2 of them, but have not given them to the expectant moms yet.  I think they are really great. Will let you know when the babies are born and have had a chance to use them.  The idea is just perfect!!
B001ECDN0W|5|I purchased this pacifier chain for my daughter about 2 months ago (she is 9 months now).  She loves it!!! It's not only a good pacifier holder but a teether and a fun toy. It's especially great with Avent pacifiers with a cap.  Keeps the pacifier clean and close enough for a baby to use.  We use it sooo much that it did crack a bit on the head as another review wrote.  But, I understand why, most likely because I wash it a lot and my daughter drools on it as well and wood will crack after a while as it dries after being wet. However, this minor issue does take away the fact that it's a safe and usefull product for babies.  I'm already ordering a new one the \\"safari\\". Definately recommend this product.
B00AF73POG|5|Great item recommend to anyone!!
B002A9IZ0Q|5|This crib is great. It's well-built and what a great price. It's fairly easy to put together and sturdy and seems like it will last years.
B001GVIMR0|3|It didn't fit my pack and play mattress very well...a little small.  But got it to fit eventually.  Baby isn't here yet, so don't know yet how it performs.
B00005JIVI|5|I purchased this when my son was a newborn and 9 months later we are still using it. Very easy to clean and doesn't take up so much storage space as the plastic bath tubs. Can easily be dried and stored on a towel rack. I love it so much that I have given it to friends for their babies.
B00Q0TRP9E|2|Returned. Did not like the color
B00018XCS8|5|These can also be used to take baby food on the go!!
B0090OM1F4|4|Super cute but not for toddlers. Too small for toddlers, perfect for baby girls
B005MQRAAK|5|Amazing seat for my very tall son!
B00BJMXKVO|5|preeeeetty nice! install is not difficult at all. the product does a decent job of protecting the jamb it resides in, though quite a bit of pressure is required to keep everything in place. operation is a breeze, and the door swings right open. the locks / foot pedal feel secure enough to keep an infant from opening the gate. would recommend.
B000S8O9ME|2|would not stay on tile wall.went on tight then loosened and fell off.
B008818NDO|5|IT IS NICE<br />I LIKE THE COLOR<br />IT IS LIGHT AND THIS IS GOOD FOR THE KIDS<br />ALSO I LIKE THE DESIGN
B00CAWRL8U|5|Exactly what I wanted to have on hand.  The parts are identical to the original and will be helpful when I need to replace them.
B005BWXJKK|4|Stopped my LO from chewing the rail on her crib, I like this one over a plastic rail guard because (1) My baby is not eating plastic bits and (2) It is machine washable (for all that teething baby drool). Cribs are expensive! Protect you crib from your baby beaver.
B000BXKTMA|5|This was for my grandson and is very portable.  My daughter takes it on trips, both short and long.  My grandson loves it and uses it willingly every day.
B009SXI4E4|3|Very cute, but it'd be nice if the picture showed the whole bumper since the design is a little different than I expected. A little flimsy, too, but does the job.
B003V9PXE0|5|Everything came in time however when I opened my package of 25 standard flow nipples I was disappointed because there were a few infant slow flow that I can not use.   I've ordered since and my orders have been fulfilled correctly.
B00ATTWKIW|4|I've been using mine and they've been helpful during this hot, socal days! It's not that rubbers don't stick well on your windows, it's that the actual shield gets removed from the rubbers easily with a slight movement or by simply bumping into it. But it's not such a hassle to put it back together.
B002DN8HCK|5|Easy to clean! Our daughter loves this cup.
B00PTL86UG|5|I received these for a review, I love them! I have 4 younger children and they all want to use them when they eat soup or warm cereal. They love that they know when it's ok to eat. They are dishwasher and microwave safe which makes them even more helpful.
B007BEIKGO|5|We were very happy with these.  They fit perfectly, and she didn't mind wearing them.  She didn't try and take them off at all!  I wouldn't definitely recommend these.
B007461XI6|5|Got this to cover coffee table since our 7 month old is now pulling up on everything and bumping his head. Fit table good but not enough protection on the sides. I ended up buying those black foam pipe covers from Lowe's, slit them in half lengthwise, strapped them to edge of table, and put the cover over. Now the edges are padded and the cover fits even better! Wife is happy with protection so all is good
B00ACR8LCU|5|I absolutely love this wrap. The K'tan is easy to put on and put newborn in. My daughter is only 3 weeks (The youngest of three) right now and she loves the K'tan. She is in it daily and I have even completed vacuuming the entire house w/o a peep from her. I have a medium size (My baby is 7 pounds and I am 130lbs) and I hope It will fit once she is bigger. I Do find that the material stretches out with extended use. This is no big deal to me because I wash the k'tan at least every other day.
B0000D9RQ2|4|I registered for the Fisher Price Aquarium Cradle Swing, but a friend bought this swing for us also.  The Aquarium swing has many great features this one does not, but this is very easy to move around the house.  We did have a problem, however, when washing the pad.  I checked the washing instruction and followed them.  However, even though it is supposed to be okay to machine dry on low, the large warning label on the back of the pad melted so that the pad would not open fully.  As a result, the swing could not be used because the seat would not extend into the full open position.  I contacted Fisher Price via phone and they were extremely helpful.  Without even questioning my complaint, they arranged to get a new pad right out to me free of charge.  In addition, the pad arrived in a only a few days, even though they had warned it could take up to two weeks.
B002QVRL2G|5|I threw my sister a Dr. Seuss themed baby shower, so I bought these to use as part of the decorations and to give her as part of her present.  They came packaged like the picture shows, and looked adorable next to the cake.  Functional and cute!  They are also super soft and just the right size for using.
B0000ARQHL|2|The  5point harness buckle is very difficult to use.  It's straps get tangled easily.  You have to fight with it every time you put your child in the seat.  The cup holder only fits on one side.  My daughter says the seat is very comfortable.  The person that designed the buckle obviously  does not have children.
B000XSGJEU|5|So good I leave the baby's room to look at the monitor and see if she is asleep. The static from interference can be annoying but a move of just an inch can solve the problem (or make it worse). Much better than audio only monitors. So often a lot of noise means nothing if the baby is still sound asleep. You can tell that on this video screen..not sure if you would have that kind of detail to be able to tell if her eyes are opened or closed when the monitor screen is just an inch or two.
B003BS4GX0|1|cheap
B005M4SKJW|5|These Dex Baby bibs are the best bibs ever. They are sturdy and wipeable. I throw them in the wash now and again.The pocket stays in place and catches just about everything. I bought an off-brand version of one of these and I wish I hadn't. The snap came right off. Make sure you spend the extra money and get Dex.
B009R27JJC|5|work great
B008RXWCT4|1|This cup is horrible! It leaks around the seal of the cup. I would not recommend this product to anyone, it's very messy.
B0038JE61O|5|I really like this little item.  A much smaller version came with my dishwasher, but this one is a larger size, which I like.  My dishwasher is a bit \\"powerful\\" and sometimes things get \\"bumped around\\".  Though I think most people think of this as a \\"baby item\\", I really think it comes in handy for everyday use also.  I have things like bottle tops, small cups, measuring cups, and so on that I put into it.
B00RMN9WFM|5|Beautiful. Great find.
B00029TCPI|4|Very nice looking dresser for the price.  It did come with the wrong screws but amazon took care of it by giving us a discount because of the issue.  My husband purchased the right size and it worked out okay.  Again, it is very nice looking and works great so far.
B0052QYLUM|5|We've been using this monitor since our daughter was about 5 weeks old, and we have greatly appreciated the peace of mind it provides. When our daughter was 8 months old, the monitor stopped holding a charge and had to be kept plugged in, and it was constantly dropping the signal. We contacted customer service and they were exceptionally helpful. First, they had me try a few things to troubleshoot the unit while I was on the phone with them. After it became clear that nothing was working, they said they would replace the whole unit for free.  We had to pay the shipping to return the defective unit, but they said we could use the cheapest shopping and as soon as they received a photo from us of the package ready for mailing, they'd ship out the new unit immediately. We received the new one just three days later and it has worked perfectly since it arrived. I would definitely get this monitor again and will recommend it to friends who are soon-to-be parents.
B000IDSLOG|5|What a cute giraffe! He's going to be well loved by our new granddaughter! What a fun toy for her, especially during teething times!
B007IUOG5A|5|A bit of background...<br />Apparently people who build houses in the Seattle area don't think air conditioners are necessary...I highly disagree!  Rather than dying in the summer, we decided to get a window unit.  Problem is...get a big one and you have to install a 220v outlet.  Rather than giving my landlord a couple hundred gift by doing that, we went with the largest that runs on a standard outlet.  New problem...while I can plug it into any outlet in the house, it would be smart to use an outlet wired for 20 amps.  I want the AC in the living room, but closest 20amp outlet is in the kitchen.  Problem solved...a giant 10/3 extension cable neatly tucked along wall behind furniture and plugged in out of sight beside the trash can.  Sounds great, right?!?  Nope...my overactive kids and forgetful husband keep bumping the trash can into the wire plugged in, which sticks out big time because its huge and probably larger than I need, but hey...bigger is always better, right?<br />After cracking a few outlets from the trash can bumping the wire, which is too strong to bend...I decided I needed an outlet cover like those ugly gray things on the outside of my house.  I discovered clear ones exist and almost bought one...until I found this nifty little creation.  It looks like the typical child-proof covers, only larger to fit my ridiculously large extension cord.  And, it was fairly cheap even though not Prime eligible and had to pay shipping.  Arrived rather quickly and I immediately installed it.  It comes with 2 plates so you can use it with standard outlets or the Decora plates (unlike a lot of other covers).  Screw off your old cover, replace with the included one and thats it!  It comes with new screws also!<br />I absolutely love this thing...it isn't terribly ugly, it fits the giant extension cord and another charging block perfectly (see my picture posted).  Easy enough for an adult to open, but would give a child problems (although I am not using it for this purpose).  No more wire bumping and it looks neater beside my trash can.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!rpose).  No more wire bumping and it looks neater beside my trash can.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!
B00GH5DXH4|1|I purchased this chair for my older child over a year ago. We haven't used it daily until the last few months and this chair is awful. My child is a petite 27 month old and this seat digs into the backs of her calves while she sits to eat. She has red marks on the backs of her legs after sitting for twenty minutes eating her breakfast this morning. We will no longer be using this booster anymore. I just hate that I got ahead of myself in ordering it because we can no longer return it for a safer booster.
B001MMW57Q|4|Saw this in a fancy baby magazine and found it here for less $.  Looked good.  Baby seems to like this to reach teeth further back, but doesnt use it as much as expected.
B0042RU2SW|5|My newborn loves this activity mat! She spends a good 20 minutes a day, sometimes 2 times a day laying on the mat and hitting and kicking all the toys that hang. Each one makes a different sound, I actually used my own extra links and added additional toys and rattles to hang - I wanted her to have a different sound for each limb... arms and legs. So she will kick one leg and hear a rattle, kick the other leg and hear a chime, etc. By using extra links you can totally customize this mat and its toys to anything you like. It is not an eyesore in our living room, or at least, the nicest looking of the bunch. For now she cant roll over so we keep it on top of a leather ottoman. The pillow it comes with is great for tummy time, which she absolutly hates but it is a great workout for her and she continues to keep getting better each time. The thing I like most about this, is that when my baby uses it, she does the more \\"talking\\" than any other time. She giggles and smiles, and coos and gurggles and tries to \\"talk\\" to all the toys that hang. she likes to swing and bat the toys to hear the sounds and then smiles and laughs. It entertains her for a good 20-30 minutes and its a nice stimulation for her to learn and explore.
B00J8QL0DS|5|Safe and comfortable booster that my 2 year old granddaughter loves.  It cleans up well and is worth the purchase price.  Highly recommended.
B007700SEO|5|We have one in the crib and another hanging from the headrest in the car- keeps him well occupied for long periods of time...
B005UV0UU4|3|The storage part was not firm enough. but the product in general its ok
B000056HM5|5|After trying just about every bottle on the market, I found these are the best. These bottles have been around awhile for a reason.  I have 3 children and all three of them have preferred these bottles over all the others.  For the sake of trying something different this time around I went searching for a regular bottle this time.  Let me tell you, I wasted time and money and should have stuck with what I know works.  I tried (Avent, Dr. Brown's, Ventaire, Gerber Comfort Hold, Gerber Nuk wide bottles).  Here's what I found:  My little one would fuss with the Dr. Brown's and Avent and had difficulty latching on to both of them, she would choke and cough from the Gerber Comfort Hold bottles because the flow was too fast even on the slow flow nipples, she couldn't get anything out of the Nuk bottles and the Ventaire nipples where too hard she couldn't form a good seal on the nipple.  My opinion with the Dr. Brown's bottles are that they are not doing anything magical that the disposable bottles won't do because the nursers don't create a vacuum allowing air into the bottle while the baby is eating, so I think the extra cleaning with the Dr. Brown's, is a waste of time.  I also don't feel like the vent that sits on the top of the tube in the Dr. Brown's bottles can get totally clean even with their little brush. Which means sterilizing it everytime.  The positives about the nursers:  The flow rate on the nursers are just right.  My baby sounds like she is nursing when drinking from them and actually fusses when I take it away from her to burp her just like she does when I take her off the breast.  The silicone nipple is very soft and she seems to really like it.  No problems switching from breast to bottle.  I think it is a close second to the real thing--the breast.   The drop in liners for these bottles are very convenient and while it is an extra step when making the bottle it is very quick and easy.  The amount of time saved in washing regular bottles and in heatingthem up more than make up for the time it takes to drop a liner in.  These bottles heat up much faster than a regular bottle does which is appreciated by Dad and Grandma when they are feeding a hungry baby.  My recommendation is to not spend the money on all those other fancy, expensive bottles and stick with the tried and true.  Spend more time with baby and less washing bottles!
B00TLYUYMK|5|I have plenty of muslin blankets but all those are put to the side after I received this beautiful thick blanket. It has two different designs which I am absolutely in love with both! The quality is top notch and my daughter is going to love it! I wish I was still little I would use it myself! Great job bebe au lait!!! I will be buying more products .
B00T6W1ZBG|5|Tried other bamboo baby washcloths for my daughter. My wife and i agree that by far Bamboo Organics is the premium choice. Not only the washcloths are premium, but also the customer service is received. The free e-book was welcoming surprised.
B00P4TXJL4|5|Beautiful necklace and perfect length! Super quick to arrive! Very pleased with this seller and product, will recommend to friends and family. (:
B004NTC7UK|5|The chair came with no problems and the colors are good--little darker than the picture I think. Even tho my little fellow is not quite a sitter yet he can use the chair in a slightly reclined position and the safety belts keep him secure.
B00080LZVA|5|In a moment of shear desperation after coming home from the hospital I ordered ALL of the BF pillows available. Even the NEST pillow at it's higher price. I did this because the boppy pillow I received as a shower gift turned out to be completely useless. It's best use is tummy time. Yes, this pillow is softer and the fabric is thin but I've been using it 10 times a day for the last 3 months and am now purchasing a second. I haven't tried washing it in the machine for fear of it loosing shape, but honestly spot cleaning and or covering it with a blanket for baby's clean head to rest on works just fine for me. It's worth the money. Especially if the football hold is the only one that really works for you.
B0051URW1Y|5|Let me start off my saying I am not a hippy. I never thought much of child wearing until my mom friends started to have their second kid.  A lot of my friends had either the Ergo or Beco.  I chose the Beco because of the designs and that it came with the infant insert.  With my first we had the Baby Bjorn and I hated it.  It hurt my back and I wore it only a handful of times.  THE BECO IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.  It is easy to wear.  My newborn is cozy.  We have already worn it to the zoo.  I even use the sunshield around the house so my baby can nap.  I wish I had this with my first.  Also... I have a large chest.  This carrier works great.  I had a hard time with some carriers and wraps because of that.  Not the Beco...it works great.
B00006C29H|5|We purchased the Step and Play when our son was 3 months old.  We were able to put him in it right away.  He couldn't reach much, but always enjoyed being upright.  Now that he is 6 months, he just adores it.  Every morning I put him in it to play  while I eat breakfast and have a quiet morning.  It has really help with his mobility also.  He twists and turns and utilizes the whole piano.  The volume is not too loud and the tunes are quite amusing.  We find ourselves humming the tunes during the day.
B003X3R6TO|5|These wipes are thick, absorbent, and hold up really well after multiple washes. The stitching along the edges haven't come apart yet (been using for several months now). These are really great quality cloth wipes. It's true that they're not 100% cotton, but a polyester blend, but they're super soft and absorb very well. I'd definitely buy them again!
B0051CSLAI|1|Then maybe you have the luck to get a good one. We've been through two so far and we cannot get one that has panels that line up and arrives undamaged. Finally gave up on this model, wouldn't trust my sons life to it now anyways.<br />This isn't a hit or miss setup, it's trash.
B006G9H1L0|1|To hard to put on, and doesn't really fit that great,
B001ISJW66|5|it is a little ackward getting it to fit to the right size of your baby it is a t-shirt material so when child is in it , it will strech and need to be adjusted basically it is a 12 foot long piece of material that you can buy at a fabric store than go on youtube and learn how to wrap it around you.
B00342UGQO|2|Product arrived as scheduled.  From the pics and the product review, I was somewhat disappointed.  The photos online made the quilt look thick and comfy.  The quilt is very thin, as are the sheets and, they are also too big for a 15x33x2 mattress, even though the product is for this size mattress. The color is nice but will not buy this product again.
B00190FZJ6|4|My 6 month old loveeeesss this jumper. It's sturdy and I like the fact that there is two rings to attach toys to so she can play with them also. My only complaint is that it's kinda ugly...I really think Graco could come up with some better designs (maybe some girl-friendly ones!)
B00020L78M|5|I wished I would have bought one of these a long time ago.  He doesn't seem to mind playing in it either. In his pack n play  he does not want to be in there very long.  I've used this both indoors and out it's really a must have for small children.  At this price   your not really out anything if you don't like it. I'm sure you could easily find a young couple to gift it to.
B00QN0B93I|4|Love it, just wish it was a bit longer . Have to un snap to put around neck, it doesn't fit right over head.
B00EFQXLW4|5|great car seat, especially for the price. very cushioned & comfortable for my daughter.
B009UEUSIQ|5|Whether or not this works, we put it on our 7 month old about 5 months ago and haven't taken it off since. (We got her a small, the medium is for when she outgrows it.)  She's popped 3 teeth almost without us noticing.
B0001GSKV4|4|I exchanged a completely damaged rochester crib (by storkcraft) for this crib.  It shipped in about 5 days which was great.  It was pretty easy to put together, but there were some cracks in the paint where the legs and the bottoms of the head and foot boards meet.  I touched that up with some basic gloss white latex paint and you cannot tell any difference.  There were also some dents in the wood on the drop rail (probably from pressure during shipping).  I do plan to keep the crib and order a replacement drop rail from the manufacturer.  Can't give it 5 stars because of this, but I do like the style and the fact that the drawer isn't attached to the crib.  This will allow you to use it when its a toddler or conversion to full bed.
B005LKQCHY|5|Great! Worked like a charm for our 3 year old who would wake up way too early. I would highly recommend.
B0000488W1|4|... make sure they fit your cabinets. We didn't have a problem with ours, but we had to install them differently on different doors.<BR>... installation IS cumbersome, but fortunately you do not need to remove them, thanks to the flip switch that holds the lock in the &quot;open position&quot;.<BR>... make sure you don't place the magnet inside the cabinets, or keep a second magnet handy (my husband tends to put the magnet inside a cabinet once he opens a door - he's locked it in there a few times, but fortunately our doors leave a tiny gap through which you can open the lock with a postcard or similar thing).<BR>... if given access to the magnet, a 2.5-yr-old can open the locks with a little practice - so if you want to protect your baby, but would like some help in putting away the dishes from you toddler, it will work.<br />As for the locks &quot;loosing their magnetic power&quot; - that is impossible, they don't have any, the magnet works with the metal pin that sits inside the lock. If the lock is not activated by the magnet, it is most likely because you flipped the switch (red).<br />One drawback - the red flip switches come off rather easily, and can get lost (we lost one) - there should be replacements for them in a regular package.
B003GAMLMG|5|These are fantastic.  They look so much better than all the other safety corner pieces I've seen. 5 years later & we still have them on some furniture & counter tops, because they blend in.
B002DWALTI|5|My son has played with this gym from newborn to now 10 month still likes. really easy to put away love that.would recommend.
B00RP0GHBO|5|I love this product. I can see how much nasty snot comes out of my babys nose and then go wash it out! It def provides more suction that a traditional bulb.
B009AO93EG|5|My child will not give These up.  He loves them.  The construction seems to be good, and they are well made.
B0019QCH3C|5|I've tried a lot of baby brushes and this one is by far the best and softest. We ordered two!
B004QZBEDW|5|I JUST now received this in the mail and had to hop on the computer to write a review.  This is a really good quality hamper.  It is small but I knew it would be as it was going to go in my sons nursery.  It is perfect in there.  The photo makes this hamper look like it may actually be gray.  But I took the chance anyway and went ahead and ordered in hopes that it would actually be brown.  Well, it is brown so I am very happy.  Also, I saw a few other reviews that say that people were mad because the top of the hamper did not fit over the bottom. Well, here is what the-short simple- instructions say : 1. Open the hamper then lower the bottom flap on the inside to secure Hamper in upright position. 2. When placing lid on Hamper, make sure inner lid is on the inside of the Hamper.<br /><br />THAT'S IT!  Those are the only 2 instructions.  So obviously whoever wrote that they were upset were the ones who could not follow directions.  The lid fits perfectly.  Really, perfectly.  I am going to purchase two more of these for my and my husbands bathrooms in the full adult size.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B0001ZXLS2|5|one of my kiddos favorites.
B00D3EWL5C|5|Great product!!!! the baby monitor is amazing! loove the app that allows me to see my baby from anywhere in the world. This camera add on works great!
B00SY3BCSY|5|My sister got these for her stroller and I could not wait to get mine. When you have kids (I have a home daycare) you always have lots of stuff. This holds a small cooler, purse, diaper bag and they hooks can be put on tight to stay put! Would make a great shower gift for new parents
B000M563TK|3|Ita a good product. I receive one from a gift. Its good when you live in a quiet place. The reception is good but noisy some times. If you get a 900Mhz corderless phone this product turn in a nigthmare. Thanks god that you can reduce the volume of the reception unit.    The voice only activated mode is equal like the other one. I didn't see the diference. If you are to far to the transmiter unit the sound in the reception unit can turn very stressed; the variation in the reception is evident that depends of the GSM cellphones arround. Eventualy you can heard people talking in the reception unit if you turn off the transmitter or loss the signal.    This product can be more developed. I want to buy another but not this one.    I need more than one reception unit i have some many rooms to place one.    A big plus for me is the function of belt portable of the reception unit using batteries(NOT INCLUDED).     And the leds indicator of sound level can wake you if you forget rise the volume.    For this price is a good choice, maybe for a travel but in a big home is useless.
B009YSYCZS|4|Works
B00GY8V1KA|5|Love it. My two year-old has been using them and other Re-Play's products for about a year now. Made in the USA which makes me feel some much better with the quality. They are spill proof and are very durable, cant beat it.
B00A5B0ZZ4|5|Let me start by saying that I have had a lot of strollers in my lifetime.  As far as jogging stroller goes, I have owned a Jeep (cheap, heavy, not good), a BOB Sport Utility Duallie and a single BOB revolution. I bought this stroller during a lightning deal to replace my BOB.  Basically I wanted to downsize from two double strollers to one (I had the BOB (fixed wheel) and a City Mini...loved both).  Because this stroller has a swiveling wheel it would allow me to use it for jogs and daily trips.  For review purses I am going to compare this stroller to the BOB: Fold- Hands down this stroller takes the cake.  It folds much easier (just like the City Mini) and is a lot less bulky than the BOB. Handle Bar- This stroller has a plastic handle bar that is easy to wipe; the BOB has a foam handle bar that is not easy to wipe (it can get quite dirty from all the sweat).  The BOB's handle bar feels a bit nicer to me, but I like the practicality of this one. Break- They both work great, the BOB's is a little easier to pull. Suspension- The suspension on this stroller is much better than the BOB's, probably because it has independent suspension on all wheels and the BOB only has it in the back wheels. Leg Room- BOB is better in this department, this stiller has a narrower area, but it does not seem to bother my daughters. Seatbelt/harness-  This one is easier to use. Canopy- The X3 is better.  It is longer and it has more vents. Swivel wheel lock- I am in love with how easy it is to lock/unlock the wheel in this stroller.  You can do it while walking.  With the BOB, you have to stop, go to the front of the stroller, bend down to the wheel and push the little button.  This one makes the process 100 times easier.  Overall feel- I think the BOB feels a bit smoother, but it's really only noticeable on long runs.  This stroller holds it's own and if the stroller was to be used for running AND every day use, I would pick this one, if anything because of the fold.   There is no way Iwould ever be OK with folding the BOB to put it in the car for daily use (even with the revolution).     Both strollers are really good- If you run 10+ miles a day, I think the BOB might be slightly better because of the feel it has while running, but it you are like me and just go for 2-6 miles, I think this stroller is better because of all the little things that make your life easier (folding, locking wheel mechanism, canopies, etc).
B008LOSHV6|5|Our son had severe reflux. He was on several medications and had to sleep with his head elevated. A crib wedge wasn't enough. He'd spit up in his sleep and wake up screaming every 30 minutes to 2 hours max. Our pediatrician told us that it was ok to let him sleep in his mamaRoo as long as he was strapped in and in our room with us. 4moms doesn't recommend this but we trusted our pediatrician. The first night we put him in it he slept for 8 hours straight. We woke up in a panic thinking he was dead! He was just sleeping peacefully for the first time. He slept in his mamaRoo every night until he was 5 months old. He also loved to just sit in it awake and bounce. I used to so I could shower, do laundry, dishes. It was a lifesaver. I don't know what we'd have done without it! And 4moms has EXCELLENT customer service. Our original mamaRoo started making a strange noise a few months into use and they overnighted us a new one, no questions asked. Then they wrote to make sure we got the new one and that it was working properly. I can't say enough about their company.
B006SFUDT4|5|Absolutely love this! Great space for more then enough bath toys and stays up on the wall beautifully. I've had to replace the glue once but I haven't had an issue since. It drains nicely and spooks perfectly making bath time clean up easy and fast!! I highly recommend it!!
B00AEQJ0Q0|5|We took the advice of others and decided to turn the lock upside down. It worked perfectly. We are now purchasing 4 more.
B0024VE7GG|5|We put juice in it for school lunches.  My 4 year old loves it.  Goes nicely with the dinosaur lunch box and backpack. Great product line.
B003NSAY7U|1|COMPLETE JUNK.  The screws that attach these to your cabinets are GARBAGE!  Three of them broke off at the head while I was simply hand tightening them.  I am a 42 yr old woman.  Not the hulk.  I now have 3 broken screws stuck in my all wood cabinets that I can't get out.  I could have probably bought new screws but at this point there was no way I was going to let a company that used such inferior materials have a dime of my money.  Beyond peeved.
B00009Q6G6|2|It is nice having my daughter right there next to me and I don't have to worry about rolling over on her. I must say though, she hates it! The mattress is so hard I may as well lay her on my floor. She just tosses and turns and grunts. Her poor little head just looks so uncomfortable! and the side of the mattress closest to my bed kind of sinks down and she ends up rolling over and sliding down with her face right up against the side of the sleeper! I also don't like how there is a million pieces of velcro everywhere. Good idea but needs much improvement.
B00CJ2OWUG|5|Been using these for almost 6 months and they are still perfect. Would totally buy again
B000EICY8E|4|Overall, this is a good product. It's strong, not flimsy at all. However, the gate is very narrow so, if you use it, put it somewhere where you do not have to carry anything through it like a car seat or stroller. The gate combined with the height make that extremely difficult. Also, make sure the walls you will put it against are exactly even. We bought it for the downstairs, but will move it upstairs.
B00849L4AE|5|This thermos is well built with easy to use snap top. The container does very well at keeping liquids cold for lunch boxes. I love the easy to clean stainless steel bottle.
B008P2P2BM|2|The cooler itself is fine, the ice pack that goes in the middle seems poorly made and you fill it with water rather than coming filled with a substance that does a better job of holding the temperature.  My ice pack expanded and cracked within the first few weeks of us.
B0052QYLUM|3|It's a mix of good and bad. The worst of the bad is that it jams our wifi, so I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />Good picture, great battery life, night vision is excellent, great range, easy to mount and aim. But! The power light is ridiculously bright (cover with tape); the lens is crooked (aim to the left); the swivel doesn't point down to the right very far (mount somewhere else); can't turn off the screen to use it audio only at night (cover with towel); and the worst sin of all, it jams our 2.4ghz wifi which takes the phones and the wife's laptop offline.
B00W2ZVOQK|3|Don't love it even though I really wanted to. It moves so it's great for a water bottle not for an iced coffee. Also, when my son is facing me, in my citi select, he's able to grab any beverage that's sticking up.
B0031E2OB0|4|This mat is great for toddlers, it travels well, rolls-up well, and is easy to clean. It stays in place on the table and generally does its job. The only downside is that it doesn't have a lip or a gutter around the edge, so food tends to creep off the edges, at least with my messy eater.
B00BH0QL8C|5|Nice-sized.  Sturdy enough for 4 bags.  Saving my fingers from those sacks that cut into my fingers and make them bleed.
B000F1O8T8|5|My daughter was so excited when I bought her a potty of her very own to use at the store, and we covered it in stickers as soon as it arrived. Smooth assembly, plain white, sanitary, and soft. It fits in a bag that is about the size of a laundry bra washing bag, so it's very easy to fit in a purse or diaper tote. It is also very easy to rinse or scrub in the sink, and doesn't have annoying little crevices for germs to breed in. Recommend!
B004IDG6XK|3|pretty cool and a great idea however this is NOT a $53.00 product. i would put it in the $25.00 range at best. i have literally gotten equivalent glow balls from gumball machines. really cheap and cheasy looking. the base however is great, they just ruined it with going really chinsey with the balls.
B006ZVV0NO|5|These could not be easier to put on your car windows and they're effective.  My 4 year old daughter can put them up and take them off.  Love them so much more than other shades we've used in the past.
B00MA0UAQC|2|this item did not work as expected. The tag is inside out and it has many threads coming out which get stuck in babies fingers and toes.
B003V1Y1O6|5|These are really the best swaddling blankets I have found.  And, my 4 year old still loves his that he had as a baby.  In fact, for his most recent birthday, I bought him a new one because the tags had fallen off of his old ones and he loves to hold onto the tag while he goes to sleep.  They wash so well and hold up great (except for the tags coming off….but after 4 years of washing/drying/using…it's about time for the tags to come off).
B002ZW365W|4|This is a cute book for a baby. I like the soft books for teething baby's because the won't get paper cuts or eat paper with them! Somewhat over priced for what you get but soft books seem to run pricy everywhere!
B00B8VZR1M|5|Baby has several pacifiers (we call them &#34;suckies&#34;) and she really only likes this one.<br /><br />Inexpensive and easy to clean and use. Also the right firmness for baby's delicate mouth.<br /><br />Would like to see different colors though as it is hard to know which one is which for rotating and cleaning.
B00BNQEZXS|5|The box that shows up says &#34;Click Connect Carseat Base&#34; without the &#34;30/35&#34; part. I ended up contacting Graco to confirm it was the right product before opening it. Rest assured that it is! And once you get to the manual, it also says that it works with Click Connect 30 and 35.
B00RFROMO6|1|Not even the same picture now as when I ordered.... Not what I was expecting this looks girly has flowers on it and looks nothing like a cowboy hat....
B0096ICWYE|5|clip is good quality, cute, and will work well for my son's pacifiers. My husband is a huge OH fan so it is perfect.
B000MGQE7A|5|The padding does its job.  As other users have posted, the adhesives are weak so I purchased better adhesives and it's working fine.  For the price, I'm not complaining.
B0018JBJ48|5|Absolutely the best diapers, happy they are available in the US now! They are softer and nicer to touch, they let your child's skin to breath and it leaves the skin dry, compared to Pull-Ups. I'm using Merries 4th year and with the second child now, tried basically every brand out there but eventually always came back to these.
B00ITHV7AI|4|I got this bag for my twins. It's durable and lightweight very pleased with the purchase
B0080AGN26|3|My 4 year old nephew loved it--but it's very empty. I ended up buying more filing from a big box store to add to it. Also, does not look like the picture. Received the one that has the solid black &#34;seat part.&#34;
B0012N8CPY|4|I liked it because it kept my granddaughter from suffocating on memory foam mattress.  Fit was perfect for the cradles I built.
B0018Z8BBQ|5|My baby has a lot of toys and most of them she is bored with quickly. She still loves this piano and I give it to her every time she is cranky and it works great! Love it and highly recommend it.
B00AHVR7YO|4|It's stylish and function well. The only thing I am a little concern is it's not storewise. If this one can be folded down for storage, it would be perfect!
B00LIRJ5H8|4|First things first - the Graco Little Lounger Rocking seat is suitable for infants up to five/six months old.  If your infant/toddler can sit up on his or her own, they're too big for this rocker.  I looked high and low, but couldn't find anything in the listing discription that indicated size guidelines.  So there you have it - newborn to six months.<br /><br />Having said that, we feel the Little Lounger is a fine rocker.  As others have mentioned, spills are definitely a down side, so extra care must be taken.  But we loved the rocker function.  For as wonderful and amazing as babies are, they can be a handful.  It's nice to be able to give mom and dad a breather every now and then.  The adjustable seat gives the versatility to maintain eye contact when the baby's awake, or to recline it back when he or she is sleeping.  It's pretty portable, too, which is no small thing considering how much effort is involved in transporting babies back and forth in cars.<br /><br />The price point seems fairly reasonable to me, especially since it's $20 cheaper than the MSRP.
B004NRNSZK|5|We've been using this chair since our baby was a little over 3 months old, since she could hold her head up for short periods of time.  It took her a month to warm up to the toy on the tray, and now she can't get enough of the toy!  She spins it, she pulls it off the tray, she gums it, she yells at it, she throws it, she watches mommy pick it up so the whole process can start over.  It's one of her favorite things to do.  Since she learned that she could sit up, all she wants to do is sit up straight (no slouching for her!), and this chair has been a lifesaver for that.  She really seems to enjoy her time in the chair.  And now that she's experimenting with pureed foods, the chair has become where she gets to play with her sweet potatoes too!
B002W7M6U6|4|I really like this lock.  It wasn't difficult to install, the toilet lid stays up when unlocked/in use, and you can't forget to lock it because it does so automatically when you put the lid down.<br /><br />The only drawback is that if you have to change the toilet seat/lid for any reason (or if you want to take the lock off between kids to accommodate a potty training seat) you'll have to buy a new lock, as there is no replacement adhesive available and it doesn't stay sticky enough to use a second time.  I wish the lock came with a set of replacement adhesive that works like the 3M stretchy-type adhesives that I use for Christmas decorations.<br /><br />I thought it might be overkill to get a toilet lock (meaning, we can just watch LO, right?).  But LO has gotten very fast and her favorite thing is to make a beeline for the bathroom and flush the toilet, bang on the seat, etc.  I feel better knowing that the most she can do is flush the toilet before I make it in there to retrieve her.
B00FQ4E8NK|5|Excellent seller.  I will be making future purchases from Just Stick It!
B007JVX47E|5|Works just as good as the one that came with the carseat. Perfect for transferring the carseat between cars simply.
B008NJLDKG|5|My daughter bought this when she went to San Antonio, anyone that has a child needs this. The baby is 18 months old and very large for his age. It's so light weight and so durable. I was a little sckeptic whether it would hold up, but it is still goign strong. I would recommend this to anyone that has a child even toddler.
B001ZVR38K|2|I bought these so that I could cut down on washing my ergo, but these get so dirty so fast that I feel the need to take them off every other day and wash them too.
B00CWN3HRQ|4|I think this is the cutest thing ever and thought it would be a fun baby to sit with us without sitting ON us. However, baby has no interest. She either wants to be in my arms or crawling around. Maybe we will get more use from this when she is a bit older.
B00EQC7UC4|5|These are very nice quality and disposable. They have met our needs. Especially when traveling.
B00KJB0PTG|2|Maybe I'm the only person who has had this problem but this does not fit our Revolution.  It is way too long and when tightened it is so floppy that it's unusable.  I was very disappointed since the item description says for use in all Bob strollers.
B004J1QNFW|4|The necklace came quickly and is easy to use. My 10 month old has been wearing it 24/7 for about a month now (when he's asleep I wrap it around his ankle and cover it in a sock). The necklace itself appears decently durable, looks nice, and I like that there is a knot between each beads so if it were to somehow break, he wouldn't be surrounded by a bunch of tiny choking hazards. He never messes with it on his neck. (I get a lot of comments about how &#34;Isn't he supposed to chew on it?&#34; but no, they are not supposed to chew on it, they shouldn't be able to get it into their mouth and he can't, it does not come up over his chin, so it's a good size).<br /><br />As for how well it works, my impression thus far is that it works at least somewhat. I ordered it because he cut his first two teeth five nights apart, both of which involved him screaming for over an hour in the middle of the night and nothing could comfort him. Both times that happened, a new tooth had poked through in the morning. So, I ordered the necklace. He has cut one tooth since then. He has definitely been grumpy, but there was no hour of screaming in the night. So, I'd say it's helping some but he's still uncomfortable. My older son was not bothered by teething to this extent so this is a new experience for me.
B00F2MQ0GO|3|So my son was almost 2 when I bought this.  I was getting frustrated because he clearly knew he needed to potty but would not go on the potty, a different little potty. So I decided to try Thomas for my train junky. Worked like a charm used it twice the day we got it.  Now a few weeks later almost no accidents. Actually take it with us in the back of the car regularly so he goes when we are out.  He is a small 2yr old (30%) so going on a big potty is not easy.  The main issue we have had is consistence of the music, if the inner pot is not set just right it won't play. Other times we will hear music coming from the bathroom when nobody is near it.  However overall happy as my little man finally started using the potty after trying for almost a year. I know some will say he was too young but I don't agree.  My other child was peeing 100% by 14 months and completely potty trained by 18 months. Until the last couple decades children where potty trained between 1-2 years old.  It lazy parents, and disposable diapers that have caused the delay in potty training.
B002147J48|5|These are inexpensive and are my favorite cover.  I have Thirsties and Bummis and I always reach for the Kushies first.  Pros: roomy for a diaper and a soaker, no need to always shove the sticking-out-diaper in at the legs. The banding at the legs is brown.  This is nice because most diaper covers have white trim which makes absolutely no sense to me.  Wet diapers almost never leach out to make his clothes wet, which is not the case with the Thirsties and Bummis. Cons: Not very pretty.  The velcro is not as strong somehow as other brands, however they have never fallen off or anything.
B0049SP08Q|5|This was a life saver for me in the stroller. I couldnt keep my son in the stroller and once I attached this toy he was fine and kept tugging ad pulling it. He loved the vibration and keeps him occupied.
B005HI20A8|5|I originally bought this mattress for use once or twice a week at my Mothers house.  I only bought this one because it was the least expensive mattress that was firm which is what my baby was used to sleeping on.  The first one still looks like new.  We liked it so much that I bought this one for everyday use and it has performed very well.  It is extremely firm which helps prevent SIDS, fits the crib well, and it is easy to change the sheets.
B005TKX98Q|5|Bought this item for a baby shower.  Very pleased with the quality and variety of items.  Unique packaging too!
B00HGA8T96|5|These are great for newborn to toddler size babies having two sizing snaps.  Look really nice even for bibs, with clothing and keep messes shielded from clothing.  Wash well and retain shape, which is problem I have had with some of the other bibs purchased on Amazon.
B00007L5WU|5|So comfy, easy to use, durable, nice and thick.These are so much better than  using a blanket.
B00266QNR0|5|I purchased this set when my son was just begining solids at 6 months.  He is now almost 9 months and I just ordered 3 more sets to insure we always have one on hand.  My son has always insisted on holding the spoon himself, and with other plastic and metal spoons I worried he would hurt himself.  The spoon in this set it a soft flexible rubber so I just let my son hold it and play with it while I feed him with a more traditional baby spoon, this way I avoid the tug of war tantrums.  The bowl suctions well to his highchair tray and is easily removed by gently pulling at the bottom of the suction cup to allow air to get in there.  This may not be the set for everyone, but for us it has been wonderful!
B000QVOXCY|5|I always keep a tube of Lansinoh Lanolin around - It is wonderful for breastfeeding and it is great for diaper rash or chappy skin.
B002WN2B6O|2|I have had this sterilizer for around 4 months now. At first I loved it! Now it seems to be breaking down, but the company only offers a 90day warranty. Most of the time I can turn it on and it will do its job. However, lately it seems to only sterilize for a couple of minutes and turn off. I have to constantly restart it and wait around in the room to make sure it will stay on and work. Before I tried to get it replaced, I would have given it 5 stars. Now I cannot justify any more than 2 due to how quickly it stopped working and the manufactures refusal to replace or even discount the purchase of another one.
B008P8EZOG|5|We were pretty hesitant to have our little one sleep in her own room (she is 8 weeks) so we bought this monitor. The first night, I still woke up every other hour just to make sure it was still working. The next couple nights were GLORIOUS! The monitor is sound activated so you aren't waking up with every shift or yawn of the baby. The baby is also sleeping longer (10 hours last night)!<br />We. Love. This. Monitor.
B0015IVQKY|5|Pretty colors and they can hold a big bite of food! I would definitely recommend these for a gift, too.
B005CMI404|5|my son LOVES it(: super soft microfiber feels like couch material. came in the mail within 3/4 days. He opened it on his birthday & was beyond excited!
B00ECHYTBI|5|i ordered this monitor after purchasing and returning 2 other brands..samsung and Foscam. The foscam stopped working after 6 months and the samsung had no reception after about 200 feet from the room. I read all the reviews on this infant optics,,the good and the bad, prior to purchasing.<br />this is what I've found<br />1. The &#34;LOUD&#34; beeping ,I've read so many complaints about, in fact is not loud or annoying. Its a normal beeping sound if you go out of range or have a low battery. What parent wouldn't want to know if the monitor that is watching their baby is not working properly. Seriously, I find this complaint a little ridiculous.<br />2. The range complaints about this monitor just have not proved to be a problem at our home. I can take the monitor out by the pool, or nest door and i have never had a problem with being out of range. In fact, I find it to have better range that the previous 2 monitors that I have used.<br />3. The complaint that even on the highest volume setting, you cannot hear your child…I have found that on the highest volume setting, my little sweet 1 year old,sounds toooo loud. I have set it on medium and I can hear everything.<br />I found registering the warranty to be quick and easy. i received an email within seconds confirming the warranty registration.<br />I love the optics on this monitor..the picture quality is crisp and clear, even the night vision works perfectly.<br />The remote camera swivel and zoom works very, very smoothly.<br />I love this monitor, and only wish I had purchased it first a year ago.
B001CDFPY0|5|Washes really well and doesn't curl up after washing! Also I let it air dry :)
B004C43JI0|1|&#34;gliding&#34; motion clicked and made a sound like it was dragging on the motor once the glide motion reached a certain point. Baby only liked this for about 1 week. Gave it to a friend where it broke just being carried. Bulky to transport from one room to another. Babe also didn't like being near the ground.
B000JGD5CA|1|This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins.  We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless.  Unless your child's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators.
B0009XEBO4|5|I love anything smocked on my daughter!  This dress is very lightweight, true to size and well made but I would not have paid more than $20 for it.
B00KHR7OGO|3|This thing was torture to put together. I broke a nail, cut two fingers and still there's a screw that isn't in straight. I've put together cribs, furniture and more and this swing was satanic.<br />Also, the reclining chair option is just scary. It doesn't click, it just slides up a plastic ledge that is held tight just because it plastic and the screws aren't tight enough for it not to move.<br />I am a bit iffy on trusting to walk away from it while upright.<br />It's cute and it did soothe a screaming newborn but if you are a single mom with no one to help put it together, you're screwed.
B00NF9HITO|5|Perfect. Easy to install and works great for my maxi cosi
B005FI7N52|5|I love these.  I make handmade mobiles in my Etsy shop ModernSimpleBaby and add these musical motors if customers request them.
B002T5Q01C|4|We really enjoy using these liners for our son who has eczema. He has skin issues with most other liners and never has the problem with these. They are very soft and pliable which is a plus, but also the thing that leads to knocking off a star. As others have said, these sometimes bunch up in the diaper. I think it happens more now because he is trying to walk all over the place now, and being more mobile in this way may cause this issue. The positives still much outweigh this sporadic issue.<br /><br />We only cloth diaper, so if you are new to liners in general, I absolutely recommend them. They make clean-up 1000x easier. These could also be used for disposable diapers since technically you are supposed to flush waste before you throw the diaper away (even though nobody does). If you use liners and are looking for something new that is not so stiff and harsh on your child's skin, this is my recommended liner. These also will degrade quickly once disposed of if you are environmentally conscious and concerned about that.
B007D1Q0TO|2|it worked well the first time we used it up until about 2 years later. It takes a lot for it to start reading (dropping it from about two feet into water, sometimes more than once). It also stayed upright. I've seen other baby bath thermometers that floated so you could always see the readout, not this one. It also filled up with water right away and grew mold inside, kinda gross and there's not way I could see how it got in.
B001TKBCS4|4|Looks just like the picture.  It's smaller than I imagined but since it's for a baby/tot, it's a good size.  It's an unusual gift.  It says it's washable but I'm curious how it would hold up after being washed since felt doesn't wash well.  I like how simple it is.
B007OZHFW0|5|A really niceeee and cuteee bumper, looks great in the crib!! The colors are durable with the washed!! High quality!!! :-)
B000YDDF6O|5|Very calming!  So relaxing for my baby boy! It is like the Baby Einstein CD in his hands but with safeness.
B005SP2LWW|2|I wanted to like this product but I can't even use it. I've watched YouTube videos, read the instructions, etc, and to no avail I'm still confused. I know if I were to actually get the hang of this my son would love it. I'll update the stars if I'm able to figure it out.
B000056JB8|5|This tub has been the best!  It has gone through 3 children and is still holding strong!  It's the perfect size!
B004TEKOZY|1|Wouldn't it be nice if the buyer could actually read the poem to see if it expressed the sentiments she wants to send?  We're supposed to buy this without knowing what it says?
B004GXA6J2|1|Broke after one use - very disappointed.
B0002ZOI92|5|This swing was (and still is) a life saver when my now 3 month old got his first cold and ear infection at 1 week old.He would only sleep in this position because of his congestion and the swaying motion and music helped with the pain as well! It folds up fairly well, a bit bulky, but well worth the money!
B00KDKKD1I|5|Great little pillow. Great company. Great customer service. I'm a satisfied customer.
B000MHIEYA|5|I own a home child care and this product was used on the edges on tables and a book case ..It is working great. Easy to apply and does the job !
B001TWI81G|5|Easily bends to fit in lunch boxes.
B000IG6HNU|1|I received these as a gift and am returning them. They are 65% polyester and feel like plastic. No one should have to sleep on something that feels like this!
B0042RU2UA|4|So cute!  It has lots of activities. He had a woodland theme, with emphasis on owls.  Love the baby owl!
B001R1SOSG|2|Maybe we just got 3 bad batches of these from three different vendors, but these things provided us with ample frustration and numerous milk baths. They work in terms of being anti-colic, but in our experience they were extremely prone to leaking, and spilling precious breast milk is not cool.
B000N0SNHY|5|This is the best brush for washing baby bottles - Its the only one I have used since my son was born (replaced several times with the same brush).  I have tried a few others and they are all too stiff.
B008UBQZKU|5|This tutu is great! They're so hard to find in blue! But this is true to its color! It looks just like the picture and I love that it's think enough that she doesn't HAVE to have shorts on underneath this! And now that it's cooler weather, she wears this to school with leggings underneath and it looks adorable! Definitely a must have!
B0042I2BWG|5|Good deal on cards. Nothing fancy but is adequate.
B002QYW8LW|3|The banana is good, but my daughter has no interested in it.<br />Who have good idea? She just like her finger!
B001B1C7R6|5|My wife and I have tried lots of different techniques and products to keep our son from crying when we rinse the suds out of his hair.  This product does the best job of keeping the water and suds out of his eyes.  It also seems sturdy and likely to last.
B002TUTP1O|5|This is one of the best purchases I have made for my granddaughter. She still uses it today to sleep. She does not like the large crib, but will sleep all night in her bassinet.
B005MJWWYG|5|Kids are Happy, I am Happy.
B003V5LA5K|5|I really like the Tilty cups and was happy to see the Smoothie Lids.  We started making Green Smoothies and this makes it easy to share with my toddler without as much mess as a regular cup.  The lids work perfectly.  I would still recommend using a big/high chair as these are not no-drip.  (and that's a good thing, the no-drip have a valve that is not recommended)
B002QBDVAC|1|The cable would not dislodge from the Panda. Very disappointed
B000K4YSZO|5|Before we bought this diaper pail we tried the Genie and the Champ, and neither did what we hoped- magically whisk away diaper odors.  The secret, and I believe the cause of many of the 1 star reviews, is that, how to put this politely.. when you have a baby, you also have a sealed bucket of human poo inside your house.  Your caveman survival instincts are tuned to detect this odor and avoid it.  Avoiding septic material is a survival instinct.  There is no magical solution.  Smells will leak from any container and the goal is to manage them, not pretend there's a way to passively seal against them.  This can is great because it actively removes odors with a fan and a carbon filter.  Yes, you have to change the batteries every 2-5 months, but it has a soft, (non-baby waking), LED on the front.  It blinks every few seconds when it's in standby, and is solid when the fan is running since you can't hear it.  When it gets a little dim it's time to change the batteries.  For the filter we change ours every 4-6 months.  It's easy to know when it's time.  Day in and day out there's no smell and then one day you walk in and, woof! smell.  Change the filter and a couple hours later, the room smells fresh and clean again, or at least as fresh as your baby, the burp cloth hamper and the changing pad smell.  One suggestion, and I can't stress this enough, is that you need to use your head when you first learn to use this pail.  It's active technology, not magical gnomes, and although it's not a smartphone you need a little bit of skill to make it work correctly.  At changing time the contents of the bag are a natural horror show and if you just pop open the top and pull the bag out with your head over it, you'll suffer a nasal assault that will burn the hair out of your nose.  Can of poo in your house, remember?  The secret is to use drawstring bags.  Sit on the floor beside the pail, open the top lid and remove the oval collar that holds the gathered collar of the bag in place.  Without disturbing the bag inside the bottom compartment below, grab one of the drawstrings and pull it tight.  Gather up the top of the bag in the other hand, and then wrap the extra drawstring around the gathered top of the bag to make a tight seal.  Tie it off a couple of times.  You now have a totally air-tight bag of dirty diapers.  Once that's done, THEN flip the top back.  Yes as some people are grumbling, it's heavy and with an empty container can tip the can over, but this won't be a problem for you, no sir.  It won't be a problem because you will have read my review and will be a skilled technician.  You'll know as I do that the inside of the bottom of the pail can, over a few years get a bit stinky, so the way you'll solve that is after you tie off the bag, you just tip the main section back quickly with one hand, supporting the weight with it open at about 45 degrees while you pull the bag out with the other hand.  Then you just close the main section back down and only a tiny whiff of ick will escape.  Last, feed a clean bag down through the pinchers into the bottom until the gathered top has about an inch of extra bag sticking up, and slide the oval collar back down into position.  Close the top and you're done.  For extra credit you can align the bag so its long ends align with the long side of the pail.  If you do that you can get  couple of extra diapers in there by shaking the pail with the convent built in handle on the back, (which you can't see in pictures).  Note that the changing procedure takes less than ten seconds- considerably quicker than wading through my paragraphs above.  My point is that if you just flip open the main top, pull up a couple of drawstrings and manhandle the bag as you wrestle it out of the can, three things will probably happen: 1) The can will tip over, 2) a jet of putridity will shoot up from the quarter sized opening in the top of the unsealed bag and possibly blind you, and 3) you will write a 1 star review of this product. Use this the right way and you'll love it more than most consumer products you buy.
B000069EXQ|5|These are so awesome!  I never have a concern that my son is cold or will get strangled with blankets. One night I had the sleep sak in the laundry and it was a cool night, so I put a blanket over him - well my husband checked him in the middle of the night and found the blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe that our son was still breathing.  Very scary.  So if anything, make sure you have more than one sleep sak.
B00KS4CHTA|5|Just what I wanted.
B001LNOYRK|5|I bought several of these for my grandson, and his parents used it exclusively for his sleeping times. He always got quiet when the swaddle was tucked firmly around him.  As he got older, holding his arms in, kept him from making random hand movements that would startle him and wake up.  They used it for the first three months, and then moved him into a sleep sak.  They were very pleased with these.  A friend with a premie baby also loved the swaddler.
B000C4W6UG|5|Can't say enough about how great these are.  They vent very well so the nipple never collapses and our daughter can drink the whole bottle without a problem.  Another option is the Evenflo glass bottles.  They are cheap and the nipples on those vent too so there is never a problem with nipple collapsing.  I definitely recommend these for anybody who wants plastic BPA free bottles.  If you want glass, go with the Evenflo bottles.  You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with either, guaranteed.
B0034ISZCA|3|I have &#34;the other bra&#34; for pumping that has velcro and is adjustable.  I needed to purchase a second one so I tried PumpEase and decided to buy based on the sizing provided and it's too big and slips and slides while I am trying to pump.  This style does not have much room for adjustments.  If you decide to purchase I would suggest buying one size smaller than the size chart guidelines.
B00NN4I19M|5|Perfect size for my little gut! He loved his new pillow. Would recommend it. Also received it from seller quickly and in great condition.
B00IX6A5O4|5|This is a great little bear for new born babies.  I give them to all the new babies in my life.  The eyes are sewn on, not buttons.  So, no worries about choking hazards.  Also, the seem to be constructed to meet the needs of a growing chewing, drooling baby.
B004JU0CFU|2|I thought it would have more cushion to it like an actual car seat cover but all it is is a thin piece of fabric that you can use to cover your car seat cover for spills. Not at all what I expected especially for the price I paid.
B007HZ9W0A|5|Loved it!!
B00IR4F3LM|1|Did not like. Not long enough. Child has to have long arms to reach the toys to even swat at them.
B001G6L5BA|5|So cute and resonablr price.
B008HCXIU2|1|Don't waste your money...it's junk. The fastener broke the first week of use.
B00KF2SCMQ|5|The shades only required a few moments to install and they attach firmly to the window. A very effective product.
B00DJPKA4Y|5|MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS LITTLE WHALE!  HE'S A KICKER AND EACH TIME HE KIDS HE'S ENTERTAINED BY THE TOYS ON TOP.  SIMPLE TO PACK UP AND FOLDS SMALL ENOUGH FOR EASY TRANSPORT.
B00NFETB9Y|4|My daughter is 7 weeks old as I write this. We have been using this gym near enough since she came home from the hospital daily. I'll weigh the pros and cons that we've seen so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's compact. It's easily tucked away and out the road.<br />- It's bright and colorful, which she loves<br />- The hanging toys and the fox are fab. My daughter's favorites are the acorn, which rattles, the leaves which clink, and the fox, which plays tunes, As she's getting older, she likes the bird mirror too.<br />- The fox can play long or short tunes, and the volume can be adjusted<br />- The hanging bits can be switched up.<br />- The colors make tummy time more interesting!<br />- The mat is pretty spit-up resistant. I usually keep some spray cleaner and wipe it down between washings<br />- Easy to assemble<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's compact (it's a blessing and a curse). Our daughter can roll to her side and shimmy herself around....and she's gotten caught and had the thing collapse over her. Although it goes without saying to supervise your children while they do anything, please be sure to pay extra attention to them while they use this. Her leg caught on one of the support beams and she kicked it just right and down it went. She was fine- gave her a fright is all and she let us know about it, but still. My heart went in my throat.  This item would be PERFECT if it was wider. There's no wiggle room or room to stretch width wise.
B00DJPKA76|5|Easy to put together. Our 3 month old loves the characters and the colors, along with the contrasting black and white patterns keep her attention.  When she lays under it she kicks the crossbars and it makes all the toys move and you can add your own to it too.  We are excited the toy will grow with her. You can also use it with a Bumbo to give them a new vantage point. Would highly recommend!
B00073HJG8|4|The only negative on this item is that when you put more than a few animals in it it hangs way down. I had seen another review about this , so I made sure to hang it way up near the ceiling to give it room to do so. Goes up easily although, I wish they would have include instructions on how to put the screw supports in. I had to go on another website to watch an instructional video for that. All in all a good buy.
B003CUXV0Q|5|perfect for playpen
B00B1M2TUA|4|Didn't work for us. Too wide at bottom, very bulky, and my son did not like to be in it. But it is good quality and great in smaller sizes for infants.
B000UEA96G|1|Not very happy, these were ineffective, seeing how I dipped one in a clear bottle of alcohol and there was no color change
B0012IZ7K2|5|I had Order the Soho Designs Deep Sea Aquarim Baby Crib Nursery Bedding and it was just beautiful and it came in such a timely matter
B00FFSRIO8|5|Best velcro tabs of any other cloth diapers. I also like the color! It's neutral and easy to keep clean.
B000LXQVA4|5|My little Ollie loves this thing.  When his mom says buy something I do.  He is 5 months old today and got this for him and he is losing his mind according to his mom.  Anythng for my son.
B00IOGIM9S|3|Great chair for ease of installation and can easily be removed to wash.  Trouble we had is that the tubular legs are at the perfect level for little ones to use to stand up on.  My twins started doing that at about a year.  Now at 17 months they put enough pressure on it to eventually loosen the straps and have wiggled out.  I am glad we stay close and no one has fallen.  We have had to replace these with Mountain Buggy seats because they don't have the same design.  We tried the Regalo one with the shoulder restraints but it requires a really deep counter top.
B008VW7SMW|3|It is pretty buy not as soft as I expected
B001RJUVS4|5|I absolutely love this as a snack container. Don't waste your money on any of the other snack containers. They're nothing compared to the Munchie Mug. Yes, it is bigger, but that never bothered me one bit. My LO took only minutes to figure out how to get snacks out of the cup and we never had any spills. It comes with the cup, snack lid and a stay fresh lid. My only complaint about this product is that I would love to see it modified to where you could use the stay fresh cap without taking off the snack lid. It fits inside of the snack lid when it's on, so I would LOVE to see it modified to where you could put on the stay fresh cap without taking off and having to store the snack lid.
B008OJ7C6Y|3|Worked, but the way it pressed on LO's tummy made a pretty decent red mark and he acted uncomfortable with it on.
B00AA6LQDY|4|It´s pretty good, only wish it would cut veggies into smaller pieces
B001ABZGU2|5|My toddler plays with these links all the time. She is always making us necklaces & crowns. No funny odors & hold up very well.
B002J4U8M0|4|This was for my 5 month old - it is cute, she grabs at it, tries to eat it, it rattles a bit. It velcros nicely to the side of the crib. It stands up but baby will most definitely knock it over! The only thing is - the material that it is made out of actually spreads when you prop it up - that isn't shown in the main picture.
B00HURFECK|5|best monitor I've purchased!
B004991LBK|5|My son loves his mat.  I love that it's easily washable.
B000BPMJS0|5|We love this bouncy chair! We have a different one for home, so we decided to try this folding one for travel. It works great! Folds down small enough to carry aboard the plane. I have already recommended this to other people.
B00D9C7FRC|5|SOOO cute! I bought Theodore to decorate my best friend's baby shower and it looked so cute sitting on top of the cake table holding on to a bunch of balloons. His paws have small Velcro patches on them. He is soft and just the right size. You will not be disappointed.
B000056J76|5|I have to say this toilet seat is really the best. We used this from the beginning while toilet training our son who is 2 and a half. The grandparents purchased another version for their house. Their seat has rubber grippers that don't hold the seat in place, side handles that don't serve much purpose, and the lip in the front is way too shallow! The Baby Bjorn has adjustable wings that grab the toilet seat so it won't slip around. The raised portion in the front is raised high enough, unlike the other seats. It is a bit more expensive, but we got one for every toilet in the house. It hangs easily on a hook and is easy to clean.
B003NSAY7U|3|These are OK. They are only moderately effective at keeping the toddler out of drawers and cabinets, as it didn't take him long to figure it out. But, it delays him and gives us some time to react. I hacked them by using two catches back-to-back to also keep him from crushing his fingers.
B00171WXII|5|When my daughter was suffering from Cold one of my Colleague suggested me this Product. This is my biggest Relief when sh cough up with Cold. i don't think i can even compare the regular bulb with this . I recommended the same to my sister's son. They also bought it from Target as they don't want to wait until shipment arrives. They loved it. i definitely recommend this Product for kids.
B008TRYN6S|5|These are so cute and such nice quality that I now own the fox and the zebra as well!  They look just as new as the day I bought them even though they are used to store toys and are used daily.  The extra price is well worth it. The quality makes up for that besides the darling animals.  We keep them in our living room because they are sooooooo.... nice!
B005QU55EA|1|IT ONLY WORKS FOR CABINET NOBS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER. OURS ARE REASONABLY CLOSE BUT THESE THINGS ARE TOO SHORT TO FIT.
B006Y7P1MK|4|I just love these. They are adorable, fit tons of toys, and i have then in any room in the house where my son's toys might end up. they also organize things in my older daughter's Ikea cube bookcase. But they are so expensive. I wish 3 sprouts could do something to bring the cost down.I have 3 and would like more but just cannot justify the cost.
B000T8LTB2|5|I love this chair! We live in a small apartment and needed something for the small space...read my full review here:<br /><br />[...]
B000KQ1RQU|5|Item fits well for its intended purpose in infant wear.  Material is soft and baby appears comfortable.
B00009RGSX|5|We bought this item for our 2 year old.  He has a habit of climbing onto boxes and jumping off of them if we don't keep an eye on him, so I was very weary about putting a toy box in his room.  This toy box really holds a lot of stuff, but because it's soft, my son couldn't really climb on it.  Every thing we wanted to put in there fit and the extra tote is nice - you can just grab it and not have to worry about picking toys out to take somewhere!  I felt safe enough to leave this toy box - unlike the others which are in the living room - in his room.  I knew he couldn't climb on it, I knew if he fell against it, it wasn't going to gouge out his eyes, etc.  Now that he's almost 3, he flips the front open and plays with his cars and tucks books into the side pockets.  This was the perfect toy box for our family!
B0034G5UZM|5|I was nervous about ordering a gift for my first great grand daughter, on line, but I'm GLAD I did, because this baby book is just what I wanted!
B00352M62A|5|I live in Chicago and wanted to take my newborn (born at end of Oct '14) out during the winter.  We have the Chicco Keyfit car seat.  I tried a JJCole cover on mine and it didn't work.  I like that this was wind/water proof with the outer shell and that it was super warm on the inside.<br /><br />Dressing my son in the appropriate winter clothes and then having this as well made me feel confident in taking my son out in the winter when he was 1, 2, or 3 months old.  He has always been super warm and comfortable in this bunting.<br /><br />And it will be able to grow with him as he gets older.  Well worth the money.
B00HZO7F9S|5|Absolutely fantastic, better than expected and mum to be loves it!
B00B7XUVLW|5|This bag has many compartments making it easy to keep everything organized. The pockets on the sides for bottles have been perfect for having them handy and neatly put away. I love the look of the bag & the slim design keeps it from getting in my way when attached to the stroller. I would definitely recommend this bag.
B00FZE5O9I|5|My 20 month old son absolutely loves his light! Bright enough, but not too bright. And it actually charges and stays on all night long if needed. Most portable lights I have bought will not stay charged. Great buy and well worth the money.
B00CJ2OWUG|5|I love these!  They adjust perfectly on my 11 week old and look stylish.  Baby seems very comfortable in them.  I'm planning to buy more.
B0016KYMMU|5|make sure to snap the legs in place before sitting your tot on it or it will collapse. Once legs are pushed into lock position it stands up perfectly. I even had to put my 4 year old on it a couple times and it still held up. When using on the toilet, very sturdy but watch out for boys because the splash guard isn't very high. I love it so much, I bought one for my sister/nephew.
B0035ER51K|4|My little girl likes this seat. It seems very comfortable and the handles are a nice touch.  It is extremely stable on our regularly shaped toilet seat.  However, when she climbs off over the front, the front guard scrapes over her genitals, and I can easily see how a boy could get caught painfully on it. The edge that's toward the child is a little on the sharp side.
B00PWV516K|5|This item IS AVAILABLE!
B004FI2P88|1|If I had reviewed these right after buying them, I'm sure I'd have given them 5 stars.  But a couple years later...  man, what a pain these have been.  First off, out of 12 we installed 3 have been replaced and 3 more need to be.  THEY JUST DONT LAST!  Something breaks in them, seemingly with no reason, rendering them completely useless.  The company replaced the first two.  The third time they said they would after receiving the defect back and - to their credit - they paid for the shipping... but I never heard from them again.<br /><br />To be honest, if I could go back in time... I just wouldn't bother.  So here's some parenting device:  Stop being so paranoid!  You won't listen to me.  I wouldn't have listened to me either.  But I found its just far better to teach the kid to not do certain things, and move the really dangerous stuff so they just can't get it.  Way better than annoying yourself and all your guests for years with these blasted things.
B00B501FDK|5|I love these liners, they're very cute and functional. I love that I can wash them in the washing machine (but I do not put them in the drier, just hang them out to dry on a chair and they dry very quickly.) I do like the flower liner more, because the leaf liner is too narrow at the top.
B000TSROL6|4|I have a daycare and am looking for instruments that won't come apart easily. I'm happy with the quality of this product which is the most important thing to me. Looks safe, sturdy and fun.
B002QYW8LW|5|My baby is obsessed with this. She'll be fussy but as soon as she chews on this, she settles down quickly. It's ridiculously cute. This is my new go-to shower gift. Love it!
B008YPL8R2|5|These do take a little while to receive, BUT, for the price, they are worth it. The little lights are very bright laser beams. They fit on the fingers just great. My daughter, who is 7, loves them!  Gauranteed to make your dog hyper!!!LOL
B0096Z8PWK|4|Was so excited to have found a growth chart with a Dalmatian on it, my sons nursery is themed 101 Dalmatians & this is so cute in there
B001HO48M4|5|I always found our little one chewing on the crib which wasn't good for it or those new little teeth so I bought this and the side covers. It has worked fabulously! We have a convertible crib like the one in the picture and the cover fits perfectly on it. It's very snug & hasn't come loose at all even with the little one's tugging and pulling on it. I also really love the 3 Velcro straps where toys can be attached. We only put toys on there that are extra safe in case they ever came off (nothing that could be swallowed, pulled apart, etc.). It couldn't have been easier to put on and it makes me feel more comfortable that it's organic and helps protect those new pearly whites. Even though it was a bit pricey, I think it is worth it and I would absolutely purchase it again!
B00PHCE2RI|5|Loved color. Great quality!
B00JFUN77E|5|my niece's loved this at Christmas
B0013O9RX8|5|after I surveyed in the website, I select this one. full a set of breast pump and hope it will be useful after my deliverary
B00005C6CJ|5|Great Item, the little one loved
B005OUIT5E|5|We bought this to put into our Karibu Folding tub and it works great! My son has yet to slide while sitting on it. Love Green Sprouts products!
B00PKP3J1W|5|Awesome!
B00073HJG8|3|Does not fit a lot and very saggy.
