B001CBUWZY|5|Very nice.
B000CM0WUE|5|Thanks ..its a perfect fit and easy to install
B000C5DUN2|5|These switches were simple to install.  I didn't need the wiring that came with them, but was glad it was included in case I had needed it.<br /><br />Install consists of:<br />  Disconnect the battery and wait at least 10 minutes (I waited at least 30-45 mins just to be safe.<br />  There is an 8mm bolt on either side<br />  Disconnected the air bag<br />  Remove the screw at the top and bottom of each switch<br />  Just removed the old switches from the wiring harness<br />  Remove the new wiring harness from the new switches<br />  Attach new switches to wiring harness in vehicle<br />The rest is the reverse of dis-assembly.<br /><br />There are a LOT of YouTube videos on this topic.  I recommend watching 2 or more to get a good idea of how to do this.<br /><br />Aside from waiting for the capacitors to drain, the whole thing took no more than 20 mins (probably less than 15).
B003X861OK|5|Great OEM replacement!
B0046HJGFS|5|Great quality.  HPS makes great stuff.
B009DK1RSC|5|I was worried that this would be difficult to install, but it snapped right into place.
B00KLI6P5A|5|god
B0041CCAYW|5|Looks grate easy to fit sounds awesome
B001O0CPPI|4|They get the job done at a good price and good quality.
B00ID2P60Q|2|Not the greatest they won't snap together all the way I had to use a pair of pliers to get them to snap together
B005SFHCVW|5|It's thick and pretty! I love it!
B003Z9T33I|3|We bought this for our 2014 F-150 and it doesn't seem to matter how its installed it makes noise.  Also makes the tailgate harder to open and close.  We have a Lund Tonneau for our 2012 F-150 and its a much better cover.  This one is being returned and I have already ordered a Lund.
B003SZKOBO|5|Fit perfectly and were factory exact !! Loved that they had the lightbulb already in there and the circuit board unlike the ones available at my local auto parts store! Saved me money in the end!
B0066S2TDQ|5|It fits well as described.
B00BLEOOKQ|5|It was exactly what I needed!!
B00WF5THCA|5|Excellent product. Exactly what I was looking for.
B000CBXSX8|1|I purchased the Maxsa garage laser park unit to replace one I had used for the past three years, which had one of the laser lights go out. The new unit has been very inconsistent as the motion sensor is not very sensitive. Part of the time it works and other times it will not come on. I have been trying to figure out when to open the door so it will be on when I enter, but have had no success. The old unit was so sensitive that it would come on if I walked through the garage, but this one will not come on if I wave my hand in front of the sensor. Needless to say I am not very happy with this new unit.
B00KTIURMO|2|Does not work if you are more than 3 feet from car. Makes remote start unusable.
B00FXLJ8U4|5|Better to be safe than sorry
B0045J0ICW|5|Easy to install, there is a video on etrailer that i found helpful. Works great.
B000C982F4|5|Excellent Original Product
B0087URUL2|5|Easy to install and look and work like the factory lights
B002IVCU66|5|Well worth the price. Surge brakes no longer engage when backing up my boat on an incline.
B001CF1XY4|4|The bolt locations will piss you off. Have patience. I had to walk away a few times. All of the holes lined up. They are just hard to get to.
B001CEJH6G|2|Amaazon said it was the correct part, it wasnt!
B0042UAJC8|4|Great price on a nice wash mitt.  Replaced a cheap auto parts store mitt.
B008427CZ2|5|Exc purchase
B00AKFWBHA|5|Received on time. Rhino ran a lot better at higher elevations
B001AVU3KA|5|beautiful product. High quality steel by the looks of it. I will purchase from JT again.
B003U4T4PU|5|This product does as advertised.  I'm a professional detailer, and I think this is the finest tire dressing on the planet. Customers rave about how deep and rich the blackness of the tires look, as well as the brilliant shine, that holds up very well after several washings. Another fantastic product from Chemical Guys.
B00HAQBEH0|5|Love the flash its very powerful<br />But if they can make it little smaller It would be awesome
B0002SRCYM|3|Doesn't fit alot of hood supports on the vehicles I work on due to the diameter of the lift support rod.  Does what it should on the cars I CAN use it on.
B00DJ688VU|5|Great product, used two coat onto of a colored epoxy floor.  Now have  a strong shine that looks amazing.  Neighbors and friends all thought it was a professionally finished floor, not a do it your self floor.  Strongly recommend. Simple and easy to use.  Cleaning and prep are key.
B0002U1TZ8|4|I bought this so I would not run out of the original amount in the Mother clay bar kit. I used about 3/4 of the original container from the kit clay barring two cars. Since I don't need/want the microfiber cloth the kit comes with, I plan to only buy the supplies I need.
B0048SEQLO|5|Just bought a 2001 BMW K1200lt.  Maintenance conducted on entire bike and they work great.  Thanks.
B00ONOO1S6|5|Looks cool.
B002HTXR7K|5|Worked perfect to replace factory cap that was not compatible with the rear lift hatch of the topper I put on my 2013 Sierra Denali. Hatch closes and seals perfect now.  Very good quality for the price.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Awesome
B0063MI858|5|Great product you get exactly what they show. The screws are a little short but you could use any screws around the house to fix that problem.
B0049Z8X4C|4|Nice relation berween price and item
B002W0ZNIU|5|Great alternative to Klasse All In One which is my normal go to synthetic polish.  Much cheaper per ounce but similar performance.  Easy on and off with a porter cable and easy off with some quick detailer and a microfiber cloth.  Throw some carnauba wax on top or a glaze for stronger protection.
B008X02HAK|5|Worked just as expected.
B00I4UWK0Q|4|I would give this transmission jack 5 stars but it is sold as &#34;Foot-operated pump and release provide easy operation while keeping your hands free to perform other tasks&#34;.  It DOES NOT release by foot! It will pump up, but this is NO release using your foot as advertised. So, just be aware! My husband is a master auto technician and knows how these things work, so it isn't a matter of him not understanding how to use it properly. But, he says it's extremely sturdy and decided to keep it anyway. Just understand you will have to release it yourself. It's well built, very sturdy and aside from there being no release, it's worth the money!
B000CSWPZS|1|I have bought two of these car cover and both have shredded apart within 3 months of use. Once they get wet and the fabric loosened the material discinigrated and ripe appart. Not a good car cover at all.
B007V2D1P6|5|Super happy. Fit perfectly.
B00RIVNP1K|3|Fits perfectly & serves its purpose.
B0031XXW4O|5|I don't regularly write reviews on things that I buy on Amazon but this makes such a difference in the shower in my travel trailer. It was easy to install and works great, that extra elbow room is wonderful.
B00KSDKWZ2|5|It was exactly what the discription was. Lookds great in my truck.
B003S6F0WQ|5|Awesome works great
B00JVHLS3G|1|it's FAKE and it turns YELLOW after a month
B0015FYQ90|5|AWESOME!
B0076PXVKS|5|Super quick delivery. Great seller would use again.  Prtect exactly as described. Thnx
B00I2ZV432|4|Good fit for my '07 Suzuki Boulevard c50.  Only 4 stars because the screen that is included is not a 90 degree connector as that of the original screen, so you'll have to pull the original dirty screen or find another screen to fit in order to put everything back together.
B000BO6MBG|3|Does it hold your stuff?  Yes.  What I didn't know is the lashing straps are sewn into a web.  That's fine if you have all four handle things.  My van only has two so I had to rig it to work.
B000GTW04Y|5|It fits and it started
B005N53C9I|5|Great product - looks great and fits well. Very fast delivery
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great, the interior is much cooler!
B00GY64WZI|5|The program tuner was easy to use, especially, when I downloaded the updates from Banks Performance website. I tried to install it first knowing that I should've updated it first, and my truck denied the program. First, you have to download the update from Banks website to your computer, then from your computer to the programmer. The whole process took about 12 minutes to download, and then another 3-4 minutes to install the program tune on my truck. I installed the sport tune, changed the transmission shifting and removed the top speed limiter. All of the changes were exceptional - and I'm very pleased with the purchase of this programmer. I installed the program tune on a F-150 SVT Raptor 6.2L. I was biased to buy the Banks Programmer because of the legacy of the Banks name.
B00O06V3QK|5|Exactly what I needed!
B00LXKYA0C|4|Good sight line, looks great and no glare. Only down side is at night it's hard to see if you have tinted windows.
B00YSZ9KYA|5|This is a really neat organizer. I use it in my car for essentials like handy wipes and kid stuff. It really makes things alot easier to find when you have everything in one place. I received this product for my honest and unbiased review.
B0010DW608|1|The application guide in the Amazon.com site is incorrect.  It states that this filter fits a 2010 Nissan Frontier, but it does not fit.  The correct Fram filter a Frontier is Part Number CF10553.
B0070Y34Q6|5|Works beautifully, it was easy to apply, just use soapy water and a spray bottle. You don't need any special solution and the tools provided work perfectly.
B009DJ8UE2|5|perfect if you have an SRT8. would buy again.
B00BTMQMSC|4|very good
B00075XCCG|5|Installed fairly easily. You must order small round brush to clean out your bolt holes, which I did.  Overall it's been on for 7 months now and works perfectly.  I like the way it's nearly hidden on Honda Pilot
B00BQVF8NG|1|The arbor striped the first use.  Shame because they normally make great products.
B004RZMCCI|1|Light says they are submersible...well they are not. I ordered both sides (driver and passenger) and both leak badly. Very unhappy with these and will be returned...going to purchase new set right now.
B00BPSUDGW|5|Used it on three cars so far. It works great. The quick detatch has metal and fits perfectly. I previously tried a kit that had a plastic fitting and it didn't work. This one goes on and off easily and securely.
B002XL2XUE|3|Kinda small, should have ordered next size up
B000BQR100|4|Works great!
B00C81RIYK|5|Love knowing it's on my rear window.  Makes me smile! Love Grumpy Cat 😛
B00PGJDZT8|4|Works great.  Would buy again.
B003POJ1DU|5|Nice heavy duty mitt. I wash my vehicles every two weeks on average and never had one fall apart and hold a ton of soap water. I do change these out once a year to avoid any possible grit that may get in and cause swirl marks and use for other cleaning chore.
B009YP8PH2|5|For the price the best deal ever
B000S2QWFC|5|Exact fit on a Pontiac Grand Am GT. Better than OEM. Use a thin layer of Dielectric grease inside the boots, both ends. A must change with spark plugs. Price was great compared to other places.
B00692TZ54|3|Usually there is no visible difference between factory and aftermarket filters but the construction of this one with its stiffer glue and side panels made installing it significantly more difficult than the OEM filter.
B007HB5OAG|4|I installed a pair of these on a 2012 Silverado extended cab pickup so I could mount a Larin roof rack [see separate review] NOTE: if you're going to do this, make sure you're ordering a PAIR and not one like I did- had to overnight the second rack before vacation!. The racks are well made and assembly was easy. Note too that you will have to purchase vehicle-specific clips and pads to fit your vehicle.  The manufacturer's website has a complete listing as well as great install videos. The only drawback I found was that I had to cut a section of the door weatherstripping to get the clips to grab the roof contour- this may or may not apply to your vehicle. Only in a torrential downpour did I notice a minor drip.  In the past I always bought Yakima racks, but the Rhinos are more versatile and a better value.  As a side note, the top bar is extruded aluminum and will accept Unistrut style 1/2 turn nuts on the bottom edge to mount accessories.
B00I5A28RK|1|I couldn't wait to put this sticker on my car, but when I opened it, I was very disappointed. The sticker I received does not look anything like the actual image shown by the seller. :(  The reason I wanted this sticker was because of the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; Font, yet the sticker I received does not use that font. The &#34;Always&#34; I received is printed in a boring, simple block font. The image posted on Amazon is misleading and I will not put this on my car. :(
B00V5DI3FA|4|Good for washing your car
B000CMHIR4|5|Easy install in focus st and made the turbo spool easy to hear.
B002MOQ8VW|5|Everything was as expected
B00ERENA48|1|It was not as big as shown, maybe half that size!
B000SNBSMI|5|This cover is as advertized. It fully covers my Harley Davidson Electra Glide Ultra Classic. It comes with storage bag.
B000C181SU|5|Works great, very easy to install, comes with good instructions, holds tailgate secure, even looks like it belongs there, would highly recommend this product
B000T9TN9Q|5|Just tried it in the &#34;cleaning&#34; concentration of a bottle to about 25 gallons of diesel in my 2005 ram 3500, and noticed a difference right away.  I did see a bit more smoke when taking off from idle, and this may be the &#34;cleaning&#34; action?  The engine runs smooth and seems to use less throttle to maintain the same speeds.  So far seems better than the Diesel Service I was using.
B000CQBK9W|1|When its labelled a &#34;rebuild kit&#34; you should include the inner c clip that holds it all together, not just the outer ring, o-ring and screws.... Also you should mention that one kit services both hubs....
B000EALHHG|4|Think I would have to use it multiple times to get the results I want.  Will try it some more
B00557RHXQ|5|thanks
B000K005Z0|5|02 Tahoe orignal speaker. Great clarity, quality, easy install with no modification needed. Highly recommend.
B00X4U64PS|5|I love it!
B0042B4B3U|5|Works great for my couch
B00BSL525S|5|the process was easy, worked great. my corner hardware store cut the key for $2.00.
B000C2SBS4|5|Part was exactly as described. Worked great.
B00G66KNZY|3|I got this helmet from a different source that was less expensive.  I've had the helmet for about a week and have taken it out about 15 times.  It's a very cool looking helmet, I'll give it that and you do get the free tinted visor.  But from the second I put it on I regretted not buying something else.  It's the proper fit but its very uncomfortable.  I will say that wearing it more and more is wearing it in a little and it's becoming more comfortable.  The quick release strap is a cool idea and it is handy but its kind of a big piece of plastic that digs into my neck.  Also the tightening strap is only secured by a very small metal ring.  At about 45 mph the strap comes out every time and starts flapping around.  It's a good feeling to be going 70 and getting slapped in the neck by a rogue strap.  About the tinted visor.  Awesome that you get it automatically for free because they're usually, what, like $30 or so.  That being said I happened to receive one that has a warp in the plastic in the line of sight of my left eye.  There are vents and it has been very hot lately and I can tell they work well, I can actually feel the air on the top of my head.  The top two vents close but as far as I can tell you cannot close the chin vent.  It's an ok helmet.  Everyone's head is a different size and shape and it just might be that this helmet is just not the right fit for my head.  If I did it all over again though I'd probably shell out a few extra bucks for and HJC because I know they fit my head well.
B000C9DSHG|5|Part was exactly as described. Worked great.
B0036YSJCI|5|We have owned this sunshade for 3.5 years now and it still fits like brand new.  Made of high quality materials.  The trim around the edge is still in great shape and has not fallen apart (into dust) like previous sunshades.  Keeps the car much cooler when used and also helps preserve our dash board.
B007ZVR44W|4|It's nice
B001U7R07S|5|my new Covercraft HP Car Cover has been on my 84 corvette for almost two months now. During that time it's rained over 4 inches. The cover still looks brand new. It let some of the water through but did a much better job than the Noah Car Cover it replaced.
B0058WXNOK|5|This worked great -- it just requires a very close reading and following of the directions and patience.  Letting the adhesive cure for at least four hours is  Spend five times as much time as you think getting the color match right.  Don't even think about moving the grain pattern sheet for an hour.  All in all I got about the same results as I had from a professional repair, but the whole kit was a 1/5 the price of that earlier repair.
B003FO2O1G|5|This replaced my Sensar antenna it brings in twice as many stations. and is smaller and more compact. I wanted the one that goes on the Wineguard mount because the higher the antenna is the better
B0024ECDL4|5|Ordered this to build a &#34;Y&#34; connection for my RV water supply/black tank flush. It arrived on the second day after ordering in excellent condition. Worked excellently for the purpose that I purchased it for. No leaks.
B000E28MTU|1|Made in Korea. Enough said
B00HRXNLIG|5|Fit my 2006 Civic Si perfectly. Literally took about 1 minute to install.
B003SS62PS|5|Good size good power
B000TYOFOY|5|Exactly as the original,only working.  This made all of our window issues on our 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport a thing of the past.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B00T0XATQ8|3|the tint itself is a pretty good quality, the pre cut is average. The edges were not perfect at all and I could easily see where the razor stopped and started again. I assumed these were laser cut and not read the description thoroughly enough. that was my fault
B000XQ9MGE|1|Disappointed.
B003AOM17I|5|Just what I needed at a good price.
B001EVDY84|5|I had to modify the tail section of the kit, but that's only because I have drop leaf shackles. Can't blame the product. $20 fix with a 2' section of 304
B007UHPSCG|5|Nice
B004GCZFVW|1|The light was good but only had one problem something about the wiring diagram made my blinker blink faster than normal other the that you guys are the best ....
B00EZFYRB4|5|Perfect fit
B003D3YKO8|5|I needed to replace my propane regulator and move it from a mount on the popup camper into a mount inside the propane tanks cover where it will receive more protection from the sun (which I blame for killing my last regulator prematurely). This mount fit on the existing dual propane hold-down bar and center rod. It only requires drilling holes for your regulator although some are pre-drilled so I only had to drill 3 more for my regulator.
B006QH55YM|5|Best battery we ever bought......finally!
B005TWWAZC|1|These turned out to be the cheap paper ones. My customers really disliked them. I would not recommend.
B0045XRK06|5|Nice bright desk light. Adjustable angle. Not much more to say other than it works.<br /><br />It doesn't have an on/off switch but I use it with a USB hub that has its own switches that take care of that nicely.
B00K1C1WC2|2|These chock blocks are average quality, not very sturdy or heavy. I found them way to easy to accidently run over, but they do hold most of their shape if you make the same mistake. Not sure I would trust them on a steep hill or even a sloping incline, but they are adequate for a nearly level surface.
B003EP52FQ|2|not good in any exposed areas - backing adhesive is not strong enough and when the sun warms the product it peels off while driving
B0095GK9SI|5|Love the look... Can't ask for a better modification. Makes my 2013 JKU Freedom Edition look MUCH more aggressive. The cost of aftermarket bumpers makes this kit even more appealing. If your &#34;on the fence&#34; about purchasing, jump over it and buy it now!!! A little caveat... make sure you have a heavy duty(extra thick) metal cutting blade... I went through 3 blades before doing that!!,
B0058J4YT6|4|Fitment wasn't to bad wiring isn't to hard but must use multimeter to know your POS and NEG wires from your vehical wire harness. some gap between the hood and top of light housing. Beam adjustment is some what of a task having to remove, adjust, place, remove again  adjust and place until u get the proper X and Y axes . If your not a handy person take to a shop that can do for you. They look great I love the smoked lens with chrome and black inside. The LED's on top are decent but the halos are not that bright but still give a cool look but don't buy for the halos. The project can be of better quality for 250 bucks but works good I can still see but use my fog lights to help illuminate directly in front of my truck. Must buy better low beam H1 bulbs then what is supplied. I'm happy with purchase gives the truck a updated look and gives the little ranger some attitude.
B008E7PYV6|4|good price,and it work perfect.very economical pads,will buy the rear soon
B0097CE2NS|4|Was easy to set up and works great except the battery occasionally and randomly seems to come loose and then it has to be opened and readjusted. Otherwise it's great
B007GLCO3W|5|Super convenient to use and has done a great job protecting the plastic parts of my Kawasaki Concours motorcycle from the harsh Colorado sun.  Wanna get a sunburn?  Come to Colorado!
B007ISYE1I|1|Had to send back, no good
B002SE55MY|4|Very high quality and heavy duty! Sizing is a bit difficult! I ordered one size larger than pant size and could not even put them on. i ordered 2x larger pant size and am waiting for them to arrive.
B00COOS5NY|5|The product was delivered in two days.  The kit was complete and came with easy to follow instructions.  I installed the lights on a Rav4. The space was very tight to install the ballasts.  I used tie wraps to secure them.  After one month they lights perform very well.
B006CQU1FU|5|Fits better than even the stock pan! Has indent for 2500 Suburban crossmember. Very well made, extra capacity means longer transmission life! I highly recommend this pan!!
B00B50HO7Q|5|Arrived on time and fit perfect
B007ZUGIK4|5|A product from one of the best in the industry at a great price you cannot do better than that!
B00KB4ZL6I|5|Love it , letters are great and the design goes with my car
B00CZF3YTM|5|These worked great as replacements for the old bulb type I had in the RV!
B00DR67P9I|5|Made of firm metal and equipped with a bright set of LED's, this is definitely my best buy for a headlight. It can fit anywhere and even includes a spare. When the time comes, I would buy again!
B003A0VW7W|5|Fits nearly the same as original.  Watch a video to see how to take the broken one off.... it can be a bit of a challenge.  The metal anchors may come out as you pull the old part off...keep those so that you can use them for your new part that you are putting in.
B008I2OZIU|1|do not waist your money or time like I did. I left one star because zero stars was not an option
B0041TR3BK|5|Perfect OEM fit. Very easy removal and installation. Mirror does not come with instructions but there are some very good tutorials in YouTube.
B000C7YLEW|5|thanks
B00XAX4B9A|2|I drive a 2014 Prius 2. This sunshade is far too short to fit my windshield. The measurement in the item listing are for the cloth part of the cover. The circles are the part that counts - if they are not big enough, the shade will not stay and it had no shot at staying up in my Prius. I returned it.
B00GBW09G6|5|direct plug and play for my 2002 Dodge 2500.
B009D0VWR8|5|Great quality decals and fast shipping.
B00NPKEOZY|5|Living on Bakersfield, CA I was in desperate need of new sun visors, and this fit perfect on my new 2014 Camry. And I love that they provide little suction cups to hold them up
B000OCIWR2|2|A good pic set still works better than this, I tried to use it and went back to the pick set after a 20 minutes of messing with it.  Spend the money on a pic set if you don't have one.
B00746CMAY|1|starter did nt have same imprinted numbers. put it in; did not work. bought one with same numbers; voila.
B00GKHI1PS|5|Perfect OEM Replacement !
B00LDNKHBK|5|Great product no problems
B00VO70W7E|5|Came fast, easy to use. Seems to work. Can't complain
B00P1F6A94|5|sorry I'm late .. and thanks a lot
B007TY5SAM|5|Ordered this after my 83 year old dad backed into something??? I have not installed yet, so unsure about fit. But, the service from AUTOANDART.Com was GREAT!! Product arrived in 2 days, and in perfect shape.
B00KJB3QJ2|5|Good quality & good fit.
B0044GHGBM|5|Part fit and worked perfectly! I will definitely keep you in mind for the next time!
B007J5EADM|5|Fast delivery. Works perfect.
B000B7RCLM|5|Works!
B00BXMRP4I|4|Very helpful and useful, Paid for itself several times over
B00QEXZVHE|5|Extremely Bright. Definitely recommend for Fog Lights to go with 6000K HID's
B003VARGVM|5|Better then I expected.
B003ELU2Q4|5|This is a very nice fuse assortment and will be a nice addition to my shop supplies
B002ET2O2W|5|Well, I needed a replacement throttle control cable for one of my projects (back engine on a parking lot vacuum sweeper) both Napa and the local bearing supply company wanted a lot more money, same item, and I found it here for a lot less. Infinite control and instant response, especially shutting down. Works perfectly and shipped quickly. Holding up well, used daily, no regrets and will purchase again. On the picture showing the engine connection, I used a urethane vacuum hose fitting packed with silicone grease. I have found that this procedure seals out dust and moisture for many years, thus preventing premature seizures and downtime.
B001BNFV0Y|4|I was charged for 2 $44.69...I only ordered 1, assuming they came as a pair! Who buys 1 car mat?  They look nice, heavy duty, official MLB.
B000CB7DG6|5|Recommend! Great brand!
B003WDEYPE|5|aaa
B002NR2Z56|5|fine
B000BWCERY|1|Did not run; unfortunately I found this out after the date I could return for a refund on this piece of junk. Many other reviews have had the same experience with this worthless item.
B00L844DAU|5|Perfect fit
B000LEPT5G|5|Worked well and as advertised
B007GR4LIC|2|I just put my new cover, it looks nice but have to wait if it will last with the sun and rain!!!!<br /><br />Update!!!! After 6 month!!!! I will look for a new option!!!
B000B68C08|5|Works like a charm.  U just need a drill and some time to install it.  Check out the internet, there's a great short video on how to install one.  A piece of cake.
B00SVE8IR4|5|Love it
B00C7I54HC|1|Found out after I bought it that it was made with BPA. Also has a bad and powerful plastic smell. Yuk.
B000GZBZOE|5|installation was completed in about 5 minutes.  This are great.
B00M9NILDE|1|Terrible!!!! Went on my door for a terrible paint chip and it went on and is black! Made an ugly chip look even worse! Don't buy!!!!!
B009WAAM70|5|Nice to have a Backup
B00IKLLIHA|4|Decent recovery tank and seems to be doing the job.
B00IC6LE54|1|Ours came with a seam already ripped, and the elastics were exposed. We returned it immediately after opening the box.
B00C417PVU|4|Perfect but there is delay between hi/lo switching
B00J10SWAA|1|Did not work on my 07 Gsxr 1000 installed them and bike kept miss firing
B00WE65J3G|5|ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  looks great on my 2011 Rubicon too!
B004B2GL6U|5|WORKS JUST LIKE NEW, THE DEALER WANTED $135.00 FOR THE SAME PART, EXCLUDING THE GMC NAME ON THE BOX.
B008L0DPE4|5|Bought this exhaust due to the reviews and because I wanted a really loud exhaust. I've listened to this exhaust on videos and you MUST hear it in person to get the full effect it is simply amazing. You will not be dissappointed with this exhaust. I put it on a 2015 ninja 650 and it took about an hour and I have VERY limited experience with working on bikes or anything. I went for aluminum as well because it was cheapest and I couldn't be happier with the looks. Get it now! Also shipping was very fast it said it would take weeks but I got it the next week.
B00120LVDC|5|very solid. well made. works great.
B00L1KHWMM|5|Dropped my original remote and after years of taping, I dint not have to take anymore!!!
B007USQE3C|5|awesome price
B004WLK314|5|Love this sticker for my pickup!  Shows my Aussie pride and now my Shepherd Jack can ride in style.
B00J040MS2|1|What a waste! Does nothing, didn't come on time
B001C6N6K2|5|worked like the original
B000CIXOX0|4|works like it should
B0054FJEDK|5|worked as stated no problems found
B000C21HS0|5|These were exactly what I was looking for with spark plug wires.  They were easy to replace, clipped on, and stayed secure.  As for performance, I have not noticed any change, but its a 3 cylinder Geo Metro, so I'm just happy it has the power to get me around, I'm not looking for any real performance boost with these.
B000QUZ57C|5|Tight and great seal. A bit expensive but well worth the peace of mind. Two sizes
B00WAOSDZS|4|Just what it says. Fit perfectly
B00FZQ2S7M|4|was a great experience and will do it again
B00JVMDB9A|1|no god
B0027OLI3K|4|Great scent but doesn't last as long as would've hoped for the price.
B000T2Z7GG|3|Solid constructed pump will last you thousands of uses. Folding legs help minimize overall profile when stored away. Tight airseal maximizes pumping effeciency, good for filling up bicycle tires, wheel barrel tire, sport balls...etc. Handle is made of ok plastic and screwed onto the main pumping shaft. A single nut is used to prevent the handle from backing out but the design could use some improvments as the handle will work its way loose. For general around the home applications this pump cannot be beat for the price and will last many uses.
B000EQ8U20|5|Just finished the install on 1996 Camaro RS.  Be gentle with the rubber boots since you will be reusing them.  Very strong lift on these struts.  If your budget is tight you could probably get away with swapping only one.  The T-47 Torx/star advice put me on a goose chase.  Mine was T-50 Torx/star which is way more common/cheaper.  We will see how they hold up; they work great on day one.  Great to put the broom back in the garage that has been holding up the hatch for a while.
B002VKH802|5|Very easy application, came in the color I wanted and fast shipping! Very impressed with this product and looks fantastic on the wall
B007AOQW24|4|Perfect fit...
B00DTTH3RC|1|Does not fit 425 xpedition. Put this in and tighten down case and it cracked it because it was longer than it was suppose to be.
B00YTW9XZI|5|Perfect replacement
B00KIXSXWQ|5|It's hard to believe something this small will start a car with a dead battery.  But that is exactly what it has done for me on a couple of occasions where I listened to the radio with the engine off a little too long.  It saved me from a call to AAA and an hour of my time waiting for a tow truck to jump start my car.  This is a GREAT item.  Have not needed to use the other features (flashlight, USB charger, etc) but they work just as well.<br /><br />Before this, I had one of those 50 pound all-in-one units you find at the auto parts stores with the jumper cables, fluorescent light and tire inflator (tire inflator was a joke as it would take 3 hours to inflate a birthday balloon).  The features on it worked well but the thing took up a lot of room in the trunk and weighed a ton.  Then, it died.<br /><br />This comes in a small case with several USB adapters and does not take up much room at all. Highly recommended.  I intend to purchase another for my other car.
B00ED7ZXIU|3|I bought this unit right before heading to the black hills.  About a 600 mile trip and the hitch worked flawlessly.  My only complaint is the box that was shipped to me was nearly destroyed when it arrived via FedEx and I was just lucky nothing was missing!!!!
B00M5XW4FY|4|Fun and definitely grippy.....will protect my steering wheel from dirty hands and it's easy to clean.
B00OSAJNPG|4|Fit my Jeep Wrangler's bumper as advertised and looks very nice too!  Not to hard to install either.
B00Q4AM2Y2|5|Just installed these on a '15 Trax. Installation was a breeze but did require drilling one hole through the underside body molding for each mud guard. The drill bit size called for was a 4mm. I used a 5/32nd bit which equals 3.97mm and it worked fine. The instructions make this clear and easy to install. I purchased the mud guard set here on Amazon from the vender IAMGMPARTS. The mounting hardware was included with the order. Took about 45 minutes to install them. Would have been quicker, but the back tires had to be pulled to allow room to work. The mud guards look good on the Trax and fit perfect. They will definitely help protect the sides in the winter.  I like that I did not have to wait long to receive these after placing the order as this vender ships from over here and not Korea. I'm happy with the purchase and will do business with them again.
B00IG0U0X8|5|Only had them one night so far so not sure about durability or how long they last or anything but #1 they are awesomely bright at night, #2 they come with PLENTY of wire to go just about anywhere on your bike as long as you are smart about it, #3 the 3m tape is pretty good, I used zip ties on top of some of the strips just to make sure. As long as they hold up, I'd recommend them to anyone. They do not come with an off switch other than the fob so if you run straight to your battery be aware. My favorite color so far is the green. I wanted to get these lights to be more visible at night and not get run over, i don't know the legality behind it, couldn't find any real information in the va code section but I can't see an officer picking a fight with someone running the Amber or White.
B00N33PM18|4|Great.
B0002MG9TC|5|works great in our motorhome!
B000CEM3M2|5|I like DEI products, have used before and will use again. Work very well!!!
B00BOVDCPE|2|It worked, but not for too long.  One sunny, summer day in a hot car, and it was all kinds of melted and warped.  This wasn't even Florida, or California sun, it was northern Virginia!
B008ICI8N8|1|They are not momentary
B00CEZIML8|5|Very happy! ...just do exactly what the direction says and you will do it with no problem. Great product!
B0002SQVDK|5|Worked very well. Helped buff up clear coat after wet sanding and then used meguiars M3 polish to bring out the shine. Great buffing compound.
B00HQKD8II|1|Very poor quality. Already wearing out.
B002MO8DY2|4|Easily installed. Fixed mount joystick is a bit touchy, but illumination is great.
B00DK3VNZ0|5|Arrived fast and exactly as described.
B000I04Z7Q|4|Pretty good the tape sucks though
B0009OR8V6|3|Did not work real well for my 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara 2wd but the design is good
B003V9TCW4|5|Works great
B006NYIAKY|5|THIS IS A DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR A NISSAN D21 HARDBODY.
B003CVPPFY|1|My fault, I did not pay attention to the size did not meet the requirements
B0015DOEKI|5|Excellent as a gun cleaning product and rust inhibitor. Works amazing to stop rust from Corrosive Ammo like 7n6, and picks up carbon making it easy to wipe parts clean. Great stuff.
B00LO0M918|5|Ordered the 10 pack to replace 921 bulbs in my camper. They seem pretty well made and all are working. Much brighter than incandescent bulbs, and put off a cleaner white light. These LEDs use CONSIDERABLY less energy than incandescent bulbs and put off much less heat. They are also much cheaper than other brands of LEDs, hopefully they will last as long.
B0081KM7X4|1|Bought these to make my vehicle more obvious on Search and Rescue missions. They're not terrible during the night, but at daytime they can't be seen.
B00GJZ390I|1|2 days after installing seat cover which are totally cute they have ripped apart at the seam supper disappointed.
B00O72UPG6|3|Looks good but scratches easily.  Don't know how long it will last on an automobile.
B00CHD6VYM|3|After I doubled checked with them to make sure this was the correct drivers side mirror. Make, model, year. Before ordering the mirror. When I received the mirror the packaging read for a 1985-1988 cavalier. I told them I had a 1994 cavalier with all of the details. The mirror  was smaller than the one it was replacing. I talked it over with my son and he said to go ahead and use it because it was just smaller. There is a gap all away around it. He said it would be more trouble to go thru with returning it, so just use it.
B00310T6NI|4|So convenient when you need a quick replace. I added a little of my own air filter spray but product is great.
B00513G82U|4|Love the box and the price. At the time of my purchase, not all components pictured are included. This was disappointing as I had to build my own mounting plate. Otherwise, VERY happy!!!
B000BAV602|1|This product does not work as good as i expected from watching its demo videos.
B000UOC33S|5|Worked great, thanks again.
B005G5EAGE|5|Worked.
B0008F67L8|5|If you need to replace your 7 pin plug there's no reason to spend anymore, this one works fine.
B002R0V9MO|4|Description doesn't state, but this doesn't fit the sedan. Although it is mountable, the shape is different and will leave large gaps and not fully lock into place.
B004BTGK6E|5|Made the very notchy 6 sped manual transmission in my 2008 BMW 335i as smooth as silk to shift. I've used many Red Line  products in other power sports applications and they never fail to satisfy.
B00E9I97QC|4|Fit great up on our 09 Honda Pilot. There is some whistling noise which can get annoying and I did notice a slight decrease in our gas milage without cargo up there. However, being able to carry everything we need and not skimp out for vacation was a nice plus.  They were a pain to install, took my husband about 30 min start to finish
B000CAINEI|5|Works as described.
B00NLM3SOO|4|Great fit for our ford expedition
B00VF0OSFC|5|This is in my motorcycle saddlebag and I will not leave home without it!  I have used this to jump start 3 motorcycle (not mine, friends and strangers) and I still have about 80% full charge.  What an incredibly powerful yet compact charger.  Love it!
B005R4GQNY|5|Fits my truck perfectly and works well.
B00FPKZWBW|3|Got for a friends car dit perfectly
B0012TYW1Q|5|right stuff
B002E02H7I|5|I use this after every wash for two years and this definitely helps the existing waxed finish holdup. I find the key after spraying this on is to chamois most of the water and then buff dry with a waffled microfiber towel. The dirt is easily washed away during the next wash and less soap is needed. This also works great on the alloy wheels by spraying on a towel and buffing dry after washing to help washing away brake dust.
B0038AV792|5|Just put these on yesterday. They fit perfectly and look awesome!
B00004Y622|4|These work very well on our very slippery, icy front porch.  However, use another adhesive.  Several came off pretty quickly.
B003E26FW8|5|Been using these for a couple of years now, great products, much better than OEMs.
B000HA9NLK|1|The latch spting that holds the pop-up anchor down is too weak. The results is the anchor will not stay down!
B00OAXWYDY|5|My boyfriend loved it.
B004EK9BAW|5|Great Mirrors. They are offset more than stock. Changed bars and was staring at my hands with stock mirrors. These give you a lot more options for adjustment.  You can swap sides and have most of mirror below center or above center.
B00877SL2M|4|I thought they was big light bolts this one is  very small you hardly used them
B00KRPUO4K|4|looks as good as original
B00FZ9AO70|5|delivery was early and tires can new and clean.
B00HZSLHTI|5|These mirrors are an improved dimension in driving/towing.  Cons, the car wash brush made them extend and I had to roll down a window fold in before water came in the passenger side.  Seem to vibrate a minor amount at times.  The truck has a towing package so the wires were there for turn signals however I did not order the turn signals mirrors.
B0101BNC66|2|The front windows work just fine but the rear in channel keeps blocking the window from rolling up. Hence the two rear ones cracked from the pressure of the window and I had to remove them.
B0074OL3EC|5|Perfect item ...
B000N8F0PO|5|Great as advertised
B005T0GZSM|5|I needed a rear facing dust light for my desert truck and this has worked out perfectly. I didn't bother with the supplied wiring, I just wanted the light itself. The yellow color cuts through the dust perfectly, it's plenty bright (55w), and has a good solid mount - no slipping and no constant adjusting despite offroad abuse. Product shipped quickly, accurately, and undamaged. These lights are exactly what I needed. 5/5.
B00QKR2HQM|5|I would recommend this item to a friend
B000SNK7HK|5|Adorable! Exactly as advertised/described!
B0096D8DPQ|5|Great tires. Look good on my Mitsubishi lancer. An awesome price, cheapest low pro tires I've seen
B00F6JU2EE|5|Bright LEDs, but double check the dimensions to make sure they fit
B00HVHGA86|5|Awesome remote rubber guard easy to install plus easy to look for it nice bright color... would be even better if they sell more bright neon colors !
B00KLIC70M|5|Works great, good replacement.
B000A8FMLO|3|Rattles around really loosely
B008G2J9ZG|5|Product fits and looks great. Just like OEM
B000VKVXLE|4|The unit arrived on schedule, well packaged for shipping.  There were no issues with installation, and it performs just as well as the original.
B009LQ7ZGQ|5|Worked great!
B004J10IAI|1|I revieved the product damaged I couldn't wait to go thru with the return process,I needed to gt my car on the road luckily for me I could customize and repair the issue the radiator had when I receive d it the tab to the resovoir bottle hose part was broken of due to improper packaging..
B0051PJWQW|4|Does a decent job of preventing headlight lens from turning yellow/oxidizing and makes your headlight extra shinny for about a 3 days. I use it after every car wash so I cannot confirm how well it holds up for an extended period of time.<br /><br />I still recommend to use plastic polish to minimize oxidation build-up on your headlight lens, but this product is good to use after the polish. Might causes some stain on the surrounding paint if it's not wiped off afterwards.
B00BCRM9RM|5|Easy to install, and adds just the right punch to my car's interior.
B004I190YO|5|Works great. Arrived exactly as described.
B000C9TY8I|5|Easy installation and no leaks from gasket. Just don't over tighten.  Make sure the filter firmly snaps into place.
B009YR00MI|5|Outstanding product thus far. It's slow to air up a tire, but gets the job done.
B00N9LMXUC|3|It does not fold back properly and not stiff enough but it will do.
B001O0AHZS|5|Perfect fit and looked good. Unfortunately my son totaled the car the next day - but he wasn't hurt....
B000WK3PK0|5|Great product. Installed on my 2010 fltrx and a big difference from stock. Had to install, take off, and reinstall, but it was mostly my fault. So I'll save you the hassle. Most importantly you must put metal washers above and below pvc spacer. Not sure why it's a big deal but just do it. Springs are shorter than stock but don't worry they are stiffer. As a guide, I'm 190lbs and I used recommend spacer length 1.25&#34; and 5 wt oil and it's perfect for me. If you weigh more than me you might want spacer a little longer, or go with heavier oil. This is trial and error so good luck. Hope this helps.
B00EIRAB78|5|Easy to use, perfect for large windshields. Folds easily and stores without bulk between seats.
B006LUELJO|1|Set is missing 16mm and 18mm collars for bigger jobs. Biggest on is 5/8 that's it.
B000LP8F60|5|It's great, except it would be nice to have a readapted version for the slim transponder...this one is made for the older version. Still works and GREAT quality :-)
B001QFMPTM|5|Bought a used mini s and these were missing. Just trying to put everything back
B00WQW3OA8|5|Very nice
B005AX93O6|2|Very poorly product , holes don't line up .I don't like it .
B004L0AC30|5|This is a good product.  My order was prompt and efficiently handled.  It arrived in a timely manner with no problems on my end.  It works great.  It is a good value for the reasonable price I paid.  I would highly recommend this product.
B001C974Y8|4|It fit my 1994 f150 on the driver side, no complaints yet.
B00X012IEC|3|Like the quality so far but I have a Siverado HD crew cab short bed and it needs about 6 more inches. If it had that extra inches I would rate it higher.
B005NC303E|5|Purchased 2.  Very easy to install.  I added fastener covers.  The plates look great!  I would recommend this product.
B0028PJ10K|5|Do not make the mistake of buying the &#34;yellow&#34; ones first. These levelers are a far better product. I bought the whole system of chock blocks, levelers and caps and they are great.  Sturdy, strong and safe says it all.
B004AIHKT2|5|A local car repair shop wanted $38 for this identical part. I paid $13 for this. Same heavy metal quality part. Thank you Amazon!
B005AM8JHO|4|I have an aggressive air ride system in my chevy s10 with all VIAIR parts.  The pressure switch and all other VIAIR products are reliable.
B006CRT72W|5|excellent.
B00NIZ87O0|1|Fit to  type it just slipped right off
B00KVXTVZ6|5|Great lights, the look awesome in my car.  They are very bright and a true white.  They slipped in just like OEM lights, and they worked right out of the box.
B000JQQQKS|4|Great product, really came in handy!!
B000BRFGCE|5|worked like a champ,<br />excellent finish<br />perfect tolerance for my mod
B007IJ2310|5|My daughters teachers loved this and could not thank us enough..
B00B8Z00OM|5|Love it! Took some time to put on the car but you'll finish in less than an hour or 2 if you know what you're doing! Looks beautiful and is ready for paint!
B00HZOBV52|5|When installing seemed like a tight fight, but afterwards I realized the fit is perfect on my 2015 Pruis3
B000WJ64O0|3|This thing looks great when you finally get it on.  It is extremely difficult to install.  Make sure you leave it in the sun for a while first to make it stretch.
B0014JQ13Q|4|I like it but no screws
B004QQCEO4|5|Just what I needed at the right price. Satisfied.
B00K65ILSC|3|Easy install, just don't know if it made any difference at all.
B006FSOHBY|5|they work nicely.
B000LKGCG0|4|While the fender bags are very different of those owned many years.  However, I am interested in more use for American Trails!!!
B002UC4P2U|5|Great Product, Great Price, Fast Delivery,
B0097ZDR4K|5|It was exactly what I expected.
B00PE0JPFW|1|Adapter did not fit  filter, please send proper adapter.Someone needs to contact me about this ASAP !!! Then I'll know we are  Communicating. Thanks, Joe
B005NHPBLS|5|These are great.  They are very high quality, and they fit perfectly into my van.  With children in the van, these things are so easy to clean, I can just vacuum everything up, without having to worry about something sticking, or being ground into the carpet.  These will be a must have for me in any vehicle that my children ride in until they are to an age that they do not make a mess.
B002DOME1E|2|I used these straps to tie down my Mt bike wheels to the bike rack of my car. The plastic loop brakes easily when torched too much. I broke 4 of 8 within 2 months of owning these. Not recommended for strapping bike tires down.
B001F79API|5|great works good
B0031B8DQ8|5|This fixed my problem, worked as expected
B009SHW6QM|1|Would have been great, if I had a WMB. They put the filter in backwards. It doesn't appear to be changeable. What a waste of $9.
B00A2THRZU|5|Arrived in perfect shape. Will make installation easy. Good dealer.
B00QQTN3EO|1|I will I could give 0 star. First of all, it's supposed to give one basecoat pen and one midcoat, but they give me two basecoat pens. Secondly, the color doesn't match!! What a waste of money and time! NEVER BUY IT!!!
B00318UXY6|2|It's heavy, it's noisy, it won't stay pointing at my kid... ugh.  It's probably easier to just get a lightweight stroller fan with a battery.  It does plug into the lighter outlet and has a long cord.  There is no on/off switch, it's either plugged  in and on, or not plugged in and off.
B005FDT166|5|High quality carbon fiber with a thick and even clear coated finish.  Product fit extremely well just like the stock fairing.  Missing two holes for my windscreen but that was not an issue.  This is a great looking product.
B0098M5LUK|5|This was my first trailer brake install so I really didn't know what to expect.  It took me 30 minutes to install, 15 minutes a side.  After wiring it up it worked perfect the first time.
B000C9P9EG|5|Fits perfectly on my 2000 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner V6 with no leaks. Remember to open the gas cap to let out pressure from the tank so less gas will fall from the inlet line, and definitely replace the filter with the car parked outside along with a fan by you to give you constant fresh air from the cancer inducing fumes.
B005PUBZ5E|5|Very high quality and easy to install.  This is also very easy clean, and helps to reduce the amount of time it takes to clean my car. Instead of having to vacuum and scrub stains in the carpet I can just vacuum this up, or take it out and shake it out.
B00HYJTD7Q|5|throaty
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Great product and value!
B0050I3DC4|4|Nice to have...<br />Necessary only in the winter.
B00DJ4F8MO|5|Very good oil good price will keep using it
B00VUX5ABA|5|Great product and speedy delivery
B00DR0R39Q|5|The product worked great after installation on my 03' Infinity FX35 lift back.  The only difficulty I had was to break off the original brackets in order to reuse them.  Next time I would order brackets to save time.  There is a customer description of how to install it on the web which is helpful.
B006IDAZW6|5|Fantastic... Works 100% and it does heat up fast but wicked....
B00FJ9BV7I|4|Tailgate Liftgate Door Handle has mechanical components which are a lot thinner, and less sturdy than OEM, although I think it will work just fine. The overall fit was spot on and was a quick and easy replacement once you switch out the locking mechanism which took all of 2 min. to take from the original to the replacement part.  Happy with the purchase and it is good to have an operating tailgate again.
B0089Z0ABM|5|impressed to hell and back twice :-)
B00NQ45AA2|4|Seat covers where great! The steering wheel cover was kind of cheap but it fit and looked good. Shipped and delivered in a timely manner
B00KL2NEAA|5|It's a sticker.
B0002Q7BZY|5|works great for our 2013 nissan pathfinder
B00KWNUXWK|5|looks great!
B000C9WLA6|5|Worked great, decent filter for a decent price. Shipping was quick.
B00E1JONJK|5|Needed a couple of these momentary switches for the red lights and siren install on my tundra, with a little sanding these fit perfectly.
B00ODLRURS|1|These headlights looked like the budget-conscious solution for my vehicle.  Not so!  The low-beams don't work and the mounting holes on the pot metal enclosures for the electronics break under the minimal pressure required to mount them with sheet metal screws.<br /><br />Go ahead and pony up the extra coin to get something better.
B00KWETZS2|5|OE replacement part, perfect fit, shipped quickly.
B000BZGKCG|5|works great on my 2006 Kia Spectra 5.
B00XXU5CPC|4|Nice and bright!  Love it buy again
B005LGURG0|5|good fit
B00873J0YY|4|Great item for the price
B000GZINTY|5|Great, super bright LED arrays.  I used these on my saddlebags and wired them as run/turn/brake lights.  Huge increase in visibility.
B004AG5Y7E|5|best
B001RAQGXC|2|I was unsuccessful in removing scuff from windshield. After 45 mins I gave up. Followed directions & watched video. Oh well....$300 it will be to replace windshield.
B006TMOW16|5|A perfect fit and match.
B00067BVUA|1|Shipping was Very timely and packaging was carefully done but these bulbs are very similar to halogen color. I must say that I'm very disappointed with PIAA on this one. I will be returning these as they were very overpriced for the look and quality of the bulb. I will not be purchasing any other PIAA products
B00S8P64K4|5|Couldn't have been any easier.
B000C2S84Q|5|arrived as scheduled and fit perfectly. The cause for the old one to fail was the distributor o-ring. Replaced inexpensive o-ring, heater hose and now I'm back in business.
B00CXB77A0|1|IN WORK:  RV is in the shop for repairs.  During vacation we tried to use this NEW Unit (just installed).  Did Not Work.  Will contact Folsom RV to checkout unit.  I will contact after unit is diagnosed.  as-of-08/16/15:Because of circumstances, vacation and RV fender bender, I was not able to contact to request refund.  NOW: the return request is Closed.  The Unit never worked.  I am now afraid that I am STUCK with a unit that does not work.  I feel bad.
B0031RBIEG|5|Very nice lights, great quality and really bright.
B0082ACB8E|5|So far this is a great bed cover, I would recommend this to many. One thing that I would add would be some secure cables to attach to bed just in case cover would fly off for some reason. I added two bungee cords to the front of the cover and two in the rear attached them to the slots on the bed, they're very easy to remove just as the clamps of the cover.
B004AE0E6C|5|Excellent price, will fit 2008 through 2012 perfectly!
B000CF6I1I|4|The In-channel Ventvisor,Good product them need nice touch finish in edge!!
B001PZCY5I|5|Great!
B000P7O5DG|5|Worked perfect on our first trip with it!
B0042Z0E6E|5|Meets or expectations, great purchase.
B001O085G6|4|Look very good, hope they work as good as they look.
B00PFUWJMC|5|Excellent quality and looks great!!
B001EP0GOK|5|Fit really nicely, and with the help of a YouTube video it took all of 25 min to install. Arrived early. Will be great for my bike rack for my GMC Acadia.
B009UPLBLI|5|Was the item I needed and received it on time for the campout! Tried to buy a non-Atwood part at a hardware store but the seal on them were smaller and they leaked. The Atwood part is the exact fit and had no issues with it.
B004HAEFS2|5|Excellent quality vs price. Correct size, good connectors, definitely recommend.
B0011Z98Q0|3|Muy buen producto
B000TYVW8G|5|Thanks  ! Just perfect!
B008G2B1KM|1|Good fit, but you may have to drill the pin hole out with a 1/4&#34; bit, as it's a little to snug to get the pin through by hand. 4 bulbs that come with are a huge plus!<br /><br />2 year update: they are cracking and there is a noticeable difference in the lighting of the road. Not sure if it's the build quality, but pay a little more for some with a better warranty or better lens. 2 new pictures.
B003IS3HV0|5|Great conditioner, i bought a new leather messenger bag that i tested this on. It has a thick, syrup like texture making it very easy to work with and avoid a huge mess. I applied it and let air out overnight. The next morning I was shocked how great this stuff works. This is simply the best out there and i say that after testing on belts, bags, wallets and everything in between.<br /><br />I saw some negative reviews for using this on automobile leather. I don't have any experience with that but remember the leather on your vehicles seat has been sealed and coated with so it lasts for ten years; the leather wont &#34;breathe&#34; and absorb the conditioner the same as your leather bag would. This (and everything else on the market) will have different results with all the different types of leather, so keep that in mind when applying.<br /><br />Overall, great quality product. Very easy to work with and gives leather an extremely natural look. Definitely would recommend and would buy again!
B008EEYWKI|4|it was  a perfect fir for my truck i will buy this Item again
B002XL2XUE|5|Fits perfect..good quality
B00N48MU1M|5|sorry I'm late .. and thanks a lot
B000Q0S9G6|4|perfect for my truck will buy again
B000C0YR1G|4|Installed easily, cannot comment on longevity yet.
B005BOQV58|4|It fits. Seems to be holding up fine. It isn't complete on the back though. Like a cylinder cut long ways. I only bring it up because the handle it's replacing was complete in the back. It's not a big deal.
B0009IQZXY|5|Just changed the oil on my BMW K1200lt and it fits like the original.  thanks.
B000LQN0CI|5|Good price on time shipping worked good
B00B1MYGUG|5|Great helmet, fits a little tight but getting better.
B00B8X27NG|5|thanks
B000WK6994|5|brought for my Honda VT1100C Shadow Spirit. The rake on the front forks and the OEM speedometer mounting required the fabrication/powder coating of a little steel bracket to move the NC Heavy Duty windshield 1&#34; to 1 1/2&#34; forward for everything to fit. Not the problem of the KIT-CJD, the dang speedo was just trying to stick through the windshield.
B00F0C2SSK|1|I need to contact this seller because it came damage  and it came with no protection no foam nothing just the box and the vent visors inside a bag.! When I opened it was broke.! They look good I was excited but disappointed..
B00WJN2F1I|2|There was no hardware sent with this item. the hardware from the original Honda part, does not fit the holes. Hardware is unique and should be included. I am unable to mount this unit.
B00G9WA1ZC|5|This fits my Harley Ultra Classic tour pack perfectly. I have a T-bags helmet bag that is 1 cu foot and this bag is 1.4 cu feet. The extra space allows me to carry enough clothes for a 8-9 day trip where the helmet bag I could only carry clothes for 6-7 days. I like that I can lock the bag especially when leaving it in a motel room.  I can place items I don't want to carry with me, like my tablet, and lock them in the bag to keep prying eyes from seeing what I am leaving in the room. Haven't tested the rain cover yet. The four external pockets are great for sunglasses, sunscreen, the rain cover, and a map. One negative is the tie down straps are too long to use on the luggage rack of the tour pack. The D-rings on the bag are mounted about 4 inches from the bottom of the bag and the straps will not tighten up. I just fasten the bag to the rack using 6-8 bungee cords. I would definitely buy this bag again.
B00NBT4774|2|I thought that the white part was part of the sticker... This sticker blends with my black car.
B009M8YFVG|5|These snap on nicely to the license plate screws and add a very nice finished touch.
B00D9E3GTG|5|I volunteer with the children at my church. This year me and my Sister in faith took the kids to ,the pool every Wednesday which is a 50 mile round trip drive for me; so for a Finale for the kids I gave a back yard picnic! This was just perfect for the little ones!
B004C6M5BU|5|Under $20.00 and fits like a glove on my Memphis Shades Fairing...Arrived in two days (Thanks Amazon Prime!!)
B0060A9C26|5|Perfect fit and no way it could be easier to put on
B006BDFLPE|5|The remote works great.  I went to Chevrolet to program the remote and they only charged $39.99.  Great investment!!
B0027988HE|1|One spark plug box was empty, although the card board appeared to be of acceptable quality. Just wish it included the actual spark plug. Giving 1 star because 0 isn't an option.
B0012PR6C2|1|This part developed a leak less than 24 hours after having a mechanic install and repair the AC system. May be a bad tig weld on the aluminum as it is a pin hole but what a pain. Buy AC Delco parts for compatibility and still have issues with quality?
B00SY2ZAK6|3|I have purchased these for both of my vehicles. I have not had issues with anything until recently when one of them opened from the inside and the gel  began crumbling out. I am assuming it is from the moving up and down that it opened. For that reason I cannot give it a full 5 stars, but 3.
B00HOXB3GQ|5|Looks great! An excellent conversation starter.
B002XZ3OUS|5|Thank you for speedy delivery. Product was also exactly as advertised.
B000QA0SKQ|5|Exactly what I needed.
B009PHKSBK|5|We have this unit in our motorhome and it powers the tv and dvd player fine and has never given us a problem.
B00I2XMMDA|5|.Works great !!!!!!!Bought this for my mom.. She has limited shoulder mobility and great difficulty reaching seatbelt . I originally thought the price was excessive however, it makes her life easier..... soo its definitely worth it!!!
B00553Z926|5|Nice product.
B001GS0DCU|1|They were terrible the back ones will not stay on for nothing and actually flew off my car and was hit by the car behind me
B000WJYYSS|5|Great quality .
B002M4B3Z8|5|Just as good as factory headlights. Delivered sooner than I expected!
B000CKN762|5|They fit well and are greasable, which I like.  I've had good luck with Spicer driveline components so far.
B00BD4YQC0|1|Very poor quality wouldn't recommend!
B00FOX5ZC6|5|Works great, highly recommended.
B00FBKJ2BW|5|Perfect replacement for the key fob on my older 4Runner.
B0007M1ZGE|5|We bought this for our travel trailer so that we could haul our bikes easier.  Putting them inside was becoming quite a pain.  We already had a hitch mounted bike rack for our Jeep, so this was the perfect solution.  It was extremely easy to install, and works great!
B001U7M5LO|5|This Covercraft WeatherShield HP Car Cover is being used on an 85 Porsche Carrera Targa. This car lives in a very hot part of San Diego County: Santee. So far it's been working out fine. The Noah Car Cover it replaced finally disintegrated after 5 years. I hope the WeatherShield HP is even better.
B0034ZY3BA|5|Very fast service with shipping.  The tool is specific to my Vmax so I can't use it on any other motorcycle.  That's okay because this will probably be the last motorcycle I have.
B000E4T7HY|5|Mirror worked out great!!
B00F7NEREU|3|I made the classic mistake; I didn't measure my car seat. I've used a beaded cushion purchased locally for years so I mistakenly assumed that this one would be like the one I'd been using. While it's appearance is similar it's, unfortunately, much smaller. I drive a mid sized SUV so it's not an oversized vehicle nor are the seats. Still, this cushion is very small, maybe better suited to a smaller vehicle such as a coupe or sports car. Next time I will pay more attention to the details.
B008BT0LRE|4|Has a couple of handy slots in the gussets for straps or hooks.
B00CS7T0IQ|1|One mirror was broken when arrived. ATV Outfitters promptly sent out a replacement mirror. (5 STARS TO THEM)<br />These mirrors are supposed to fit Polaris Ranger. Will not fit a 2014 Ranger!!! The mounts are designed to fit a round post. The Ranger's roll bar post is irregular in shape and far too big for this clamp to go around. I don't know how I can use these mirrors!!!
B000E4PV0G|5|Just a described, perfect match with the other handles.
B001U7MWDU|5|Perfect fit easy install great quality
B003ZWE7UO|5|Perfect replacement to the OEM model that failed.
B0039HD4RM|5|I'VE TAKEN TIME TO READ MANY OF THE REVIEWS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT ON THIS PRODUCT PRIOR TO MINE. I PUT THEM ON AND COULD NOT BE HAPPIER... I ALREADY HAVE GRILL ACCENTS AND THE HEAD LIGHT ACCEMTS THAT MATCH.. ALSO, I HAVE SIDE WINDOW VISORS ON MY JKU.. MOST OF THESE PIECES ARE ATTACHED USING THE SAME 3M DOUBLE SIDED TAPE AS THESE PARTS. WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS THERE MAY BE A VERY SLIGHT GAP BETWEEN THE PIECE AND YOUR VEHICLE BODY, BUT JUST WHO IS GONNA SEE THAT!! IT IS SO INSIGNIFICANT, THAT IT ISN'T WORTH EBEN WORRYING ABOUT.. THESE ARE NOT LAMBORGHINIS OR ROLLES ROYCE WE'RE TALKING ANOUT HERE..THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN GETTING THE PROTECTIVE COVER OFF THE PIECES OF TAPE, BUT AFTER THAT JUST DON'T BE IN A QUICK RUSH TO STICK THE PIECE ON. SLIDE IT BEHIND THE DOOR HANDLE AND SLOWLY ALIGN THE TOP PIECE OF THE PART WITH THE TOP OF THE HANDLE RECESS. THEN PUSH THE PIECE INTO THE RECESS. JUST NOTE, AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED, ONCE THIS PIECE STARTS TO GO ON, IT'S PRETTY MUCH STAYING THERE.. I ADVISE YOU DOING THE BACK TAILGATE DOOR FIRST.. THAT GIVES YOU A DOOR THAT IS MOSTLY UNSEEN..SO, SHOULD YOU NOT QUITE GET ALIGNED PROPERLY, ONLY YOU WILL MOST LIKELY EVER KNOW! THEN JUST LEARN FROM WHERE YOU WENT WRONG AND THE OTHERS WILL GO ON JUST FINE! YOU CAN DO IT MAN!! I THINK THEY LOOK GREAT AND ADD A LITTLE CONTRAST TO THE SIDE OF THE JEEP..
B007FVQJF2|5|perfect for my application
B00DV47PDM|2|Alright, because Kensun asked for a review, here it is. This is NOT a vehicle specific kit by consumer definition. It did have the H3 bulbs my buell uses but that is all. Because it is, in fact, a motorcycle, I couldn't use the kit. I'll keep it, and hope that it works well for my car.
B007KPUXVY|5|Love them, fast shipping, great price!
B000FGEF9G|4|What I was looking for, but a little difficult to figure out how to adjust.
B000E8UZIU|5|They work very well on my Supra.
B0006IX87S|4|Made raising and lowering scissor jacks so much easier.
B002SE1GFY|4|geting a litte rain in car when it rains
B003YMX0US|2|Wrong description of product
B004FSTR5W|5|Great fit. Can't go wrong with K&N washable Air Filters. Increase performance while saving the environment.
B000K0263O|5|02 Tahoe orignal speaker. Great clarity, quality, easy install with no modification needed. Highly recommend.
B0040CTYAQ|5|Great replacements for broken ones on your door panels. They are a new design that works better than the original factory ones. Used these on a 97 grand am. They locked in way better than the OEM ones did.
B00B1G9PBC|4|This shifter looks and feels great! It compliments the interior of my tundra well. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because there is a little &#34;play&#34; in the shifter, even when fully tightened. The shifter will turn about a half an inch left or right, as if it's not tightly screwed on. Maybe I am a little OCD about this, but it simply irritates me. I purchased a new one and will be sending this one back. If the new one has the same issue, I will have to decide it I can live with the slight movement or find a different product.<br /><br />I will this review once I receive the new shifter next week.
B00ITG3RUC|4|Unit was new...mechanic installed it, charged it up and I am now running cool! Perfect replacement, shipper called and we verified my vehicle, engine, etc. before shipping, actually on the same day I ordered the unit.
B00L7UIUY0|4|these things are WAY cool.  Pretty straight forward instal. The wires are VERY thin and frail.  It takes a bit of finesse to strip them well and get them to cooperate.  No issues other than that.  No need for instructions, its all kinda obvious.
B009IJBMF6|5|Love this product ! arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Fits my 2000 Saturn LW2 Wagon, 3 Litre.  ALWAYS change the O Ring when changing this filter.
B002TMWIQ6|5|great brake pads does its job well
B0062IJQEA|5|Great fit and look for my truck !!
B00S9T7BLA|4|cute air freshener. a little smaller than what I was wishing for. but I like it. this was scheduled to not ship to me for about a month but lo and behold yesterday I got a letter-sized envelope all the way from England--wow, fast! a must for the pug lover.
B002DTV172|5|This product replaced the charger on a interior scissor lift that had went out. Works great.
B005PHCW2W|5|Fast delivery, exactly what I thought I was getting thank you
B000CMHVGM|5|This is a great item so easy to use saved a lot of time to rewire my harness thanks Mike
B004IYYELA|5|Worked perfectly!  The up/down was even set in the proper position to make installation a breeze.  Info from the internet made installing a 1 hour or less job.
B008PTV7QY|1|The chrome began to separate from the part shortly after installation.
B00QT1PRFC|5|great quality
B004ZC3TFC|1|Does not work as advertised. Do not waste your money.
B0000C6FOM|4|So far we haven't been able to install these due to the parts that secure the boat guides to your trailer are to narrow for our boat. The ubolts that come with the product are 2x7. And at minimum we need a 4x7 so that it will fit our trailer support rod running under the boat. Seems like it's going to be a good product once we find these bigger ubolts. Suggest to measure your boat trailer rods where you plan to install.
B0007N5758|4|Except for being ugly, this brush is great.  It is easy to hold and does a good job of cleaning nails.  That it is also inexpensive doesn't hurt, either.
B000VT44HK|1|Product arrived in a busted box and had a visible defect.
B00V56U28I|4|looks good and seems to work in removing odors.  I run the AC a lot so hard to tell for sure in short trips.  Longer trips, seems to do the job
B001TQMZWU|1|Chair broke at both sides of armrest when went to sit down. Had it less than 30 days.
B003YOD39E|5|Fits perfect, way cheaper than getting these parts at the GM Dealer.
B00ZB6CLSW|5|Great kit for the price. Very pleased
B000GOG3QK|5|Perfect fit
B00KWMO7V4|4|Great heavy duty mats. Only down fall is they slide around a lot due to no grip on the bottom side.
B00LZAYL8G|5|love it
B002R4U72I|5|This wrap arrived very quickly and it looks amazing on my pipes! I used it to wrap my KZ650's 4-into-1 pipes from the engine outlets down past the collector to just about where the tip attaches and I had just enough to get it done with the 50' roll.<br /><br />Pro tip: if you're good with safety wire and have a spool of .032 or bigger, you don't need to spend the cash on the steel securing straps. I always just safety wire my wrapping and I think it actually works better than the straps.
B00W2MPF0Y|3|Didn't fit perfect. A tad too small.  2013 Tahoe LTZ.  The chrome still peaks through.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|I purchased these lights for my zero turn mower.  I wanted to be able to mow near sunset when it is not quite so hot.  These lights appear to be made very solid and sturdy construction.  I was amazed by how bright they were.  I can see so well that I could mow at midnight with these lights.  I gave my buddy the other two lights.  I am now thinking about buying these again and putting them on my four wheeler and truck.  A great price for a great light!
B005P5DO30|1|What an absolute piece of garbage.  One of the cover rail bars snapped off when I was installing it - it's plastic.  I had to unscrew four of my bed rail screws to get the clamp ends into the rails.  The screw posts that clamp the cover rail in place aren't long enough, allowing a lot of play in the rail system when it's open.  When I tried to close the cover ( with the screw posts in the full open position, the latch would not close.  I had to push it closed with a screwdriver.  Then, when I tried to open the latch, the cord snapped!  Shame on me for letting this sit before I could get it installed - I can't return it now, and it's an expensive addition to the landfill.  My first, last, and only time I will ever buy from these people.  Steer clear!!!
B000AOMQ80|5|This worked really well on my rear tires. I had a puncture in one and the sidewalls were cracking on the other. After using it and then driving it on the side of a hill for a bit to get a good coating of slime on the insides. It seal the puncture and the cracking tire no longer needs air. Probably wont hold forever. But it bought me at least till the end of the mowing season.
B000Q0VU6M|4|perfect for fit for my truck
B00WMK6Z46|5|Has a grippy underside so it doesn't move around and is held down by the weight of the object. Looks great, perfect fit, provides excellent protection. I give the highest rating 5starts for appearance, 5 stars for easy installation, and 5 stars for affordability.I didn't believe just how well this product is made. Perfectly molded to my car and protects the interior. I would definitely purchase more from this company.
B00JXBAWEQ|2|Bulbs would only turn on if high beams were initiated. One light would flicker and eventually turned. Due to lack of directions I tried different wire configurations from other HID kits.  The adaptor supplies for the headlight socket was poorly made and felt it would come apart very easily on the road. I commend this company allowing me to return this kit but I don't appreciate paying for the return in exchange.
B008G2TRSA|5|well made. just as good as mopar/OEM
B003NHEPEE|5|My husband just replaced a broken strut on the rear hatch of our 2011 Suburban LTZ.  The door had stopped opening.  Replacement was simple and only required a small screwdriver.  Doing it ourselves saved hundreds of dollars.
B0030BBHN0|5|It's nice and you listen how it's sucks the air
B000EDQQJM|4|Tired to install this in my RV. Having problems with the proper positioning of the support due to the kind of counters we have.
B00VKM417K|5|Awesome cover and great price!!!!
B006YUICLY|5|Bought the 9005 4300K kit for my Toyota RAV4 a month ago and so far, they're holding up great. Comes in a silver brief case with the Kensun logo on it with a pair of bulbs, ballasts, written manual, and mounting brackets inside. Although the listing on Amazon says &#34;premium ballast&#34;, my kit came with digital slim ballasts. Had no need to use the mounting brackets or drilling my headlight dust covers since I was able to fit the cables and ballast inside the headlight housing (no worry of weather damage). Quality of the components is pretty good, although there isn't much of a difference between this and other kits, in my opinion (other than the way they're advertised). All non-OEM hid kits are subject to the same chance of failing or defect since they're unregulated and imported from China.<br /><br />Installation took less than 20 minutes since everything plugs together easily and with easy access to my headlights. All bulbs worked fine with no flickering. The bulbs warmed to full brightness around 8 seconds, give or take. Although I have projector headlights for halogen bulbs, these HID bulbs worked perfectly fine and light up the road with plenty of light without blinding oncoming traffic. For the price, this is one of the best HID kits you can buy under $100. I was tempted to buy the more expensive kits from TRS or Xenondepot but these are holding up great and for less money.
B005K4XF2G|4|Absolutely love it! The weight and color was perfect. The material around the steering wheel has a great feel to it as well.
B00BRAVCEK|5|On time and right item
B000E7WLJW|1|Poor Quality
B000FQ004U|5|YES IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED  AND EVER THING FIT FINE. THANKS YOU
B00K7938O4|5|WELL PRICED
B007R57ZEU|5|They look great just had a small issue with blinking in the trunk dome lights currently dealing with customer service so far so good
B0010GFW88|5|work perfectly
B007Z1FSKO|5|Just like the ones they sell at the dealership for a lot more.  It was easy to take the old Hyundai H off by using a credit card to slip under it after warming with a hair dryer.  The wings fit perfectly into the existing holes under the H
B00OLOBFVO|5|We have a Dune Buggy or Rail Buggy and we ordered these lights for it. My husband installed them very easily and quickly. They are great. Bright little led lights. Have a high quality aluminum body, very durable and they give great visibility while driving. Love that they are waterproof, dustproof, shockproof,  and anti-corrosion.<br />Wide operating voltage range: allowing them to used on different types of trucks, Off-road vehicles, 4x4's, Military, Mining, Boating, Farming and Heavy Equipment and more. Highly recommend this product. They look awesome too. I have adied photos. I receivedthis product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B004CV1PXE|4|Good, but wear away quick
B002WP362U|5|great quality!
B00E3BQRBI|1|Pot metal hollow studs snap and strip almost immediately. The design is very nice, but the execution is garbage. You've been warned.
B000LQHCJK|5|I bought these with the stove for my husband for his truck he says the work great
B003WOZOUM|3|This item is great - it stands up to weather and holds a ton of items.  We have a Ford Escort that doesn't have rooftop rails and we needed extra storage for our trip to Tennessee.  Why I didn't rate it a 5 is because it is very difficult to hook to the roof without the rails. We fought the item for hours and then watched the video from the manufacturer, that didn't really help.  We drove 4 hours to my parents with the carrier in the car.  My Dad had to loan us some additional tie down straps and it worked.  8 hours to Tennessee and then 10 back home after vacation.  It worked great, just a bear to figure out how to make it sturdy without roof top racks.
B0002SQZQ8|5|Perfect tool as pictured with a nice case.  Highly recommend if installing cam bearings.
B00GJKXW8M|5|It is small but it is very bright , I love it
B003X861OK|5|Got exactly what I ordered. Pay attention to the color and the number of openings for the window switches and locks.
B00JRE38EA|5|This just made my night driving so easy when I have to look at the instrument panel
B001A6VN72|5|Love this bag. Kuryakyn has excellent products!
B004TC3D18|5|The brush is great
B000H8QBSK|5|Fits perfectly. Comes protected in double box. Easy to install. Well made.
B0015KZNLU|3|This is a 2.000 in. ID to 1.500 in. ID reducer.
B005FRBJLM|5|I love the finish of the material. It makes it look very elegant my CRV. The package arrived earlier than expected. highly recommended!
B000JLMWBU|5|Very satisfied
B00KL3ALGO|4|Excellent customer service - the shades do help to block the sun which makes for a more comfortable ride for our little one.  The company was very helpful in sending a replacement order when one of the shades didn't flatten all the way.  Would definitely recommend!
B00QG5S9UG|5|Great product installs easily and is very durable
B007TY0E1K|5|This item shipped stupid fast, and for the 1/4 of the price of OE it was actually decent quality. I had expected this to get me by long enough to get the 150$ replacement from the dealer but may actually last just as long! It lined up spot on, and is a little quicker than factory! Quality cheap part, rare.
B00Q1RS83M|5|Fantastic light output. No one flashing brights at me. Very pleased with quality of wiring, telephone tech support was easy to reach and helpful. I spliced these onto the existing fog-light wires on a 99 F150. No issues.  Loved them so much, we are putting a pair on the community ambulance.  UPDATE - The drivers of the ambulance love these - as long as you aim them low enough, you will not be blinding anyone and will still get fantastic lighting. We bought the protective covers for that pair and the ones on my truck - fit great and will worth the 20 a pair.
B00FNP3YBE|1|Didn't work well for me. But I started liking the blue on my pipes, I think it gives some personality to the bike!
B000C36BKI|5|Looks great, as others have said. No noise, top notch construction.
B0041THIII|5|Fit my 2007 rabbit perfectly.
B0009N30IM|5|Really bright blue, I put in in my backseat lighter and it illuminates the rear of the car nicely, too bright for the front though.
B007V4XW44|5|Exact replacement,easy install.
B00JNA07S8|5|.  These work well and I will buy more.
B00RW7XE8E|5|These wipers a awesome!  Better than most I've bought at twice the price!!  Glad Amazon was able to come through with another company making quality products at a fraction of the cost.
B0013FW8LK|3|Worked fine, fit fine.  Has same internal cooling-fin structure as OEM.  Removed from box, cleaned rotor friction surface with aerosol brake cleaner and lint-free rags.  Installed easily.  Fixed a pulsing brake pedal and shudder when stopping when the brakes were warm, which means the original rotor(s) were warping as they warmed-up from use.  Made in China, so they cost twice what they should.  Certainly no better than OEM, but they may or may not be worse.
B00CNF092Y|5|Met all expectations
B00QIT9102|3|Look good but am having trouble installing them. Not very good instructions and also the instructions that came with it weren't for my 98 Chevy they were for a 05ish Chevy
B00C5RB03W|5|Good fit, ventilation, and bug free.
B0049YDIAM|4|Good
B003CEJWW8|5|It works great!  Stays on the wheels and everything.
B000EDUTX6|5|This stove topper is wonderful! Not only is it pretty and a wonderful way to add extra usable counter space in my RV, it actually does keep the stove top silent when the vehicle is moving. I highly recommend this product!
B00GEO29SM|5|Fits great!
B000Q0PEQE|5|Always pleased with Dorman brand. Never disappoints.
B000E3GH14|4|It didn't fit 100% perfect, but it'll do the job!
B00M42DEL4|5|These steps are great.  You can place your whole foot on the step to get in the truck.  I read other reviews that say it gives some when they step on it,  I do not find that to be happening.  Maybe it's certain trucks!  Mine are on a 2014 ram 1500. After looking at around 20 different boards I finally decided on these and I am glad I did! Don't let these other people's complaints stop you from purchasing these boards.  Everyone that gets in my truck says man I need these on my truck,  my step is useless compared to these, and they are talking about their factory running boards! !!!
B000BQWLE6|4|Bought this thinking it would hold a kitchen sized trash bag, but it's much much smaller. (My bad for not reading!) I'll use it anyway, and it seems to be sturdy.
B00A8QB3DY|5|Love this for my jeep, just wish it was lime green.
B00WFOPCUM|5|Works great. Thanks
B00SGGWGS4|5|Product is exactly as described and a great price. It also seems to be a little more durable than other frames I've had. Very well made. Thick plastic not the flexible crap. Very sturdy. Looks great on my Cavalier. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B00CFQ5GY2|5|This kit included SO much more than I anticipated. I fully anticipated using this as a 1-time &#34;use it, return it, and wait for a refund&#34; purchase, but I am keeping this for years to come until it breaks!<br /><br />I purchased this kit to break and rivet a 520mm chain, and it has VASTLY exceeded my expectations! I saw absolutely no signs of ware-and-tear after replacing my chain, and the price was extremely cheap compared to any local retailer.<br /><br />Please feel free to reply to this review asking any questions about the tools and I will give the latest feedback I have. If anything breaks, I will update the review to be less than 5 stars, but at this time I really could not ask for anything more from this product!
B000WOB7ZG|5|WOW... who knew this was going to work so well. I like this one.
B000EDQQJW|4|This is a pretty, functional addition to my RV and a great way to add usable space in the kitchen. Nice little product.
B001KSG2SK|5|I only buy AC Delco or genuine GM but since is really difficult to confirm if it is genuine GM i get this brand, perfect fit, great quality, etc, etc, anyhow, these links worked as expected
B00A1X9AES|5|good
B00N9MDGIE|5|Does the job of keeping the shoulder belt from cutting into my neck and looks great in my jeep
B00OX5GSRW|5|Easy installation to replace the mirror on my truck at a much lower price then i could find anywhere else.  Works great and looks great.
B000BO79AY|3|They work but just don't look very good on the car.
B000OR18BE|5|We stay at State Parks for 10-12 days at a time.  Our Travel Trailer is a newer lightweight 1/2 ton towable with 2 slides, but it only has a 32 gallon gray tank.  Even if our family of 5 takes &#34;military&#34; showers, we fill the gray tank in 4-5 days.  This large Barker Tote allows me to empty the entire gray tank without worrying it will overflow.  It has the better inflatable tires vs. some older units & hitches-up & tows nicely for trips to the dump station.  Since I only use it for the gray tank, I have washed it off & stored it in the bathtub or beside the bathroom near our 2nd doorway.  However, if used for both black & gray disposal I would only store it in the pickup bed or strapped under the Travel Trailer for sanity reasons...
B00OVBTKKU|5|I'm using these LED in the cargo light fixtures of my RAM truck.  they are very bright and light up the bed of y truck, as well as the surrounding area when unloading.  they seem to be of good quality and should last a long time.
B0083Z9136|5|good fit, the readers are an excellent choice.
B00TCBKYJA|1|The whole thing gets pulled into the seatbelt slot and the clips are too tight and when trying to adjust the length the clip scratches very hard on to the seatbelt. Do Not Buy.
B00F2ZHDU8|5|Great product if you use your gas powered tools sparingly. Keeps my blower and weed eater happy and easy to start.
B009DJUFCM|5|worked perfect
B002G29LLE|4|Easy to hold and gets into the contours of the tire. It also soaks up and holds the product so a little goes a long way. I did not like it when I tried to use it on plastic surfaces. I used a microfiber towel instead and got great results.
B006K8YQYW|4|Good merchandise and service.Thanks
B00KWHSVHK|3|Have a hard time keeping them on the seat. The clips that came with it don't seem to work right, or I can't figure out the right way to use them.
B00TM015XA|4|Make sure you get lubricants as this product has none.
B00OPMIR2M|5|Accurate gauge with built in light which help find the stem in low light.

B00ROJEMI6|4|Fender eliminator makes blinkers faster. The connections are easy to follow and hardware easy to bolt on.
B00GG9FK2M|5|I've been using ONR and other no rinse products for 6 years. I'm a pro detailer and wash my cars 80% of the time with ONR. Other uses include interiors (leather, trim and glass) Wring out your wash towel very well and wipe down a door/window then dry. Continue that on the whole interior. We have even removed fresh jean dye transfer from leather seats using ONR. In the house, wife and I have cleaned all of the interior glass/mirrors in the house in under 30 mins. Again wring out your washing MF towel well. Wipe glass both directions and dry with a nice waffle weave MF.

B00CFBVPOW|2|It fit, it worked, but for how long remains to be scene.I have lost confidence in Gates products lately since laying eyes on this part and<br />a water pump of the same badge. Use at your own risk.
B000E2CO9Y|5|I was afraid it would come loose after a while per other reviews, but this has worked great after over a year ever day in a demanding environment. Looks great!
B001EXDUAE|5|Works perfect
B010EUNSK4|5|I was pleasantly surprised when I received the Anker PowerCore Jump Starter 400.  I imagined that it would be very similar to a MagLight flashlight and while it is very similar it isn't nearly as heavy.  It actually feels very comfortable in your hand.  I have three other jump starters (two large lead-acid units and a compact Genius Boost model) and I have to admit I'm really intrigued by the design of this one.  It is very simple and practical.  Other than knowing which button to use to turn on each flashlight there is nothing else you need to know in order to use the jump start feature.  You simply plug it up and start your car.  Contents of the package: Jump Starter Clamps to connect to car battery Wall charger Car charger Micro USB charging cable Carrying case  Features: Jump Starter - It is a 400A Li-ion battery.  It should be able to start most engines.  It had no problem jumping the 4.0L V6 in my truck.  I suspect it will work much better to 'boost' a weak battery versus a completely dead battery though I wasn't able to test this.  It has the intelligent safety features so it won't work if you hook it up wrong and it won't spark if you touch the clamps together.  To jump start, all you have to do is hook up the clamp cable to the jump starter (it only connects one way), hook the clamps to the battery (red / black), and then start your car.  Unlike the Genius Boost and the traditional lead-acid pack I have, there are no button combinations or switches required to 'turn on' jump mode.  Just plug it in.  There are also lights on the connector that shows you when it is Ready or if there is an Error.  You are supposed to be able to jump start multiple times on one charge though I wasn't able to test that.  I also wanted to test it on a large V8 to see how it would do.  If I'm able to test that in the future I will update the review.  Flash light:  There are really two flashlight modes, a traditional led torch flashlight and lantern style work light mode.  With both lights you are able to have the light on solid or blinking.  There is a fast and a slow blink rate for the flash light.  The lantern has three different intensity levels.  The flashlight is very bright and has an adjustable zoom.  The lantern can be either be a white work light or a red emergency light.  Unlike most lights built in to jump starters, this one is actually a very usable flashlight.  The size and shape are actually normal for a flash light, so it is like you are getting a good quality flashlight with a jump starter thrown in.  In fact this will allow me to only have one device in the car and not have to also have a separate flashlight and remembering to constantly check the batteries in the flashlight.  USB charger:  There is one 'SmartIQ' USB charging port.  It is capable of charging at up to 2.4A.  This is great in that it will automatically determine the highest charge that your phone, tablet, etc. can accept allowing for the fastest possible charging. Emergency Window Breaker:  On one end of the jump starter there is a small metal spike that could be used to break a car window in an emergency.  There is a rubber cover keeping it from damaging anything.  I didn't expect this and found it a nice touch.  Battery indicator:  There is a four led battery indicator that is bright and easy to read.  Overall design: Again, the overall design is reminiscent of a good quality flashlight that happens to have a jump starter, glass breaker, lantern, and USB charger thrown in.  I expected the features other than the jump starter to mainly be gimmicks, but that isn't the case.  I have found myself using this as my primary flashlight and have also used it as a work light.  The work light is useful, but I would prefer that it be brighter.  I really like the size and shape as it fits in the glove box or in the door storage compartment. The end of the device that is not a jump starter is where the plugs are.  It is covered by a weather tight cap that screws on.  At first glance it isn't obvious that you unscrew this cap to get to the plugs, but you figure it out pretty fast.  Another surprising feature was that the cap is magnetized so that you can 'stick' it to your hood or engine compartment without a danger of it rolling away.  I do wish there was a connector of some kind that allowed you to 'clip' it to the jump starter.  Since the cap is black, it can be difficult to find it in the dark. The materials and workmanship are top notch.  It feels as if it is all metal.  I was initially surprised at the size of the clamps as they are much smaller than either of the other jump starters I use.  I was concerned that they wouldn't work very well, but that was not the case.  They seem well made and had no issues connecting to the battery.  One of the reasons I initially bought my Genius Boost was the size and quality of the clamps, but in practice these worked just as well and took up less room.  All in all I'm very happy with this unit.  I'm most impressed with the simplicity and plan to keep it in my wife's car as she was completely comfortable with the size and operation of this unit compared to the other ones that I own.  I'm really impressed with the smart design features and taking the time to make sure that each feature was actually useful and not just there to build the marketing story.  While I did receive this as a review sample ( I promise my review is fair and unbiased), I actually prefer this one to the three other units that I purchased mainly due to the size and ease of use.
B002BZV6FA|5|It was what i expected. Good quality cable and hook easy to install on the winch. I recommend this item.
B00GTORDWY|5|Good price, about 20% less than the local stores.
B0016KG72I|5|Very good no problems yet
B00UMD37PK|5|Husband loves it!
B00BMZU90I|5|Fits like a glove
B00B9DZKDE|2|It didn't remove hardly any of the rust from the water. Disappointed.
B007RW2Y30|5|Just as good as the one from from the dealer  Took appox 2 minutes to change apetr removing the motor cover
B001C6L5U0|5|Not used these yet but they also looked good.
B00GYUQ6XU|5|Perfect fit
B002R0QPFA|5|Exactly what I needed.
B0023VB7BU|4|Looks great, difficult to get the hardware to line up for installation. I recommend buying the adjustment wrench.
B000BGM7QS|3|It's a spare didn't use it because a seal came with toilet.
B00144B26C|5|Perfect fit and function on my 150 Mercury  XR6.
B003RQBKLC|4|The BESTEK 4 way Car cigarette lighter socket is ver nice but a little bit big.  I apreciated the business. Working good... So far. Thanks again.
B000BHKZIE|5|This is so far the best gauge I've had.  Work right out of the box and love for the fact that it is made in USA!
B0037W38IE|3|I bought a Joe Rocket when they first came out with the mesh- This one has some differences that are not really positive- it seems to have less armour, and doesn't breathe quite as freely as the original. It does fit better- these jacket should be snug if they are to offer any protection- I have a 42 chest and ordered a small- it fits fine WITHOUT the liner (which I have no use for anyway).<br />One issue not addressed by any of the manufacturers of these type of jackets (except one) is that the plastic used to make them can melt in a bad slid- and if you are not wearing anything under it can actually burn INTO the skin- the answer is Kevlar mesh- but those jackets start at $500..<br />Overall, it doesn't seem anywhere as flimsy as some reviews indicate for the cheaper jackets, and it isn't up to the standard of an Alpinestar etc.<br />So its in the middle and so is the price..
B00AA7OFLI|3|These work OK. I  broke one already in a accident. Two packs may be a safe buy..
B000VBA6KC|4|So... no template.  Which isn't that hard to make, honestly, but you'd still think they'd include one.  Getting the holes to line up precisely is what makes or breaks this install.<br /><br />Also... the rubber grommet just doesn't seem like it wants to fit, it's much too large to fit into the cut out for it without cinching it down, which you do from the other side - making this a two person install: one to hold it in place so it doesn't torque, the other on the other side of the firewall tightening each screw a few turns and moving to the next, over and over until it fits flush.
B0009IR0PQ|4|Works as advertised. Spray on cloth or upholstery, wait a few seconds, and wipe off. Been able to remove minor stains on my cloth car seats.
B003PIXA1U|5|Lots of extra power up top, easy to install.
B0007M1ZGE|5|Super easy to install took me about five minutes. And works great :-)
B000MIUHS0|5|Hard to fit over thick visor, but fits my 02 Tahoe ok. Sunglass clip part works great, I hope not to leave open and break as I have done in the past.
B002VPLB32|5|This is the original Toyota Denso air filter for my 2005 Toyota Avalon XLS even though the box has AC DELCO printed on it.  It fits perfectly.  I would buy this product again on my next air filter change.  5 star!
B002Y2LC7C|5|Great quality decal and very easy to apply using the Youtube tutorial provided by the seller.  Would highly recommend and most likely will purchase again for my husband.  Very cool product!
B000Q0YPYG|5|Fits perfectly for my Kia Sportage 2006!
B003IS3HV0|5|This is great I used in on my leather seats in my Acura SUV.  They feel soft and look amazing and new  I would recommend to anyone that needs to condition their leather.  I ordered this product through a discount/promo amount.

B00XMUNVF6|5|Thanks
B000MWQROE|4|Fits my Harley Davidson Sportster XL883L perfectly!

B000BM8RT8|1|Garbage product. Does not work
B00XQ6M13Y|5|100% WORTH EVERY PENNY
B001O01CJI|5|Now my 94' 4runner window rolls down! YAY
B0049JAA44|5|I was leary of ordering auto parts online, especially when I found out that the model year of my truck had more than one possible diameter of exhaust pipe, but the muffler fit and works great.
B0016IJFJ2|5|perfect fit and worked as it should
B0085IJNNY|5|My husband and I are pleased with the jacks, they helped the moving and or rocking while we are parked.  Husband wants to purchase<br />2 more for our RV is 36.9' long.  We are very pleased.
B00KK45XJO|5|Very unique decal and love the quality!!!
B000C9G00S|5|fit my 01 voyager perfectly.  smooth brakes now.
B000BYD3X6|5|A little different in design from the previous unit but worked just fine and engine runs great. Might cost little more than others but looks like good quality.
B007V6JJ3U|1|The decal fell off almost immediately after installing this on my hitch. Then the hitch cover completely fell off in just under a year.
B00F2Q8L30|5|very nice
B001C6L5H8|5|The part was a perfect fit in the mercury maruder .
B002PBWLJA|4|This is my second helmet.  The first one worked very well.  Save my life.
B00CJ00OKK|5|This worked great for my large arbor 4wt fly rod.  Easy to open and close.  Holds the rod securely enough that it's not jostling too much when my kayak gets thrown around by the tubers.  Simple device for a simple purpose, executed nicely.  Well made, as usual by Ram.
B005IDO5NC|5|Perfect wheel for my s14
B005SEJTYG|5|Good product and shipped quickly.  Have bought before and will buy again.
B00KDDZ9QE|4|Looks cool.
B008JORKP2|5|Absolutely fantastic!  Tried it out last night and was amazed at the amount of heat it put out on low!  We sat around the fire all night, from dark till three in the morning!  Only used a half a tank of propane. No dirty ash, no stinky clothes!
B00BD4SM9S|4|Is nice the material is not great but is good
B00UMR1I1G|5|The light is bright and I can still see how to back up. product arrived on time.
B00DNXRKAY|1|Break lever did not come with all of the parts needed. The little detent that pushes in the break piston was not there. I was only able to use the clutch.
B002MAGGC2|1|It fell apart on the first trip.  The attachment for the strap pulled off the bag, making it unusable.
B000VKOD9S|5|Perfect fit
B002ZMR6KS|5|Installed; looks and works great!
B003Q1NSQI|4|This item is very sturdy and a good buy .
B006OCAP80|5|Exc purchase
B00IS93UKW|5|Great bumper!
B009S31X6U|5|Performed as expected, fit very well. Would highly recommend
B00YB5GAEA|2|I have only tried one of the two, the first time I cycled it through functions it worked fine the next time and every time since it only has one constant light output, I don't know if its hi or low and flashing works. Also it is so hard to push the charging cord in ,I feel like I am going to break it. When mounted on seat post it points downward to much. The housing is well made and nice looking, but the internals appear to be of low quality.
B0086ZNB4S|1|Bought this, installed it as soon as it came and within a week and a half, it was sliding up and down the seatbelt with no effort. Completely ineffective, cheaply made and a complete disappointment.<br /><br />And, now that I've had them for about a month, I can't even return them and have to speak to Amazon to resolve.<br /><br />So disappointed.
B000C0WOMA|4|Good quality part at a great price and shipped, Prime, equals Fast.  Golly, what is not to like?!
B00NHBYOA6|4|Works great, but don't leave it plugged in over night will drain battery if left on.
B004WK1OOA|5|A perfect match to my 2008 XC90. Look on YouTube for a really easy diy video for self-installation. Took me 7 minutes. Buying the part online and installing it myself saved me HUNDREDS.
B00K7X870U|5|Awesome mats
B000CCM3J2|3|This stuff is so strong that if you accidentally get it on your paint it will take the paint right off!
B000JFHNG0|2|After several used, I have had problems with this item
B00032K4FG|4|Great product! Love it!
B00757E7LE|1|Strong material but disappointing in the transmitting
B000E3FDXM|5|Nice fit on my 30&#34; tire. Love the denim texture and color over those shiny vinyl types. Has an elastic band so no adjustment needed. Great quality for the price.
B009NCLY1K|2|Did not fit on my gear shifter... So I cut it down the middle partially, so I could pull it over the gear shifter knob and then tied a hair tie at the bottom. The quality is very poor. 2 stars .... because I'm still going to use them...
B00DX87928|5|What can be said about a helmet. They can be hard to review as you don't know if they are going their job unless you unfortunately end up testing it the hard way... a bump on the head.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Looks beautiful.<br />Feels like better quality than any of my other helmets<br />Good air flow...for a helmet. Don't expect a winters breeze in the summer though.<br />Padding is great<br />Price - I doubt this is the best helmet you can get, as I would assume a $300 is going to get you more, but for this price point I am surprised how nice it feels.<br />Button for strap (Nice to have the strap not dangling)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Weight - Average here.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seems a little thicker than my others, not sure if this is a con as I am all for more protection if that is what it is providing.<br /><br />I have no regrets buying this helmet, and I think it would be hard to find a better one for the price. Can you find one for less money that is as good...maybe, but doubt it. I would easily recommend this product, but again without real life testing of its safety it is hard to rate these things.<br /><br />Happy riding, and keep it safe.
B00JB39ZJY|5|Love these seat covers. And they do fit my 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan which has been converted by Braun for a wheelchair. My be pricey but well worth the extra money.
B00UMQ5P8O|4|Buen producto.
B006166OR0|5|MHVKY L LILIY T LILI LI IG
B0083TYGW8|4|Fit well. Like the material. Stretch fabric on back and around the sides of the set easily damaged. Careful it doesn't get snagged on anything during installation. Would buy again. Almost made it a 5 star.
B007LIA8JM|5|This fits great on my Saab 9-3, feels perfect, good enough grip to not slip to much or feel rough when turning.  Definitely worth it.
B009PIKHYW|5|Perfect fit. Just as advertised
B000GZQJIQ|5|I like this thing. Just added the platforms from pegs, and the stock pedal was a little to small. I had it over 3 months now
B0067UFHWS|1|To preface my comments, let me say that, before I left the automotive industry altogether, I was an ASE Master Automotive Technician.  Make of this what you will.  I bought this bearing because it had solid reviews and I could get it in two days via Prime.  After replacing the factory bearing and u-joints (all made by Spicer and of good quality), I had a driveline vibration starting at 40 MPH.  I spent my weekend checking driveshaft phase, looking for something I might have bent while installing u-joints, etc.  After eliminating all other variables, I reinstalled the old Spicer bearing.  Vibration gone, noise gone.  Others may have luck with this bearing, but I sure didn't.
B005JPGTNI|5|Good stuff!<br />Works well when you run out of toilet paper...
B0002MBC1W|5|nice
B00KMD3IB8|5|Works perfectly for my 2001 suburban!
B00IGJKFXE|1|Not at all horrible ... Nothing like it shows in the picture
B000CB0WBO|5|Good price, great.
B00JXZK12A|5|great!great!great! did I SAY GREAT WHY THAT EXPRESSES MY VIEW OF YOUR PRODUCT THANK YOU AND IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE BACK/JIMPAWLIK
B003WJO5ZW|5|Insulated the return fuel line on my 1987 Wrangler.
B001EAQTRI|5|Didn't know these existed until I needed one.  I drive an older vehicle with an older stereo.  While attempting to add Bluetooth functionality to the stereo I couldn't help but notice a loud static noise was interfering with my audio experience. I used this device between my Bluetooth receiver and the Aux port in the car.  It removed all electrical interference and static for clear-as-a-bell audio! This allowed me to properly enter the Bluetooth age in my old car.  I am extremely happy with my Noise Isolator and highly recommend it to anyone with an old car stereo that they don't want to replace.
B00836X87K|5|Fits very well. Looks great.
B00GXXMG7S|1|lights dont all work
B009XA8DYS|5|Good fit, less than half dealer price!!!!
B002U729UA|4|Better than products with carnauba wax that made my entire car static.
B00HYU94OC|5|PERFECT - RIGHT ON -DELIVERED ON TIME !
B0051SE3ZY|4|good price!
B000GD5FMY|5|I love them, had an issue with my eyes watering while riding. Once I got these, no more tears. ;0)
B00JKMNV5K|5|Fit middle row seats like a glove. Looks better than original material,.
B00684TAYY|5|Worked exactly as described. Followed the directions and I had a working remote within seconds. This was for my husband's 2004 Nissan Maxima. Would recommend
B000765E12|5|good product
B000YE6YMU|5|Fit as stated on a 97 pathfinder. I purchased this and a national bearing at the same time for the exact same application with the same part#. This bearing fit the national did not. The national had a better fit and finish and had more smaller roller elements that were a few mm longer that this bearing has. The national was machined with too tight and ID to go all the way onto the spindle shaft. this one was fine.
B00P80905I|5|Excellent ,
B000CIK8CA|5|What type of muffler comes with it
B00T36HLYU|5|These mirrors fit our 2014 Silverado.  They actually look like they came with the truck!  Very easy to put on and take off!  Highly recommend the mirrors!
B00KQXC2J8|5|works a it should,  beware the new cap does not include the push pin.  without the push pin you cannot attach the strap.l
B004ZF39T0|5|Purchased for my 08 grand prix... love them! could not have made a better purchase. The 6000k is perfect. A nice cool whitish blue tint without blinding on coming traffic. One caviot is to make sure you install the lamos to the point correctly. I woud suggest watching some videos on how to install them and point them in the correct direct, so as to not get pulled over or blind on coming motorist.<br /><br />Installation:<br />Seriously took me 7 minsutes to install. Just plug mount the resistor with the bracket and viola you re good money!
B00LMZ3LF8|5|I had to adjust my review to update how it really is after spending more time working with this housing. It fits the rocker switches perfectly (previously I said it did not). It was user error, which is rough since I spent over an hour working on trying to get the rockers to fit.<br /><br />After taking a month away from my project, I went back and tested it and bam, it fit right. So I have no idea what was going on the night it wouldn't seem to fit.<br /><br />Overall, this is the perfect housing for any single rocker switches.
B00JSDZ3U2|5|Fits my car perfect....Thank you
B000B6DG4U|5|I've been looking for a solution to make my ugly, dirty calipers look crisp and clean for a while, and - this is it. I went with the Black Satin color.  The good -  * LOTS of paint. Seriously. There's enough paint in this kit to cover all the calipers of three or four cars and then some. Excellent. * Everything you need is included. A pretty big can of caliper cleaner (which is definitely going to last for at least a year with as much as you're going to use), tape (for taping off brake parts that simply won't do well with paint on them), and instructions (need I say anything about that?) * Finish looks great. Have had my calipers painted for a couple weeks now and the paint has held up wonderfully after numerous self-service car washes with a *very* high pressure sprayer.  The not-so-good -  The brush included is sub-par quality, for sure. There were bristles falling off inside the package before I even took the brush out.  Other -  In addition to the caliper cleaner, you may want to use some sort of abrasive pad (sandpaper, steel wool, etc.) to clean off any dirt build up on your calipers before painting. I, personally, gave them a -very- mild clean, and the paint holds it's own very well, even without being a factory finish.  I picked up a set of foam brushes (which I would definitely recommend) which provided a great even application with absolutely no dripping whatsoever. You can find them here for $5-8 bucks for a substantial amount of brushes - way more than you need - to get your calipers looking great. Even with the additional cost of the brushes, this is still a killer price for what you get.
B000TYU4Z8|5|Seems better than oem
B00YE5Q182|5|Have you ever had problems with the battery of your car?<br />Did you happen to buy a starter for your battery and maybe it did not work?<br />If you then think that this product is made for you, as it fully reflects the characteristics described on the info product, certainly you will not be walking if your battery goes to ground. (If you do not forget to take it with you =))<br />The packaging is simple and inside we find a practical case really well done, with inside:<br />1 * 12000mAh emergency starter Jump Starter<br />1 * Car Charger<br />1 * AC<br />1 * 1 USB cable micro-USB<br />1 * Battery Clip<br />1 * Manual (various languages including Italian)<br />This product is really well done, for the same price many times there are products that are found in the end does not work, then over this product, not only the works of jump starter but also torch, usb charger, and messages SOS visual.<br />The operation is very simple, look at the video found next door (if you do not see is probably because you have to use smartphone with a desktop device to see the video)<br />This is a product that I recommend to almost anyone who has a car, because the lives of car batteries are unpredictable, it is to avoid being on foot due to low battery, the board much to spend this money, because if you think about contact a Wrecker etc ... there would cost a lot more. (Opinion of all my staff)<br />Recommended Product<br />I hope I was helpful.
B00ANZHG7C|4|I've been using these cloths all around the house, and the set comes with quite a few, as well as for detailing the interior of my car. I prefer not to use them on the exterior as they do have some pulling and jaggy frays when you run your hands over them.
B00ONHITZY|1|Did not fit tail gate and did not work a total waist of time and money.
B00ZHZ608Y|5|It went on very easy but it kind of scars it's a lot of scratches on the yellow one on the back it doesn't hold up well when is a lot of activity going on in the area and trunk area salon scratches on the front hood at that lied it is pretty shiny waxes up good Price is right
B001ABPKUS|5|Awesome product, easy to install!!!!
B001JR3RRQ|5|Fit perfectly.
B00LX0C8XS|5|This is a quality jump cable. It comes in a cloth carrying case, and they even supply a pair of light weight gloves to keep your hands clean when you have to use this cable.  Am well pleased.
B0045G09TC|5|Solid chain, solid clasp. Very satisfied
B0012TRB9Q|5|Good quality letters.  Worked out well for my inflatable raft
B001AY2WLU|5|Product arrived on time and as described. I dig smaller multi-tools and this one seems durable so far.
B004PC0CQG|4|Easy to put on other than small lenses very durable
B00AMMCT50|5|They are really cute and my grandchildren love them.  I also go a Road Runner decal for the back window.  Make a grandma feel young again.
B000RXKR6M|5|This microfiber mitt is better than any other i have used. It suds up really good and has a nice feel to it and its smooth on my car.
B00QGPKFGW|4|I wish the sides were a bit higher on the front mats. Other than that I think they are great!
B008FAQONO|5|Nice product
B0000AXU02|4|Only complaint was the loop.  It's a little big and I'm afraid it may fall off when I'm towing but it really can't.
B0038AVI4G|5|I had my qualms when I bought this for my W220 chasis Mercedes S500 4Matic. I was really amazed by the respect and beauty it brought my benz. Friends and foes alike are awed by them. I am satisfied and will recommend them to any lover of respect and aesthetics to install them on their benzes.
B00VHSFG1M|1|Pretty cool unit, could do better with user manual. I would not recommend buying the unit.
B001DZHTD2|5|These REALLY WORK!
B003NU0EM8|1|Bought this to remove some quarter sized dents on my new dryer.  Suction not strong enough to remov any dents.
B00NA7OH7W|5|Super LED replacement bulbs for the power hungry incandescent bulbs. Replacement could not be easier and the illumination provided far eclipses the original bulbs.  A friend of mine liked them so much he purchased some as well.  He said he was pleased too. The vendor, Cabin Bright was terrific in fixing a shipping problem.
B0018YGOIO|5|Seem to be a good shock without spending a lot of money.
B0049EXGV8|5|Works great.
B00G5N24E6|4|Purchased 4 sets of these to replace the lights on the back of 4 Caterpillar 777A Rock Trucks and they work great so far. They were used in a 24V application and seem plenty bright enough, though did notice at certain viewing angles they seem a bit dimmer, but they work well for what we needed them for. You also have to be careful when mounting them if you over torque the mounting bolt you can pull them out of the housing. You can't beat these for the price.
B000JFHNG0|5|Can't say enough about the value of this set<br />Good Quality<br />Accurate<br />Low cost
B0009IQZH0|4|Good product.  Its hard not to trust the Meguiar's name when it comes to auto detailing.
B00E1ETJNU|5|As shown - good condition
B0009IQZFM|4|These are real nice lint free towels for drying your car.  Couple them With the Pilot auto squeegee for a spot free dry every time. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BELP3Y/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_56
B00HHGSFLG|5|cheap and now my scion rides like when I first got it.
B005SVXQS4|5|Does what it says
B00150T13G|5|Best smelling air freshener!
B00CH6T18C|5|Easy to use and makes the leather look new without being oily or sticky.
B000C57W1S|5|Best steering parts I've ever bought..
B0050Z9WL8|4|BRIGHT! Wow! This kit was very simple to install, and comes with just about everything you need. The temp choices are awesome to you can pick what application you want to go with. After much research the best color for normal driving lights is 4500k - 6000k<br /><br />Less than 4300k - Good for fog lights, will be very yellow in color<br />4300k - Factory color, this is white with a hue of yellow.<br />5000k - Near pure white in color<br />6000k - White with a hue of blue<br />More than 6000k - Starts turning blue and then purple<br /><br />I personally went with the 5000k setup and do not regret it at all, and I am glad I went with that over the 6000k. The 6000k has the &#34;HID&#34; look  you see in Audi, BMW, Mercedes, etc however that blue is not actually from the bulb but from the light bending in the projector housing which is what gives it that color. These vehicles are actually in the factory color area listed above. Again I went with pure white and love it. Coming from halogens I didn't know what to expect but now I know I will never ever use anything but HID or brighter for the road.<br /><br />I do have reflectors in my vehicle instead of projectors which some people can complain that are blinding, and they are correct if the lights are not adjusted properly. I installed mine, tested them and then lowered them just a notch to make sure they stay on the road and not in peoples eyes. I found that even lowering them I get at least 2-3 times more light coverage on the road and distance at night than using Sylvania Silverstars and I have yet to have anyone flash me that they are too bright. I even went to the extent of leaving them on, going down the road in another vehicle and seeing what the look like from behind and head on. No issues.<br /><br />The only issues that I had are minuscule in the big picture. The packaging though cool looking from the outside, is not made of metal it is cardboard meant to look showy. The items packed inside are just thrown inand not really meant for the foam that it is inserted into so they just flow around in the case. They would have been better off by just putting everything in bubble wrap and putting it in. The cord going from headlight to headlight leaves very little room in an SUV was clearly designed for a car and I can imagine would hardly fit or not fit at all in some pickup trucks. New cars have very little room for extra things so you need the extra cord stretch to make it fit. The mounting brackets are flimsy at best and lack self tapping screws to mount them into the body or frame of the car which is what is needed. The cord lacks heat shielding which is needed for the heat of the engine compartment. Lastly if you own a vehicle that is at all made in the last 15 years and uses a 55w halogen setup you are going to need to the capacitors to get rid of the check engine light for a light being out, and don't bother with the cancelers, they are for other 35w vehicles using factory HID and you changing them out.<br /><br />I did speak to customer service a couple of times about the check engine for the lights and they were kind enough to send out a set of capacitors. Customer service though polite, seemed like this person shouldn't have been in the customer service field. You could tell they didn't really want to talk to me, wasn't interested in being on the phone and wanted to throw something at the problem to move on. While this time did work, it left a bit to be desired in terms of customer care.<br /><br />In the end, for the price you can't go wrong. It isn't much more than decent halogen replacements, everything for the most part is plug and play, and this will give you light like you never seen before. But be ready to get extra parts to do it correctly and a clean install. I highly recommend this upgrade, and yes I would buy this kit again if necessary in the future.
B00CJ9IJ6M|5|Perfect
B004U3THY8|5|Looks great on my 2014 RT Blacktop Charger. Very secure
B00KMM6A6Y|2|UPDATE!! About 6 months after installing these lights, one build started flickering a lot. It now turns on but only about 1/2 as bright (the white) so one side is ultra bright and one side is dim. The orange light is still full power. Now the other light is doing it too (after about 8 months). I tested all my wiring and that's not the problem. I have many bulbs from JDM ASTAR and have never had an issue but these bulbs aren't fine tuned yet.  These lights are awesome! They're super bright and switch colors just like they're supposed to. You need to buy load resisters otherwise you'll get hyperflash.
B00GHT2WZ4|5|Just what I needed! Awesome price. Thanks!
B001UOS8RM|5|A true fit on a Toyota collora 2001 4-door manual
B001FCAY8U|5|Just what I needed. Easy on easy off. Just the right height.
B00QMVTFAC|5|Awesome product, came with all materials and looks minty!!!!!!
B0053ZIZXQ|3|Ok
B008BE04C6|1|Bought this in January 2015. Now August 2015, both lamps are burnt out. This did not work well on my Toyota Camry Hybrid.
B000ED8KTG|1|It was the wrong part, not even close to the right one!
B002VVI6T8|5|This is a well built intake for the money.  Installation was easy but the directions were not great.  I looked at a few photos online before figuring out how everything went together.  It took me no more than 30 minutes from start to finish.  You can definitely hear the air sucking through this intake compared with the stock unit.<br /><br />While this model will work on a 2014 or 2015 Street Glide, the stock cover will not fit.  This is a bit confusing for some dealers as was the case for my purchase.  Their part numbers indicated that this was the correct model.  Unfortunately I did not realize this until when I attempted to put the stock cover back on.  Rather than return it, the dealer called V&H and they will be sending out the required bracket.  I'll update the review once the bracket arrives.<br /><br />If you are doing the intake, don't forget the V&H Fuel Pack 3.  I installed both the intake and FP3 in under one hour.  Both upgrades are highly recommended.
B00O53PARG|4|Timely delivery, price lower than Findlay Lincoln, Henderson, NV. They wanted $1660 to fix both, right and left side, rear doors. That didn't include labor. Had it fixed by a dealership in GA for $260, rushed the OEM parts for $200. All together I paid $460 for the job. Findlay Lincoln's loss.
B006QH56GO|5|Great battery
B009ET15P2|4|Had a couple little snares when I got it but a good product.
B000BZL080|1|It did not fit my jeep as the description  said it would.
B00FBWJXDC|5|Good quality
B001OCOKM2|5|Better than I expected
B00PM35BQS|5|Perfect factory replacement and cheaper than other places I looked at.
B00FPFTUBK|5|best value in LED lamps for RV's.
B004R33H56|4|Great bars. I'm a picky guy and live by &#34;You get what you paid for&#34; but a really didn't want to spend 450$ for Thule or Yakima aero bars. I ordered these and didn't expect much from it but I was really nicely surprised by quality and looks. They look great!
B00XM16K2Q|5|Great product just as expected. My fuel mileage defiantly went up and the throttle response is great. Even though my truck is lifted 3.5 in with 33s. I would recommend to anyone.
B00GBVPAAW|3|Comfortable grips, but I dislike the pin used to hold the throttle side in place. Why not just have it clamp to the handlebar like a normal throttle handle? Also, the kill switch wire is very short and needed to be extended to fit the application.
B00EFDYFHW|5|awesome
B00KGIEDP4|4|Works great no problems
B002C7DSIK|3|The product images depict using this net as a bag, for example to store groceries in the back of your car. In fact the net is too flimsy to do this; there's no way you could reliably use it as a bag in this way. If the woman holding the bag in that image were to let go, the net would flop down onto the floor and offer no storage space whatsoever. The net probably works fine if all you want to do is section off your car, but for the misleading product images I removed multiple stars.
B0024NSLO8|5|The product quality was excellent.I have no problem or trouble at all.👍
B00KH9PW3E|5|Awesome!! I purchased two one for my SUV and my car and they both are just what I needed!!! Just the right fit for my SUV and for my car I can fold the corner and it protects just as well!!
B003IS3HV0|5|We have a couple of leather couches that are at least ten years old.  I applied this conditioner to the arms of the couch which get the most use.  It was fairly thick, like honey, to spread on but seemed to really seep into the leather and soften it.  I also tested it by applying to one cushion and not the others.  The cushion which I applied the leather conditioner is indeed a lot softer.  Worth the money!
B000YC7G8I|3|Does the job it needs to.  I don't like that the air chuck leaks air after it is put on until it is closed.  For car tires it isn't a big deal, but for bike tires, it makes a noticeable difference.  Overall, not a bad air gun though.
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Great light bar for the price, the only problem i had with it is that i live in southeast Alaska where it rains a little over 100 inches per year, so condensation is a bit of a problem but other than that this light bar has performed admirably. Mounted on a Suzuki samurai wheeler.
B005G58DKI|5|strong battery, works great!
B00HHYHQRW|1|Tried it on two cars and it didn't work. Then I went to test it by going around the block and it fell off and someone stole it. There gonna wanna give it back because it doesn't work. And if you took it I want to send it back and get my money back
B000O3IGI6|5|Works great. It got all of the air out of my intercooler system in my CTS V.
B000FQBWCY|5|Use this product every day. Flawless.
B0083B2IEY|5|Fit perfect
B003BZD03K|5|This really takes the strain off my filter and hose.  I am loving it.
B004VGAJOG|3|they seem cheap compared ton the original but holding up so far
B000HBGGQ4|5|It's a great product, I've been using it for years, cleans my hands great without excessive drying. I'm a truck driver and I keep it in my cab all the time
B000CRO4IK|5|Slots for 4 coin sizes not just 3. Easy to slide the coins out after there are a few in the stack... the last few are difficult to remove, so keep it loaded.
B00CXMPR2E|5|I love it! It looks great on my car. It was a little difficult to apply because of the thin lines, but just do it slowly and carefully and you should be fine. It's rained a lot and I've washed my car a few times and it hasn't affected it at all. Great deal and so cute!
B00NXFZ1FI|5|Perfect! A great way to personalize your MINI. I've have a few people ask about it, which I reply &#34;it represents that MINI runs through my veins&#34;. Easy to install with an overall durable feel. This is not one of those cheap stickers. This should last you a very long time. Motor On!
B00WJ06UTE|5|Love the quality of this product. Just the added touch needed for my RX350.
B00BSB1H7U|5|No complaints, item arrived as expected, fast shipping. Thanks!
B0063CTDPW|5|After the first set was delivered broken, Amazon re-shipped another set to me, and I received them the very next day! I installed them on my vehicle, which took about 20-30 minutes total, and I could not be happier! They are made very durable, not thin like others. In my opinion, they look better than the official Kia brand ones. I LOVE these! They are very functional, and look super slick to boot! Thanks Amazon!
B00CWKT4RG|4|Works very well but not good in tight spaces
B0002U26QE|3|Mediocre product. Good for the casual user.
B00CZCSOP4|1|Was not the right item not even close I was able to use one c clip and the rest was useless
B004RCWXW0|1|Took me about 30 days before I used this samlex SAM-250 It blew the fuse immediatly (polarity was confirmed correct)put a new fuse in and it flashed input voltage error and it never has worked (tested other power sources) this is a garbage unit and i threw my money away when i ordered it dont do the same, skip this one!<br />signed<br />A verry experienced inverter user
B001EOV3HK|5|easiest receiver i ever put on
B007BE4W5C|4|Perfect fit but thought it was darker. Way better than factory
B00WO8E8I6|4|I got these and they work just fine.  Installation is a pain but there are some good YouTube videos out there.<br />Make sure to check the connector tabs.  I installed the first time and didn't work because the leads were bent out of position.
B009B41D6Q|5|Purchased to replace my OEM style control arms in an '08 Cobalt.  The GM design of these control arms is terrible.  In the 60k miles that i have put on the car i have had to replace the rear bushing three times.  It has been ~25k miles since I changed to the Moog spherical design and so far they seem to be working well.  The package comes with all the parts needed to drop out and replace the whole control arm (1x knuckle bolt and 2x front mounting bolts, and new grease fittings).  Note that these do have grease fittings in the ball joint (unlike the originals) so make sure you have a grease gun and grease prior to installing them.<br /><br />(This review has been written and submitted on both CK620301 and CK620302 control arms as they are the matching set)
B000F5ECUY|5|Had used one before I purchased this one.  Good tool.
B008BTM12W|5|It's a little lighter than my old battery but has more cranking amps.  Nice battery!
B000GZNENY|5|CoverMax half cover XLG, (107523) arrived in three days. Silver. Underside black with taped seams. The silver reflects heat. It can be turned inside out for stealth mode. “CoverMax” printed on front, and tags sewn into rear for orientation. Fits a 1999 KLR 650 with tall windshield and rear top case. Generous fit covers front fender and rear fender. Elastic around entire bottom edge with a strap on each side to hook a foot peg. Included carry bag has tie down straps and is roughly 4” X 4” X 10”. Cover helps passers-by keep walking. Out of sight, out of mind. Compact and light. $25. Likely urethane coated fabric. Just Right.
B005DOQYNU|5|I installed the kit on a 2006 Toyota 4Runner.  Everything was easily installed and looks great.  Shipping was quick with good communications from the company.  Will buy more for other vehicles.
B0064R6DJA|5|Took forever to get here but looked nice when it did.
B000BGHVSM|5|good product. saves lugging around 4x4's
B00LLJHY9E|5|The way things are going, I'm extremely proud to display this. Every little bit helps, if you're a Christian I urge you to do this.  Awesome quality, vivid colors, just lovely on my car. Exceeded my expectations.
B00KQH1DL2|1|if you want cheap plastic lights THIS IS FOR YOU !
B001AMC9OM|1|didn't even last a year, i popped one just now the rubber cracked it was stretching too much it seems
B00U590RYA|5|Good
B001EOV492|5|An excellent addition to the Curt 13707
B00BBJM8GI|5|It work just like stated and was easy to put up. Love it
B004L2F6VG|5|perfect easy to install, works great
B00BCRMBGQ|1|I absolutely HATE this set! Super cheap material and they are not like regular seat covers so install is different. The instructions included tell you how to install regular over the back covers NOT the ones included in set. So they are still sitting in my garage because I can't figure out how to install them.
B00GKZUSII|5|Great help....
B000C55VXY|5|great quality and price!
B004W7KS2C|5|Product fit perfectly on 2013 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. Installed myself with proper tools.  Bought Curt bike rack with it. Highly recommend both products. Made in the USA!
B000E35UV2|5|WORKS JUST LIKE INTENDED
B0080DK93C|4|Replaced old module with this one. My Buick was parked for two years due to a intermittent ignition problem. Since fuel was not being burned in two cylinders, it ended up in the oil pan. 4 quarts of oil plus 4 quarts of gasoline is never a good thing. The location of the module made swapping out parts challenging, but now I can spin the wheels again. I've had this car for almost 25 years. I don't know how much longer this car will live, but now, maybe a little longer.
B00PX6DZNK|1|Their is no head rest holes so you need to make your own to put the headrest back on. The material for the headrest is way too big with just a couple of strings to hold it on. There is no way to tighten it it up and it looks cheep ridicules. I ended up not use the cover for the headrest. They were a present so couldn't return them. I am sure they will fall apart rather soon since the are really thin and cheaply made. Then I can go buy some that I like. Put them in a SUV.
B000EQP9JC|5|Met my expectations. Excellent
B00J0ABS5M|5|Great product and great price. Fits my 2015 Toyota Tacoma
B003IS3HV0|5|Used this on 1991 300zx seats. Beautiful results !
B008XKDG7I|5|worked just fine
B00O99NP46|1|cheap thin small towel. overpriced.
B00OXWZ60A|5|Excelent !!!
B004ZF4MW8|5|This item is very easy to install
B00KQ02M32|5|fit perfectly
B004EFQP2Y|5|Keepsake
B006L998TI|5|Excellent sticker. And, as you guess it right, the number of people on welfare still increasing.
B0017OZZT4|4|Cute set!! Plate cover seem a little flimsy but that was expected since they are plastic! Seat covers were a little difficult to install but once we got one in the other was easier. My daughter loves this set for her car.
B00N2K6M2A|4|Works with Samsung Tab 4, and on a 2001 3.5L Pathfinder.
B004C6OBBC|5|Perfect
B007M4D3RO|5|Good quality and fit
B00M2URZIG|5|Im a master tech and this works perfect. Good price
B00384SKC0|5|Most simply put this stuff works as well as plexus at less than half the price.  Both my motorcycles will carry it now.  It works effectively on motorcycle windshield s and helmet shields aswell
B00R6J45RC|5|Mounted to my AEV bumper, right behind my license plate bracket... no one will ever see it under normal conditions but I know it's there ready and waiting. Makes for a really cool surprise as people expect a regular hook when I remove my license plate. Quality is outstanding.
B003RAEC6I|5|I thought it wasn't gonna work... just read one of the reviews and the instructions are there...
B003SBDA3C|1|It was broken on arrival had to send it back
B0001CLG2S|4|not to much to go wrong here
B004RCQT98|5|Very good
B00DIHRT5Q|5|Exactly as described and well built.
B00I13GOIA|3|Pump worked well until one month after the warranty expired.  The bearings went out.  Also, the fuel strainer in the package did not fit the pump.  I had to use my original fuel strainer from my old pump.  I guess if you are looking for a inexpensive replacement pump to last a year, buy it.
B00OQTF5FG|5|Fit perfectly on my bike. The fit and finish is great. I  am very happy.
B00VX8Q7BO|5|Got here fast and fit perfect.
B00E6YS61G|3|This &#34;sticker&#34; is not what I thought I was ordering.  It would look good if it wasn't for the minor scratch on it, which is extremely noticeable. I'm very disappointed but it did come sooner than I expected, which is why I didn't rate it as a 2. Definitely not going on my car, I'll probably find something else for it
B00J00X5YO|5|It has improved my miles per gallon by 2 mpg.
B000VUC426|5|This replaced the old one PERFECTLY and the new gasket sealed it water tight!!!
B00092893E|5|MUST BUY !!!!!!!!!!!
B00NH63Y6Q|3|I put these in DRL bulbs in my 2003 Maxima and they barely fit and are pretty dull overall.
B000VTZON8|5|Easy installation
B00IVPA4E8|4|Good gloves for the cost.
B004EC5CP8|1|Quality of this cover is not what what it used to be.  Fabric begins shred like tissue in about two years.
B002RMLBC0|5|I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package with these springbar bending pliers. The are very professionally made and move smoothly with no play. One side of the die is grooved to keep the spring bar aligned while bending. It works great.
B00JIEX722|5|bright white light,  throws good light compared to stock. makes a triangle light pattern on my tailgate above my plates looks really cool would buy again. fit 05 tundra perfectly
B000KPU8MK|5|This is the best diagnostic tool you can have in your tool box. The built in circuit breaker is a great feature. Its helped me on many wiring issues. The ability to send a 12v power charge to the problem area allows you to find the electrical problem very quickly. Amazon had the best pricing too
B004YWPKVO|5|Very good lights, excellent color, good product.
B00SI4KBBS|5|Fantastic tube.
B00QQYX11Y|4|Heavy duty
B00T74RCWY|5|I used this to replace the pump in my 2009 YFZ450R and it works perfect.  Flow rate and PSI is the same and $20 is much better than $300+ the dealer will only sell the whole unit.
B009LQKIP6|5|Great crossbars that were easily installed after figuring out how the &#34;key screw&#34; on the rails worked.  These don't add any noticeable noise when driving even at brisk highway speeds.  Had zero issue attaching a Yakima Sky Box and getting things tightened down so that there was no wiggle room (the rails have a grippy texture that aids in attaching stuff and not having it move on you).<br /><br />These came in at about 1/2 the price of high end &#34;aero&#34; bars from either Yakima or Thule and work great on my MDX.... so I definitely recommend them!
B00F2ZH9UW|5|Works with my small engine no problem!
B00GBW89M2|5|Great!
B00032KC3K|2|Looks good but poor quality control. The caps fit way to lose. I had to use silicon glue to hold them on.
B00DDIW22K|5|Nice product
B00FMOJZHS|2|well first it didn't fit, tried to use it on my land cruiser fj40 not enough room in front of the windshield
B00GHT6SF4|5|Looks identical, except hinge plastic is 2-3 times thicker. I wish GM would offer a &#34;Dorman Edition&#34; where the vehicle was offered with properly built components. I previously installed a Dorman steering shaft which got rid of the &#34;Clunk&#34; that came from the factory new, which GM said was fine. Thanks for exceeding my expectations!, Doug
B0009H519Y|5|Awesome price.<br />You get quite a lot of it, and it does not seem to take a lot to polish things.<br /><br />I polished an old quarter to a mirror finish in like 3 minutes with a dremel tool.<br /><br />Astounding results.
B005FO1WJY|1|Mirror is loosely placed in the frame so it rotates every time you have a car wash.
B00E5O7HDU|3|Love it but the jag covers a bit of the plate digits so I don't know if I could get hassled by the po-po
B000N9VF6Q|4|Right tank, good price,fast shipping, hope I don't need it
B00SM8R04Q|5|Works!
B00F3J2FW4|2|The description said this would fit a 2 door jeep but they are clearly for the 4 door. The holes for the fasteners don't line up well.  The mats are however durable and well made,  just not a great fit for the 2 door.
B0085XH58O|2|The base plate does not stay in the grommet holes. Needed to add a bit of silicon to hold them.
B000NVW1LM|4|I have an older 2001 Mercedes ML430. Both the engine and power steering was sweating oil over time, but stopped the leak on both systems. Will not miss that semi-gummy disgusting sludge buildup on the engine, spraying all over from the belt and pulleys.<br />Tried it on a different car (just never know) with oil dripping and pooling every time it was driven (left a trail even on the street too), but predictably it did not stop that leak.<br />Still, good job ATP, works as advertised!
B00N5UBQHS|5|I purchased this to maintain a WPS Featherweight Lithium battery that I recently installed in my motorcycle.  I have never been disappointed with a Battery Tender product.  I have not had this for long, but I am sure it will live up to my expectations.  I did a bunch of research before I bought into the Lithium Ion Polymer technology.  I was on the fence as far as whether or not to get a special charger.  Basically, I learned that a regular battery charger, and/or your bikes charging system will never fully charge the lithium battery to 100% of its capacity.  This lithium specific charger will not only top off the charge to 100%, but if it the charge gets dangerously low (Lithium batteries can be damaged by discharging too much), this charger may be able to save the battery from permanent damage.
B00SVE0R0A|5|I hooked up the Shklxmt485 Premium 3&#34; Aluminum Bullet Shape Waterproof speakers (also sold under the name Lexin) with internal amplifier in each speaker yesterday to try the system out. They come in 2 sizes of handlebar clamps, so make sure you order the clamp size to fit your bike. It worked as advertised. I used an iPod Nano for my input via 3.5 mm connection, and my wife and daughter came out and made me turn it down. That means it is pretty loud and clear. 3 inch speakers will not put out much bass, it is not rocket science if you know music and speakers, but these are pretty heavy and sound good. Bose does not make motorcycle speakers, so you will have to do with what is on the market. After testing and knowing it worked and I liked it, I began installation. I put my windshield on just to check clearance and speaker placement and loosely kept the speakers in position. I wanted them placed behind the windshield for better volume when I use the shield. Running the main wire from the battery, under the tank, to your point of choosing, is the hardest part. it is all downhill from there. I used a little dielectric grease on the USB input, USB charger (1 connector for both), 3.5mm input, and 2nd speaker connections. Just ensure your main wire does not touch the hot engine, and don't blow your speakers by trying to play music beyond the capabilities of the speaker and you will be fine. With a 3.5mm input for my iPod, MP3 player or iPhone I probably won't utilize Bluetooth since the sound is degraded a bit using this connection. All in all, it has a great assortment of connections to play music with plenty of sound and listen to GPS commands, while not cluttering your bike with an amplifier which my motorcycle has no room for, especially a non-waterproof one. If it has a downside it would be there is no control for treble to control the tone. Some songs sound tin.
B007CMQZFI|4|Fits perfect on 09 fz6. Looks same as factory. More comfortable then stock but i think they could have used more gel in the seat but maybe thats just my oersonal preferance
B00W6IYO3S|1|They would not stay on...
B009DJ37ZE|5|fit right, good price and was shipped fast.
B008XB9BJY|5|They fit where the existing incandescent bulbs are in our RV and work well.  Good light, good color, use much less power and should last long.
B000C9JRBW|2|Not well made in China.  Did not meet the existing product parts.
B00GT0CJPY|4|Installation was easy. The trick is to have the light panels ( yellow tab looking things) pointed in the correct direction for the best light. All went easily with the exception of the license plate. The lights for the license plate are square shaped going into a smaller round hole. I am liking these a lot.
B000WJA78O|5|Does what it's designed to do.
B007638HZE|5|We use these in our RV.  The light is a bit yellow but then again it saves our battery so I love them!
B00196FDOW|3|I bought this from Amazon in 10/2012.  It lasted just under 3 years.  When I opened it up, I found that water had gotten into the wiring leading through the epoxy block and corroded out the copper wire.  Normally this would get a 1 or no star, but I guess 3 years gets a star for each good year it did work.<br /><br />The terminals and nuts rust really easily - low quality ferrous metal.  After connecting up, spray with something for corrosion control.
B0066RZH0Y|5|Purchased this to go on a 1996 329i with 206,000 miles. Direct fit with no issues. Was Prime-eligible, and actually arrived the next day.
B002MQCYO0|5|Excellent
B000MX2ORM|5|Great battery and great price. Fast delivery as usual.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Far better than the ones that came with the new trailer!
B0009IQXFO|5|Wont remove wax and a little goes a long way.  This is the only soap I use on my black car and it shines like a mirror!
B00AWNVR8Y|5|Fitted perfect
B0077QKSSO|5|Perfect fit
B00WXBYYR4|5|Quick ship.  Does not contain sealant or dye.  Great, clean R134a.
B004NTOCQM|5|Pump came with everything included. Instal was super easy and took me less then an hour. Great throttle response difference. Great product. Hope this one lasts me a long time.
B00QMXB6UC|5|Item was as described. Fast shipping.
B001KS2PXQ|5|Its a wiper blade and it fits perfectly.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very happy with the sunshade. Installs easily and fits my S10 pickup very well
B000WJF4HS|5|These work very well for an universal kit.
B000EQS1E2|5|I ordered this product for my Aunt.  It fit perfectly and her truck window is now operable.
B0055AW0N0|4|I spend a lot of time on the car and its nice to have a bit of organized space vs. filling up  the passenger seat
B009K4H42Y|5|Just as described, ie Honda !
B000C0YNPG|5|Fantastic product - matched the old original hose perfectly.
B00VWSCRNM|3|Smaller than expected but it is higher quality than expected. It comes in two different pieces and i had a hard time getting the bottom piece to stay on . I ended up just taking it off
B004ZF4MW8|5|Great light best out there did my headlight going do the fog next wanted to see how it look 1st 2015 Altima
B005G9CN3C|5|Has these lights for just about a year now and they are still working strong.  They make my truck nice n bright.  When and if they go any time soon, i will buy the same from this seller!!
B00BFI5SE4|1|ran one all last summer, ran ok, unit died this spring, the new unit was dead out of the box. trash.
B0002KR88A|2|There is NO FUSE, it is just a holder. That seems like cheating to me.
B00Q8FUAO2|2|Very cheap rubber parts, collapsed  when temperature got hot
B0012TT8OM|5|So far so good! Got it in and filled with no problem
B000EFOZMK|2|the product came in a timely manner. When I started to put the wheel covers on , one of them split in half so now I have 3 wheel covers for 4 wheels. I can't .order just one and I'm not going to reordering 4 more. Now I'm wondering when will the other 3 split if I try to use them.
B000P17NXQ|5|Quick delivery. It was very easy to mount and hook up with the Tekonsha wiring harness, just plug it in and ready to go. Very simple directions. Real easy to adjust setting.
B007Y87ZE0|5|Came quicker than it said and was in my car and working the next day.
B000BQQWR8|5|Good brush and scrape. You may need to have a sharper scraper as well.<br />Next time I would probably buy it with a longer handle.
B00LTKNWJ6|3|The angle mechanism is plastic and I expect the little notches to wear out pretty fast.
B00TPKKS3A|4|It came in good shape and it works perfectly
B004B61B34|5|Very easy instructions, had this installed in less than an hour. Good buy!
B002WPXXPU|5|What I was looking for
B005V9NSE0|3|Didn't fit my truck.
B004G7XCYO|5|Perfect, awesome, fast shipping definitely will do business with again...
B001LHVOVK|5|This does the job. Tells you the codes (not their meanings, which you look up on line), then lets you erase then and turn off the CEL (check engine light), at least on the cars that I own. Price is very reasonable.  The cord is long enough to use from time to time, but I added an extension to keep the scanner plugged in without preventing safe driving.
B0012PR59G|5|Works just as it should
B00JDQ3I8S|5|Awesome product!
B00G9C5Y2C|5|An overall great badge! This thing is seriously thick and sturdy with a very strong magnet. I'm not worried about this badge falling off. Plus the saying is perfect! What better way to describe how our MINIs handle and feel. I also bought the Double Grill Badge Holder by the same seller and it looks great on my MINI.
B000C57VB4|5|excellent stuff!
B007Q13M2Y|5|Perfect fit!  No complaints.
B00ZBHS0NG|5|Wonderful gift for my husband...
B00ECW2T38|5|Great addition to the rear hitch.  Lots of compliments from friends.  Gives you a place to stand when you are trailering or launching your boat.
B00757KJTI|5|Great product!
B005Q0ERS0|5|looks nice with my new chevy truck
B0000AY2Z6|5|Expensive, but worth it
B00RW58Y3Q|5|looks great on my street glide.
B001LQHUBE|4|Received as expected.  Easy installation
B00J36JWWE|4|matches my color of my car. I'm thinking to order another one. thanks
B004OHHXL4|5|nice item
B00IQVZ96K|5|They were exactly what I needed and had them on in less than 10 minutes.
B00U5OMBJ4|5|Outstanding led bar! The spot and flood are definitive. This is bright, fully satisfied with the 13k lumens!
B008FCCS6E|5|It makes my vehicle look super and was very easy to attach.
B007Y85G5K|3|Work great fixes perfect
B0057NSBJW|5|On my truck now works perfect and fit great, truck don't go faster but sounds like it does.
B00V3RULYO|2|way to much play in the cable, wouldnt suggest buying if you have a yz
B000GUWR96|5|Not my first EV13. Great cam for a heavier bike with plenty of grunt throughout. Power is right where I ride in the rpm range (2500-4500) most of the time.
B00NPIRAUC|5|Really a great product very easy to install and I recommend this product
B009F4RI2K|5|Easy install and fit.
B0002U1TYY|3|Mediocre product. Good for the casual user.
B000F5JMEA|5|OTC makes professional quality tools and this is one. It is designed for a range of applications and it is sturdy.
B0076PXV4Y|5|Fits nicely, just as expected.
B00XP0Q7VI|1|Map sensor failed within a week
B0040CZ0TU|4|Just connector pins
B00RCHF1RQ|5|Works well, my turbo spools in a little earlier than before which is great. I'm not sure if it was the air filter I replaces of the oil, probably both. But would buy again.
B009IMW0VI|5|This is an  excellent tank. It was well packaged and delivered quickly.  It is certified for gasoline or diesel.  It has a vent and comes with a filler cap.
B00BDEP9S0|5|Just what I needed - works great - fast shipping
B00R8D5IHM|5|These mats fit great in my 2011 Mazda 2 sport. They were easy to cut to fit where needed and feel pretty sturdy. They're quite flexible and not as rigid as other rubber mats, but I like it because it's more easy to place. I drove my car briefly and they didn't move around. I think for the price these are great.
B005M1ZBH4|4|I've been a mechanic for 4 years now and for the money this is the way to go it may not be perfect and you may have to use zip ties or a foam strip to make the devider stationary but it works good and is fairly easy to install and will not throw error codes.
B003POL5PM|4|Just ok
B00GJMRZTW|5|Very comfortable and well made.
B004AFC9C8|5|Very good, worked as expected, no issues
B00LOX4SNM|5|looks great on the jeep
B00AIJY2ZM|5|very bright. unfortunately did not work on my vehicle because of the canbus in my vehicle
B000E2CVW4|4|Installed on 2014 CRF250L. Fit and worked as expect, no complaints.
B00NIDNV5C|1|I hooked them up today an turned my lights on an had nothing I un plugged them. plugged them back in an still nothing. I thought maybe my fuse blew so I put my stock bulb back in to see an it came right on buy the balaces don't work.
B001RZ65MO|5|Best thing I did for my car
B0049IT2NA|4|I had to purchase these to replace the original ones whereon the plating pitted & corroded terribly. So, let's hope these replacements do better.
B000BQWLE6|4|its compact and easy to take even if your not camping you can use it as an extra trash bin at parties.  Even if your buddy needs more trash bins at his place you can take it hthere.  its great
B000C5FL84|5|It worked as promised. I would definitely purchase from them again.
B00AAXKQME|5|just like new and good price
B00D2DG7T0|5|just as listed, fast shipper
B002N5W8Q4|5|This refrig fan for our Rv does its job. The batteries are a little tight to put in. This fan when placed at the bottom helps circulate the cool air around the food, bottom of frig holds at 40* just right. If you Rv frig doesn't cool like you want try this product.
B00EI6CKVE|5|Was easy to put on. I live up int the north so it takes a beating in the winter but has yet to peal at all.
B009YYVSZO|4|Excelent
B00E0LI09S|5|I used four of these for rock lights under my F350 on 42's and they are great for under the truck. I ran a relay to power these, not that you need it, but because I wanted to have an extra security measure in place because I frequently submerge my truck in 4 feet of water.
B008HZH6FW|5|Best Ever
B002XYT2HI|5|A quick and easy fix to the recurring and random ABS light on my 2005 Terraza.  Even came with weather resistant crimp connectors (the kind you put on and then heat so that they shrink wrap).<br /><br />Seems sturdy with quality wire.  The rest of my lemon from Buick will likely fall apart around it.
B0060EI84U|5|Quality
B00429NKWK|5|Absolutely amazing results. Well worth the cost, time and effort!
B006ISVBRO|5|This fit in the socket for our oven-hood light, worked well and the light from it is good.  It'll use much less power, run way cooler, and should last a long time.
B000H6G4VQ|5|It's frustrating to buy a tool that I may only use a couple times in my life... but this tool made the job soooo easy.  The handle of this tool is plenty tough, so you don't need to worry about bending it when you push hard to squeeze the o-ring in the fuel tank.
B0067UE4K4|4|worked good
B008CLIUGU|5|This starter seems to work as well as new. Only problem is finding a way to get the old one out and then this one in. I think I'll trade the truck if the starter goes out again. 99 Tacoma TRD
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Used this item a few times...works with out any issues. Fit and finish of product is great and the case can't be beat. Test of time will be the determining factor but it deserves 5 stars right now.
B002VEERA2|5|Works so far
B00C53LVLC|1|Didn't work on my car
B00CJ5E1GS|5|Works great, so much easier to traditional bleeding 😊👍
B00KLIWMCU|4|Once you get the hang of collapsing this, it works like a dream.
B00EVPLS0G|5|The otc came in today. Popped a tube of grease in it and attached the hose. Greased my disc and tractor in half the time . Worked great straight out of the box. Very pleased so far.
B009U0AHJU|5|Much cheaper than the dealer....a great item to have spares of too
B00NOA1STA|5|Fits my 2005 Ford Expedition very well, and seems to be of good quality compared to previous sun shades I have owned.  It is very thick, not thin or flimsy at all.  We'll see how it holds up to Texas summers...
B00LISZPVW|3|Expected a bit more for a Honda product, but it is okay.
B00BXLEI2G|5|I wouldn't classify these as &#34;incredibly light,&#34; but they are easy to move around, and because they're aluminum, not steel, the ramp won't rust.  That's a big plus!!<br /><br />I use these for my full-size goats to climb into a transport carrier on my full size pickup.  The openings in the ramp are probably slightly less than an inch, but to build goat-confidence I put duct tape over the ramp surface to give it a smooth surface.<br /><br />If you have a full size pickup, you will probably need one this length (7' 6&#34;), not one of the shorter ones on the market.<br /><br />This is one of those lifetime purchases (buy one and you'll never need another one), so make sure the one you choose is going to work for you!
B009K9ITY6|5|Wigwags just fine
B000GOHUTY|4|I replaced the old one, it was easy with the Chiltons book.
B00NJXSOW6|5|Delivered on time.  Went on the car with only a little effort.  Great conversation starter. I like it.
B003ZWE82G|4|I replaced the old one, easy to do.
B00KQ7WDZW|5|Great and sturdy bins for storing clothes in our trailer Cabinet!
B00NGQTUQA|5|Awesome! Works better than I expected.
B000EBKG5E|4|It works great for what I need and it's cheap!
B004A6PLZ4|5|Works just like a stock in-cabin air filter for my 2008 Nissan Versa SL Hatchback. I'm not sure if the coconut actually does anything that a stock filter doesn't, but I noticed an immediate difference in the air smell in the car after putting this one in.
B00A9OCZVY|2|I put on a 2002 Z71 Tahoe only 2 bolts would line up.when received it it had a dent in it. Because it was a birthday gift I made it work
B00AAQRW1E|5|Was thinking they were going to be some cheap dim light but no these lights are awesome would buy them again
B00CUAWJ6G|5|Perfect for the job.
B0099M2RYC|5|This works very well in our holding tanks, we will use this one to refill our small one we previously purchased.
B008CE06ZA|5|Great Product. Heavy Duty and well made. Coating is really thick. I put a trimax 3 inch lock into one of the pin holes so that it count not be stolen.
B00B2AESCS|5|These work perfect with my stock control arms and 4.5&#34; lift. The ride is smooth and the articulation is comparable to more expensive long arm kits!  Great bargain on these and I would recommend them!
B003RF8VEC|5|I bought this for the Lake Superior Circle trip this summer. It was amazing! 1600 miles and my tush was never sore at the end of each day
B000OUUG8M|5|great product to prevent rust in damp conditions
B00SVCHL42|5|Sticker arrived quickly, and looks great.
B000ARPVOI|4|cheapest I've seen in a while l, beats Walmarts price by $.98<br /><br />I've been using this product for years in a wrx as well as a Silverado with the 5.3 in it
B000IG3JJA|2|it did not fit.
B0038B4AQI|2|The name of the product is deceiving it says with Amber reflector but it doesn't have the Amber reflector in the middle just a chrome housingi f I knew that I wouldn't have bought them
B0044AVLF0|5|Always go with the factory oem oil filters and avoid 3rd party brands.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Installed the FP3 on a 2014 Street Glide with screaming eagle slip ons and newly added Vance and Hines intake.  Multiple dealers had recommended against the FP3 saying that the bike would not run correctly.  They were wrong.  The bike runs smoothly, has no more decel pop, and runs noticeably cooler.  I'm not planning to try autotune at this point but may in the future.  I highly recommend this upgrade.<br /><br />Looking to run the FP3 before adding intake?  I asked V&H about this and they said to select the appropriate exhaust and that the bike would compensate for intake on its own.  If you add intake later, they suggested a flashing it again.
B000GU24HG|3|very simple plastic, attach to my bike like a hug and maybe didn't''t had the enough air flow to make the bike brief
B00HVU5AL6|1|I did love these, but after two weeks I only have 2 wheel covers!!! I have purchased ones from Wal-mart that never fell off. So disappointed.
B007RW3KJM|5|Fits perfectly. Works great! At less than half the cost of buying from the oil change shops.
B00700E8QA|1|All crumpled up when I got it.
B00269504E|5|Made my mustang almost look new. Great buy and price was nice. Not exact quality of OEM but they work and look like they were bought from factory.  Check out pictures of the difference between the old one and new one.
B00JP1R9MW|5|Works great.
B0040D2QVE|1|Terrible!  These &#34;look correct&#34; but they are too short to function as originally designed. Waste of my cash
B00MVHCEY0|5|Saved $200+ easy to install and work great. BMW quoted $225 for parts and installation.
B00BWOWS26|5|Came well packaged with the wires marked plus and minus. I removed the worthless amber reflectors from the front of my mirrors. I do not have puddle lights, there are removable round plastic covers on the bottom of my mirrors instead. There are factory LED turn signal indicators on the left and right mirrors facing the pass. and driver. I removed the puddle light hole covers and removed the existing electrical plugs at the back of existing T S indicators. Green is Hot with black neg. I installed the AnzoUSA 861114 in place of the amber reflectors by first fishing the wires in one of the slots and out the puddle light hole. I wired the new wires into the existing plug on the amber lights facing driver/passenger and reinstalled plug. I reinstalled the plastic puddle light hole covers after pushing the remaining wire into the mirror housing. By working through the puddle light hole I did not have to remove the mirror glass, if you have large hands/fingers you may have to remove the mirror glass to wire to existing electrical connections.They work and look great compared to the ugly amber reflectors they replaced.
B00F3J2FW4|5|Nice Fit
B00EFXC8MQ|5|excelent
B00029KA4U|5|worked perfectly
B00NESAE92|5|I ordered these on July 27th 2015 because i had lost my original one. It said they would arrive between August 3rd and the 6th. I checked my mail today, August 1st and they were here! I had already received the email on how to sync them with my vehicle so after i checked my mail i opened the email and proceded to do just that. Within 2 minutes i had both remotes synced with my car. They even sent an extra set of batteries for each remote. I am very happy with how quickly they arrived, how well the directions were written and the product itself. Thank You!
B000QGZXCS|5|This has always been a great product, but the service from this seller is amazing A+++++++++++++
B004S7HM52|4|****2014 Subaru STi Sedan****<br /><br />---- Packaging: 9/10 ----<br /><br />Pretty much what you would expect - cardboard box containing everything you need. The only minor issue is that the brackets are kind of haphazardly thrown into bubble wrap and one came slightly bent.<br /><br />---- Instructions: 4/10 ----<br /><br />This is where I felt the product truly came up short. The instructions are pretty poorly written. Not translated poorly, or anything like that, just poorly written. In addition, if you follow the steps in the order given, it makes life difficult for you. The provided pictures/illustrations aren't much help either; they're very low-res and in B&W. It's even hard to tell what orientation the pictures were taken in.<br /><br />In fact, if you watch one of the numerous videos demonstrating the installation, and then read the instructions, you'll likely be confused. In the end, you're better off watching the video(s) and throwing the instructions in the garbage.<br /><br />For a nearly $200 set of mud flaps, I think they could have done a lot better here.<br /><br />---- Installation: 7/10 ----<br /><br />I'm a pretty mechanically inclined person, and I had installed factory mud flaps on my FRS, so I did have some knowledge going in. Installation was pretty straightforward and easy enough. I HIGHLY recommend removing the wheel as it makes things MUCH easier.<br /><br />The video on their site tells you to bend the brackets after installing them. I can see why - the flaps come in towards the tire on the rear unless you bend them outwards. What puzzles me is, why do the brackets not fit correctly to start with? Pretty lame if you ask me.<br /><br />---- Fit/Finish: 8/10 ----<br /><br />Overall, these fit really well and look like they belong on the car. There are, however, some minor annoyances. First of all, the inner-most portion of the flaps are held on by a self-tapping screw that is WAY too long. Honestly, it looks like I lost the right screws and used what I had laying around. Not very impressed with this at all.<br /><br />Second, the hardware included is all stainless steel which is nice. However, I would have really liked to have something that blends in with the fender liner. It has a very industrial look which is kind-of OK, but really, I'd prefer not to have silver nuts and bolts sticking out of my fenders.<br /><br />Third, there's a small gap between the top of the flaps and the side skirts on the front. In the instructions they tell you that it is designed this way to allow best tire clearance. I really don't see how this small gap would make any difference. Perhaps someone can enlighten me?<br /><br />Lastly, another annoyance, albeit minor, is that the edges of the flaps are not smoothed. It has a a jagged and unfinished look; it looks like they just punched them out, threw them in the box, and called it a day. How much time would it take to properly finish the product?<br /><br />---- Appearance: 10/10 ----<br /><br />When everything is all said and done, they do look really good. It adds a rally look to the car which is what I was after.<br /><br />---- Function: To Be Decided ----<br /><br />I've had these on the car less than a day, but I imagine they'll perform as expected. The sides of the flaps extend quite far beyond the body of the car, so there's lots of protection there. One thing that I can see being a problem is the gap in the front flaps I mentioned earlier on.
B00QJB7SCC|3|Front fits perfect, back seat not so much !
B00QJWUPC6|5|Very good lights. Nice and bright.
B000CD5LXQ|5|Loved it
B005R4MKFM|5|works good and looks sporty. Added led bulbs and lights are bright, makes car look like a newer model.
B00GMNUGBC|5|Loved it!
B000FPYW4K|5|Works great!  Used it on a Subaru Impreza 2.5i (EJ253) engine to remove the camshaft and crankshaft seals.
B001GJ3EJS|5|Perfect for the little slots in my fancy alloy wheels. And for dusting the dash, vents, etc.  Stiff enough to work yet soft enough to not scratch.
B00NY9S95W|3|Almost impossible to affix, probably won't last.
B000CGUI9U|5|did the job, awesome product. I recommend these to anyone.
B00YE5Q0Q0|5|For a woman like me it is very reassuring to know I have a portable car jump starter if I were to ever be stranded somewhere. I will be keeping this in my trunk just in case, because you never know when it might come in handy!<br /><br />This portable device is also helpful in more than one way, having the ability to charge my device (phone, Ipod, so on..) using the power bank. Not to mention the bright emergency light, a great way to attract attention and signal that help/assistance is needed.<br /><br />Easy to understand the instructions, and lightweight so I can handle any problem without needing to call someone to help me out. I found it easy to set up and I had no help from any one!<br /><br />Finally found something to calm my nerves about driving alone - I feel less stressed knowing I can handle being stranded by simply using my durable 16500mAh multi purpose life saver! Sample provided for evaluation and review.
B00KN0UOEE|5|As always, 303 is one of the finest products for interior dressing.
B00BI3GNP4|5|It was a perfect  match got here on time
B004RHZJ80|5|Works!
B00IN4EY6G|5|Great product!
B00IMVK08G|1|Smaller than expected, not tinted dark enough either
B0048J01RG|5|Worked great and super easy to install. HOLY SMOKES this window opens and closes so much faster than the old one did.
B000WG952Q|3|The pump draws too much current to use with any of our vehicles' power sockets. The amps to start the compressor motor is probably greater than the typical 10-15 amp rating of most cars. I got a battery hook up so I could go straight to the batter. With that, I really liked the pump until it stopped turning about 1.5 years after I got it.<br /><br />As solid at the pump appears to be constructed, I was surprised that it died.<br /><br />So, -1 star for not being able to use it with a car's power socket. -1 star for not lasting several years.
B0076PXVKS|5|Fits nicely, just as expected.
B007XE8C74|4|I have to say this is a handy dandy tool. I had a drive pattern I needed to pass my CAT monitor to be &#34;Ready&#34;. B4 buying this and not knowing about the drive pattern, I drove the car over and over bringing it back to the shop and getting them to plug their machine to tell me it wasn't ready and to drive some more. Did my own TS B4 figuring things out and the tool saved me time from having to bring it to someone else machine. Good tool to have especially in CA for their stupid smog tests.
B004AIKVPC|5|Worked out fine thankyou
B0002JMLW4|4|Does a good job.
B000JZDBE8|4|Works great and is much better quality than Duralast. Went through two Duralast cylinders before getting this OEM cylinder.
B00BTGSID0|5|Nery nice.  Quality. I'm pretty picky about cars and use these all the time.
B00G7HPKQE|5|Awesome jacket
B004A9EW24|2|Very poor quality product!
B00WVJR0D8|5|1999 KLR 650 had a 100 watt halogen bulb. Better than stock, but lacking. OPT7 H-4 Motorcycle LED Headlight Kit w/ Arc-Glass fit like any other bulb, just longer. The rubber boot would not go back on. Cut a 1.5” hole in rear of boot. Cooling fins protrude half way out. They say a little moisture is not a problem. Simple install. Product picture shows 2 LEDs on side of bulb. The other side is ditto. Light shines out of both sides. Two LEDs for low beam, all four LEDs for high. Very much good. Not over-kill. Doesn’t bother other drivers.
B00K763NNS|5|real good product heavy and durable

B00SM7KVS4|2|Very bad to adjust. Light output is very good
B006WEFFP8|5|Truck has plenty of power it also corrected my speedometer.Programing was a challenge for me I got help from Hypertech no problem.
B00D3UP9J6|1|I purchased this gas caddy to use around the farm and strap to the trailor when traveling.<br />First the hose is inadequate and I replaced it with a proper hose and nozzle as well.<br />the hand pump lasted 15 gallons before it would no longer prime. I contacted the seller and they informed me my unit was just out of warentee<br />and the manufacturer in China would sell me an improved one. I don't think so<br />beware of this unit!!!!!!!!<br />I replaces the pump with an electric one and it works fine...now I just have to fill the tires with foam as they leak
B000BQW5LK|5|Great little pump! For any fluid your can't pour in.
B00MJ4812Y|1|We were VERY disappointed with these running bars.  They did not line up straight and they do not stick out enough from the car causing them to be more of a hassle than a help.  My husband thinks he was given the wrong brackets.
B001Q399RA|5|My husband liked the winch and installed it. It was easy to install on a 4 wheeler. Haven't had much of a chance to use it yet, so can't say much about the durability, etc.
B000SOM9GQ|4|For the price they are ok.  Not exactly what I would call anti-theft.  Lol
