B006XB267K|5.0|Back to the Future references, Elliott Ness, Dean channeling Sean Connery, not to mention a smokin hot Jensen looking absolutely edible in 40's style...what's not to love? This 80's baby was so pleased I watched it twice! A task I usually reserve for high info exposition episodes. This was a real treat in the middle of a highly depressing season 7. Between the 'unbeatable' Leviathan (can't help thinking of Peter Weller every time they say it) and a dead Bobby Singer I didn't know if I would want to stay tuned, but this light ep pulled me back in for sure.
B000URWYTS|3.0|I had to postpone reviewing this until I was less upset about it. It's not the ending, which is fairly accurate to history, so anybody that googles Frank Lloyd Wright or Mamah will find out what happens. It is brutal, but I expected it.<br />The book itself is interesting, a glimpse into such a bright and passionate mind. Unfortunately, the book is supposed to be about Mamah, and by the end, I'm not sure I like her too much. She's a woman like so many in her time, trying to find herself and her calling. It's a time when women want more than just being moms and housewives, and it must have been a very tought time for these women to come through.<br />But Mamah was already doing that in her life before FLW. She was a mother, but was allowed to go to a University, was allowed to have a job, spare time to write...she had a nanny and a sister to help out with the house. Wait, she was way better off than me. And I'm not going to attack her for ***SPOILER*** (again, you can google this, not a secret) falling in love with Frank. Life happens, she's not the first one. Ok, so she has an affair and then decides to get a divorce. Fine. I felt bad for her husband who seemed like a nice person, but I know how love works. And she was in love with somebody else.<br />What I couldn't really forgive her is the abandonment of her little kids. I couldn't undestand it.<br />Also, throughout the book we see a woman who continuously gets influenced (blind-sided) by liars. Frank LW was a big liar, and then Ellen. So not too get too long here, but it seems that she was more of an independent woman while she was married than later on, when she's constantly controlled by Frank and other influences. But I give it to her, living with Frank must have been a messy affair. I would have dumped his a$$ long before her :)(

B000RH0C8G|5.0|I heard a lot about this book and then the movie came out and I just had to read the book first, as in my opinion, book is always better than movie.  The book did not disappoint.  Was in my top five ever, for sure.  I'm a baseball fan and was very intrigued by the unconventional way of doing business shared in this book.  It's so like in everyday real life.  We get locked into one way is the only way, or have our blinders on.  Very interesting and entertaining.  Although much of it is commonsense, I'd guess that what Billy started here is getting a lot more \\"play.\\"  Highly recommend the book for anyone that is a baseball or sports fan.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Zeitgeist has received a lot of flak since it was released, most of the criticism being drawn from the fact that neither D'arcy or James Iha appear on the album. A lot of people question whether this is a true Pumpkins album - I can tell you for sure that yes, Zeitgeist is a Smashing Pumpkins album.<br /><br />Billy Corgan is, has been and always will be The Smashing Pumpkins. Whilst Jimmy Chamberlin definitely has some amazing chemistry with Billy, 98% of the actual music and songwriting is entirely Billy. He has a right to the Smashing Pumpkins name, whether you like Zeitgeist or not.<br /><br />I see this album as a very straightforward statement by Billy - he can still rock. After Adore, Machina, Zwan and TheFutureEmbrace, I think fans were really calling for a rock album again. And thus, for Zeitgeist, Billy does away with the electronica elements that influened his latter day Pumpkins work and his solo album, and instead dusted off the strat, cranked up the distortion on his Marshall and Big Muff and decided to show us what alternative rock is again.<br /><br />Does it have the depth or range of Siamese Dream? No. Does it have the ambition of Gish? Probably not. Is it anywhere near as grand as Mellon Collie? Definitely not. But it never tries to be. That's what people fail to see, and that is why people are disappointed. After 7-years without The Smashing Pumpkins, fans expected Billy to produce another epic masterpiece straight away. Zeitgeist is a reintroduction, a moodsetter to remind fans that Billy still has more music to share with us.<br /><br />The actual album itself has its highs and lows. Songs like Starz, 7 Shades of Black, Come On (Let's Go) and the opening track, Doomsday Clock, are straight forward hard rock songs. Perhaps they don't have strong meanings behind them, but these songs are all about the music, and I believe cater much more to a live setting. I saw the Pumpkins live back in '08 when they were still touring on a lot of Zeitgeist tracks, and whilst something like Come On (Let's Go) sounds like a silly meaningless rock song in its recorded format, I received it completely different live.<br /><br />Bleeding the Orchid is an eerie ballad that helps give the album more substance and depth as Billy seems to experiment a bit more vocally and with production. Other tracks like Bring the Light and Tarantula (the lead single) really drive the album with catchy riffs and choruses that stick in the back of your mind well after you've finished listening.<br /><br />That's the Way, Neverlost and For God and Country make up the slower and calmer sections of the album. That's the Way is still a very poppy song and seems almost made for radio play, whilst For God and Country is an odd song that's uncharacteristic of Billy. Extremely heavy and overpowering bass backs the song as Billy righteously claims that he wants to fight for God and Country in a very restrained goth-pop track that seems to have an undertone of cynical patriotism, but I'm probably wrong there.<br />Neverlost seems like an underrated treasure on the album, a well written song that uses the classic Pumpkins formula of quiet verses and harder choruses.<br /><br />Zeitgeist's wild card though, is without a doubt, United States. The ten-minute progessive rock epic features some of the greatest drumming I have ever heard put to CD, and I would go as far as calling it Jimmy's magnum opus. United States is a definite mood setter, painting a dreary picture of the current state of America and the world in general. Billy's guitar work is simple for this track, yet very heavy and to the point. Halfway through, we're treated to a very creepy and distorted guitar piec until Jimmy and Billy explode back into the song with a fast hard rock beat.<br /><br />The album ends with Pomp and Circumstances, an odd song which won't end up on my list of favourite Pumpkins songs anytime soon, but it serves its purpose in ending Zeitgeist.<br /><br />I believe that Zeitgeist will actually end up being more like Adore and Machina in the way that it will be appreciated more in the future. Already (5 years on) people seem to be less resentful towards it. As time goes on, it wouldn't surprise me if people begin to consider Zeitgeist as a strong rock album, which is what it is. It doesn't have any serious range or depth, but in terms of rock albums, it's one of the better releases we've seen in the alternative market over the last few years. Jimmy also provides some of the best drumming of his career, whilst Billy continues to prove that he is one of the most underrated guitarists in the business today.<br />Stand out tracks go to Tarantula, United States and Bleeding the Orchid. It is worth at least one listen to help you make up your mind. Even the most avid Billy Corgan hater should be able to find at least one song to enjoy on this LP.

0345803485|5.0|Loved this book couldnt put it down. I have an infant and work and still found the time to read this book in 3 days. Its a fun read with interesting sex scenes that make you think a little that's for sure. I did get annoyed like other reviewers said of the constant \\"inner goddess\\" references and think she could have made Christian stronger. Yes he's withdrawn at times but she makes him insecure also which I dont really feel adds to his sexy dominant character. I ordered the next 2 books right away and cant wait for them to get here so I can finish the trilogy. I sure do hope though that they dont have Christian acting all weak chasing after Ana that would kind of ruin it for me a bit I think. Enjoy the book!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a gripping story and, although I hate to draw the comparison because of how ABC's Lost ended on such a sad/pathetic note, the Wool saga is the first fictional series to captivate me in the same way that Lost managed to in its best seasons. Don't be deterred if the second story feels a little slow -- the payoff in the later stories is WELL worth the investment!!!!  I am completely hooked and can't wait to read the 6th installment, which just came out.  Pacing is a little off sometimes and the characters don't feel as \\"real\\" to me as others have raved about, but this is still a really fantastic series that seems to be getting better and better with each new installment.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I agree with a lot of the reviews when they say this was classic Stephen King. However, it was a bit too short for my taste, definitely not worth the $2.99 price tag. I realize that it's just a single, but it seems like just as I got hooked on it, it was done and over. Not too mention that it left way too much to the imagination... but I guess is what King's sometimes best at doing, letting us continue the story the way we'd like it to end. All in all it was well written and captivating but definitely left me hanging.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can't believe the hype this book is getting. The erotic scenes are hot, but other than that it's a total bore. Ana spends 50% of her time biting her lip, 25% rolling her eyes, and the other 25% split between checking her email and having sex. I wanted to like this book, I really did. I have to apologize to the author for blasting her, but even she said she doesn't know why everyone is making such a big deal over it. It could've been written by a junior high student who's had too much internet exposure.<br /><br />Won't be wasting money on books 2 and 3.

B0018QQQK8|1.0|This book hardly warrants a review. The plot is so scattered and ill-conceived. There is no need to share the viewpoints of some of the characters; just explain them through other characters so that I don't have to hear them whine about their lives or how they creep on young girls. The whole premise of this book is somewhat ridiculous, but the way it's written makes it a chore to read.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although I still think that the author could have done a better job with the ending I still am happy on how the book is concluded. Wars are ugly and the people who survive are barely left unscathed. But what I wish the author could have giving Katniss was a little more hope. I mean after each horrible experience this chick goes through you would think she would continue to grow. But it seems that character was stuck in a vicious circle of non-belief. But I'm team Peeta so yay to that ending!
0385342063|5.0|:)  <3  :)  <3<br />Totally how I feel about this book, a long time reader of Kinsella (I will admit to stopping at book 2 of Shopaholic as it felt tired and I was paying for her new Merc instead of a good book) for the most part have liked her and willing to buy but was wondering with the last few books if Kinsella had lost her mojo-the answer is nope! Thank goodness! I started this book knowing I shouldn't as I had work bright and early but couldn't wait and even as 1130pm came and went and I knew I needed to go to bed I was only half way through and you would have had to pry the book from my fingers with a crow bar.<br />It was silly funny in some places and sweet and gently sad in others, I laughed out loud and a few tears that I'm sure were allergies were shed.<br />Loved it!

0143120530|5.0|Who does not want to have a good memory!  Josh Foer recounts the many efforts through the ages to improve memory.  He starts with ancient times, when an excellent internal memory was necessary, when ancient books were very scarce.  Today, the ability to recite large amounts of material, without book-in-hand, is routine for actors on the stage, but for few other occasions.  For most of us, written lists and Google substitute for our relatively untrained memory.  Clearly most people can improve their memory by certain methods and practice. Foer describes some methods that rely on purposeful exaggeration to augment memory, by making things more exciting. We have little trouble remembering outrageous frightful things and hurtful things that happen to us.  Alcohol, sleeping pills, and vacations are used to escape remembering unwanted information.  Foer gives a difficult method for remembering based on the concept of an imaginary house that you mentally furnish with items that you want to or need to remember. Little mention is made of the effects of stimulants, particularly caffeine, which has long been used to make life more exciting!  The book gives some examples of persons that have incredible natural memory. Certainly repetition plays a very important role, which cannot be denied for ordinary people.

0761169253|2.0|I have never written a review before but I just can't let this one go.The author says he only saves positive feedback and deletes anything which doesn't make him feel positive. This will not be something he'll be keeping. This book is far from memorable. This is a compilation of the obvious. I don't recall a single new inspiring or insightful idea. The author seemed to think he was being clever (or maybe creative?) but he repeatedly misses the mark. He should be ashamed to charge any money for his ramblings. I could have gotten more I inspiration from my dear old Aunt Fanny.
B007549YM4|4.0|*** The less you know about this movie the better. Don't read reviews, don't view the trailer again and again, just watch it. But be warned, it is disturbing. I blind bought it and I am glad I did. Worth multiple viewings. ***<br /><br />It is hard to rate a movie like The Divide and I'm hesitant to say I liked it due to being judged as a psychopath. I'm not going to tell my mom about it, but I actually like this movie. Yes movie, not film. It is very fast paced yet patient as it cooks the crazy in each of the tenant's minds while they're stuck in the basement/bunker. The movie starts off with a bang and never lets up. It gets more and more intense as it goes on. At first I found the acting a bit cheesy, however as the movie went on each character became more interesting and well played.<br /><br />The movie is violent, disturbing, un-nerving, and sometimes makes you squirm in your seat. There is a little twist here or there, however not much is really explained. You know what they know and nothing more. You are viewing the people experiencing this tragedy and you are locked in that basement with them. If you are one of those people who have to know why something happened or try and make sense of the madness, you may not like this movie. It is not a thinking movie however it projects the psychological effects of being confined to a small space with a bunch of people with little food and water. The beginning of the movie started to annoy me because I wanted answers. Why did the city blow up? Was it bombed? But as the movie progressed I understood that the explosion had really nothing to do with the movie, it is all about the people and the toll it takes on the mind.<br /><br />Michael Biehn and Lauren German were brilliant and strong characters in The Divide. Milo Ventimiglia also had a very intense character to play. There were times where I was laughing (more in the beginning) due to the interaction between the tenants as not all of them get along. It is quite a rapid turn from the beginning of the movie to the end.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are both very good. The PQ is sharp, yet a little grainy as the director indented. The graininess really adds something to this movie and I 100% appreciate it. The AQ is crystal clear and at a good level blows you away with the intensity of the actions on the screen. It is a great movie to give you subwoofer a workout. There also is an almost constant buzz of the lights throughout.<br /><br />Do I recommend The Divide? Yes, I do. Is it worth multiple viewings? Yes, I very much think so. It is one of those movies that wasn't great, however it will sit and stew around in your head for weeks to come and it will become one of those guilty little pleasure movies that you watch every once and a while and enjoy it.<br /><br />Recommended for the post-apocalyptic psychological movie fans.pid turn from the beginning of the movie to the end.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are both very good.

0062011847|5.0|I loved it, like I love everything what Mr. Pratchett has written. I love Sam Vimes and Ankh-Morpork. Now my dream is to see a new book with the three witches!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|My initial reaction on completing this was simply: wow.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. It's not perfect, I'll admit, but it's close.<br /><br />The main pull that had me wanting to read this book is the element of Wicca. Wicca has been a subject that's been of great interest to me over the last few years. My favorite show of all time is Charmed. It's got strong storylines and powerful female role models, and so does this story. I love stories with powerful witches in them. I also enjoy the connection to nature, and simplicity, and peace that Wicca can bring.<br /><br />This story had all those things and more.<br /><br />Not everything, or everyone, is always as they seem. Sophia is a typical 20 something, just finished college and moved back home. The people in her town are wary of her, suspicious even, because she practices Wicca. She tries her best to ignore them, but even she has her limits. One night her friend Ivory invites her out to a club, under the pretense of having some fun, and little does she know the people that she meets there and the events that unfold will change her path, and her life, forever.<br /><br />This book is full of action, suspense, and romance all at once.<br /><br />I have to admit, that once I learned that there were vampires, my enthusiasm sagged slightly. I was thinking, \\"Oh no, same tired thing again, witches falling for vampires.\\" And while some of the information is the same, there are a lot of twists and differences to keep your interest. I don't want to give anything away, but trust me, it's different.<br /><br />I love the attention to detail that the author has. This is just one example that sticks out in my mind, but it works really well. For Sophia's love interest Charles, Hamilton gives him teal colored eyes. Not blue, not green, not even blue-green, but teal. In that simple word choice she had me hooked in to his character and to rooting for him and Sophia  as a  couple.<br /><br />The romance between them is just right. Mature, simple, not overly exaggerated. It made me catch my breath a few times, I'll admit.<br /><br />The concept of a Forever Girl is a new spin on reincarnation. I really enjoyed the idea of this. It's done in a way that I've not read before, and it's a powerful way to let Sophia's past come to light and to complete the strengthening of her magic.<br /><br />I could probably go on and on about this book but I won't ramble on with too many more details. I don't want to give too much away. I can't wait to read the next book in this series, I hope it's just as good if not better than this one.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm a big, huge sucker for a tough girl, a good family story, the Avett Brothers, poetry, romance...so Colleen Hoover basically had me at the title of this book. This is a gorgeous story of love and loss, growing up and embracing life, learning to let go and being brave enough to hold on with all you've got. I cried. Literal tears and snot on my face during this read...but I was also left with a tremendous feeling of hope and satisfaction. Oooh, and if you want to see Will's poem (YOU'LL know the one) slammed in real life, please visit Colleen's website: [...] because an AMAZING slam poet reads the poem, and it gave me CHILLS!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|SMALL SPOILER ALERT!<br />So I started off seeing the movie (convinced by my fiance) and loved it, So the next day I purchased the trilogy to read on my Iphone, the books are all great but I feel the first is the best. There books are so addicting that I finished them in under 2 days. The first ends well leaving you hungry for more. So then you get to the second, which in my opinion starts off weak and gets stronger and stronger. So as I progress into the book Im antipating the bond between the 2 main characters to get stronger but then out of the blink of the eye its over, Dragging me to the third and final book. This one really left me open, I wasn't satisfied with what I was given. The bond from the second book is basically deteratating all throughout the book, The bond most fans are hoping for all along has become nothing but a \\"back-event\\" to seal the book up. The series had to end of couse, but I feel we couldve been given more. After I finished I sat back and thought to myself, \\"Wow, that movie is gonna suck\\" I just feel like it takes a complete opposite turn from the first two. So all in all, the first two of the series are great!, but the third, although ending well, just needed alot more of the original qualities that we saw in the first two. If only it could be re-written, now im just scarred with a thousand questions
B007549W62|5.0|First off, This is not for children or those with any concern of graphic violence.  The themes portrayed here are dark and evil and this is a stark look at humanity and the decent into madness that isolation and fear can induce.  Also I find that the involvement of \\"higher and more organized survivors\\" interacting with the group adds to the sense of dread and ultimate dissolution of sanity.  The use of cinematography to capture the emotion of these events adds a very real and foreboding setting.  Once the world is viewed it is desolate and dark and reminder of the consequence of war.<br /><br />The story begins with explosions (obviously nuclear) seen outside of an office window stories up in an apartment building.  As chaos errupts people make there way down stairs to the ground but some groups seek out the underground basement as a place to hide and regroup.  The Super of the building is a survivalist and has been preparing for the end of the world for many years.  A former military man and firefighter in 9-11 he is no stranger to surviving difficult and seemingly impossible situations.  Yet as we learn his wife and daughter perish in a fire themselves.  He is hard and impassionate.  Yet despite all of this he allows the 10 or so people to pile into the basement storage areas of the building. There is so many stress elements to deal with for everyone involved as the story continues but here are a couple of the highlights.  They can't let anyone in or out of the basements primary entrance due to the fear of radiation and dust.  There are load banging noises constantly as the building itself collapses and the sounds of other destruction continues long after the initial barrage.  In short,  the psychological strain is great and it plays against each character in varying ways.<br /><br />Ultimately we learn that the risks outside are as great as the risks of those inside.  Who are these survivors and will they maintain sanity or slowly slide into the abyss of madness.  This concept is played over and over and things get only worse as time passes.  I don't wish to give any more away.  We know that the world around them is in ruin but the reality of their situation is too much for them to mentally grasp and as the tension builds so does the danger and despair.  The walls of humanity shake and crumble and the images will haunt you long after the last scene.<br /><br />We know what is happening and yet the story continues to suck you in.  The character interaction is strong and the acting was very good.  The cinemetography was striking.  This is a powerful story with even more memorable images. I highly reccomend this movie as it was the most realistic I have seen dealing with the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  Why did all of this happen?  Do we ever really know?  If the world did end and you found yourself in that basement how would you know what was really happening or when it was safe to go outside?  How would the government deal with it and would they be helpful or the opposite?<br /><br />Great movie.  A+ for me.This concept is played over and over and things get only worse as time passes.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|Look no further, the Cosmonaut is really the best stylus available. It glides across gorilla glass like no other stylus, and feels great in the hand.
B005R4255C|5.0|This album feels like someone followed Michael over his whole life, and they mixed the best parts together.  They are unusual mixes, and it makes a great compilation album.  Worth adding to your MJ collection.
B006R1T40I|4.0|After seeing several previous reviews, I decided to post my own.<br /><br />Overall, this is a real good album.  Mostly great songs, with a couple that could have been better.  But, let's face it, no album is perfect.  Even Michael Jackson's Thriller had a couple songs that weren't very good.<br /><br />What I like most about Bonnie Raitt is that her style is all her own, which means that many times people either love it or hate it.  She doesn't cater to pop, rock or blues standards.  She'll play them all, but when she does it has her signature on them.  That is what makes her better than anything that will ever come out from an American Idol, X Factor, or The Voice winner.<br /><br />Does she do this album justice.  Absolutely.  Should you buy this album?  Yes.<br /><br />If and when she makes it to Milwaukee again, I will definitely see her in concert, too.  She did a couple songs on the Colbert Report, and the band sounds tight.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I loved how the story goes in the Breaking Dawn. I was sadden when i thought Bella was going to die after giving birth to her baby girl. The wedding was so beatufiful. Thats how i want my wedding to look in real like Bella's and Edward. I love this movie so much i can;t get enough of it. I can't wait to see what happends in Breaking Dawn part 2. I recommoned people if u are a super big fan like me buy this movie and u won;t regret.  Get it for your girlfriend or your sister she will love this movie to. Its a really good price on amazon also.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was an amazing story about an amazing young woman who survived one of the most horrible life barriers one could imagine.  It was like reading \\"Silence of the Lamb's\\" but this was a real story. Jaycee Dugard was able to provide her readers with a side of a story than many of us will find hard to accept as truth due just in part to the cruel nature of the crimes committed against her.  It was amazing how she was able to mature from an abused child taken away from her family to someone who can share this story with others and motivate many to overcome the many barriers in life they face.  I was reminded of something I once heard: \\"Don't be afraid of opposition.  Remember, a kite rises against the wind, not with it.\\"  Jaycee was faced with such opposition but eventually overcame the abuse and brainwashing and rose to freedom alive and with a new look and life with her family.  The story is scary yet real.  So real it haunts you as you begin her journey into the mind of a crazy criminal, but as you see her will to just survive one day at a time, you begin to take on the strength she developed to finish the story. It was a journey hard to understand or even why it would happen, but one where Jaycee survived, not knowing if she would live from one day to the next, but she did endure to live and become free.  Great story by a great individual.
B005FISC52|5.0|i love one tree hill. I love the twists and turns this season 9. I am sadden they cancel  One Tree Hill for good. I think they rushed this season way to fast it came out on April 10th thats pretty rushed to be honest. I love the cast and the stars on the show. I am going to Miss One Tree Hill. I recommoned u all to buy it if your a big One Tree Hill fan like me and u won;t regret it. its the best deal on Amazon for the price.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for being the cheapest place to buy this stuff.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Mockingjay is a fine written book but is NOTHING compared to the first two books in the series. I found this book confusing and harder to follow. I had to reread sections numerous times to figure out what was going on and honestly never really understood it. If you have read the other books in the series you must read this but prepare yourself for a little dissapointment.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it was a great book. If you haven't read this book you should.This book has gotten me hooked on kindle. This was the first book I read from my kindle app on my phone and I loved it. If you have read this book you should get the next book mockingjay from amazon.com. This whole series is great.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you have read the hunger games and catching fire this book is a must. It is better  than the first two. I love this series. Amazon.com is so awesome you can find any book you want at amazon.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I loath the idea of needing a stylus to use a device, but for certain tasks fingers alone simply won't do. Reluctantly, I purchased the cosmonaut directly from Neat and was blown away.<br /><br />The product itself is solid. Perfect weight, good size, and it feels indestructible. Functionally, although you're not going to get the precision of a pencil on paper (though that's a limitation of the electronic device, not the stylus), you will get a superb experience. My iPad consistently picks up taps and it only requires light pressure.<br /><br />The greatest strength of this product is its weight, but sadly that is also its greatest weakness. Simply, it is uncomfortable to try and briefly type (eg a search query) while half-holding the pen. The cosmonaut's bulk pretty much requires that you set it down if you're going to be using both hands. Because of the difficulty of mixing input methods, you pretty much have to choose between one or the other. Typing is slow, but tolerable.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|This movie proves that you don't have to be well educated and informed to be in Hollywood.  Who possibly could believe Mickey Rourke as a tyrannical Greek king with a New York accent?  It has only a vague and distant relationship to any actual Greek mythology, which is primarily used as a containing vehicle (with plenty of deformation of the original Greek legends) for as much bloodshed and non-stop graphic violence as they could squeeze into the movie.  Probably the worst movie I've seen in the last five years.  About the only positive things you can say about this movie is that the sets are sometimes quite visually spectacular, and the actress who plays the Oracle is genuinely hypnotic.  Otherwise, the movie is absolute trash.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am happy with this app and it's abilities. I would and have recommended it. Give it a try. Thank you.
B00007LTIA|2.0|I first bought this album as a British import back in 1973 several weeks or months before they released it in the states. I was a huge YES fan of about 2 years time at that point, and they were coming off the tremendous \\"Close to the Edge,\\" one of the best progressive rock albums of all time.<br /><br />With tales, they had already lost Bill Bruford to King Crimson, and were about to have Rick Wakeman jump ship largely because even he thought this album was self-important pompous drek. It turns out that Wakeman was right; it further turned out the Alan White could in no way replace Bill Bruford. [question: did Bill Bruford bolt because he too thought YES were going in the wrong direction(s)?]<br /><br />I tried hard to like this record. I saw this show live at the Forum in LA that year, and was greatly disappointed in the show. Wakeman looked on stage like he hated this material, judging by his body language.<br /><br />This was the album that began my turn away from YES and toward some other far more important progressive bands (King Crimson, Gong, Supertramp - \\"Crime\\" at least, and TR's Utopia to name but a few). I eventually sold my import of this album and have never looked back.<br /><br />If you want YES at their best, go for \\"Fragile,\\" \\"The YES album,\\" and \\"Edge.\\" This album is to me a colossal waste of time AND money.

B006UG90RM|4.0|So I was never THAT into Van Halen...and when I was, it was during the Van Hagar years.  Something about David Lee Roth was so silly and I kind of thought rock should be serious (grunge, etc).  I have to admit...my opinion mellowed on this band and DLR in general (after covering some of the tunes in my band).  Anyway, this new album exceeded all of my expectations.  The producer/engineer did a great job of doing what I thought was impossible--making DLR and Van Halen sound MODERN and current and yet COMPLETELY LIKE THEMSELVES.  I don't know how that was possible.  I thought Van Halen with DLR was a relic of the 80s, but this is a GREAT rock album for 2012.  If you didn't like them before, give a listen to, say, She's the Woman.  I was lukewarm on Tattoo at first but that chorus stays in my head, too.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is the most amazing game in the world I recommend this game a whole lot la la la la
B005FITIK0|5.0|This was one of the best movies of last year.  Major oversight that Diablo Cody was overlooked for a best writing Oscar nomination.  Also Charlize Theron deserved best actress.  No other actress and writer could have made a character like Mavis both sad and funny.  Not for people looking for a feel-good movie, but for people who like harsh realities of adulthood.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I've read most everything Baldacci has written and I can honestly say this was one of my favorites.  The story flowed well and was interesting through out the entire book.  I'm not about to give away the plot as it is one of his better ones and very well played out. The story progressed at a good pace and the characters were developed well to allow you to become attached in all the right places.  Zero Day introduces a completely new character who is somewhat reminiscent to a Raylan Givens from FX's Justified.  He's sharp, quick witted and very savvy to people and his surroundings. I really liked him and hope to see more with him as the hero in the tale.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A few weeks ago everywhere I turned people were talking about 50 Shades of Grey, the hot new story written by someone named E L James. I've seen this trilogy described as \\"mommy porn\\" more times than I can count, and while I'm not a mom I thought I'd make my way through the trilogy anyhow.<br /><br />I was determined to read not just the first book, 50 Shades of Grey, but the entire trilogy. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not sure why I made and kept this goal because I found the books to be pretty abysmal from page 1.<br /><br />It's worth noting that 50 Shades started off as a Twilight fan fiction story called Master of the Universe. So yeah, when you're reading these books, just picture the main character Christian as Edward and Anna as Bella and you'll be good to go.<br /><br />The most unforgivable aspect of the 50 Shades series is that it is just very poorly written. The books are addled with type-o's, which drives me freaking nuts.  They're making who knows how many millions of dollars on these stories and they couldn't bother getting a proper copy editor? Give me a break. Once you get past the type-o's, it's glaringly obvious that the stories are written at about a sixth grade reading level. You know, about the same level at which the Twilight books were written. For instances of poor writing, look no further than the words that come the most frequently out of Anna's being mouth being either, \\"Holy $***\\" or \\"Holy F***.\\" I considered making a drinking game out of Anna saying either of these expressions but then realized I'd be hammered after about five pages.<br /><br />I didn't actually know that 50 Shades of Grey started out as fanfic until after I finished the first book, and then it all made sense. While reading Grey I kept thinking that it was written in a similar - READ: basic and unsophisticated - style to Twilight. The things the characters say to one another is downright cringe-worthy. Instead of Jacob and the werewolves, however, 50 Shades of Grey has SEX. Holy cow do they have sex. Christian and Ana can't look at one another without \\"tingling\\" and wanting to have sex immediately. And often. And anywhere they can. There's so much sex that it becomes mind-numbing and I started skipping over those scenes completely. I'm not opposed to sex scenes in books, but these scenes were so boring and similar to one another that I found them unbearable.<br /><br />Christian and Ana are not well thought-out characters nor are they characters worth cheering for. Ana has no backbone whatsoever and apparently spent her time in college living under a box. Christian is, well, 50 shades of f***** up. {This is straight from the book. I don't talk like this.} He's also a stalker, abuser, billionaire that never works, and a psychopath.<br /><br />I feel bad for all of us that 50 Shades of Grey is considered great/fun/interesting reading material. I don't recommend the first book or the series at all.Grey has SEX. Holy cow do they have sex. Christian and Ana can't look at one another without \\"tingling\\" and wanting to have sex immediately.

B005T87QCI|3.0|this game is fun but it will get boring in a short time. also the main character of the moive (Atom) is not even in here.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|A great game and a great time passer. I give the creater props on this idea it's awesome. Better than angry birds. you should get it.
0062101897|5.0|so i got this book for Christmas and i have to tell you it has everything you could ever want to know about the film adaptions. Did you ever wonder how they made brooms fly? well now i know. This is the ultimate book for every harry potter fan out there. Don't hesitate because of the somewhat steep price because honestly you wont be disappointed!
0446572993|1.0|I have read this author for many years, but this time he falls far short. The plot is incoherent and Balducci decided to wrap it up. It was clear who the bad person was in this book. It stuck out  like a sore thumb. The author is better than this book, and it was too  long that delivered too little.
0307888908|2.0|I liked this book...easy to read...breezy...until I pulled it out for a paper I'm writing and tried to find something to quote.<br /><br />Lite.<br /><br />No research and all stories...great if you think a story has a bigger fact (Sheryl Sanberg, working for Larry Summers, was able to ask Eric Schmidt for career advise and landed at Google...if that fits your lifestyle more power to you but drawing a larger lesson...for the paper I'm trying to write...).<br /><br />Now I'm mad that there is no concrete research whatsoever.  Employment projections going forward on the jobs of the future and skills needed (recent Foreign affairs report; Thomas Friedmans That Used to be US...they are there...)?  Nothing.<br /><br />If you want a trite bit of insight from some guys who made money but won't spend it to find any facts you will like this book (not a lot to love).  I wasted my money.  I can guess about the future (or research projections based on trends and some strenous analysis) alone.<br /><br />Don't buy the hype.
B007IK44CK|1.0|Step away from the buy/rent button trust me you will regret renting/purchasing this movie...<br /><br />Oaky, First off I 'm a fan of action movies and had high hopes for this particular installment of MI. Wow was I wrong. It's bad as in never want to see it again... want my money back... wasted my life... screaming profanities at the TV kinda bad. The best part of the movie was the end and I don't mean the ending. I mean the end as in when the screen went black. Seriously a total disappointment.<br /><br />Additionally I tried to give this zero stars but Amazon wouldn't let me nor did they have a negative stars option but if they did I'd be so there.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a nice game being that its free and it does not ask me to buy items for a fee.  Works good on my Kindle Fire without any issues.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book grabbed my attention and held on to it all the way through.  I have recommended it to people who have seen the movie, because there is so much more information on the story line.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|great tool to carry around. I find it very useful when your travelling or even just at home. I carry my one almost everywhere. The downside of it is just the sheath the back part where you slip in your belt easily gets torn. Should think of making better sheath.

It could be because she's a 21-year-old, which is one of my many complaints about this book, second to Christian Grey's 27-year-old character, who apparently plays the piano like a modern day Bach. If the writer made the characters older, and added some depth to their personal stories, I think the book might have had a chance. However, Fifty Shades of Grey is basically Twilight without the sparkles and the fangs. Edward Cullen and Christian Grey must be the most awesomely perfect males to have ever walked the fictional world. Jeez!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the game play. How about adding more movies at the theatre though ( great idea). As for the person with the trouble on the kindle all I do is quick hit the power. button and than quick hit it again,  but yes it is annoying.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My sister told me to get this book the same time my best friend said the same thing. It is a great love story and the best thing about it is that rich or poor everyone comes with their past and if you love someone enough you decide if you can handle it.  Well written with hot sex but as hot as the sex is it does not take away from the love or the complex people who are learning about one another.  I am on book two and can't wait to read three!
B0061QD88S|5.0|I love Disney.  This is a sweet movie.  I would watch it more than once.  It reminds me when my children were small when we first watched it at the Drive In.
0345803493|5.0|Although the book is getting most of it's attention for the sexy... the really good plot is being ignored.  I agree that the scenes are rudundant but skip over them and get into Who and Why Christiane is who he is.  There's also a lot of drama and action not associated with the lovey dovey stuff.  I also like that she leaves you hanging at the end of each one so you have to read on to know what's gonna happen.  Book three should be really good...can't wait to get to it.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher. She was portrayed as she would have wanted to be. In the movie, we had the opportunity to travel through her grief experience as she said goodbye to her husband - a privilege few have. She was a remarkable woman who lived her life according to her beliefs. Streep portrayed her as she was - authoritarian, autocratic, a bit arrogant. Streep gave insight into the inner mind and heart of Thatcher.

0439023513|4.0|The first game was amazing, the second one not too much...this one is by far the most cruel and raw of all, shows you the reality of war: \\"in the end war kills you, doesn't matter which side you are\\"
0553386794|5.0|When I first started reading I honestly thought it was a little slow and it took me a few chapters to get used to the changing viewpoints. I had read other books that had tried to pull that style off and those experiences kind of put me off the technique. However GRR Martin really created a great book and I became addicted to this book after those first initial chapters lol I read it every free moment I had (even avoiding answering the phone so I would have more time to read it). I now really like the switching viewpoints and found myself really looking forward to certain characters, especially Tyrion. Anyway a great book that I highly recommend.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|was playing when everything switched to 58 days until I could harvest or collect. now I'm out the digital content. I paid for.
0553381695|5.0|Since there are already a couple hundred 5 star reviews I kind of wonder to myself why I am adding another review. The answer: because it is awesome. Luckily I began reading the series around a year and a half ago before the series on HBO and just in time for A Dance With Dragons lol. I feel lucky because I could imagine the characters my own way before seeing them on the screen. Anyway A Clash of Kings is a really awesome book and I highly recommend it.

B000CCIVDO|2.0|It sounds good, I'll give you that. But the finishing is terrible. The cord that connects the ear parts unglues from the head part in a matter of days. It does not fit well, too. I thought that even a low-priced Behringer headphone would still be awesome. Guess I was wrong.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book because I tend to try to keep up with my daughter's habits, especially when I hear that teens are killing each other. This book was tastefully done on that account and I can honestly say that it was not gruesome or inappropriate outside of that, although that sounds like enough from the outside. My initial impression was that the concept is imaginative and interesting. The main character goes through some serious challenges that I think would be positive for a teenager to read and process. In particular, the deep struggles Katniss faces in her every day life to survive and maintain normalcy are compelling and reachable for even a young mind. I like this a lot because this is a gap in a lot of American teenagers' ability to process and connect with. The disconnection between her circumstance and the Capitol is very good emphasis of this point. The arena portion is also very solid because of her developed connection to others and trying to cope with death and what she has to do. the portion that is wholly unbelievable in my mind is the level of maturity this character has. As a sixteen year old girl, she is beyond wise and her thought processes are way too mature. This lends itself to unbelievability in my mind in almost every turn of the book. This continues in the following book and really turns me off. It just goes too far and borders on extreme in my opinion. Overall, I liked the story and see why it is so appealing to others in this age range. It is a well thought out concept and story. I do recommend it for those interested or those who saw the movie
0439023491|3.0|My review is on the 2nd book of three by Suzanne Collins, Catching Fire. In this book Katniss has just won the Hunger Games with Peeta. They won by pretending that they were falling in love. They are about to start the victory tour when President Snow stops by and gives Katniss a warning that he is watching what she is doing. Katniss isn't sure what he means by this. Katniss takes Haymitch aside to find out if he knows what is going on. Haymitch tells her that if she and Peeta are to survive they are to stay to true to the falling love story.<br />Their first stop is in District 11 which is where Rue was from. Katniss and Peeta talk too much and it seems that they are being rebellious against the Capital. They watch in horror as some of the people from District 11 are dealt brutal punishments for agreeing with their words. After this Katniss and Peeta are more careful in what they say and how they behave. By the end of the tour of the Districts, Peeta has proposed to Katniss and she is afraid that everyone is going to be able to tell that it isn't for real.<br />While in the Capital Katniss and Peeta attend a party and meet the new Gamemaker. The Gamemaker shows Katniss his watch and it has the mockingjay on it. With this Katniss realizes that the mockingjay has become the symbol of the rebellion. President Snow isn't going to like this when he finds out.<br />Once Katniss gets home she tries to talk with Gale but they don't do much talking just a lot of arguing. Gale wants to leave and fight the Capital and Katniss doesn't. Gale leaves and when Katniss catches up to him Gale is being whipped in the center of the District for hunting game. Katniss tries to help Gale and ends up getting hurt herself but she also manages to get Gale to her house to help him heal. Gale continues talking about joining the rebellion. Katniss goes to the woods to thinks and finds that she has been trapped in the woods. While in the woods she runs into 2 people who say that they are from District 8 and they are on their way to District 13. Katniss has always been told that District 13 was destroyed. These people have heard of the rebellion and that District 13 is where everyone is meeting to join the rebellion. Katniss gets home finally from the woods.<br />While Katniss is preparing for her wedding the Capital announces that there is going to be a special Hunger Games. The Quarter Quell. These games will have all the winners from the previous games competing against each other. Katniss and Peeta must go back to the games again. Katniss and Peeta start telling everyone that they were secretly married earlier and that she is pregnant. This news builds more unrest against the Capital.<br />During the games Katniss and Peeta make friends with some of the other winners and they try and help each other out. They figure out that the arena is surrounded by water and that a force field keeps everything together. Katniss and Peeta fight over which one is going to die to save the other. Meanwhile, the team schemes about how to take out the remaining tributes who aren't their allies. Beetee has a plan to electrocute the arena with his handy coil of wire. The group gets separated while they're putting his into action, and chaos ensues. Katniss is brutally wounded but still realizes a significant part of Beetee's plan. She winds the end of Beetee's wire around one of her arrows and shoots it into the force field. The arena explodes.<br />Katniss is barely conscious enough to realize that she's been taken out of the arena. When she finally comes to, she's in an aircraft with Plutarch and Haymitch, along with Finnick, Beetee, and some others. She learns that this was part of a master plot, and that there is a serious group of rebels, based out of District 13, working to take down the Capitol. She learns that all of the effort in the Quell was to protect her, because she's the rallying point for the entire rebellion and the face of the revolution.<br />But Peeta hasn't been saved from the arena. The Capitol got him, which is obviously really, really bad. Katniss plunges into dark despair. The only thing that brings her out is news from Gale, who also happens to be on the aircraft. Gale breaks the news to her, very gently, that their entire home district has been destroyed.n't been saved from the arena. The Capitol got him, which is obviously really, really bad.

B0059XTUVI|2.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\" is not the movie you expect it to be, nor is the movie you want it to be. That in it's self is not necessarily a bad thing, the reason that this is a bad movie is because what it is isn't very good. This is perhaps the least focused, least interesting biopic in a great many years. Considering it's fascinating subject, weather you agree politically or not, you've got to admit Marget Thatcher is an interesting woman and historical figure. What we get instead is a banal Lifetimeish movie of the week, a tear jerker, if you will, that no one cries over.<br /><br />\\"The Iron Lady\\" gives no insight into Mrs. Thatcher, little or no historical references, little in way of her personal life. Instead, the film seems focused on her weening years as she enters dementia and caries on conversations with her deceased husband. The unfocused script barely touched on issues of politics, how her gender affected her place in parliament or much of her personal sacrifices, that she must have made when ascending to the highest office in the land. This is the kind of vague biography where the subject is kept continuously at arms length. I have read that those who support this movie claim that it is well made, I disagree, it may look professionally made, but the film is undermined by flashbacks, edits and montages that keep the viewer disorientated.<br /><br />Much has been said of Meryl Streep's performance as Mrs. Thatcher, well it is interesting and it is good, but not in the way most think it is. There is so little insight into Thatcher's personality and no emotional depth, that Streep is left to do little more than mimic her voice, her mannerisams, and thanks to a fine make-up specialist, her appearance. This isn't a performance so much, as an impersonation, a good one indeed, but an impersonation no less. Was Streep worth of the Best Actress Oscar? I don't really think so, an Academy Award should be seen as a standard of excellence, but in all facets of life mistakes are made, and the academy has made more than their fair share over the years.<br /><br />\\"The Iron Lady\\" was directed by Phyllida Lloyd, from a screenplay by Abi Morgan, who is a highly respected theatre director, her previous film was \\"Mama Mia!\\". I have read that miss Lloyd believes Thatcher to have been the most important woman in politics since Elizabeth 1. A valid point of view, not shared by all, but with such a strong belief in her subject, I have to ask, why did she so willingly let her down. A better focused, more interesting, and possibly better acted, movie will some day be made about Margret Thatcher. Until then, it's still best to get your history, even recent history for a good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Didn't really know what to think when I started this. I do like to look over reviews before starting a book by an author I have not heard of, and all the 5 star reviews had me kind of suspecting a conspiracy. But I decided, why not?<br /><br />As you can see, I'm adding my own 5 star review. I don't think I've been subjugated by the nefarious organization behind the cleanings. And now I can understand why so many rave reviews. By the time I started chapter 4, I found myself unable to put it down, and spent a few nights missing my normal bed time.<br /><br />I simply enjoyed the omnibus from start to finish.

B000Q7ZND6|2.0|A very nice movie. Overall audio is okay but the center channnel is soft on output. Whisper can hardly be heard. Dolby TrueHd is average. Switched to Dolby Digital, less compressed. Gabriel wing flaps can be heard. Now the center channel is much better. Visual just okay. Its a 50G disc.
B000FC0OOU|1.0|I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to \\"unprintable\\", \\"unmentionable\\" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist. Whoever edited this book need be shot, and be sent back to whatever community college academic standpoint they came from where they believe the world is fair and things should all be politically correct.<br />NEVER CHANGE THINGS TO SUIT YOUR SENSIBILITY!

B000FBFN1U|5.0|The third installment of the George R.R. Martin Smash, was a real page turner.  There are some real surprises that made me laugh and smile with devious delight and others that made me so angry as to ask what the author was thinking.  But all was done beautifully, this is my favorite so far, the characters I've grown to love and some I hate are really well written.<br />If you're as hooked as I am on this series you'll be even more so with this 3rd one.  Happy reading!

B006OB3K56|5.0|This is the story of two struggling people: sex addict Brandon and his emotionally dependent sister Sissy.  When the latter shows up out of the blue (well, after leaving countless distressing messages on Brandon's answering machine), the pair must cope with their own messed up lives.  And, like most people, they don't cope very well at all.<br /><br />There isn't much plot in SHAME.  It's a slow-moving character study.  It's also not for everyone.  The NC-17 rating isn't much for the content (we've seen more graphic stuff in R-rated films), but for the way the content is handled: unflinchingly, without judgement, without condemnation, and perhaps with a tad bit of understanding.  Director/writer Steve McQueen makes frequent use of extended shots; this adds and aura of unease to even the film's more beautiful moments (a real-time take of Carey Mulligan singing \\"New York, New York\\" is most memorable).  The script is intelligent, and never belittles its characters; nor does it put them up on some pedestal of victimhood and pity.  It's simply an honest take on two incredibly realistic individuals.<br /><br />None of that would be possible, of course, without the right actors.  Thankfully, both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan have proven themselves worthy of the job.  They deliver their best performances here; the bravery isn't necessarily in their willingness to bare it all before the camera, but in the off-handed way they do so.  The relationship between Brandon and Sissy is incredibly strained and at times uncomfortable; Fassbender and Mulligan don't shy away from this, but instead embrace it and swing for the fences.  These are truly award-worthy performances; the film's edgy content may have scares away the Academy Awards, but actors of this caliber don't really care.  There will be awards for Fassbender and Mulligan some day.  Right now, they give gripping, memorable performances in a film that is a must-see for anyone who appreciates quality filmmaking, and isn't afraid of stepping outside their emotional comfort zone.isn't afraid of stepping outside their emotional comfort zone.

B004EPYZV2|4.0|Ethan Hunt is back, but this time things are slightly different: IMF is blamed for the explosion of the Kremlin, and Hunt and his teammates are disavowed.  Now they're after a madman armed with Russian nuclear missile codes (which is never a good thing), a true idealist bent on making everyone even...through mass destruction.<br /><br />Brad Bird brings his particular creative genius to the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE franchise, much as his predecessor J. J. Abrams did for the third installment (Abrams is here as a producer).  The result is a fun romp filled with thrills, chills, and quite a bit of laughter.  (The centerpiece, Hunt hanging off the tallest building in the world, is capped by one of the most well-timed one-liners in recent memory.)  It's more or less what you expect from this series; if you liked the first three (we'll forgive you for not liking the second film, however), you'll like GHOST PROTOCOL.  It's no-apologies-necessary entertainment, plain and simple.  It has the great action sequences, the improbable technology and plot points (only Tom Cruise would drive a convertible at high speed during a sandstorm), that we secretly hope for every time we sit down before an action film.<br /><br />What sets GHOST PROTOCOL above your typical flick of this type is the way it handles its characters and actors.  (For example: when a character's knee is dislocated in a key scene, it STAYS dislocated, and said character is forced to hop around.  You just don't see that in a Schwarzenegger film.)  Tom Cruise is in fine form; he's still doing some of his own stunts, still kicking butt and taking names, and yes, he's still charming as all get out.  Joining him are Simon Pegg (returning from the previous film, with a much larger role), Paula Patton, and Jeremy Renner; each of these supporting characters/actors manages to hold their own and leave their stamp on the film, which isn't easy when you're acting opposite Tom Cruise.  For a villain, we have Michael Nyqvist (from the original GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO films), who doesn't get much to do, save for his final, brilliant, and heart-stopping scene.  There are also a few great cameos, which I won't spoil here; I'll only mention Tom Wilkinson because he was in the trailers, and because it's not easy to upstage Cruise and Renner, yet Wilkinson does so without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL is a slick action movie, another solid entry in a deservedly-beloved series.  It isn't as great as the first film, and lacks the adrenaline-fueled rush of the third (not to mention Philip Seymour Hoffman), but it's still a fine flick, much better than it could have been (and what many people expected).  Maybe it's not perfect, but it doesn't try to be.  It's popcorn entertainment, brought to you courtesy of the powerhouse that is (and will always be) Tom Cruise.  If that sounds like your thing, then by all means, fasten your seat belt and take a two-hour cruise (get it?) through the world of MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE.he original GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO films), who doesn't get much to do, save for his final, brilliant, and heart-stopping scene.

0061785652|1.0|All I can say for Mr. Rollins fan base is that they are not a very discriminating group. I have read several of his books through the past few years, and found them so poorly researched that I hadn't read one for over two years. When I saw The Devil Colony at my library, the premise of the book sounded interesting enough that I thought I would give him another try.<br /><br />Big mistake. The author is still writing about a secret agency - Sigma - which is populated by former Special Forces operatives and DARPA scientists, but the author still doesn't know the difference between a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol. In one scene, Hank Kanosh empties his Ruger Blackhawk at the bad guys in a helicopter until his \\"clip\\" runs out. Ruger Blackhawks are single action revolvers (Western style \\"sixguns\\" for those who don't know what a single action revolver is), and they don't use \\"clips\\" (magazines: the detachable metal piece that is loaded with cartridges - not \\"bullets\\" - and inserted into the pistol, usually into the grip of the handgun, as with the Glock pistols used so often in the movies these days). While it is certainly authentic that a guy who travels in the West, and sometimes on horseback, might choose to carry a revolver that has to be cocked by hand for every shot and only holds six cartridges, Mr. Rollins should definitely have known the gun does not use a \\"clip\\".<br /><br />Later, one of his characters is in a helicopter that is caught in extreme turbulence due to an explosion (volcanic, IIRC), and joins the pilot in \\"hauling back\\" on the cyclic control to prevent the aircraft from crashing.<br /><br />As a helicopter pilot who has flown through extreme turbulence (once while crossing Military Pass on the east side of Mt. Shasta in Northern California under a rotor cloud concealed by a cumulus formation) I can tell you that the cyclic control neither requires - nor benefits from - having two people pull on it. A six year old child can pull hard enough to operate the cyclic throughout its entire range of movement, even in turbulence.<br /><br />There were other ridiculous errors in information that showed how poorly Rollins researches his novels, an issue I had with the others I had read. In addition, his characters - so \\"highly trained\\" in Special Forces operations, etc., made some of the most ignorant and silly mistakes imaginable. I'm sure they were simply a plot device to enable Mr. Rollins to have them demonstrate ingenuity in getting out of the \\"fix\\" they found themselves in, but it was completely unbelievable and made the novel painful to read.<br /><br />I'm glad there are people who can enjoy such poor writing, if only because it is nice that they can enjoy themselves, and nice that Mr. Rollins can make a few bucks (far more than his books deserve, IMHO), but if you prefer any sort of believable action and accuracy in your stories, avoid this author like the Plague.perate the cyclic throughout its entire range of movement, even in turbulence.<br /><br />There were other ridiculous errors in information that showed how poorly Rollins researches his novels, an issue I had with the others I had read.

B0051SDM5Q|4.0|My boss bought this book for my entire team and it was required reading. I wasn't looking forward to it because I thought it would be your run of the mill boring book on negotiating.

The book itself is a \\"sticky idea\\" that I keep coming back to, unable to put it down even when I know I should be working.  But reading this book is actually working for me, because I am in the business of sharing valuable ideas.  This is a valuable idea!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|new rules and storyline keep it interesting. the tiles design is crisp and the game is a lot of fun
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of novellas/novels was absorbing, riveting, haunting, and wholly enjoyable. The mystery of this world drives an adventure into deeply relatable characters. While haunting and depressing in premise, I enjoyed the distinct difference between this and other contemporary sci-fi I've read recently in that, despite a depressing world and circumstances, there is a triumph of the human spirit. This driving, not quite optimism, but I'll go with that, was rewardingly brought full circle in the fifth installment with discussions of past versus legacy which, for me, echoed one of my favorite lines from Lord of the Rings: It is what we do with the time that is given to us that matters most (might not be exactly right, but that's the sentiment).<br /><br />Unlike many fans commenting, I am actually happy with the resolution offered in the fifth installment. I'm not saying I wouldn't read a follow-up (I definitely would), but I am saying that the fifth book was rewarding and complete on its own.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading other works of Hugh Howey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love the trilogy! I could not stop reading these books and seriously read all three within two weeks. I highly recommend it for any age. It's such an interesting story!
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Lots of great elements to the story.  Cold War political thriller, with the wonderful touch of including actual historical figures from the time (Brezhnev, LBJ, etc).  Very well done!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I decided to read this book because it had mostly good reviews. I have found it very intriguing and addicting to read. I read the reviews warning about the very descriptive sexual content of the book and although I'm not into reading porn or romances... I figured if the reviews were so positive there must be a story worth reading despite the sex or cheesy romance stuff. There definitely is! The characters are mysterious and the story keeps you in anticipation. So... Even though I think the frequency of the sexual encounters is a bit annoying (it gets old!) and the author annoyingly uses the same phrases again and again to describe things, the story keeps you reading!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I actually really enjoyed this game a lot at first. I didn't mind waiting for Energy and there was plenty to do. but then every time I opened the game it wouldn't remember what I had done the time beforehand I had to start all over again. things were set to hundreds of hours until completion. wont continue playing until fixed.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Of course it's fun.  More important as everyone knows, my four year old daughter loves it.  I do think however that Cut the Rope has severely eaten into it's play time.

1451673442|1.0|The author bases her 'magical' theory on a verse from Matthew (which she doesn't provide so its up to you to search it out - and the same goes for the koran etc.). I found the verse in question and discovered that she was taking the verse completely out of context. She continues to do this throughout the book. I do believe that gratitude can change your life. Many Christian books proclaim the benefits of making a list of things to thank God for every day. It is common for counselors to advise their clients to do the same. The entire book consists of suggesting that you do this, and that you focus your intent on what you want out of life. So she starts out by saying that we cannot receive more until we can be content with what we have (as per Biblical counsel) and then she turns around and tells you that you should focus on what you are envying, on that which you do not have but want. I'll be honest - that, combined with her blatant misquoting and quoting out of context, insults my intelligence. I recommend that you save your money for a book in which the author is truly trying to help you - not on this one that seems thrown together for the sole purpose of preying on people who are discouraged with their lot in life but who are incapable or uwilling to do what it takes to change it. The book isn't even well written. It is full of cliches and does not flow well at all but gives the feeling of having been quickly thrown together. I do not recommend.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I don't need to tell people who've seen this film in theaters to get it when the Blu-Ray comes out (I was fortunate to see John Carter in IMAX when it opened) but it is my hope that JC will have such a great run in disk sales that a sequel might be considered.  The movie deserved better from moviegoers.  The Matrix became a phenom in DVD sales and got a second chance and Disney also resurrected Tron which has a cult following.  I will be sad if John Carter ends with just this one film but this will hold a place of honor amongst my home video collection.  I've always held the belief that critics can get me to see something I wouldn't normally see, but they can never keep me from something I was planning on seeing...I only wish more people would have seen John Carter...maybe they will at home.

1574216988|1.0|I was really dissapointed with this purchase.  The price was really high priced for what you get (in my opinion it was worth maybe $4.00).  The book doesn't go in to how you do the shading if you are using an ink pen.  It doesn't explain really how to do the Zentangle, and just shows lots of examples that have \\"strange names\\".

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I read a lot of negative reviews on this book, so was a little hesitant, but ordered it anyway.  Glad I did because it picks up on characters that are missing in the last book.  When I read series books I have to read them all to see how it ends, don't like to be left hanging and wondering what happened.  For me this is a good read so far, a little slow, but I believe it will get there eventually.
1451648537|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this biography.  In the end, I found it mostly to be a business biography.  How can you cover his personal and business life in a 600 page book?  There is too much to cover.  I was hoping for more personal information or thoughts from his wife on living with Jobs, but maybe that is another book.  As noted by others, I, too, found it interesting that his death is not mentioned at the end of the book.  I also would have preferred a more cronological book.  The skipping around became difficult to sometimes follow.  Yet, here is a man that gets us to pay $400 for a phone and love it.  He followed HIS vision, that you can say for sure.

However, this is one of the better, if not one of the best, books I've read in a long time.  Don't be dissuaded by the book's length.  There are a few short periods where the book drags a little, but those pass quickly enough.  There are also a couple parts that seem predictable, and while one or two of your predictions may be correct, the rest won't be.  READ THIS BOOK
B005EGXTL2|3.0|This is the last in the series of Hunger Games books and I find it just gets too political and too focused on the same idea, which was exciting in the first and second book but by this book I find it falls very flat.  I also found that Katniss seems to be always getting injured and by this stage its boring!  She gets patched up and moved through hospital again and again and doesn't seem to achieve anything.  Also, by the end of the book it seems to have gotten to the writer too who seems to all of sudden reach a certain amount of words and then up and leaves, tying all the ends of the tale together, too quickly and too fast without really thinking about the tone and the attitude of the original two books.  A sad finish to a great start.
B004D38HOG|5.0|As someone who has known a bulimic/anorexia sufferer, not to the extreme that Portia got to. I am ashamed to admit I was very naive on how to help this person & understand what their daily life was like. I hated hearing them being sick after each meal, I didn't understand why they would do this, I felt angry & at the same time helpless. After reading Portia account of her life I have a greater understanding of their daily struggle. Like Portia the person I know is healthy, happy & so am I.<br />At times I cried reading the book, now I am grateful to Portia for her very personal in site into a very difficult time in her life.<br />To be in love & to be loved warts and all is all we really only need.<br />I recommend this book 100%.<br />Thank you
B005EGXTHG|4.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games series and it is just as good as the first book.  Its exciting, fast paced and very edgy.  It again has that tweeny feel to it but it still continues on the disturbed concept of setting up opponents to hunt and kill each other in the arena while people watch this as \\"entertainment\\".  I did find the end of the book confusing, it was too fast paced but the rest of the book is fantastic.  A great, fast paced read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is not your typical build a city/town game.  this game is fun, creative, and really cute. I just downloaded onto my kindle fire yesterday and the graphics are great! Many of the other reviews state that you have to shut down your kindle in order to exit the game. this is NOT true. If you simply hit the settings button in the menu list where the shop and other icons are listed the bar with the home button and back arrow button appear and you can easily exit the game that way. This is a simple, yet fun and adorable game that even has cute mini movies and mini games within it. I also like how you don't HAVE to purchase the acorns in order to get special items like with other games. you can actually get acorns a variety of ways which makes it more fun for those who do not wish to waste money in order to advance in the game.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This is an amazing page turner of a book.  It is slightly tweeny, but you are caught up in the whole concept of the book which is slightly disturbing but leaves you turning every page as fast as you can.  The book is written at a fast pace and leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting to know more.  I do not think I will look at another Reality TV show again.  Greatly enjoyed the book and enjoyed the movie too, however, be aware the movie is TWEENY
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This is a great read, continuing the Game of Thrones saga.  Its interesting and entertaining all at the same time.  New characters are introduced, however the story contines.  You still hear from your favourite characters from Book 1 and Book 2 however the tale is now interwoven with more characters and more intrigue!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|very easy but love the add ons. My granma even thinks its easy and she doesn't use a computer because she doesn't know how. its an all over great app. now I have both
B006RUJST6|5.0|It is always an amazing book that immediately drives me to get up and DO. I don't just finish the book and reflect on the things I have read. I have an overwhelming desire to change something in my life or do something that I have never done before. I find myself wanting to truly experience something, to go out and LIVE life to its fullest. That is what Slammed did to me. No, nothing really life changing occurred with me after reading this book, but I couldn't move on until I immediately loaded the Avett Brothers onto my Pandora playlist so I could hear their amazing music. Then I searched for the beautiful lyrics of their songs so that I could soak them in and interpret them for myself. I have a need to find somewhere, anywhere within driving distance for me to see Slam poetry in action. I found myself sitting in my spare moments and thinking about the Slam poetry that I could perform about the moments in my life that have impacted me the most. I don't just want to sit around and think about the things that I read about in this novel. I want to DO.<br /><br />In short, this is a book about grieving, but ultimately this is a book about living. Lake (a strange name for a main character, but soon it becomes natural and right to me as a name once I got to know her) finds herself transplanted from Texas to Michigan when her mom and she, along with a younger brother, move after the sudden death of her father. Although it has been a few months since her father's death, Lake is still experiencing residual sadness because of the loss of her happy family. Things are different now, and it is even more different when she finds herself in Michigan. She isn't happy to be there, but things begin to look up immediately when she meets the lovely man living next door to her. Will is a few years older than Lake, and they immediately hit it off. I mean they REALLY hit it off. I wouldn't go so far as to call it love at first sight, but they definitely find that there is a solid connection between each other. Within a few days they have gone on the best date ever in Lake's experience, and they are definitely way into each other.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD. READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br /><br />Then their happily ever after world tilts a bit on its axis. Lake shows up for her first day of school on the Monday following her amazing weekend of Will, only to see him in the hall at school as she starts searching for her third hour class. She goes to him, throws her arms around him, and he freaks out. Why? Well, young and lovely Will is actually a very young high school teacher at Lake's high school. He thought she was in college. She thought he was definitely not a teacher. And to add insult to injury . . . he's her third hour teacher. Noooooooo! Now that's trouble. Obviously they can't keep seeing each other. That's all kinds of wrong in almost any playbook in existence. High school teachers do not date their students. Even if the teacher is twenty-one and the student is eighteen. It just can't be done.<br /><br />So what to do now? They try to avoid each other. They try to be \\"just friends.\\" They occasionally get into snippy fits with each other. But they keep coming back to each other again and again. This becomes increasingly more frustrating as the novel continues. As a reader I am rooting for them to find a way to be together as a couple. No matter what Will may say, it is obvious that he wants to be with Lake. But even as my reading heart is wishing for this couple to make it work, my real life brain is saying that this wouldn't be a happy thing in a real life high school. Google any number of recent news stories on this sort of topic, and it becomes clear that situations like this do not generally have happy endings. And yet I continued to root for these two people who seem to be so meant for each other.<br /><br />In Slammed, Lake's mother gives her some great advise about finding a good man. She says:<br />\\"Does he treat you with respect at alltimes? That's the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire you to want to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man.\\"<br /><br />That is why I can't stop rooting for this couple. Will is a good man. He inspires Lake to be a better person. He treats her with respect. A good man. Somehow this relationship has to succeed.<br /><br />Even with a crazy situation like this dominating her life, the difficulties are only beginning for Lake. She finds out that there is more to this move to Michigan than she originally believed, and this revelation is a doozy of a revelation. It will change Lake's life in a significant way, and it is in the midst of this struggle that I believe that Will truly shows his worth to her. Unfortunately it is mixed up in all the confusion of his being her teacher, so a lot of his awesome behavior is lost to her. But it was further proof of his goodness.<br /><br />I won't say more about the eventual ending or resolution of the various issues of the story. I will just say a few thoughts I had while I read. Most of all . . . I absolutely loved the character of Will. He was amazing in so many ways. The things he does for his younger brother and the consideration he gives to Lake's mother and to Lake as well were wonderful. He behaves in a way that seems very hurtful to Lake at one point in the novel (well, actually it is at several points), but once we discover his motivations for his actions, it makes him even more amazing in my opinion. The ending scene of the book was nice, but for me the most wonderful, incredible, amazing, swoon worthy, awwwwww moment of the book was when Will performed his Slam poetry, reading the \\"Lake\\" poem. My heart is still fluttering from that scene. I LOVED that poem and how he used words to so beautifully portray his love for Lake. I can't get them out of my head. That is writing genius in my mind. That is what makes a brilliant poem. Loved it!<br /><br />The poetry of the lyrics of the Avett Brothers played a good part in this novel. They aren't just words to read and then quickly move on to the main plot. They are words that have to simmer in your conscience, percolating until the meaning seeps into your heart, finding residence that resonates with you on a deeper level. I just really loved the inclusion of these lyrics in the novel. It is a richer novel for having them in it.<br /><br />Hoover does an amazing job of really portraying the struggle that Lake goes through as she realizes that she has fallen in love with Will. As a reader I could feel her desire warring with her head as she tried to find a way to make this situation work. I could feel her frustration. I could feel her moving through the stages of grief. The writing was very well done, keeping me turning pages until I could find a resolution that satisfied me.<br /><br />So am I satisfied? Yes! And no. I love the ending of this novel. It was what I wanted to find, even though it occurred in a way I didn't expect. But I was not satisfied to be done with Will and Lake's story. I wanted more. I want to re-enter the world of Slam poetry that displays the emotions of the writers in such a raw and real way. Hurray that there is a second novel in this series! I downloaded it right away so that I can continue their story. This was a wonderful discovery for me as a reader. Five stars!times? That's the first question.

B006BZ8WAI|5.0|Best album since Follow the Leader. Not a single bad song on whole album. A must have for any fan.
0345803485|5.0|I am a lover of all type of books but this series has really captured my interest. It is truely indulgent and maybe too sexually intense for some readers but I love the characters, flaws and all. It has humor, depth and of course heat.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I love Tina Fey! she is adorable and far from your average saturday night clowns.  She has written a very good book.  I have laughed on some parts but i doozed off on plenty.

0439023491|5.0|This bit of fiction is an interesting exploration of post traumatic stress disorder in a fictional environment.  It is obvious that everyone who survives the games are damaged goods including the heroine of the book.  The author explores the trauma in an interesting and emotionally devastating manner.  This exploration raises the book above the normal run of fiction to very interesting literature.
0061726834|4.0|I picked this book up because it seemed like it would be interesting. A world where love is viewed as a disease that has to be cured is ample ground for a wonderful story. I was hesitant though, because, even though this story focuses on the prevention of love, it revolves around a romance. I worried that the romance would be overly cheesy, or it wouldn't be developed enough. However, that wasn't the case.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver weaves a web of complexity, tangled lies and drawing you farther and farther into the story. The first few chapters were a little slow but it was needed so that you can understand each of the characters, the world, and how they think.<br /><br />The one thing I liked the most was the quotes at the beginning of each chapter.  These quotes - from the Delirium world's history books, to science books, all the way to children's rhymes - allowed me to get a glimpse into the beliefs that dominated this city. I loved reading about the stages of the disease and how the fourth stage was death. It was completely believable because people have done anything for love, from starting wars - Troy anyone? - to committing suicide - Romeo and Juliet. Love does make people act differently. There is truth to the concept that people will do just about anything for love. Just as there is truth that love hurts, tremendously.<br /><br />I do think there should have been a little more development about what incident actually sparked the mandatory cure because I didn't really feel the urgency to hide Lena's romance. I knew they would get in trouble and be forced to undergo the surgery, but I didn't really get a strong sense of the severity. Not until the end that is. Oliver ends the book on a cliffhanger which annoys me because I'm number 18 on the waitlist for the sequel. I want to know what happens next. And I want to know now!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book because it was on the book club list for Elvis Duran and Morning Show and I asked a friend how the book was and she loved the whole series.  We have similar taste in books so i decided to get the sample for my kindle.  as soon as i finished the sample i downloaded the book because i was hooked.  this book kept me going until the end, it was so suspenseful and easy to follow.  I have also read the second book and am looking forward to the third.  i def recommend this book to people of all ages (it's not inappropriate at all for the younger teenagers).
B003L16FAE|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers.  This blu ray edition is well done ONCE past the Ken doll beginning.<br /><br />Arnold and Carl both look like perfect Ken dolls in the beginning of the film, but during the helicopter ride into the jungle the blu ray becomes real pops with depth, sound and color.  The jungle scenes are really outstanding.<br /><br />Predator is a classic and for the price totally worth adding to your collection.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book was a true breath of fresh air! It was as fun and as sweet as many books can hope to get. Not only was the plot simple, but crazy, too. This book did not need any paranormal romance or unrealistic twists and turns. All it needed was a silly and sweet protagonist and a handsome and cool male lead.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella has written books that will stay in your heart. Her latest book is just truly lovely in every way.<br />If you want to read a book that has you laughing and smiling, a book that is full of fun surprises, a book that has you falling in love with the characters more and more (through amazing character development), a book that has a fun and fresh plot, a book that you won't be able to put down, and a book that is a truly adoring romance, you should read this one! It is just soooo great!<br /><br />When Poppy Wyatt looses the precious ring her fiance, Magnus, gave her, she is devastated and, for lack of better a word, freaking out. Her only hope is her phone, because she has passed the number out to everyone working in the hotel (where she lost it during an unexpected fire drill) in hopes that someone may find it. Unfortunately for Poppy, her phone is snatched right out of her hands and she is left in dismay. As luck would have it, though, she finds a phone in a trash bin. Well, as Poppy would say \\"If it's in a bin it's public property.\\" She takes the phone only to find out that it belongs to the PA (who quit and dumped the phone without a care) of Sam Roxton who is a handsome businessman. Poppy needs the phone to find her engagement ring, but Sam needs the phone that belongs to his company because everyone who does business with him sends it to his PA's phone (that Poppy now says is hers!). Now if that wasn't enough of trouble for Poppy, now she has to hide her engagement finger from her fiance's obnoxious educated parents who Poppy can't seem to impress. The story gets even more ridiculously fun as Poppy begins to read all of Sam's e-mails. But little does Poppy know that a few texts and e-mails can't be all there is to a person, and surely there is still a lot more she has to learn about not only Sam, but everyone she knows before she can go ahead and get married.<br /><br />This book is a joy to read. You will not be disappointed!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a good game although it makes you do a review. get tthis game. it is kinda hhard to figure out at first though
B0074YVW1G|5.0|As an absolute, self- confessed introvert, I have been waiting for a book like this my whole life. Susan beautifully and convincingly researches, then backs- up her arguments and subject matter in the quest to explain and understand who introverts are. Finally we are seen as wonderfully relevant in the way that we should be, introversion is not a social disease, so many of us are high achievers with specialist knowledge. Bravo Susan!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Entertaining book. It feels like I was reading a Liz Lemon monologue. Some parts were a little dry, but overall it is a fun read. Especially if you grew up in the 80's.
B007IQX1G4|2.0|Yes this lady is physco, and you are trying to figure out what she is really trying to achieve.  It was funny, and odd at the same time.  Probably a waist of time.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I enjoyed these 3 books, yes there is alot of kinky descriptive scenes but please remember, we are reading \\"fiction\\".  The plot of the books were well thought out and the story did flow very well together.  The characters were well developed and interacted together well.  I have and will recommended them to others with the disclaimer they are pretty kinky and graphic.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|i liked their debut album, \\"Everything All the Time,\\" though thought they sounded a lot of My Morning Jacket (at least before their last two mediocre albums). A solid southern Rock band. They've since lost that arc, especially when it comes to the lyrics. I've listened to this album several times, thinking it might be a grower, but that is just not the case.  There are too many great bands out there to spend time listening to one that is just okay.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I knew about this book in a site that talks about Paris an so. I don't have children and i even don't want then, but i'm enchanted with<br />french education always i'm in Paris, and so i decided to purchase the book to see what about it was.<br />And what a surprise! Lots of secrets about good education were revealed in a delightful prose! It's an indispensable book for everyone<br />who wants to know how to create a civilized country!

B007V2UGPE|5.0|a good time sink. not complex but not just open and forget. moderately difficult at certain points. runs well on a fire with little to no lag.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Great video with a 3rd version with alternate ending. You will need a code to access it. 82997 to access the alternate ending version. Also be prepare to wait 2-5 minutes for disc to load. I was on the verge of calling customer assistance when it finally loaded. Just be patient and you will be rewarded. Great pic quality and the new audio is good too. We prefer the Dolby True MAster HD version to the DTS-HD MA version. Very crisp and it will give your sub a good workout. Picture quality is fantastic for an older film. Best $5.50 I have ever spent.

B0069GRIHW|1.0|i had thought the 2nd, bonus CD the raison d'etre of the re-release of L A Woman. (the disc is an offering wonderfully strange, eerily so.) until, that is, i discovered on the www news of some accompanying celebration to the enterprise. it would seem that there is/was a 41st anniversary 'party' complete w/ video filmed in venice, CA. excuse me, \\"Venice\\"? what the video shows bears little to no resemblance to Jim Morrison's Venice. (i write as an erstwhile citizen of Venice pre-gentrification--albeit short-term and post Jim's residency.) to include Mr Morrison in this doors celebration then, i think that additional scenes would need to be added, perhaps super-8 slides of Venice in the days of the oil fields. Days, too, of the original Venice beats--the painters & poets.<br /><br />so, yes, although 5 stars for the music's re-release, 1 star for the package deal.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a cool game. I spend hours playing it. I used to play frontierville on db but when my Pc crashed I couldn't play it anymore so this is a close game to that
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was extremly late even reading the first book.  I saw The Hunger Games movie and really wanted to see what the book had to offer.  Once I finished the first book I had to read the second.  I have to say I was not disappointed in any way.  I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the whole book.  The ending to the book was epic.  It's a must read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a good game I really like it its got good tasks and its good for burning time and for kids
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I'm not sure what the rationale was for the marketing strategy that Disney used to promote this film.  Did they assume when titling the movie, for example, that 'John Carter' would be a good name for the film because of built in name recognition on the part of the audience? Why did they think that showing a bleak, 10 minute long trailer that barely suggested the sci-fi elements in the story was a good idea?  Who knows.<br /><br />All I know is that my wife and I enjoyed the movie, and found it both enjoyable and entertaining - enough so that we went and saw it again in the theater.  We've also found that other people who have actually seen it have liked it too.<br /><br />I'm not sure that it's fair to describe 'John Carter' as the best movie that ever was, but it's pretty good and pretty enjoyable.  It certainly has more depth to it that many a popular film, and is a good ride.  It's made me pick up Edgar Rice Burroughs' books again, which I'm thoroughly enjoying.<br /><br />If you like sci-fi at all, give this movie a shot.  I'm betting you'll like it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A very fun and addictive game. You can basically play this game forever. There is always something new to do!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|um I like how you can adopt people and like make baby's and things so I also like the movie its funny
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I acknowledge that this movie isn't perfect, but it does offer a lot to think about.  Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's characters are thrown together and torn apart, all according to a divine master plan.  Can this master plan be altered?  The characters jump through literal hoops to be together despite supernatural forces contriving one scheme after another to keep them separated.<br /><br />According to this movie, free will is an illusion.  Keep in mind that so many belief systems are based on the premise of free will.  Yet while the Adjustment Bureau won't let us choose our life partner, we are free to decide which brand of toothpaste we want.  I had to laugh and can completely relate to this theme.  So many times I've felt like I do not have complete free will.  There have been times when words I hadn't even thought popped out of my mouth, as though the words were foisted by a ventriloquist.  Another time I felt supernaturally manhandled when I momentarily lost control of my balance and equilibrium (medically, postural hypotension, though it felt more like untoward supernatural possession).  I've also had two chemical imbalances when I was not myself for a period of time and do not know the extent of \\"free will\\" that I experienced during those times.<br /><br />I personally am confused about the whole \\"free will\\" concept and have come to the conclusion that we have \\"limited\\" free will.  It's as though we are to a certain degree puppets being puppeteered by a master puppeteer, a.k.a. the \\"Adjustment Bureau.\\"

With the success of her other series; The Chosen, it's no wonder that this well written and easy to read tale has sparked immediate attention.<br /><br />Swank creates mystery and romance effortlessly, leaving a clear message to the reader.  \\"Life is short so you have to start living it.\\"<br /><br />Rose Gardner is \\"good girl\\".  She still lives at home with her mother, she's never been late to work, and she's never even had a boyfriend or kissed a boy.  It's not that she's ugly or that she has a terrible personality.  It's because she's different.<br /><br />Rose is \\"gifted\\" with THE SIGHT and has \\"visions\\".  Usually they're of silly little things.  Things like, your daughter sneaking out at night to see her boyfriend, or your dog is going to escape under the fence in your backyard. Nothing of great importance, but that all changes when she meets Daniel Crocker and sees her own future.  When she sees her own death.<br /><br />Before Rose knows what hit her, she is thrown in the middle of a police investigation full of murder and mayhem and she doesn't even know it.  It seems there is no one on her side as everything around her seems to fall apart.  No one that is except the handsome new neighbor Joe McAllister.<br /><br />With twists and turns abound, Twenty-Eight and a half wishes will leave you wanting the Twenty-Ninth wish.......The next book in the series.<br /><br />5 of 5 stars<br />Available @ Amazon
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this app, it is super fun without a doubt and runs smoothly on my kindle fire. If this game had a price on it it would be worth buying. I am shocked at how much I had fun with it at the very start of the game.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|As an avid Harry Potter fan (of both the movies and the books) \\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" is decidedly darker than its predecessors (let's face it---a lot of dark things are going on with Voldemort having the wizarding community in a stranglehold and Harry and Dumbledore trying desperately to find out what makes the Dark Lord tick) but it is an amazing piece of cinematography.  I tire of individuals claiming a movie is not as well as a book-in this case, the movie would be roughly 10 hours long (although I would probably be one who would happily sit through a 10-hour Harry Potter flick).  My only dislikes are simply a matter of what I envisioned when I read the book-the young Voldemort seen in the pensieve did not meet my mental pic (I had him looking like John F Kennedy Jr. or at least John Mayer) and I felt Snape should have been more involved in the movie instead of merely being on the outskirts until the very end.  I love Alan Rickman's Snape and can't get enough of him.  Other than that, the movie is suitably photographed in dark and ominous tones and the acting is wonderful (I love Ron's girlfriend Lavendar Brown).
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|overall fun game I enjoy it ~ although I wish I can just play A game I don't have to keep spending<br />money on to level up
B00005JLEU|5.0|I actually bought this for my 13-yr-old sister, but we both enjoy it.  I love the hand-drawn animation, and the story, to me, is a pleasing mix of fantasy/mythology in a real-world context.  It's a little reminiscent of the Narnia series, in that respect.<br /><br />As I tell anyone in terms of books or movies, borrow before you buy.  But if you're a fan of Hayao Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli, just go ahead and buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is the most fun game in the universe.great for wasting time or waiting for something to finish finishing Its things
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This one will make you want to get out your computer games from the 1980s. The plot zings along pretty well-all in all, a fun read.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|game is fun for kids, my grandkids like it not to hard for them, but still challenging for adults also
B00632HWOG|3.0|This is not a well behaved app. If you enjoy multiple notifications you might enjoy this app.  I was getting two notifications anytime I received email and it wouldn't allow me to turn off the notification sound.  I tried, but it would play my default sound even though the setting on the app was flagged for no sound. I finally uninstalled it just to get rid of the sound and multiple notifications.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|the most awsome game ever played i give it a 10000000000000000000000 out of 1 just amazing like i said the best game ever
B0050XFYNA|3.0|The story line is what first enticed me to this movie, and also the fact the I think the bearded guy is hot!<br />I really liked the cinematography, especially the beach scenes in Rio. But overall, the movie is a little slow and kind of<br />boring to be honest. I thought it spent a little too much time on their childhood. And the ending just seems so abrupt and almost<br />like the movie just cuts off. That part was disappointing. I'd say if you're into this type of indy, foreign flick, then it's worth a viewing<br />if you've got nothing else to do, but it's definitely just a rental. Don't purchase it like I did! LOL

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 1 was hard to get through for me, but 2 and 3 had more side stories and I'm glad I pushed through the first one.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book.  One of the best books I've read in quite some time.  A funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking read! From the summary, you would expect it to be a sad novel and while it does have its heartbreaking moments, it was a funny book to read. The writing is just wonderful and refreshing. I loved each and every character in this novel with the exception of one (you'll know who I'm talking about when you read this book). I could feel and understand each of their emotions to what life had thrown at them. One of my favorite quotes from this book is  'some infinities are bigger than other infinities'. Some events or people hold a bigger place in your heart and will stay with you forever more so than other events or people. Some people are with you for a short period of your life but they affect you in ways that change you and make you someone different. I just love that, and I am so glad that I came across this book.<br /><br />Like with Hazel's favorite book, I also want a sequel and want to ask the author what happens next - but I doubt we'll ever get those answers.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to everyone.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|There was a time Balducci was one of my favorite authors.  Now his books are half as good, if that.  Also, his publisher engages in illegal price fixing - a fact I hope they pay dearly for.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very touching story. Great acting! Amazon is easy to use from your tv. Skip the additional cost for HD since Amazon can not guarantee that you will get HD during the entire movie.
B0031RDVNM|5.0|F. Forsyth is always a good read. Research for his books is phenomenal and he has a knack of turning factual occurences into a great novel.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|once the game loaded it would not let me return to my kindle home menu.  I had to shut down the whole thing so I could get back to my home page. I will be removing it from my device!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|To me, this was the weakest of the 3 books.  It was good to have an \\"ending\\", but it didn't hold the suspence of the other 2 books.  The ending seemed just like that...\\"okay. let's end this trilogy any way we can.\\"
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game reminds me of the frontier game on facebook. it does give you plenty of missions to complete also. good game.

B00280LYIC|5.0|The Percy Jackson series is definately my favorite.  It has wonderful dialogue, descriptive writing, and great humor.  I love the Greek Mythology in it.  It is a fantastic way to tell old stories in a modern way.  Being the starter book for the series, I was very pleased with it.  The series only gets better as you continue on.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This is a good little app for keeping track of upcoming monthly bill payments that are due. Easy to input and access reminders. Has good alert properties.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, great to be able to take it on my Kindle! A thought-provoking roller coaster ride. The violence in the book is a lot for a child, though. It's a PG-13 book that I don't recommend for teens prone to nightmares. It WILL make you think about economic justice (income and wealth disparities), the appetite for violence in our society, the corrupt and corrupting nature of much of reality TV, the potential perversions of genetic science and the abuse of power. An easy, won't want to put it down, read, but by no means a light one.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I look the game but I'm stuck and cant finish. its a bit frustrating since everyone is saying it was a quick game.

1400052181|5.0|I had never heard the story of Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cells before reading this story. It was fascinating to learn about the science behind the use of the he-la cells,<br />and how they have stayed alive and are useful in medical research.  The other part of the story is the social and ethical issues of poor, African-Americans living in the<br />South, and how they were treated.  The cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks without her knowledge or permission and used for the benefit of millions of people while<br />her own motherless children lived very poor, difficult lives. The irony and injustice of this is incredible. Another side story was about Henrietta's daughter who lived in a<br />mental institution in the South in the 1950-60's and the deplorable conditions which she endured. I found many issues in this book shocking and disturbing, but I am<br />glad that the story is coming out. I hope that her grandchildren can benefit from this and have better lives than Henrietta and her children did.

Excellent characters, excitement, suspense, and much more. I laughed, cried, cringed, sweat and laughed some more!<br /><br />Abby has left behind a life that she never asked for. Known as Lucky 13 since she turned the age of 13 she has wanted nothing but normalcy and acceptance for herself, nothing to do with her well known father and nothing to do with the name that is NOT on her birth certificate. Abby and her best friend America go for a fresh start in college. Things are new and fresh and no one knows of her past or what she is running and hiding from. That is until her entire world is turned upside down and inside out by the campus hottie and player Travis.<br /><br />Travis is one hot, bad ass dude that just loves them and leaves them. He pays his way by engaging in fights that rake in enough cash for him to take care of his living expenses, college and more. Travis also holds his heart close and does not open up to anyone. That is until he sees Abby at one of his fights and is enraptured by her completely.<br /><br />Together Abby and Travis ride an emotional roller coaster that seems to never end. Will it ever come to a stop for them or will everything be a struggle between the two stubborn friends. It's a fun emotional trip in the lives of Abby and Travis :)
0307949486|5.0|This is the first mystery novel I have read and thoroughly enjoyed it. I stayed up late each night reading it and enjoyed it so much that the day I finished it I went to the bookstore to buy the second book in the series. The characters were intriguing, the plot was interesting, the dialog flowed well and the writing was simple enough to knock out pages whenever you have a free moment. Though it's not a literary achievement (in the prose sense), the book affected me and is thought provoking insofar as its most difficult parts to read are based on crimes that happen frequently throughout the world and we, for the most part, choose to ignore them because they are at a minimum uncomfortable to accept.  As for the most difficult parts to read....<br /><br />If you don't do well with violence (specifically sexual abuse), then you'll likely have a difficult time with this book. Many will find it gratuitously violent and at first I felt the violence to be unnecessarily detailed; however, by the end of the book I felt it was necessary to illustrate the severity of the horrors. These crimes are perpetrated by absolute evil (both in this book and in real life). Without the detailed violence most readers won't feel the significance of these actions as we frequently mute uncomfortable thoughts in our minds to protect ourselves (unless, as in this book, we are forced to think about it/visualize it). However, in doing so I feel we do an injustice to the victims. Additionally, there's a risk the reader could sympathize with the antagonist(s) and I believe neither the antagonist(s) nor anyone like the antagonist(s) deserves an ounce of sympathy. As a result, I am in full support of this detailed violence as it has given me a new found understanding of what victims must deal with and how evil perpetrators of crimes like these truly are.<br /><br />The disturbing detail in which certain scenes of this book are written will cause many to not read it; however, it helps turns this book from simply a mystery into a haunting piece of work. It is because of this impact that I am giving it 5 stars.from simply a mystery into a haunting piece of work. It is because of this impact that I am giving it 5 stars.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|For folks who have neither read the book nor seen the miniseries, I feel this adaptation failed to spell things out that were immediately clear in the miniseries: things like the central premise (which is Operation Testify, never even named in the film), which was spelled out right away in the miniseries, along with the tinker, tailor code words and their meaning and Jim Prideaux's mission; the meaning of \\"Circus\\"; what/who Karla is; Witchcraft and Merlin; and so on and so forth that would have made the film much more watchable for the novice. And it's not for lack of time that these things aren't spelled out: a lot of meaningless and incongruous new stuff is added in that is not in the book and therefore unnecessary.<br /><br />Yes, the book is mucked about with but it's not all to ill effect: Tom Hardy gives a delicious performance and is disarmingly likeable as Ricky Tarr. Unfortunately, the time spent here on Tarr is taken away from getting to know the four suspects, and even the mole doesn't get enough airtime, unlike in the miniseries, where everyone is explored. I also missed seeing much of the Peter Gwillem character, who is quite yummy in the miniseries and has a lot of screentime therein, but Benedict Cumberbatch as Gwillem here is hardly seen, plus there's a homosexual plotline tagged onto him that is needless but not entirely out of place.<br /><br />I'm of two or three minds about Gary Oldman as Smiley. Oldman's leathery expressionless face hardly moves, especially not behind those immense glasses which he does not remove even when swimming. So even though Oldman gives a presumably authentic reading of the character, he's much less expressive than Alec Guinness -- who though more cheerful and perhaps less stolid than LeCarre wrote him, is often more appealing to watch because his face actually moves and his eyes twinkle.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this movie has merit on its own, and is certainly worth watching. I think it could be a bit of a puzzle for newcomers, especially if they do not pay attention, but some folks love being puzzled like that so this can work for some people. Do check it out if you have the inclination -- for instance, it's just $3.99 to \\"rent\\" it for a 48-hour viewing on Amazon Instant. That's how I watched it and it was totally worth it. It's worth it even if you are just the least bit curious and/or want to compare it to the book or miniseries.for newcomers, especially if they do not pay attention, but some folks love being puzzled like that so this can work for some people.

0307949508|4.0|The prologue is so disturbing and haunting that you get locked into the book immediately (though I suppose you actually get locked into the book by reading and appreciating The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). The prologue hints that the book may be as disturbing as Dragon; however, it doesn't end up being anywhere near that level.<br /><br />What most readers will probably appreciate is that the book mostly deals with Lisbeth Salander. Larsson does a good job of following present day Salander and presenting views into her background with an ongoing murder mystery/investigation. Though the book as a whole is entertaining, I found the first half to be mediocre, yet flowed quickly enough that it didn't feel like it dragged on and kept me curious about what was going to happen next, while I found the second half to flow very quickly and kept me glued to the pages.<br /><br />I did not, however, find this book nearly as engaging, fascinating, disturbing or upsetting as I found the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It's certainly an entertaining, fast-paced read that by itself I'd probably give 3 stars, but since it's the continuation of Dragon and gives more insight into and background about Salander (something I kept wanting while reading the first book), I'll bump it up to 3.5 or 4 stars.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I believe that due to the complexity and sheer numbers of characters created by the author that it was impossible to tie this series up with anything resembling a conclusion. I was disappointed with the way Mr. Martin ended the series. Up until the ending of the A Dance with Dragons I was totally involved with his world, and I don't want to take anything away from the author, he has written a true epic, but it became so complex that I don't know if there is any way to neatly and satisfactorally bring it to an end. I had hoped for more.

B006Z7Z3R2|3.0|I find myself a bit torn in my opinion of The Innkeepers.  There's a lot to enjoy but there's also a fair amount to dislike about the film.  Director Ti West's story about an aging New England Inn in its final week of operation has a tone unlike most horror films.  There are a lot of elements that don't seem on the surface like they would mix together well, but the enjoyable cast makes the film eminently watchable.<br /><br />Claire (Paxton) and Luke (Healey) are a couple of twenty-something loafers who work at the Yankee Pedlar, a New England inn that is over a hundred years old.  With the owner on vacation, Claire and Luke are the only employees still working at the near-empty inn during its final week of operation.  With few guests to attend, and having to work 12 hour shifts the pair do what they can to amuse themselves and pass the time.  Fancying themselves amateur ghost hunters, they've setup a website to explore the legend of the Yankee Pedlar which is allegedly haunted by the spirit of a Madeline O'Malley, a woman who hung herself on her wedding day when her fianc&eacute; jilted her.<br /><br />As mentioned, The Innkeepers has a strange vibe to it.  The early part of the film has a good deal of comedy as the pair of Luke and Claire engage in various pursuits just to get through the day including drinking beer at the front counter, telling ghost stories to the young son of an annoying guest, just to get under her skin, and dealing with the wacky counterperson at the nearby coffee shop.  This, along with a slow pace doesn't fit with what you expect out of a horror film.  The tone changes abruptly with the arrival of Leanne Reese-Jones (McGillis) a former actress turned psychic.<br /><br />As Claire explores the inn at night with recording equipment, looking to pickup some EVP (electronic voice phenomena) she encounters voices whispering within the walls and the playing of a piano in the front lobby.  A terrified Claire runs to Leanne for help.  The psychic uses her ability to channel the spirits in the inn and warns Claire to stay clear of the basement.  The arrival of an elderly guest who wants to spend one last night in the honeymoon suite completes the transition from slacker comedy to full-on horror culminating with Claire's terrifying encounter with the inn's spirits.<br /><br />I suppose it depends on your outlook as to whether The Innkeeper's faults can be overlooked due to its positives or if it's positives are neutralized by the faults.  West's slow burn of a film develops the characters of Claire and Luke to the point where you can certainly relate to them.  The pair apparently have no prospects once the inn closes.  Claire's redoubtable spunkiness drives much of the action.  Last seen in the horrible film \\"Shark Night\\", Paxton appears here, sans tiny bikini and without make-up in a huge contrast from that film. There's a brilliantly funny scene as she is trying to open a dumpster lid with one hand and toss in a leaky plastic trash bag for the other...that is just a little too heavy for her to lift with a single hand and avoid whatever noxious contents are spilling out of the bag.  The dialog sparkles with a casual wit.  You feel like you're eavesdropping on a couple of real people when they are talking.<br /><br />But The Innkeepers has a major Achilles heel.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the film's conclusion; so many, in fact, that I found myself re-watching scenes to see if I missed the \\"Shamalayan\\" moment.  What did Leanne really see when she channeled the spirits?  And what was with her strange staring out of her room's window at the end?  For all of the development of the two leads, West is woefully short on any exposition when it comes to the spirits.  What are their motivations?  Why are they after Claire?  Why was it that Leanne's arrival seemed to have triggered the spirit's activity?  These issues prevent The Innkeepers from having the clean ending that most viewers desire.  But maybethat's what West was going for all along.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Extras<br /><br />Two Audio commentaries: One with Writer/director/editor Ti West, producers Peter Phok & Larry Fessenden, and second unit director/sound designer Graham Reznick; and the second with Ti West and stars Sara Paxton & Pat Healy.<br /><br />Behinds the Scenes Featurettewhat West was going for all along.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Extras<br /><br />Two Audio commentaries: One with Writer/director/editor Ti West, producers Peter Phok & Larry Fessenden, and second unit director/sound designer Graham Reznick; and the second with Ti West and stars Sara Paxton & Pat Healy.<br /><br />Behinds the Scenes Featurette

B0073U2F2Q|2.0|The Darkest Hour offers a new take on the alien invasion film with mixed results.  This American-Russian co-production finds two software developers Ben (Minghella) and Sean (Hirsch) traveling to Moscow where they hope to sell their new social networking app to a group of Russian investors.  However when they arrive at the meeting they find that their Swedish partner Skyler has stolen their idea and has already made a deal with the Russians.  Seeking to drown their sorrows they head to a nightclub where they meet a couple of women: Natalie, an American and her Australian friend Anne.<br /><br />The city suffers a total blackout and as the curious partiers head outside they see hundreds of wispy, glowing lights floating down from the sky.  Then lights turn out to he a hostile race of aliens who can disintegrate a person with a mere touch, leaving behind only a pile of ash.  The four, along with backstabbing business partner Skyler take refuge in a basement storeroom where they remain for a full day until its safe to venture out.  However they find the city almost completely devoid of any life with ashes strewn about.  Keeping an eye out for the near-invisible aliens, the group somehow must try to survive and make it out of Moscow.<br /><br />The aliens in The Darkest Hour are certainly original.  The glowing balls are mere shields protecting their bio-mechanical forms but this is about as far as the film goes with original ideas.  In the end it falls back on plot contrivances that have been used in every alien invasion film from War of the Worlds to Independence Day, often blatantly ripping off both of those films.  There's even the Deus Ex Machina moment when they figure out how to kill the aliens. The film is muddled with confusing and contrasting uses of the aliens powers.  Ben and Sean turn out to be typical film characters who are much smarter than anyone should be about an alien life form they've never encountered. After hiding behind a glass display in a clothing store, they determine that the aliens \\"see\\" using a kind of radar that detects a human's electro magnetic signature.  I mean, that exactly what I would have thought, too.<br /><br />Yet it begs the question that if glass somehow blocks this ability then why aren't the people who were in their cars safe at the time of the attack.  As they explore the city they encounter an electrician who has covered the floors and walls of his apartment in metal grates which can somehow keep the aliens out.  Later however, we learn that they are mining our planets metals which they feed on.  So is metal good or bad for the aliens?  I still have no idea.<br /><br />The film is essentially the same scene played over and over...move to a new place, explore it, encounter aliens, and run.  At no point does Director Chris Gorak stop long enough to offer anything remotely resembling character development.  I mean what was the point to having the Swedish partner steal their idea only to turn around and have them all act like nothing happened.  Sure, an alien invasion might tend to make you forget the rest of your problems but why toss that sub-plot in there anyway?<br /><br />I mean it gets to the point when you actually start rooting for the aliens.  At least a little energy is infused in the last third of the film when they meet a gung-ho group of Russian soldiers who've found a way to hurt the aliens.  By this time though the film seems far longer than its 90 minute runtime.  There was a great idea here for a new and original type of alien but the filmmakers didn't seem to know what to do with it.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Extras:<br /><br />Survivors (8:09) - This is a short film sequel which shows groups of survivors coordinating a counter-attack against the aliens<br /><br />Visualizing an Invasion (12:09) - Behind the scenes look at the making of the film from the concept of the aliens to special effects<br /><br />Deleted Scenes with Director Commentary (4:48)<br /><br />Audio Commentary with Director Chris Gorakry with Director Chris Gorak
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series.  Book 1 and 2 kept me on the edge for the whole duration.  I feel that book three was a little rushed though.  With all that happened in book three it seems that too many loose ends were tied together at once without enough explanation.  But overall I really enjoyed the series.

0062112430|5.0|Lena Haloway has her procedure in 95 days. She's anxious to get the procedure. But Lena does the impossible, to fall in love with a guy named Alex.<br /><br />It's a page turner, long story short. Well, let's say that I bought this book on a Saturday on the afternoon, and finished it Monday night. It was definitely intense, fun, surprising, and romantic! I can't wait to read the second book in the Delirium series, Pandemonium! And the final book, Requiem, will come out someday in 2013! Excited!<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's writing, it's beautiful! If I had to choose someone to help me write a book, i'd choose her!
B0071MV540|3.0|Pretty funny movie. No problems streaming. overall i am very satisfied with this purchase. It was a rented streaming movie
B000JQU4TW|3.0|The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking.  However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece.  Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader.  Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain.  I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book.  I simply didn't care about any of their fates.  Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the reading plans, the choice if devotionals. You are also able to read any chapter, verse or passages when ever you want. This makes it easy to get that desperately needed daily dose of our Lord in the crazy world we live in. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS
B00756GKBA|3.0|Madonna is the queen of pop. Period. It's not even debatable. Since Madonna's presence on the pop chart in 1983, she has been the most influential female dance-oriented pop artist, by far.  Not just her music, but her image. She set the standard for future dance-pop stars, from Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul in the past, to Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Rihanna and (of course) Lady GaGa today. I, like many others, was impressed by Madonna's Super Bowl performance.<br /><br />Madonna's 12th album, \\"MDNA\\", won't be as successful as the latest releases by some of her younger counterparts. It won't produce any singles as successful as, say, \\"Born This Way\\", \\"We Found Love\\", and \\"Part of Me\\".  And while I respect Madonna A LOT, let's be honest here - those songs are catchier and fresher than \\"Give Me All You Luvin'\\". But here's another piece of honesty - Madonna's best work of the past - I'm thinking \\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Cherish\\", \\"Material Girl\\" - is better than the typical work of her younger counterparts.<br /><br />So if Madonna's latest album isn't as good as the latest by Lady GaGa and other newbies, or her own older work, then where does this leave it?  Well, it's a mixed bag.  The entire album is made up of tracks that combine electronic and pop music - a formula that she always does competently.  There's not much here that's unpleasant.  There's a couple of stand-out tracks - upbeat ones like \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", \\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Turn Up The Radio\\", and \\"Some Girls\\", as well as the slower \\"Falling Free\\" and \\"Masterpiece\\". Yet, I am not `wow'-ed by any of these tracks, even though they're the best on the album.  Like her 1998 album \\"Ray of Light\\", the majority of the album is produced by William Orbit. That album was a masterpiece, while this one isn't.<br /><br />If you're a Madonna fan, you may or may not be satisfied with the album. Unless you are a fan, then skip it.

0385534639|1.0|I have never reviewed a book publicly before, but my frustration with The Night Circus prompted me to do so.  I am only a casual reader and have no real credentials as a reviewer, other than that.  I will make general comments and nothing here will be a spoiler for others who choose to read the book.  I really anticipated reading this book;  I love circuses, I love magic, and I love the cover artwork (sorry, I'm being a little shallow there).  However, I never was able to get involved in anything about the story and I plodded along, hoping it would grab me at some point.  Sadly, it never did, and beginning about 2/3 of the way through, I forced myself to the end.  I generally had a \\"who cares\\" attitude about the characters and plot, and that lasted right to the last word.  As a matter of fact, it was resolved and I didn't even realize it.  Further, while I am not a grammar expert, I know the difference between phrases and real sentences;  unfortunately, neither the writer nor the editors did.  I might have forgiven this if there was something stylistic that added to the work, but it was more distracting than anything else and I would sometimes stop reading and try to analyze the sentence structures.  I realize, of course, that reading is \\"different strokes for different folks\\", but this was just a big zero for me.  I am happy to be done with it and on to something else.  A favorable point from my reading, though, is thinking that this would make an excellent movie, with enough plot to move it along, letting the real star be the effects.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am on day 9 of this workout and i can already feel a difference in my body. I have lost a few lbs and have a lot more energy. The only thing I dislike is that Im very, very bored with it. I dont like the 10 days of level 1, 10 days of level 2 and 10 days of level 3. I think I will alternate level 2 and 3 just because im so bored, I know exactly what she is going to say, the same music. boring! I could do it without watching it.<br /><br />This isnt an easy work out. Its pretty tough. Im not in horrible shape but not in the best either and I am still exhausted after the workouts and still have a hard time getting through the cardio. I could hardly walk after day 2 which I like because I feel like its working.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After hearing all the controversy regarding this book, I was intrigued! I now understand the controversy; however, I loved the book! The writing style is very engaging and a definite page-turner! Upon finishing the book, I immediately bought the 2nd book of the trilogy!

B004WCTLNY|5.0|The premise is kind of hard to understand until the end but the movie is fantastic!!! It's a sci-fi romance, but the reveal is so worth the mild confusion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very nice game to play. It reminds me of Tiny Village. building places for people to live.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Number one: I love to read. Number two: Everyone at work kept talking about this set of books and how interesting it was. I read the first chapter and knew that it was going to be one of those books I would not be able to put down until I finished it! I highly enjoyed the book and would recommend all three books to anyone.
B00009NHC5|5.0|The world loves Audrey Hepburn, but I find this film to be her at her strongest -- take charge moments abound and surprises.  I don't know what I can say that others haven't but this is a wonderful film and very empowering in many ways.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever made. It may be the worst movie ever created. Bad, real bad and boring. CHEESY.
B002UNMW7O|3.0|I liked the characters so much in the first film that it was difficult to get by the \\"dream scenes\\" and cowboy boot sporting female, but it was great the have the Billy Connoly character resolved and the hope of a three-quel with Willem Dafoe.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|Clever mix of A Perfect Circle and Tool. A must have on mp3. Love \\"Horizons\\" and \\"Telling Ghosts\\". Title track is also great. Maynard James Keenan wins again!!

B006VA57CY|5.0|I had a free trial to try out Prime.  I caught up with the series Downton Abbey season one and two, and looking forward to season three.  The instant watch was very easy to navigate, and the picture was very clear.  So far my dealings with Amazon in many departments has been problem free, and when I first started I somehow I over ordered and that was taken care of with great customer service.  I have nothing bad to say about my dealings with Amazon.
0545265355|5.0|These books were so good I couldn't put them down.  I contemplated taking off work to finish them, but instead I just read them AT work :)  so addicting. LOVE
B001993Y2C|4.0|The top of this product was pushed way down so that one of the edges of the box split open. From what I've heard this is pretty useless packaging anyways (I bought some slim slipcases to hold the discs in), but it makes me wonder if the product was this way before they shipped it or if it was damaged in the shipping process. Either way a very dissatisfied customer.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|This movie was not very scary. The ending is good, however some people did not like it, they only loved it. Carries the potential to be mildly upsetting.
B000002L7R|4.0|If you're Prince, you do so in the most unpredictable of ways. Almost nothing on this album sounds as if it could have fit in comfortably on its predecessor. This was an incredibly bold move. Beginning with the '80s, it was almost unheard of for a pop artist to follow up a blockbuster album only a mere ten months later. Look at 1984's other major hit albums. Madonna took nearly two years to follow up 1984's \\"Like a Virgin.\\" Springsteen waited three years to release a new studio album after \\"Born in the USA.\\" Two years for Van Halen to follow up \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />Why is that significant? To put it into context, \\"Purple Rain\\" spent 24 consecutive weeks at number one on Billboard's album chart. It was only three months after \\"Purple Rain\\" relinquished it's stranglehold on the top spot that \\"Around the World\\" was released. The then-new album was seen by many as a disappointment commercially because it \\"only\\" spent three weeks at number one, and \\"only\\" sold three million or so copies.<br /><br />Not that any of that really matters more than a quarter of a century later. The most casual fans only know \\"Raspberry Beret\\" and \\"Pop Life,\\" but there's much more to this album. \\"Tamborine\\" is one of the most insanely funky creations he ever released. \\"America\\" - a near miss on the Top 40 singles chart - was a surprisingly right-leaning political anthem (maybe not so surprising, actually, considering earlier tunes like \\"Ronnie Talk to Russia\\" and \\"Free\\"). \\"Paisley Park,\\" lest anyone think Prince was a hardliner, asks \\"Whoever said that elephants were stronger than mules?\\" Despite a too-long, meandering intro, \\"Condition of the Heart\\" is a lovely ballad with idiosyncratic lyrics (\\"There was a woman from the ghetto/Who made funny faces/Just like Clara Bow\\").<br /><br />The only real mistep comes in the form of \\"The Ladder,\\" a quasi-spritual snoozer. \\"Temptation\\" is better, though it is far from classic Prince. The guitar playing is hot, Eddie M's sax introduces live horns into Prince's recorded work, and the confrontation with God is, well, kind of silly. Together these tracks comprise roughly one-third of the album's running time. The seven songs that came before them are all superior, so the album lands with thud rather than exploding with a climax (pretty much defined by \\"Purple Rain\\"). The last section of the album understandably leaves the listener with mixed feelings. But start it over again and soak up the greatness of the first two-thirds and you might come to agree with the notion that this is an underrated album.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Never was a fan of Parmamore growing up, never gave them a chance and thought they were just another TRL band. I have grown to love them after finally listening to this album from start to finish. I now put them in the same group as Blink 182(one of my favorite bands all time). Every song they put out is extremely catchy and an anthem of are youth. This album gets me so pumped up, I love it.
B000002L9B|5.0|I'm not sure that there is a more moving song in the Prince catalog than \\"Sometimes It Snows In April.\\" The lyrics and melody, not to mention the skeletal arrangement, all combine to make one of the man's overlooked masterpieces.<br /><br />This is an adventurous, daring, and complex album that has somehow faded from the landscape of great pop albums. Well, that's actually partly because it has never been remastered and reissued. Prince is one of the very few major artists who has yet to see even ONE of his albums reissued. He was still breathing rarefied air at the time of this album. Compared to recent albums like \\"20ten,\\" \\"MPLSound,\\" \\"Planet Earth,\\" or \\"3121,\\" this sounds like the work of an entirely different artist.<br /><br />\\"Kiss\\" is the most popular moments, credit for its arrangement goes to Mazarati, who re-worked Prince's acoustic demo into the work of funk genius we hear on the album. \\"Mountains\\" was a hit too, though only Prince fans know that - casual fans don't have that one on the compilations. \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\" was a failed single, which only proves that commercial success means nothing - this is one brilliantly executed song. \\"Girls & Boys\\" is another funk workout that perfectly capture's its author's horny narcissism with the simple line, \\"She had the cutest ass he'd ever seen/She did 2, they were meant 2 be.\\"<br /><br />Prince recorded the album's opening quartet of songs sequentially, sitting at his drum set and laying down the rhythm. All four songs in a row. Told the engineer to start rolling, and he launched into it, with the lyrics taped to the wall. He then built the tracks up from that point. This is according to Per Nilson in his meticulously researched and indispensible book \\"DMSR.\\" Anyway, that's artistic VISION.<br /><br />\\"Life Can Be So Nice\\" might be the most polarizing track on the album. But it's an amazingly dense, multi-layered production with some great, idiosyncratic lyrics, i.e. \\"No one plays the clarinet/The way youplay my heart.\\" The man doesn't write like that anymore.<br /><br />The very recently departed (01/26/2012) Clare Fischer arranged the string parts for these songs. They are breathtaking, lending a very distinct sound that expands on the richness of Prince's songs. Fischer did similarly great work on many other Prince recordings.<br /><br />\\"Parade\\" has been criticized for being tied in some ways to the characters in the film \\"Under the Cherry Moon.\\" Nonsense. The French overtones on songs like \\"Do U Lie?\\" and \\"Girls & Boys\\" only adds to the timelessness of the album. Yes, the character of Christopher Tracy is name-checked in the opening and closing tracks. So what? Does anyone complain that the Beatles sang about the fictional people Sgt. Pepper and Billy Shears? Even if the movie had not existed, the name Christopher Tracy doesn't render the songs incomprehensible or invalid in any way.<br /><br />The only way to improve this album would be to remastered it and add the following bonus tracks: \\"Alexa de Paris,\\" \\"Love or Money,\\" and the incredible extended mixes of \\"Kiss,\\" \\"Anotherlover,\\" and \\"Mountains.\\" Maybe someday. Until then, the album can be acquired inexpensively. If you haven't heard it and have read this far, you need it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good story line and fun game the kids enjoy it very much need a little more to do. thank you.
B00470XF9C|1.0|Even though the product is listed as being compatible in the Accessories Booklet that came with the Sony NEX-7 I recently purchased from Amazon, it's difficult to get the camera in and out of this case. I would not recommend it for any NEX-7 owner who needs to be able to quickly access their camera.

B005FPT51K|2.0|I've been using the iBaby monitor for over 4 months now. I think that this is a great piece of hardware that is limited by really bad software. Every time there is a software update, one issue gets fixed, and two new issues appear. This company needs to get their act together and fix this issues, some of which are really easy to fix. With the latest iPhone app update, the software crashes after about 5 minutes of operation. This is unacceptable because my child's life is at stake.
0670022705|5.0|A History of The World In 100 Objects is a very interesting and informative book.<br />It is loaded with a lot of history that can be easily remembered throu the 100 objects...
B007ORVC36|5.0|Don't be discouraged by the low ratings given by three of the four previous reviewers. Two had nothing to do with the show but with other issues. I have loved this character/dialogue driven series and am delighted with the opening episodes of the fifth season. Don Draper remains a fascinating character trying now to overcome his self-destructive tendencies. If you enjoyed the previous four seasons, chances are excellent that you will also appreciate the fifth season's opener.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|I really didn't know what to expect with this book. It was suggested for a bookclub and I'm not overly interested in flowers. I was pleasantly surprised. As a mum there was a lot to relate to in the book, it raised a lot of issues about how a baby and child is brought up, about foster care. And how lovely it is to see flowers for more than their look or scent or that they are a gift for someone; it has been a revelation to know they have specific meanings for the purposes of communication.<br /><br />This is a well written book that I will always remember fondly, and can confidently recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a great way to spend sometime focusing on a task to keep your mind off of other thoughts!<br />it is great it is free and you are not seeing ads.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. its very fun and I could play it all day! I would deffinatly recommend it to anyone because it al good. and this game kinda cracks me up because its like Mario!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Ok, Hollywood, do something smart and make a movie based on this series. Juliette could be played by Evangeline Lily. I've got an entire cast list in my head but I'll spare you...<br /><br />It would suffice to say that this series was great. If you want a compelling scifi story - look no further.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Please don't believe the other reviews!!! Just go to the options menu in the game and you can leave the game!!! This is an awesome game!! It is a lot of fun!!! I love it! It's also free, so why not play it!!??
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Almost exactly like Mario. Is that allowed? Anyway, it is entertaining nonetheless for the whole family.<br />I would recommend it for the family.

0670022950|3.0|This work, on which the author obviously spent a tremendous amount of energy and work, was for me a great disappointment.  Where I had hoped for a scholarly treatment, I found instead a polemic in which, as other readers have observed, whatever doesn't fit the thesis is ignored or underplayed.  For example, in his first chapter, which attempts to show us that ancient society was an unremitting bloodbath (one wonders how, in the midst of such violence, ancient societies achieved what they did--how could the Egyptians have built the pyramids if they were killing each other off at the rates Pinker projects), Pinker describes the Ten Commandments as the Jews' \\"great moral code that outlaws engraved images and coveting of livestock, but gives a pass to slavery, rape, torture, mutilation, and genocide of neighboring tribes.\\" (p. 7) This is so one-sided as to be shocking: no mention of the fact that the Ten Commandments outlawed murder, stealing, and adultery, required honoring one's parents, and prohibited bearing false witness--all provisions that, it would seem, were aimed at reducing violence.  But, since that doesn't fit Pinker's thesis, these aspects of the ancient biblical moral code are ignored.  Another weird problem: Pinker uses the Homeric epics and the Bible as reliable evidence of how life was lived in ancient societies, without ever questioning the assumption that they are accurate portrayals. Would one rely on \\"Lonesome Dove\\" for an accurate portrayal of life in the Old West?  No, one would seek out historical works on the period.  It is very interesting in this regard that Pinker uses Homer's poems rather than the ancient histories of, say, Alexander's conquests or Caesar's Gallic Wars.  As others have noted, Pinker asserts the unremitting violence of primitive man, without mentioning that this interpretation is very controversial and not at all generally accepted.  To turn to a more modern period, in arguing that the violence of World War II pales in comparison to past massacres--Pinker's point (itself controversial and not intuitively obvious to this reader) is that, since the population of the world was much less in the past, World War II is not as bad proportionately--he uses estimates of earlier casualties that are highly contested, but gives no real explanation that this is so.  For example, he puts the death toll from the An Lushan Revolt at 35 million, without making clear how debated that number is and why, in fact, there are those who say the death toll was far less.  As I read the book, I felt more and more let down by the lack of objectivity that I found.  And, in the end, what is the use of such a work, since the evidence relied upon is basically massaged to support the author's thesis?  I sincerely hope that what we have here is not a more modern version of Normal Angell's 1910 classic \\"The Great Illusion,\\" which argued that due to the integration of modern economies, war and militarism were becoming obsolete.  As we know, four years later World War I broke out.  (Prof. Pinker might say, of course, that Angell was correct, if for the wrong reasons, and that WWI and WWII were the last gasps of an older world.  Let's hope so.)  On a positive note: I must add to the above criticisms this note: when Professor Pinker was writing about what he knows best--human psychology and the way the human mind works--I found what he wrote helpful and genuinely worthwhile (which explains the three stars).rison to past massacres--Pinker's point (itself controversial and not intuitively obvious to this reader) is that, since the population of the world was much less in the past, World War II is not as bad proportionately--he uses estimates of earlier casualties that are highly contested, but gives no real explanation that this is so.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the original Oregon trail game and this one is even better. You pretty much just get to build your own little town in the middle of a forest. The only down side to this game is that your energy gets depleted very fast and to get more you have to buy some or wait an hour for it to refill. I don't really mind because I don't play it for more than 10 minutes at a time but for some people, this would be annoying. Also highly recommended is an oregon trail gameplay commentary by Penguinz0 on youtube. It is hilarious but just a warning - it does use some profanity. Overall great games from a very satisfying developer.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had heard of the book through a new friendship, desperate to talk to someone who has read it, I succumbed and bought book one and then two. Everyone including myself have not only enjoyed the book, but also experienced a rekindling in the bedroom. Take it for what it is and I was grateful I had a kindle to read it on the train, without everyone knowing what I am reading.<br /><br />I would say by mid book two I was tired of how beautiful he was and the tearing of ... Other than that it did pick up and I look forward to seeing what happens in book three.

B0054S6N04|5.0|I purchased the Kindle edition of this book because I have it in hard back and have read it so many times the spine was getting damage. I love this book
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the complete set of 3.  This trilogy is wonderful!  I had to go see the movie after reading it.  And buying the kindle version was SO great!  Buying my kindle from Amazon was truly a wonderful buy and SO SO easy to purchase and it loads the book in a matter of a few minutes!  I highly recommend it!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I love ice age and wanted to like this, but the fact that you have to completely shut down your KF in order to get out of it is unacceptable. btw, I read all the other reviews from people complaining of the same thing - I still downloaded it thinking that these reviews just had to be wrong. they are not, this must be fixed in order to make this game playable.
0670022411|5.0|A book not to be missed.  Entralling and captivating ... You will not be able to put this book down.  And it will have you eagerly anticipating what comes next.
0345803485|1.0|This is probably the worst writing I  have encountered ever. It reads like a middle-school girl's badly written fantasy. Ugh, it's hard to believe this is #1 on the NYT best seller list and that this is what \\"America\\" reads. A truly and completely depressing experience. Couldn't read beyond the first \\"erotic\\" sex scene. Nothing but lust, no feelings, emotions, thoughts -really really bad.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I first got the weather channel's app but when I saw this I was so happy I have this on all my laptops & computers. There is one pdroblem that I wish they would fix the map.

B0076NAWWA|5.0|It's difficult to truly comprehend a review for an album of this magnitude. Flying Colors is a band that fuses multiple musical personalities into one cohesive package. What we ultimately get in this album is a perfected and almost finely tuned machine running on all cylinders possible to warrant a constructed sound which feels like a mind trip down the multiple era's of the sound of rock. From ballads, to pop tunes, to heavier beats and progressive tempos, this is an album that accumulates everything you have come to love and respect about music and not only that, but the power and influence that a great rock album can have on your mental state of mind.<br /><br />This is an album that gets more and more appreciated the more you listen to it. One play through will not do a review justice for this album. This is a album that needs to be experienced. All songs are composed within an inch of perfection. It's has since i listened to it, become one of my top ten albums that has helped me cope with various aspects of my life. Not too shabby for an album barely three weeks old.<br /><br />This is a definitive yes on my buy list. Do yourself the favor of purchasing this album, and support a super group deserving of the name, with an album deserving of it's sound.
B007JCP962|4.0|One of the great things about being a TMV fan for me is that you just don't know what each record is going to sound like, and with so few acts willing to change up a successful formula these days, that's refreshing. This album, lost most Volta, is different than previous albums, but retains the distinct sound of Cedric's amazing voice and Omar's incredible songwriting and guitar playing.<br /><br />'Noctourniquet' does indeed have a cool 'electronic' sheen over much of the material, but it still rocks pretty hard in places. It's a good mix of the experimentation of 'Bedlam' with the more mellow sounds of the last album.<br /><br />Personally I'm really enjoying this right now, it's hard to judge where it will sit in their canon until about 10 listens or so, but it's definitely a good one. If you are a hardcore TMV fan who has always respected their restless nature and enjoyed their musical twists and turns, you'll probably like this.<br /><br />And who knows, there next album could be a one-track 75 minute avant-garde free-jazz freakout! And that would be cool too...

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|this is a truly magnificent work in the making. sporting a massive cast of top-notch actors (including Sean Bean, who played Boromir in Lord of the Rings), Game of Thrones is a sprawling story of civil unrest in the fantasy kingdom of Westeros, where summer and winter can last for decades.<br /><br />this is NOT, however, a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy thingit. it's more comparable to The Tudors in Middle-Earth; fantasy elements are very subtle, often only half-seen or hinted at. the real story lies in the power struggles two of Westeros's most prominent noble families, the Starks and the Lannisters. it's a very political story, with lots of plotting, veiled threats, and double entendres. all of the characters are well-realized, deep, and magnificently portrayed by their actors. the story gets off to a slow start, but ultimately it becomes absolutely riveting.<br /><br />visually, the show is almost like a movie. we get lots of gorgeous shots of castles, from the squat, grim, ugly towers of Winterfell to the soaring spires of King's Landing, or the cold, forbidding ice cliffs of the 800-foot-high Wall of the North. landscapes are rendered beautifully, with not a single hitch in the CGI, although at times the backdrops look a bit like painted murals (i think this is an intentional stylistic choice).<br /><br />the only criticisms i have are these: first, the show does stumble a bit through the first few episodes. i can hardly blame the producers, though. the book sports a huge and intricate web of characters, all of whom have histories that need to be explained. so naturally, the exposition sometimes trips over itself in trying to fit an 800+ page novel into a ten-episode season. the story really takes off after episode 6, and from that point on it's smooth sailing.<br /><br />my second complaint is a small thing. the fight scenes are well-choreographed and practiced, but they don't quite seem real. the actors know the choreography, they just haven't been taught how to move like swordsmen. this is just a personal pet peeve.<br /><br />all in all, Game of Thrones is a definite Must See. it is deep, dangerous, and mature. the characters are very realistic and likable, especially the dwarf Tyrion, whose cutting, mocking sense of humor always shows up at just the right moment to draw a laugh from what would otherwise be an overwhelmingly dark and cynical series.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My wife and two kids and I have this game on our Fires. We play the game together on the local network against each other and have a blast! An hour goes by really quick! I love how you can turn features of the game on and off to make it different each game play.

0385342039|5.0|This latest Kinsella novel begins in a typical way -- with a young, bright, new-penny girl who is in over her head. Lara Lington quit her job and put all her savings into a headhunting business with her best friend, but now the best friend has followed her libido to India, Lara knows very little about headhunting, and she is lying to her concerned parents at every turn, as they worry about her business situation AND her obsession with Josh -- the \\"perfect\\" guy who dumped her a few months ago. As Lara gets pressured by her parents and her clients, it doesn't seem like much else could go wrong, but of course it does! While at the funeral of her 105-year old great-aunt Sadie, Lara hears a voice -- the voice of her dead great-aunt -- and thus begins her adventure, as flapper Sadie begins making demands of Lara that lead to all sorts of difficulties and, ultimately, the happy ending we've all come to expect from Kinsella.<br /><br />Even though the general structure is not surprising, this doesn't diminish one's enjoyment of the novel. Kinsella is like a modern PG Wodehouse, writing a world populated by charming, if sometimes dim, characters, who eventually achieve all their dreams.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and can't wait for the next!
B001MW0J2Y|2.0|I think my review's title says it all. Although, this latest offering from the former Red Hot Chili Pepper guitarist is an improvement over all his other solo efforts. It's still a one star album at best.<br /><br />I gave it two stars for Before the Beginning, the mesmerising homage to Eddie Hazel, the Funkadelic guitar shaman, and Funkadelic's Maggot Brain, a gorgeous guitar masterpiece showcasing Eddie's unquestionable and laudable guitar prowess.<br /><br />The Empyrean doesn't work for me cuz it's too long, too repetitive, and shows very little evolution in Frusciante's vocals and song arranging. His adherence to the lo-fi production values of his previous efforts are in full force here, despite the fact that Frusciante clearly needs a producer and/or collaborator to reign in his unfocused and unbridled creativity. This record sounds as if Frusciante applied the \\"first thought, best thought\\" philosophy to his songwriting, cutting his mostly unformed seed ideas into songs before the songs has the appropriate amount of time to \\"get their legs.\\" The result is a chaotic mess that you could \\"listen to in a dark room at night.\\" But you might not want to. I know I don't.

B000069HZP|2.0|The Game has the potential to be an exquisite thriller if it had remained the homage to revenge fantasies it started out being. However, towards the climax of the film, the rug is rudely ripped out from under the feet of the viewer as we are now treated to a film that decided to be a thinking man's thriller. In order for the Game to be a thriller, there would have to be genuine thrills instead of jaw-droppingly pallid scenes involving Douglas plunging to near-certain death only to \\"miraculously\\" survive. Apparently, the filmmaker has mistaken roller-coaster ride style shocks for thrills of a psychological bent.<br /><br />The pseudo twist ending made the film an incoherent mess and failed to invite the viewer to reflect at all. And I watched this film closely.<br /><br />In summary, the Game is an entertaining watch if its on TV for free and you've nothing better to watch.

B001P9EQH8|2.0|OK, so this thing does amplify quite a bit, its max volume is very very loud when the input is somewhat loud to begin with. The levels of any sound coming through it are messed up, though. It sounds like listening to music after randomly sliding some equalizer bars all the way up and others down.
0345803485|1.0|Then you will enjoy one of the worse pieces of garbage ever published! This book was bad and the author should be ashamed. I can only guess that is the reason for the initials . My \\"inner goddess\\" turned into Athena and wanted to burn this book. \\"oh my\\" I was angry! How in the world could such amaturistic crap end up on the best sellers list. The porn bored me and then they went back to talking! The main character Ana is the most pathetic female I have ever read. I had no desire to root for her and had no clue what century she was from. Then there is Grey. We are suppose to feel as if he is a guy we would all secretly want. If All women wanted a sociopath then yes this stalker is perfect. The writing which is beyond juvenile must be intended to appeal to the lowest common denominator because I felt my brain cells sliding out of my head the more I read. Never Again!!
B00005NTN5|5.0|I admit that I am partial. I have seen \\"Bound\\" 5 times.  It is my favorite picture of all times. The plot is a familiar one with two friends plotting to steal one of the plotters boy friends money. The way the plot is woven is different. It is really two stories in one. The \\"chemistry\\" between Gina Gershon and Jennifer  Tilly is great. A lot different than the chemistry that you might remember from High School,but chemistry nevertheless. Ther is not a bad performance. Everyone in the movie is good. Joe Pantoliano gives a  really good perfomance as Jennifer Tilly's boyfriend. I read that Joe Pantoliano said that \\"Bound\\" was his favorite film. I can see why.Gershon and Tilly are wonderful. In my opinion when you see Gina Gershon you see \\"real life\\" as opposed to \\"reel life\\".In reviewing  a famous movie made in the late 30's (Not a movie like \\"Bound\\" the critic John Grierson said\\"One of the fine ones which begin as a film and ends as an experience\\".The same could be said about \\"Bound\\".

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The game is fun and entertaining even a bit addictive, but requires either large amounts of real cash or tons of friends (or both) to be able to do nearly anything truly productive. I'd be willing to buy some things, but not the large amounts they seem to require.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit's \\"The Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavoured Water\\" is without a doubt one of the most important musical works of the previous millennium and a fitting exclamation point to mark the end of the second Renaissance known as the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />I remember when I was first introduced to this veritable powder keg of creative energy in the Autumn of 1999.<br /><br />It was a simpler time.  Sega Dreamcasts were selling like hotcakes.  WCW Monday Nitro brought the thrill of live wrestling competitions, once afforded only to those with the means to witness these dazzling events in person, into the homes of ordinary Americans.  Lance Armstrong had won his first Tour de France, and Woodstock '99 delivered the message of peace and free love to a new generation of idealistic, starry-eyed youths.<br /><br />Enter \\"Nookie,\\" from Limp Bizkit's groundbreaking sophomore effort, \\"Significant Other.\\"<br /><br />I first heard the now iconic strains of this masterpiece while driving to Shakey's Pizza for a post-cram session luncheon with my dear friend and schoolmate Alistair Brestmane.  I stifled a gasp when its chorus swelled to a glorious crescendo:<br /><br />\\"I did it all for the nookie (Come on) / The nookie (Come on) / So you can take that cookie / And stick it up your (YEAH!) / And stick it up your (YEAH!) / And stick it up your (YEAH!) / And stick it up your...\\"<br /><br />I had no choice but to pull over then and there.  Alistair didn't question why.  I think he knew that, together in that car, we had experienced nothing short of a watershed moment.  We sat there for the following three minutes, neither of us daring to utter a word, as Fred Durst, Wes Borland, Sam Rivers, John Otto, Mike Smith and DJ Lethal stuck a defiant fork in the roast goose that was the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />You see, 1999 was not all mirth and gaiety.  As the sun began to rise on the new millennium, the looming spectre of the Y2K computer glitch cast its ominous shadow over the world.  Like frightened goats, people everywhere stormed their local haberdasheries to stock up on sundries like water, electricity generators, dehydrated meals and Code Red Mountain Dew, for fear of what the impending End might visit upon us.  Around the world, streets emptied out as families huddled together in their basements to read from the Book of Revelation and the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita and beseech God for mercy.<br /><br />But like the first seagull spotted from a tempest-tossed barge, Limp Bizkit arrived just as it seemed that all was lost and declared to the world, using not seagull screams but their innovative nu-metal sound, \\"Land ho!\\"<br /><br />Or so Alistair put it when the song was over and I turned off the radio.<br /><br />Like Bob Dylan before them, Limp Bizkit used music to soothe a society gone mad as it faced its own self-destruction.  I like to think that Fred Durst knew this, and modeled his oeuvre after Dylan's; for every \\"Blowing in the Wind,\\" a \\"Stink Finger.\\"  And for every \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" a \\"Three Dollar Bill, Yall$.\\"<br /><br />And like the Beatles, these six lads from Jacksonville, Florida made us all rethink what music could be.  Which is why I compare \\"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\\" to the Beatles' masterwork, \\"Abbey Road.\\"<br /><br />Who doesn't hear echoes of \\"Octopus's Garden\\" in lyrics like this?:<br /><br />\\"Ain't life a bitch? / A f...ed up bitch / A f...ed up sore with a f...ed up stitch / A f...ed up head / Is a f...ed up shame / Swinging on my nuts / Is a f...ed up game... Hooo Haaa Haaaw! Listen up baby / You can't bring me down / I don't think so / I don't want some / You better check yourself / Before you wreck yourself / Kiss my star fish / My chocolate Starfish, punk / Kiss my star fish / My chocolate Starfish, punk.\\"<br /><br />Alistair was sent away to military school the following Spring.  I never saw my dear friend again, but on rainy nights I like to fire up my gramophone, make myself a cup of Earl Gray, and lounge on the chaise with my Pomeranians (Mitsy and Oppenheimer) as I lose myself in some Limp Bizkit and think back on those days, those beautiful days with Alistair.  The time we skipped school and had a picnic in a canoe.  The time our team won the Fourth Division Young Men's Polo Tourney.  The time we were showering in the locker room after the Fourth Division Young Men's Polo Tourney and I slipped and fell and a part of Alistair's body accidentally went in my mouth.<br /><br />Those bright and beautiful days are forever etched in my memory.<br /><br />And if by some chance happening, or twist of fate, or by heavenly design, you stumble across this review, Alistair, know that you are missed.  You are loved.  And there is plenty of room on this chaise longue for two.
044042321X|3.0|So, I like this comic book in general. The art is good but no remarkable, the faces faded in my eyes, the most seems to be the same in all the characters who shared some features. And about the adaptation, looks like Daniel Abraham extract the spoken lines in the book, copied here and cut the descriptions. That makes the scene's cuts poorly constructed and without any grace. The overall work diminished the original book and erase almost all of the magic in it. I think that's because it was no adaptation at all, just a \\"copy and paste\\", unlike the tv series. Every gender needs some changes in order to fit and don't lose what makes \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\" special. And I don't count as changes some wacky and rude cuts in the scenes. That's just poorly work.<br /><br />The thing I like it the most is the cover, even when is just a layer, not printed in the actually cover, a white \\"beatles\\" cover that also like. Back on the cover art, it features a draw of Ned Stark made up with a pencil-like, just gray-scale and a red crow shape. He has the eyes close and the head down, somehow reflecting all the burden he is holding above his shoulders. Yes, in one draw. That's what rocks!!! I wish all the comic was make it like this adding vintage colors and using gestures of the characters instead of spoken lines surrounded by white blooms. Here, all I see is every person with the mouth open, the same look in their faces, no expression at all. Yicks. Destroyed all I ever imagined in my mine.<br /><br />Well, I'm gonna stop because it seems that the comic is terrible and it isn't. Is just that I expected much more. I expected love for GoT. And I think neither Abraham nor Patterson are true fans. Was another contract work they have to finish in time for Tv Series Second season premiere. Better keep looking in Devianart for draws with more heart in it.
0894803123|4.0|We are ice cream fanatics - our family consumes about a quart per week.  And we have been making virtually all of our own ice cream for the past 15 years,with a Cuisinart. That's over 750 1-quart batches of home made ice cream, and at least half of those batches were made using recipes from this book.  The basic recipe is uncooked, and consists of cream, milk, eggs, and sugar.  Custard based ice creams have their place, as do those eggless versions made by heating milk/cream with a cornstarch/milk paste (see below), but they are more time consuming and dirty a lot of dishes.  So I keep coming back to Ben and Jerry's easy to make, raw egg recipes.  The reason is simple: nothing beats the pure, fresh flavor of an uncooked ice cream with few ingredients: no corn starch, no corn syrup, no cream cheese.<br /><br />So what are the problems with these recipes, and what can be done about them:<br /><br />1. Salmonella in raw eggs.  If you buy the typical, inexpensive supermarket eggs from filthy, crowded factory farms, then you should worry about the risk of salmonella in raw eggs.  Worry less if you buy \\"cage free\\" eggs from the supermarket.  Worry still less if you buy eggs laid by chickens on pasture, as you might find from a local farm.  We don't worry at all because we get our eggs from our own backyard chickens who roam outside in a spacious paradise and sleep in a squeaky clean chicken coop.  And the eggs are never more than 2 days old when we use them for ice cream.  You can buy pasteurized (therefore no salmonella) factory farm eggs at the grocery store, but I personally never do this because I don't want to support any kind of factory farm.<br /><br />2. While the texture of the ice cream made using the recipes in this book is excellent for the first few days, it does become icy rather quickly.  So if it's going to sit in the freezer for more than 3-4 days, a cooked ice cream (either custard or eggless) will maintain its smooth, creamy mouth-feel for longer.  I use a cooked recipe if I am making a flavor that only 1 or 2 of us like, because it will not be eaten so quickly.<br /><br />3. The chocolate ice cream recipes in this book do not work well for me.  Jerry's chocolate is too gritty, and Ben's chocolate doesn't blend right -- the chocolate seizes.  Maybe they work sometimes for some people, but after 2 flops with each recipe, I gave up.  So for chocolate ice creams, I use either a custard based recipe (my favorite for chocolate), or the Milkiest Chocolate Ice Cream in the World (from the book Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams).  For a fool-proof, quick and dirty version of chocolate ice cream, reduce the sugar in Ben and Jerry's sweet cream base, and stir in Hershey's chocolate syrup to taste, before pouring the liquid into the ice cream machine.  Yeah, the flavor is far inferior to ice cream made with melted, unsweetened chocolate, but hey, if you're in a rush, and it's just going to be eaten by kids who won't care, this is the way to go.<br /><br />For vanilla or sweet cream based ice creams (oreo, cookie dough, chocolate chip, etc.) NOTHING beats the pure, fresh, raw flavor of Ben and Jerry's recipes.  During berry and peach seasons, we consume a quart of vanilla ice cream within 2 days, so never bother with cooked recipes.  In winter, when chickens are resting and we are short on eggs, Jeni's eggless technique of cooking the ingredients with a milk/cornstarch slurry and adding both cream cheese and corn syrup for smoother texture, is pretty decent for flavor (if you don't mind a hint of cream cheese in all your ice cream flavors), and stays smooth for a long time in the freezer.<br /><br />Another alternative, if you don't have, or don't want to use, eggs: Omit the eggs from Ben and Jerry's recipes - just reduce the amount of sugar slightly, or increase the amount of milk or cream, so you won't have too much sugar relative to the volume of liquid ingredients.  But an uncooked eggless ice cream gets icy even more quickly, so don't use it for ice cream that will sit in the freezer for more than 2 days.<br /><br />Some people might find this ice cream to be \\"cloying\\" due to the high fat content (recipes use twice as much cream as milk).  We don't, but if you do, you can reduce the cream and increase the milk.  The problem is that reducing the fat content will make the ice cream less smooth. You really need a high fat content for a raw ice cream to be super smooth.  Jeni's technique of cooking the ingredients and using corn starch, corn syrup, and cream cheese makes the lowest fat, super smooth ice cream I know of, but the flavor just isn't is good, IMO.<br /><br />Oh, I should say that if you add fruit to an uncooked ice cream, the increased water content will make it icier, so we don't mix the fruit in unless it will be eaten within a day or two: we usually just top vanilla ice cream with the fruit.  If you must have strawberry or mango or peach ice cream, a cooked recipe will yield a product that stays smooth for a long time.  Ben and Jerry's uncooked peanut butter ice cream, on the other hand, is fabulous, since the fat content of the peanut butter adds to the smooth/creamy texture.  No need to waste time on a cooked peanut butter ice cream.  Same for egg nog ice cream: the uncooked Ben and Jerry's recipe is outstanding.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the cookie dough and brownie recipes in this book, because I use my own recipes for those, and just add them to Ben and Jerry's sweet cream base.  We don't like sorbet, so I can't comment on those recipes either.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
1455508977|4.0|I ordered this book to read before I watch the movie.  Since I love The Notebook, Dear Johh, & The Last Song, I figured I'd give this one a try as well. I found it a little difficult to get into the book, the first couple of chapters describes Logan's Marine life, what I found difficult is that the author bounces from present to past (not a big fan of that could be hard to keep up with).  What I love is how this picture that he finds of Elizabeth (Beth) pretty much becomes his lucky charm, & so on a journey he goes to find this mysterious woman who has kept him alive.  Wont give out the story but overall I did like the story & cant wait to watch the movie. I still think The Notebook is Nicholas ultimate achievement

B0025UHKNS|3.0|Edit: The following is still true but I've finally gotten the replacement and it works as well as the 305 ever did. I added a couple of stars on the review for the quality of the product but still keeping it short of full marks for having to deal with this.<br /><br />I own a Garmin Forerunner 305 and decided that it was time for an upgrade.<br />When the 405cx arrived I found it easy to set up and easy to live with as a timepiece. When I went for my first run, the 405 took a LOT longer than the 305 to find the satellites. I figured being new, this wasn't out of the ordinary. I went for a run and found the pace to be WILDLY inaccurate. Not the normal drift but often off by ten min/mile and viewing the GPS data it was clear that the watch was losing sat connection. So I deleted the cache and tried again with the same results. I called tech support and cleared all the data and the cache and the same result happened. In the three times I was on the phone with tech support, I was frustrated that they seemed unable to think past the script. Each one without fail urged me to just use the average pace data. I tried to explain that: 1)Average pace data wasn't helpful in the middle of the run. 2)If a function on the device wasn't working as advertised, \\"don't use that function\\" is unacceptable. 3)The 305 is very good at providing a current pace 4)Average pace can easily be done with a stopwatch and isn't something I'm willing to spend ~$200 for.<br /><br />Their first advice was to return the watch to Amazon. If I am reading Amazon's return policy correctly, I could lose up to half the value since the box has been opened and the device used. I pushed for an RMA and they gave me one. So I pack up the watch and send it in. This is when I find out that their RMA status on their website can take up to \\"10-12 business days\\" to update, so it's not useful. Finally today my RMA status has updated. \\"Your product has been backordered. Please contact Product Support for an expected shipment date.\\" Production shortfalls happen and I understand that...assuming I had been contacted directly instead of finding out when they finally got around to updating their website.<br /><br />I realize that 99% of the time, Garmin makes a great product and it works right out of the box but had I known that I'd be three weeks into this watch and still not have a working one, I would have looked harder at the Timex and Motorola products.

0985114606|5.0|- The Story -<br /><br />Gideon Cross is a 28-year-old, highly driven, mysterious, sexually magnetic captain of industry.  His personal relationships are dealt with much like those in his business in that they are cold, calculated, and pressed for time.  He's had a traumatic past, part of which he attempts to hide at all costs.  And then, one afternoon, in the lobby of his building, he locks eyes with Eva Trammell, and his safe, emotionless, utterly controlled world begins to slowly evolve.<br /><br />Eva Trammell is a 24-year-old recent college graduate with an equally tragic past.  She takes an entry-level position with an advertising firm in New York City, excited to begin a life of semi-independence.  Eva is surrounded by family who care for her....maybe just a little too much, and a best friend who is emotionally and somewhat financially dependent on her.  Her world begins to evolve as well once she meets the enigmatic Gideon Cross.<br /><br />- My Thoughts -<br /><br />Sexy, sophisticated, intense and impossible to put down!  In Bared To You, Sylvia Day has crafted a rousing tale of emotional and sexual obsession you will not want to miss, without a doubt!<br /><br />This story will grab you at page one and won't let you go until you've turned the very last.  The writing is superb, contemporary and truly gives all comparable books and series a run for their money!  In my opinion, this easily comes out on top.<br /><br />5 Highly Satisfied Stars!!

B006KX3GXO|1.0|When I first downloaded this I was extreamly happy with this; I could edit my pictures on the go and save them for later uploads. However since the update (I am guessing) I haven't been able to use my pictures that are stored on my Kindle Fire. If I am at home the only pictures I can use are the ones on my social networks and that's defeating the purpose of editing pictures before I upload them. Please get this fixed as I really did like Picsart and it would be a shame not to be able to ise it again.

B00753MBHA|5.0|Quite simply, Stalingrad (2012) is one of the best Accept albums ever, and that's saying a lot.  It is a devastating, and brutal experience which epitomizes the best that heavy metal has to offer at this time.  There's not a lot of pretense here, and very few surprises, as Accept has had pretty much the same sound for nearly three decades.  Forget about love ballads, this is the dark stuff that reaches out and grabs you in the gut, and shakes your foundations.  If you want to hear about pain, war, death, struggle, oppression, evil, and destruction, then Accept is speaking your language, and with a maturity and conviction that is powerfully effective.<br /><br />When the core of Accept, guitarists Wolf Hoffman and Herman Frank, bass player Peter Baltes, and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann, reformed with new vocalist Mark Tornillo, some may have doubted that the band could be as powerful as before, and questioned how anyone could replace the legendary Udo Dirkschneider.  First on [[ASIN:B003SWNRU2 Blood of the Nations]] (2010), and now on Stalingrad, Accept has clearly demonstrated that the members of the band more than stand on their own merits as musicians and songwriters, and Mark Tornillo is one hell of a singer.  Kind of a mix of Udo, Graham Bonnett, and Rob Halford, Tornillo's aggressive singing style meshes perfectly with the band's dark musical tone.<br /><br />Led by DIrkschneider and Hoffman, Accept was one of heaviest exponents of Eurometal in the 1980's.  After forming his band U.D.O., and leaving Accept, Dirkschneider has continued to produce the same kind of pile driving metal that the original Accept pioneered.  Happily for fans of this crushing genre of metal, the newest version of Accept is arguably as powerful and relevant as ever.  The production on Stalingrad is impeccable, with nary a weak song in the battle ready lineup.  Wolf Hoffman remains one of the more talented and understated guitarists around.  His exquisite playing almost always leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />This album is destined to become a classic in the genre, and fans of Accept, particularly the Tornillo version shouldn't hesitate to get this album.  The music is as hard, heavy, and brutal, so be prepared to be devastated.nting more.<br /><br />This album is destined to become a classic in the genre, and fans of Accept, particularly the Tornillo version shouldn't hesitate to get this album.

B0052U59F4|5.0|The news media did not give this book a good rating, so I decided to see what it was all about.........I purchased the first book on my Kindle.........exciting.....hard to put down....then I read the other 2....spell bound!!  The author was on the Today show today 4/17/12.......they had her on too late..... I had to go to work so I missed the interview.  I was very upset.  I wanted to hear what she had to say about writing the book and all the flack she got from it...I would like to contact the author....I found out how much I really do not know about relationships.  I think this is possible and really happens in The Real World.  I would have liked a little different ending, especially because they had children.  Great  Patty Anadio

I understood she had to write her feeling like a diary because she couldn't express into words how she really felt.  This book was good.  I enjoyed it alot.  I have seen the previews for the film.  I am not sure the film will hold up to the book, but....what film does.

1610660242|2.0|Ok, so I guess I should have read the description in a bit more detail. I meant to buy the non-comic book version of this but i didn't see it on Amazon so I figured this had to be the version that was recommended to me by a few friends. The presentation of this book couldn't be more annoying. I couldn't read it. I have since ordered the regular version of the book. I guess if you were trying to teach your kids about customer service this would be a good book to give them?
B007549YM4|4.0|watchd this yesterday with my gf and we both liked it, its not the best nor the worse movie, but as the film goes on you get pulled in and want to know what happens to them and really want to know whats really outside, some other reviewers said theres intense rape scenes and violance, which i dont think its true. now the scenes from the last house on the left are some really messed up scenes, this is deff. not a kids movie, but a movie for grownups that shows that this could really happen in this day and edge, thats more scary then anything
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout!  I have exercised with weights prior to doing this video, I have regularly taken bootcamp style classes at the gym and weight training classes as well.  I do bycycling, walking, jogging.  I did this with my husband, we have only done level one, and it is a challenge, it is only approximately 25 minutes but there are no breaks and it gets your heart rate going.  I was used to using 6 lb weights in my bootcamp class at the gym, but I had to decrease the weights for this one to 3 lb weights because she does more reps and no rest in between exercises and I can feel the burn with the 3 lb weights.  The instruction is very clear and easy to follow; looking forward to doing the level 2 and 3 workouts!

0553386794|5.0|The real inspiration of the books is of course.... cricket.<br /><br />It's easy to see where George Martin got the inspiration for GOT from, especially with the casting of Sean Bean as Eddard Stark on TV, and that is of course the cut throat world of County Cricket. The North is obviously Yorkshire and Lancashire with Winterfell being a thinly disguised Headingly\\", the Dreadfort being Old Trafford with the Iron Islands representing County Durham.<br /><br />The many centuries of battles between hardened northerners and their soft southern Jessie counterparts in Kings Landing. Aka \\"Lords\\", is well known, the battle for supremacy, the thorny issue of Sellswords or \\"Overseas Professionals\\" as they are more commonly known as and of course the exotic foreign dimension, the 5 free cities of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Bangladesh, with Slavers Bay (South Africa) and of course the old enemy herself, Valyria, or Australia as it is more commonly known......<br /><br />Denaerys Targaryen fights for the right for women to enter the Pavillion at Lords, yes, it's all there. Highgarden is obviously Surrey, with Dorne representing Somerset, and the Freefolk beyond The Wall representing Ireland and Scotland, who whom Jon Snow is attempting to get  Test recognition, by the end of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", they are allowed to take part in the Natwest Trophy and play some one day internationals...<br /><br />The 147 books in the series to date chronicle the allegoric struggle of Yorkshire to win the County Championship and gain the England captaincy , the struggle of bat against ball, the tradition, the heraldry, the pomp, the Starks, descended from their mighty King, Ser Geoffrey of Boycott,  with various pretenders to the throne such as Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss, and a history of mad Targaryen kings, such as Ted Dexter. All of these elements are clearly recognised by Martin as important allegorical references in Game of Thrones, and I salute him.<br /><br />Seriously, these books are good, and I am particularly scathing in my view of fantasy and dragons and stuff taking valuable space in the sci-fi section, or indeed in most mainstream bookshops ALL of the space, so if you want space dedicated to erm, space, then you have are out of luck sunshine. But GOT and the 438 other books in the saga are well worth reading.<br /><br />Oh, and read TUF Voyaging too, now thats PROPER sci-fi and would make an amazing mini-series.riously, these books are good, and I am particularly scathing in my view of fantasy and dragons and stuff taking valuable space in the sci-fi section, or indeed in most mainstream bookshops ALL of the space, so if you want space dedicated to erm, space, then you have are out of luck sunshine.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I went into the first season of Game of Thrones without having read any in the popular book series titled [[ASIN:B004JN1D2I A Song of Ice and Fire]].  By the end of the first season I was so captivated by the story that I decided to read the books.<br /><br />Upon reading Game of Thrones, Book 1 in the series, I was surprised and delighted by how closely the HBO series mirrored the 700+ page book. And it was really cool to have faces and persona with all of the characters...especially that of Tyrion Lannister played precisely by Peter Dinklage.<br /><br />I am halfway through (as of this writing) the second book (this one almost 800 pages) of the series titled A Clash of Kings and based on how closely the HBO adaptation has once again almost mirrored the written work, I probably will abandon the extremely wordy George RR Martin and just stick with watching the show.<br /><br />And the show is excellent. Season 2 has taken more liberties from the source material than I noticed with season 1, and some of the detail in some of the most memorable scenes in the book have been lightened a tad for TV (i.e. when Tyrion confronts Pycelle); but it's all good and obviously anyone who has not read the book(s) will be none-the-wiser. I suppose that a standout descrepany from book to screen is that the ages of several of the prime characters have been elevated from teen to young adult. I guess that HBO was not ready to push the envelope with all of the graphic material...especially the sex...involving teens.<br /><br />We all know the fate of season 1's main character Ned Stark, so this year's main character is certainly Tyrion (even though Tyrion really stole the show last year too). I had hoped that season 2 would continue with more detail of Daenerys' (and her dragons) plight, but there is clearly a reduced role there in season 2.<br /><br />The best story arcs in season 2 are seen through the eyes of Tyrion and Arya. You don't want to move from your seat when it's their turn for the screen. Tyrion's wit and banter are as sharp as presented in the books, and it's easy to empathize with Arya's perilous predicament and feel like you're right there journeying along side of her as one of her youngling companions. Tyrion and Arya's escapades are more entertaining to watch than anything on TV right now. (I will say that anyone believing that Arya is a boy is a tough sell that needs to be taken with a grain of salt for the first few episodes of season 2.)<br /><br />As per the book, you also see arcs presented through the eyes of Sansa, Catelyn, Jon, Bran and Theon. However some deviations from sticking to seeing through the eyes of the main characters are present in order to better develop certain characters and/or story lines.<br /><br />The HBO crew has created magic with Game of Thrones. It is must see TV for any fan of the book series. It's a fantastic drama aimed towards an adult audience, and any fan of the fantasy genre not watching this should be thrown into one of the Black Cells.for the screen.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|PLEASE do not hate on me for this review... I liked the idea however it is kind of an easy read for the intended age group and it gets boring reading about a girl hiding in trees and caves for a week or so. In other words, kinda lacking in the action department.

0439023513|5.0|The first two books were tailored to a certain young, female audience that probably are giving negative reviews on here because they didn't get their simplistic, fairy-tale ending.  I think the book was just too mature for some of the readers.  The world does NOT revolve around puppy love.  This was not a romance book for god's sake, it was a dystopian world (which frighteningly looks more like ours all the time) and a war story.  Maybe the author threw the male/older readers a bone this time, or just thought she could get younger people thinking about things they wouldn't normally think about and elevate the discourse.<br /><br />This trilogy was 1984 (my favorite book), adapted for this generation.  You hear/read kids complain they hate that book in high school; you can tell it simply goes way over their heads.<br /><br />It was the right way to end the trilogy--realistically.  People think in black and white too much these days, that's not the real world.  This was actually for sure the best of the 3 books.

0618918248|5.0|This book was my introduction to Dawkins, and what a fantastic one it was! Dawkins lays it all out for us in pure fact-of-the-matter style and really made me think about things I had never thought of before, such as how truly ridiculous (and utterly immoral) it is to label children as \\"Christian child\\" or \\"Muslim child\\" etc. What a form of abuse it is to force your personal believes onto small children who don't know any better. And how incorrect it is to label them when they don't understand what religion truly is at all.<br /><br />It is my belief that absolutely everyone in the world (who is able) should own a copy of this book! If everyone read it, the world would inevitably be a better place! Scientific studies and progress would increase substantially as well no doubt, boosting our civilization in the right direction.<br /><br />Get this book! I cannot recommend it enough!
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|While a film that echos the Matrix original, there are some spectacular and unrealistic effects that the film does pull off if you leave your sense of reality behind.  I enjoyed the film tho it doesn't rank up there anywhere near close to my favorites.<br /><br />The video transfer is excellent, great resolution and clarity with no aliasing and deep shadow details.  The DTSHD audio doesn't make the best use of the surrounds in so far as discreet audio coming from any of the surrounds.  The soundtrack clearly overpowers any foley sounds that may have come from them.  There is some side to side audio transitioning as well as front to back but, like \\"Saving Private Ryan', the bullets should be falling left and right all over the discreet channels.  Of course, with such a movie the sub woofer does get a great workout.<br /><br />The extras include an alternate opening scene, which after seeing, I agree that it should not  have been used.  The making of special effects shorts are all well documented and interesting as well.<br /><br />I would have probably been just as happy to have this film in the standard def format but have not had an opportunity to compare.  It's a fun movie, not to be taken seriously but, in blu ray, a real pop corn film.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
0060853972|2.0|I picked up this book on the suggestion of a friend.  Said it was a fun read and something that I would enjoy.  He was wrong.  I did manage to finally plow through the book but did not enjoy it at all.  Most of it was predictable, a lot of it was not funny (while it tried to be funny).  If you are going to spend your money on a book, there are hundreds of thousands of better reads than this.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I love this film and ,when seeing it in the theater, it was nothing like I expected and everything I hoped for.  The 5 stars go to an incredibly moving, dramatic and humorous film that should have won an Academy award for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best everything.  That said, there are plenty of reviews here already doing a book report on the plot so I will refrain from that.<br /><br />So lets take a look at the Blu Ray version and how it stacks up to the Standard version which I also own. The Standard DVD version was not bad to begin with.  The Blu Ray video transfer is good, not great.  There is a scene early in the film when a car pulls up and you can clearly see aliasing/stairstepping in the cars chrome grill.  Seeing this, I look for those artifacts in other areas of the video transfer but failed to find them.  As this is a dark film, somewhat  desaturated in color, the shadows retain depth and detail as a blu ray transfer should, but, then again, so did the standard def version.  The Audio is DDHD and, as this is a very dialogue driven film, there was little use for the surround speakers or sub. There was some use of the front side channels when cars were driven but that was about it.<br /><br />The extras were the typical commentaries, and an interesting and informative 'making of' with a good amount of discussion regarding integrating the Hmong culture and actors within the film.  This was well worth watching.  Really don't see the big deal about BD Live...does anyone really use it?  I would have rather space been used for deleted scenes, of which there were none, out takes and the like.  You were able to see some original audition clips for the parts of Sue and Thao and I would have liked more of this.<br /><br />I buy movies on Blu Ray for a serious upgrade of both video and audio.  While this movie gets 5 stars because it is a great film, for those who have the standard def version, I do not believe that you will see a significant difference between it and the blu ray version.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankse a significant difference between it and the blu ray version.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

Fanny has \\"big plans\\" for the girls and divides them off to occupations she believe best suits them.

However, there is a Magic Castle that moves about the border of Market Chipping that is said to house a Wizard by the name of Howl.  The story proceed and after Sophie gets turned into an old woman by a witch she takes the initiative to hunt down Howl and get him to change her back.<br />  The story continues and Sophie and Howl have the basic \\"frenemy\\" relationship as she resides in his castle as his cleaning lady.  He puts on constant tempter tantrum and is a man who loves the chase in the game of love.  There is a romantic twist at the end to surprise all readers.<br />  The age group of this read seems to be targeted more to young adults due to of the amount of romantic altercations.  However, the novel instills valuable lessons and is great for young children as well because of the friendly ways that it teaches life-long values.<br />  The tale proves that inner beauty is truly what counts at the end of the day and that a person should never judge a book by it's cover.
B0041B785Y|5.0|I,ve always kept my ears open for Meshuggah and never was able to wholely enjoy an album though I feel all there albums have some gems And some of there songs are down right classic, Koloss though is there first album that I listen to front to back everytime. I know everyone seems to be using the term organic but for me thats what has absolutly captivated me here, Theres less frills and added sounds to invoke a sence of enviorment instead this album is friggin endurance challenge not in a bad way. Koloss starts off with such an believable frieght trian chugging that never lets up once except for the last track which is an instumental track, But the sheer brutallity of this album masks the phenomenal musicianship upon first listen at least for me it did. Yet once I slipped on thee ole headphones I was blown away with what the managed to slip into such denseness, So if your lookin for something to just flat out purge your fury to right here is a good place to start so pick this up and enjoy. JESUS SLAVES-METAL SAVES!!!

006197806X|5.0|[...]    If you follow me on Twitter, you might know that I've been dying for this book since I finished Delirium. Then, when I went to buy it the day it came out and I could not find it in any book-selling stores in my area. I was so upset. Finally, my dad brought it home to me a couple weeks after its release and I almost had a stroke because I was so frackin excited. At least the wait was worth it. So so so so so so so so worth it. Lauren Oliver brings back everything we adored in Delirium--beautiful prose, a haunting society, high emotion, relentless tension--and even more: edgier writing, sharper beliefs and goals, and a much tougher lifestyle. Lauren Oliver has created yet another book that will rage in my soul for my entire life.    I don't even know how to coherently express my love for this book, besides, \\"OMGOMGO MGKDGNIQUERBGIBDNKASFJN FGIHJBFGVAN AHHH YAYAYAYAYAYAYAAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYA OMG.  PWENFHOIABXCKJFD!\\" I feel like Lauren Oliver took a stroll through my heart and discovered exactly what will make me love and break my heart and BLOW MY FRACKIN MIND. Because that's what she does. Every word builds me up to break me down to build me back up. I'm not sure how she manages to fit all these feelings in one book, but she does.    This book has a lot more action than the first. Whereas Delirium was about Lena discovering what she wants and figuring out how to grab hold of it, Pandemonium was about Lena fighting for what she wants and struggling to hold on to it. The book alternates between \\"Then\\" and \\"Now.\\"    In the 'Then' section, Lena has just arrived at the Wilds and she is struggling to recuperate--physically and emotionally. And yet, she doesn't back down. She wants to get her strength back and she wants to carry on. She turns her weaknesses into strengths. We're introduced to new characters, which I absolutely fell for. They all have an air of mystery surrounding them because nobody in the Wilds is particularly fond of discussing the past. But their strength and kindness is evident even if their lifestyle is harsh and their words are terse. There's a lot of despair and hopelessness in this section.    In the 'Now' section, Lena has created a tough outer shell around herself. She tries not to think of the past and just keep doing what she knows is right. I think I liked this section a lot better than 'Then.' This section is just a little more fierce and contains a lot more action. I also feel more connected to Lena in this section.    I just couldn't bring myself to fall for the new guy. I mean, not even just because I adore Alex and I miss the hell out of him in this book. But also because the new guy is so naive that I just get this little boy vibe from him. I just couldn't. I mean, he's a good character but he's not good for Lena, in my opinion. I also missed Hana and Grace. I haven't read the Hana novella, so I'm not sure what happens to her, but I do hope she will be in the next book.    The ending, of course, was epic. While I kind of expected it, when it happened I was completely taken aback. I expected nothing less from Lauren Oliver. She rips me apart and stitches me back together over and over and over in the best possible way. I cannot wait for the next book. This is a series I am one hundred percent invested in and will never forget. It makes me feel so much more than I can possibly describe.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love it. I can play it all day on my kindlle fire. I can do without the ads popping up every time I start a new game. But other than that, I can't get enough!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like to play this game for fun because it is really fun to play when I'm bored like now
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app for when your on the go. i think its the best bible app out there as it contains different bible versions and audio. its free and worth getting.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|George Clooney is a great draw and stretches himself yet again in a somewhat whimsical role, but the story is weak and leaves you wanting some form of resolution.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|........and loved every minute of it!<br />The series finale to THE best show ever on television. A must see from beginning to its conclusion. EVERY SINGLE episode has one if not two or three plot (more in some episodes) twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end!!!!! DON'T MISS THIS SERIES IF ITS THE LAST THING YOU DO!!!!!!!!!!
B007KQXB2G|5.0|I've never actually watched a whole episode of Mad Men, not because I don't like the show or its cast or crew but simply due to lack of time. But I HAVE seen a million-and-one \\"how to succeed in business\\" video productions, most of which are pretty boring and generally not very creative. This \\"Special Feature: How to Succeed in Business Draper Style,\\" produced and distributed by Lionsgate, is not really intended to be a part of the tv series. Rather, it's actually a professionally produced one-hour business leadership training video that features interviews with business and industry leaders, executives, and of course relevant clips from Mad Men. It's at least one of the very best - possibly THE best - one-hour video of its kind that I've ever seen. It's accurate, contains practical information, and presents its information in a very entertaining and creative way without \\"dumbing it down.\\" And it's an *excellent* example of how motion picture and television product can be effectively used (or re-used) to not just entertain but to also inspire, educate and actually train. I give it 5 stars from this point of view.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I just got it and I love it. I go around and sonic every thing. Once I tried to open a door but it was made wood.<br /><br />This is a must for any Doctor Who fan.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Like all the other Angry Birds games, this is no exception, starts off easy and gets more challenging as you go though the different levels. I love it.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I downlosded this app just to give it a try. It played the Mp3s I have on my Kindle Fire with no problems. It found my Mp3s and listed them so I could pick the one I want. Works great for my Podcasts too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game has a story in ti it has so manycool things you have to see so get it trust me you will love it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Most books and series follow a fairly preset structure and path.  They focus on one group, person, or family and tell a tale of highs and lows.  In most cases things end a bit on the high side, but this is not a typical series.  The cast of characters starts large and gets bigger as the books go on.  Twists and turns in the plot do not follow a predictable path, making each chapter exciting to start and leaves you begging for more.  Well devolved characters leave the story line frequently, only to be picked up a few books later or not at all.  This is what makes this series so much fun to read and so hard to put down when you start.  I highly recommend buying the whole series at one time, you won't be able to stop at just one book and you will kick yourself for not getting the better deal upfront.  That said this is an ADULT series.  I would not recommend buying this for anyone under the age 16 or 17.  The book is graphic and very detailed in both violent and sexual acts.  Very typical HBO type material.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was the very first person in my school to read the Hunger Games.It took me only one chapter until I was hooked.I am usualy very picky about my books and will not read anything fiction that doesent have the least bit of violence.Do not listen to anybody that writes a bad review.I hope someday Suzanne Collins will let me do my books about the future of Panem and this new method of population control.
B003VNKNDW|5.0|Transcend Flash Drive are great. Never had any problems using the, I have a 4gig and this 16gig and they do what there intended to do!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Hilarious, enchanting, and entertaining!  I couldn't walk away from my iPad, I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Kinsella's characters are so witty and bumbling; where does she find her material?
0439023483|5.0|At first I was doubtful of this book because I heard that all it was about was people kill each other inside an arena, and I thought to myself \\"People killing each other... What's more to write about?\\" But since many of my friends told me to read it I decided to give it a try thinking \\"Why not?\\" This book was so full of emotion and detail you could easily picture it and imagine what the characters feel like. I just couldn't put down this book. This is a must read!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is super cute and very addicting!!! you can play the game without purchasing anything you just have to be patient and need friends.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is as easy to play as on a desk top computer but I like the extra features like hints and being able to change the settings to allow deal with an empty column
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Saw this film numerous times in the theater over the course of several months. I did read the book just prior to viewing so no comment on it as an independent entity. It can be said that both the book and the film assume that the reader/viewer are truly intelligence minded (all meanings of the word apply) and up for the task of intellectual pursuit (hint: more than one viewing may be required [gasp!].) The film is a miracle of narrative condensation. It's also an exalted fast track to 1970's Western political society, and it's cinematic aesthetics. For further reading, see films such as The Conversation, The Passenger, The Conformist, All The President's Men...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. I enjoy it. I would recommend downloading this game. its very addictive. why not download it's free and fun.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Loved this, set 15 years after the Farseer trilogy. It starts a little slow but that is natural, it really builds the story into an amazing and intense drama. Get through all three and be amazed
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is better than tap zoo and zoo story its really fun my friend has a kindle this is all we play I'm a lv 50
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Perhaps you have already read about the disappointing performance of Disney's sci-fi adventure \\"John Carter\\" at the box office. I don't know who is responsible for that, but I know for sure that the film itself is not to be blamed. It is overlong, I admit, but \\"John Carter\\" is actually a pretty enjoyable adventure movie with stunning visuals and effective performances from the leads Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins.<br /><br />A Civil War veteran John Carter's adventures and romance on Mars, or \\"Barsoom,\\" is very famous. Transported to the red planet (the film describes the process in detail), Carter fights with his super-jumping ability and falls in love with a beautiful princess of Mars. No wonder it took so long (100 years to be exact) for the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic story to be made into a film - a film of this scale, which needs imagination, storytelling skills, visuals and someone who can play John Carter.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is perfect as the hero, and so is Lynn Collins as a Princess of Mars Dejah Thoris, but it is Carter's ever faithful pet Woola that steals the show. The combat scenes are to me a bit too fast and busy, but they are still exciting with first-rate special effects. Some characters' motives are not convincing, but the slick narrative almost makes us forget that.<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" (or \\"John Carter of Mars\\") is flawed. First of all, it needs a better title. This is the first live-action film by Andrew Stanton (\\"WALL-E\\"), acclaimed director whose excellent use of visuals is seen here, but not his tight narrative style.<br /><br />That said, \\"John Carter\\" is a very good sci-fi action film, much better than you are led to believe by negative reviews and disappointing box office results.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very user friendly and has so many features that make Bible study a pleasure.  I love being able to go immediately to any book-chapter-verse.  I also enjoy being able to compare a selected passage in a large number of different versions.  There are also commentaries available to help further clarify those passages.  Several versions also feature audio. This app has so many other features but I've mentioned the ones I personally like and use most often.
0756405890|5.0|A  very smart person  who is dear to me, but with very different reading tastes highly recommended this book to me. However, she said with a warning tone, \\"It's that fantasy genre that I don't think you like too much.\\" I inwardly groaned, but decided to leave the comfortable confines of my preferred thriller/detective/spy /espionage favorite genre and give it a whirl and I grumpily picked up this behemoth when I had nothing else to read.  Well, by page 10 of this 700 page + monster I was hooked with Kvothe and his story.  I finished Name of the Wind in record time by nonstop reading - stealing time during the day, reading during meals and before bed and within a day of finishing The Name of the Wind, had purchased the second book in the KingKiller Trilogy, The Wise Man's Fear because I couldn't bear not to see what happened next in the epic of Kvothe. Rothfuss's writing drags you right into the middle of his story and won't let you go. I dread finishing Book Two because I don't think there is a Book Three yet! This book is perfect for age 12 on up as it doesn't have sex or graphic violence.  (Esp. good for girls as Rothfus has written some strong and smart women characters.)
B007BRJYF2|5.0|Nice Hidden Object game for all public.<br />A kid or an adult can play. Very relaxing game and nice graphics.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Over and over and over.... there are so many errors in this book.  Who published it?  They should be ashamed!!<br /><br />The writing is medicore at best, the story boring.  Save your time and money.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is so fun that I can play 5 minutes or 2 hours...<br />I recommand this game if still don't have it.
0345803485|1.0|To call this book raunchy is a compliment.  I can't believe that this is considered romance!  HE IS HITTING HER!  That's not romance, it's a criminal offense!!  The writing reminds me of composing a paper in the 8th grade and trying SO hard to get to 500 words.  Lots of \\"oh no\\"s and \\"oh sh--\\"s, and \\"he isn't looking at me :(, he's looking at me\\" for the word count.  Seriously, her \\"inner goddess\\" wants to be hit?  I'll hit her!  Ladies, what is wrong with this picture?  This is seriously demeaning and terribly juvenile.  Want your daughter reading this?  If the sexual deviance doesn't bother you, the writing should!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|To have the Bible at my fingertips,  in all of these various translations, on and offline accessibility,  always there when I need/want it...love, love, love it!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I think this game is good, except for having to wait for your energy to build up, also wish other settlers could be &quot;tagged&quot; in to help out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and addicting game. hard to put down. better than many others I have tried. cant wait for next movie.
0307946711|2.0|Interesting idea for a novel and I was quite excited about reading this but was upset that the story line was in places really quite unrealistic. And it annoyed me that the author (and subsequent editors etc) didn't correct a couple of mistakes that wouldn't have taken much research to check.<br /><br />One was the teaching interview (they are done very differently to commercial/industrial interviews) Emma would have been told on the day of interview that she had the job. Also Dex opening a cafe on a twelve month lease when there would have been change of use planning applications to change it from a retail shop to a cafe? Just wouldn't happen. Most shop leases are at least 5 years - any commercial letting agent could have told Nichols this.<br /><br />I hated the ending and couldn't help wondering what the point was? That said, I read it in two days - it was easy to read - a page turner. But because it was nicely written, I think that is why I felt rather let down....
1599218011|5.0|well written and witty with lots of great recipes.  Tried all the juices and smoothies which were easy to make and had easily acquired ingredients.  Sauces good as well.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|Excellent film!I really enjoyed the characterizations of the people and felt that she really caught the essense of Marilyn-the sadness, the sensuality and the innocence as well.
0985114606|5.0|.....I started this at work yesterday and finished it at midnight and it was more than worth the lack of sleep.<br /><br />I've seen many comments comparing this to 50 Shades of Grey. The comparison is shallow the only thing they have in common is they are both written in the first person.  Normally I'm not a fan of first person POV but Bared To You was written so well I didn't even think about the fact that it was in first person.  Gideon and Eva are three dimensional characters and I found myself drawn into the story almost feeling their reactions with them.  The sex is hot and compelling and real, not forced like I've read in other books.  This book is incredibly intense and I can't wait for the next Crossfire book Deeper In You!!
0439023491|4.0|In Book 2, Katniss gets thrown back into the Games, and still comes out strong in the end (without giving up too much). I'm still undecided between Gale and Peeta, but like that Gale is emerging more. Peeta meanwhile also becomes a stronger player. Book 2 isn't as intriguing as 1, but you must move on to 3 at this point.

B0017SWPXY|1.0|Please, do not post my review. Taking too much time to review my reviews these days. Thank you for not posting this review.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|While the product worked fine for the first few months, it eventually completely stopped functioning for no apparent reason.  From the beginning I was very careful in how I handled the adapter so that it wouldn't hang over the edge of the table and so it wouldn't have any undue stress applied to the cable portion of the adapter. I was VERY careful in how I treated the adapter, and still it only lasted 11 months (with infrequent use). Towards the end of its life it became more and more sensitive to how the adapter cable was positioned, until there was no longer a position we could hold the adapter in and still have video be sent to the tv.  Unbelievable to spend $30 on a product (a non electric product with no moving parts) and have it just stop working because of poor build construction.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
1401233376|2.0|I have been reading comics since the 70s (yes I am That old!) and I have seen all types of multipart stories that change everything as we know it.  In the 80s DC revamped their universe with the Crisis series which I loved.  As a result, things were fresh and new, but there was still a hint of the old.<br /><br />This time around DC decided to get rid of anything that tied their characters to an older period.  I was only 2 issues in to Flashpoint when I found out that everything was going to change.  Bascially I lost interest.  By issue 3 I was done.  Last year and I went from reading 10-15 DC titles a month to not caring.  In June it will be a year since I read any DC titles.<br /><br />So, you may like this book, or by the end you may say \\"who cares!\\"  I can only imagine that in 15 years DC will reboot again to fix all the problems they created this time.<br /><br />So why 2 stars?  The art.....otherwise it would get less than one star.
B000UX6THK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000UX6THK Twin Peaks: The Complete Series (The Definitive Gold Box Edition)]]<br />As a first time customer, I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered the Twin Peaks Series.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I purchased this game for my daughter to play originally yet found myself hopelessly hooked. It runs well without any force closes on my Droid.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|For James Clavell, the need to exorcise the bewildering Japanese who kept him captive in Singapore in WWII, must have been a powerful driving force. His novel of Japan in 1600 is as clear a description of the Japanese sense of life and honor as can be expected from a foreigner, or so do all my Japanese acquaintances believe.<br />I personally enjoyed this novel for the second time, even more so than my first of 35 years ago. A story that flows captivatingly. An understanding of the Japanese, that changed from a frightening shock to an intelligent understanding and finally to having to quit it, longingly after only something over a thousand pages. I recommend it if you want something much more valuable than just a superbly well written and entertaining novel.
159102594X|4.0|I just finished reading this book and, overall I liked it.<br /><br />This book is like reading a comic book, or watching a funny cartoon. Everything is very visual. It's almost like a storyboard. When one character screams, the author doesn't just say so, he adds funny details to make it more explicit so you immediately get a visual image. For instance. At one point, startled, a character will let a scream. Abercombie adds \\"like a school girl who spotted a spider in her bathtube\\". These details adds all the flavour.<br /><br />It's not a very complex book nor a serious book like \\"A wheel of time\\" or \\"A song of fire and Ice\\". No. It's like a parody, with stereotypical characters. They are mainly weak, scared, cowardly but some acting tough. Their reaction are fun to watch...err read. It would make a great cartoon (but not a kid cartoon). It highly reminded me \\"Mech ebook\\" by Larson, B.V.<br /><br />The story kinda drags on, like those manga cartoon (One Piece for instance) where not much happens but you keep watching because it's fun. I'm eager to read the book Two.
B001QERPDO|2.0|If you are buying this album because you liked Science and Faith then think again. This album (their first) is very prehistoric compared to the second. It is rough around the edges. Buyer beware!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, must read the whole trilogy.  I couldn't wait for those special times to be able to read.  Characters very well expanded, setting unlike any before.  Much better than the movie.
B000002534|2.0|When Santana decided to abandon fusion in order to sell more records, this was the product - a hodge-podge album, with some really awful R&B tracks - \\"moorage???\\" and some great instrumental pieces, that to me, define the Santana sound of the period.<br /><br />So you get an inconsistent, weak album overall, although not without some great music on it.<br /><br />Far from being washed up, Santana put out some very good and very commercial albums later, such as Amigos and Moonflower, and a solid return to fusion with The Swing of Delight. After that, it was the same hit-or-miss for a few decades, until his total artistic self-sacrifice with Supernatural, in 2000. Oh well, I console myself with the thought that we still have the classic albums to enjoy. Viva Santana Classico!
B0063GORYU|5.0|like I just said pretty cool. card game that's all. what else can I say to post this. ok ill go on and on and on and on

B005RUUUAI|3.0|I think Season 2 wasn't quite as good as Season 1 was. I don't think it was as action packed as Season 1 and one episode in particular seemed to have a repeating scene in it, which I found a little odd. Hopefully Season 3 will bring back more of the action!
0440133688|5.0|just wanted to make a + comment on this book. i read it 1/2 way through my internship in 1979 -1980. i read it because i had asked another intern why he was laughing hysterically in the hallway at LAC/USC medical center in 1979. all he could get out was (he was laughing very hard) \\"it is just like the book\\". intrigued, i read it. the book helped me a great deal not only with the rest of my internship but with the rest of my career. it was the first honest assessment of the state of medical care that i had run across, something that was new to me despite 4 years of medical school. if you are an intern, let me simply say life will get better! and if you are a married intern, make your wife read it, it may save you from a divorce. i plan to re-read it soon, as it would seem many physicians (perhaps even me at age 58) may be about to enter another \\"house of God\\" scenario unless the supreme court rules against it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It seems so simple but can be amazingly challenging at times. The olden times theme is a tad odd but it works.
0062014951|5.0|I won't try to review this book. This is wondeful edition to our stacks. I got this yesterday and the presentation is outstanding. All the Limited Editions are signed and numbered. Most of the listings don't have that information. I was suprised.
1451648537|2.0|This is not the book I expected, and my 2-star rating is a slightly negative composite of two extremes.  The author gets a poorer rating for creating a book that is not overly insightful, is a little long and is bit too repetitive.  In short, it lacked substance and appears to have been rushed out the door editorially.  On the other extreme, the events and chronology were well documented, and that part alone warrants a better rating.  I loved reading about the development of the technology during that time, as I was a computer professional from the mid-1970's to mid-1980's.  The book brought back a lot of great memories for me and I enjoyed that part a lot.  But I didn't buy the book to learn about the history of the PC.  That drags the book down from a 3 to a 2.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had was this: I didn't walk away from this biography with a feeling of who Steve Jobs really was.  What was missing to me was a much deeper understanding of what type of a person he was in the eyes of those who really loved him.  Laurene and his kids should have been more than bit role players in this understanding, and certainly some of his closest friends and professional associates could have offered more too.  Many times he appeared not to have a family or friends, and with all the anecdotal instances of his temper tantrums and crying, one might conclude that most sane people simply avoided him whenever possible.  I don't believe that to be true.<br /><br />I want to read a deeper, more insightful biography.  This book, although an enjoyable read from an historical perspective, doesn't provide the breakthrough I was hoping for in understanding who Steve Jobs was.
B005XTLAQQ|3.0|This doll is a must have for all Twilight fans. I actually bought it for my sister. Bella's face is pretty and the dress is beautiful. It comes with a doll stand so you can display it outside of the box properly if you want.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|McGuire does realistic dialog and conflict.  The book starts strong, but after multiple breakups, I began to lose sympathy for our dear protagonist who insists on jerking around her boyfriend repeatedly.  When the resolution comes, we as readers don't buy it because it isn't true to character.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I played on. kindle fire and there is no wag to get out of it so I ended up going to the install these apps and then that took mw out. of the game. the game itself was fun and entertaining
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Look, if you were like me and fell completely in love with the first book, then this one is going to blow you out of your seat!! The book is filled with drama, surprises and literally for 5 days distracted me from my social life because I could not stop reading. The story of Annastasia Steele and Christian Grey is indeed dark, different, but definitely inspiring. Just by reading this book I feel like I learned alot about myself. The book will have you sitting on the edge of your seat... not being able to tend to your outside life without finding out whats going to happen next. The author definitely has a way of making you buy every book of the series. I have spent 30$ so far just to see what happens to Steele and Grey in the end.... But I think its worth it.
0142419400|5.0|This book receives 5 out of 5 gnomes for having superb characters and supreme readability.  I had heard good things about this book but I had no idea that I'd love it this much.<br /><br />What makes the book great is the voice of the character.  Anna Oliphant is relatable and just seems like a believable person.  I'm sure that most people would probably feel the way she does after being told by their parents that they have to go to an overseas boarding school for senior year instead of graduating at home.<br /><br />I laughed a lot while reading this story, there is a lot of funny going on in these pages.  I think it's so funny because everything in the story is easy to picture.<br /><br />Watching Anna learn to fit in is really endearing because I have a feeling I'd have had some of the same problems/been an even bigger nerd then she is.  It's great when she's only eating bread and fruit because she doesn't know enough French to order anything else.<br /><br />Then there's Etienne, I wasn't sure if I liked his character at first but boy does he grow on you.  He's a short guy but has so much confidence, also he's pretty darn funny.  The biggest problem though for Anna anyway is that St. Clair has a girlfriend.<br /><br />His having a girlfriend of course leads to complications but also adds some great tension to the story.  Anna and St. Clair actually become friends and don't have this insta-love that tends to plague some novels.<br /><br />Well-rounded characters, humor, and surprises makes this book a definite must read.  Stephanie Perkins is an author that I will be looking forward to reading more from.  I can't wait to read whatever she writes next.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br />\\"Any bloke with a working prick would be insane not to like you.\\"...\\"Because, of course, of how intelligent you are.  And funny.  Not that you aren't attractive.  Because you are.  Attractive.\\"...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Let me start by saying, this is the first book that literally caught my attention to the point where I might have been a little delusional while reading it. I am completely consumed with college and all the massive textbooks I am forced to read. So for me to just actually choose a book that is worthy for my attention outside of a classroom is rare. Within the first two chapter I was captivated my the story of Annastasia Steele and Christian Grey. I could relate to her college life and anticipation of graduation. The way Grey and Steele meet eachother is so beautiful and unpredictable. I am 22 an the story of them two was definitely a story that I could relate too. I found myself waking up in the morning after reading the book all night feeling like I need to text Christian grey.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Great idea for a game but don't waste your time or money. Too many errors way too often. Eventually your 5 min wait time to collect something will turn to 60+ hours due to errors. And even worst is you can't stop production without selling the item.
B00004SA88|5.0|I bought this album because I am a guitarist and I kept hearing how Paganini was a great influence on some of today's best  guitar players. Yngwie Malmsteen in particular.  I also enjoy this style music and usually just listen to it on our local radio station.  I saw this complete collection and I couldn't say no.  I am very pleased with the quality of the playing and the recording.  Accardo is a beast!
B006X415GK|5.0|OK i have tosay i wish it was in color. I love the clothes but i wish they put color. Overall ahe is very preatty and a cute doll. I got her at kholes for 7.99 dolars so i buy at a store.

0446698342|5.0|I guess few people will read this seeing there are currently 372 reviews but I figured I should add my input plus I read some of the other reviews.  Considering the other reviews obviously some people don't like it or think it's okay and to that I would say this is not for everybody.  But if you like any of Spark's other works and believe anything is possible especially when it comes to love then this is for you.  I read this book in 2 days and that's something I never do.  I mean I stayed up all night to finish it. The only reason for the 2 days is due to a slow start but things change pretty quickly.  It's like when a series on tv says to be continued and having the book I didn't have to stop nor did I have the desire to. Now I think I might have ruined it once I see the movie.  So hopefully there will be some different twists and it will be just as good or better.  Honestly I couldn't see why the author wrote a few parts the way he did since I would have imagined it to be a little different but it didn't really detract from the whole plot.  Also the narration comes from three different characters and the ending isn't the best but these are still only minor issues. Even the main character's flashbacks may seem somewhat of an issue but they actually add to the whole work.  So I don't feel the need to be too critical which is why I give it 5 stars.  Even if I could give it 4.8 or something I don't think that would be enough. Get the book.  You'll like it.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|This would be much more useful to me if the zipper went around 3 sides of the cover instead of just 2.  Of course then it would need to have something to hold the Kindle in place so it wouldn't fall out.
0553801473|1.0|It's been said but....this book is nothing short of a tragedy and a total failure to extend the series in any meaningful direction. Mr. Martin, you have let down your fans spectacularly. I can understand if the filming of the show took your attention away from writing. But in that case, DON'T WRITE!!! Especially if you're going to piss all over your legacy as a great fantasy writer. How do you plan to dig yourself out of this hole? Or are you satisfied with the wonderful books that preceeded this absurd piece of junk?

B002ZCY7PU|4.0|Charles 'Chuck' Bartowski and his handlers, Sarah Walker and John Casey, have successfully defeated FULCRUM, a rogue intelligence agency. The Intersect, the combined intelligence database of the entire United States which has been downloaded into Chuck's brain, has been radically upgraded. Now Chuck has access to advanced weapons and kung fu skills, amongst other abilities. But Chuck's emotions are getting in the way of him being able to do his job. A new agent, Daniel Shaw, is assigned to the team to help train Chuck as a spy, but this has unexpected results.<br /><br />After the relentlessly entertaining second season of Chuck, the third season gets off to a surprisingly weak start. Rather than picking up immediately on Season 2's cliffhanger ending (where Chuck comes into possession of the Intersect 2.0), we rejoin the action six months later. This causes problems even with Chuck's elastic notions of plausibility (why are Sarah and Casey hanging around Burbank for six months when Chuck isn't there?) and necessitates a lot of backtracking and flashbacks to fill in the gap. Once we're past the hurdle of the first few episodes (and a somewhat dubious Vinnie Jones guest role), however, things improve a lot. The second season's format of stringing together several multi-episode arcs into one cohesive whole is repeated and is almost as successful as previously. Brandon Routh is decent in the new role of Shaw, with the writers not wasting any opportunity to highlight his previous major role as Superman (even draping him in the American flag in one amusing scene).<br /><br />As usual, the season has a good mix of comedy and drama, with some great stand-alone stories (Armand Assante's turn as a somewhat demented, American-friendly version of Castro is especially entertaining) standing alongside the ongoing story arcs. Most satisfying is the unexpected way the show's set-up suddenly changes. Major characters discover Chuck's secret with little forewarning, altering the show's premise for the better by dropping the 'secret identity' storyline just as it was starting to get a little stale. Chuck and Sarah's relationship is moved onto another level, again just as the 'will they/won't they' angle was running out of steam. Even Casey is given a stronger personal storyline, as he discovers a family he never knew he had and becomes conflicted over contacting them or not. And, as usual, the more serious spy stuff is balanced out nicely by the lunacy going on over at the Buy More store.<br /><br />Overall, the third season of Chuck (****) is funny, self-aware and entertaining. It's not quite as a good as the second season, due to a dodgy set-up in the first few episodes that results in a lot of backtracking and wheel-spinning and the fact that the new bad guys, the Ring, are identical to FULCRUM. Beyond that, the show evolves its premise and characters in compelling new directions and shows a willingness to change even fundamental parts of the premise when necessary. The season is available now in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).
B003ZSJ212|4.0|To begin with, the complete saga remastered in full HD is a great adquisition. For even hardcore fans like, me it is a lil' disappointing to see no original trilogy without any changes, any way, the changes made to the films make it really good. For example, the animated  Yoda for episode 1 is just fantastic. So if you don't mind watching a modern anakin skywalker at the end of episode VI, this might be for you. Finally, if you like watching documentaries and behind-the-secnes stuff, this saga collection is right for you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Game is a great &quot;build a city&quot; type game. Only reason iI deleted it was because I play a million other ones that I'm further in. its clever and gameloft always does aa good job. and if you're complaining about toto being able to get home... open bag &gt; stuff &gt; bottom bar appears. gameloft games started on apple products which have a home button as do most tablets. stop freaking out people its not a bug its how gameloft does it. Free and fun!<br /><br />~Seth
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This was a gift and it came very fast. This is one of my favorite Tim Burton movies, a very interesting story with great images.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this is why a lot of gameloft games werent for kindle fire. this game is fun, but everyone has to complain about the memory. what do you people expect?? its a rpg with a huge map. they cant &quot;fix that&quot; do you want them to cut half the map... no. its fun so get over it.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I hats the fact that if you lose all your live you have to start all over.other than that its good
B004LROUNG|4.0|A good fast moving Grisham.  Entertaining read while on vacation. A little light on character development but overall a good read. Thanks!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The Hunger game trilogy was great.  When I got to the Catching Fire I could not go to bed til I finished it.  It is so applicable for today where the goverment is trying to tell us all what to do etc.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its like Mario and it is fun for me. but its in a Irish version but its different that's why I like it.
B000068IEU|2.0|I won't lie to you; I don't like the cinematography style & sound effects of the 70s & I can't stand any genre of music of that decade either, though I have no problem with any decade prior. But even if I turn on 80s music & just watch the film on mute with subtitles, it's still not a good film.<br /><br />The movie bounces back & forth between taking itself sadistically seriously, to dancing around like a monkey in clown shoes. If a horror movie is going to try to make you laugh, it should either be a straight-up horror comedy like \\"Seed of Chucky\\" or just unintentionally funny like \\"The Story of Ricky,\\" but this movie chose to tastelessly integrate slapstick with rape-murder.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />It's not free from potholes & bad acting either; when the parents find their daughter, who was shot in the back while standing in a pond, lying dry in the grass, & the actress is clearly moving, even though she's supposed to be dead.<br /><br />A slight redeeming factor is at the end where the parents take vengeance into their own hands, though the effects are lackluster, & that's why I didn't give it just a single star.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is similar to that of Mario Bros. Kids and I really enjoy.Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
0446615625|5.0|I really enjoyed the Camel Club and would reccommend it to any one who likes a little convoluted story line that does mesh well  and introduces you to some varied personalities.  I enjoy Baldacci's books and am hooked on reading the whole Camel Club series.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|there are a few glitches but over all a pretty fun game really cute animation. wish they would fix the glitches
B007BLCGNU|3.0|Not bad - interesting and well worth watching.  I would not purchase this movie.  DeCaprio was amazing and I do not like him generally speaking.

B007JRU2UK|3.0|While I have never had the opportunity to visit the Island, I found the photography to be wonderful.  However, this movie drags forever in some places...good acting, I suppose, but BORING!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a nice easy build ur own village. its kind of like the movies first part is fun then a little monotonous after u keep adding
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|OK, I am a big Hunter fan, and used to be a big Depp fan, but this is not the same magic combination you see in Fear and Loathing... The performance is good, but the script follows the trend of trying to but too much of a book into a movie, making it just a bit awkward and disjointed (ala Atlas Shrugged)...
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Mission impossible does it again. Makes it possible for another feature film to be an entertaining blockbuster. Already looking forward to the enxt one! Tom Cruise still got it! Paula Patton is fine. 5 stars.<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lovely little puzzle game. The challenges range from graceful and intuative, to just the right kind of frustrating.  The over all layout and presentation are very artful and the music is quite charming.

B004UID2LC|5.0|loved this app. allqaoed me to download all the music I wanted.  only thing I didn't like was the pictures it made in my gallery when I would down load a song.
B002BU4HWE|5.0|It's really a lovely gem of a movie. Christopher Walken is absolutely fabulous, as usual, and if for no other reason, his performace alone is worth money. Yes, it is a V-E-R-Y  L-O-N-G film, but totally worth the effort. Every scene has merit, and the ending really shoked me. I'm so glad for the other reviewers on this site, becuase i would not have understood the significance of the prologue and epilogue otherwise.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|For exiting the program you need to go to the options menu. Other than that I really loved this app.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|This is a perfect story of everything working out in the end. Im getting married and so decided to watch all the wedding movies I could find this didn't disappoint at all. It was great to watch a non-american film gives you an eye into other cultures.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Excellent read. It tied the other two books together. I was disappointed when it ended. Its ashame there are not more of his books.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin creates an in-depth and vivid depiction of a mystical yet realistic depiction of the political games of nobles that took place during the feudal system era.  His unconventional chapters that follow multiple characters allows for intense character growth.  He incorporates gender equality by creating many lead female characters who command immense power in a time where they were pawns for political marriages.  He proves his boldness with shocking twists that are powerfully emotional.  A must read.
0307352145|5.0|Great, well written book.  I encourage all introverts read this, along with parents of introverted children and all teachers.<br />Not only will it add  understanding of yourself, but teachers and parents can better understand that introverted children have gifts and a sensitivity that will enrich your lives and the classroom when given the opportunity to express themselves and be their natural selves.<br />I wish this book had been available to me 40 years ago.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|The season shattered norms by being deservably nominated for multiple Emmy's and Golden Globed, which is unheard of for a fantasy show.  Emotional attachment or vehemence to characters is unavoidable due to the brilliant acting.  It impressively follows the depth, plot, and character building of the book while creating characters of its own that supplement the already existing ones by showing background scheming the book could not convey.  The sexually explicitness of the show is necessary because it shows how women must use sex to exert power in a time that they were second class to men and removed from all lines of succession.  Shocking twists and excellent editing in each episode leaves you longing to see the next episode.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I'm really not understanding the negative reviews. This movie was nonstop. Characters were great and they did a excellent job switching to the new team and explaining things(like what happened to the old team) which they didn't have to do, but they did and it made the movie that much better for me. I usually don't go to the theatre anymore but I did with this one and didn't regret it at all. Awesome movie.
B0025KVLT2|1.0|Okay- do I have to rate the actual album? I mean, it's the Beatles so of course the music is wonderful. What infuriated me is the packaging. I ordered three Beatles CDs that I could have gotten anywhere for the same price, and they were to be gifts. They came in crappy cardboard packaging and look like they were pulled from a box set. They were to be gifts but they look cheesy and awful.
1451627289|5.0|Believe it or not, this book constitutes my first Stephen King 'read.'  I was very impressive.  The novel is multi-layered, and nicely blends in the sci-fi aspects, along with the deep historical research conduct by King, along with a touching love story.  I placed in the title to my review that it was \\"thought provoking.\\"  The thought provoking nature of the work was less about whether Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone gunman.  Rather, it stems from stirring thought and discussion of our individual, and collective, impact upon history, society, life, the ecology, etc.  After action generates an effect -- often, the consequences of this action are indiscernible in the instant, but require the foresight of a long-term understanding of such an impact.<br /><br />Again, this is my first Stephen King book ... it likely will be the first of many.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved the infusion of magic and fantasy that created a world of creativity and exhaustion. I read the book like I usually approach poetry - expecting to enjoy the moment, but that the plot probably wasn't going anywhere linear.  The forward and backwards motion in the storyline made its point about time being meaningless and uncontrollable, but for me, as a reader, it lost me.  I'd read a section and become interested in the key moments and then I'd lose track of what was happening.  When I lose track of the story, I tend to start reading something else.<br /><br />Everything magic-related and tied to something physical such as the tarot cards, the carousel, or the clock fascinated me.  There was a great line in the book where Celia tells her father that she likes birds that think more than birds with a memory.<br /><br />So, this is a great book for readers who like to think or bring life to words on the page and aren't too terribly worried about not remembering every detail that pushes you to the story's conclusion.  There's a lot to love about Night Circus.  Enjoy every word.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. I highly recommend this app to anyone. The reading plans are very good and covet s wide range of topics. You can also share the plans with friends.
0761169253|5.0|What a fantastic book this is. I started reading and couldn't put it down. It's one of those books that you can tell from the very beginning that the author knows what's going on in your head.<br /><br />I wrote down 6 or 7 great tips and started working on them that same day. I have been working on my second book and have been somewhat stuck in the process. This book helped me bust through the fog and now I'm moving full steam ahead.<br /><br />Awesome book. You have to read it! :-)
B007G5H2HQ|1.0|I downloaded movie to Cloud, paid for it. Attempted to download to K Fire, have downloaded movies previously, but Puss and Boots disappeared. Same thing just happened to \\"A Week With Marilyn\\". Wasted six bucks.
0812992792|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have read in years.  I've been long interested in the topic of North Korea and I think Adam Johnson has crafted an amazing and engaging narrative.  It seems that many of the reviewers who gave this book poor reviews struggled with his style of shifting narratives and perspectives, but these shifting perspectives and timelines, which did leave me guessing a bit as to whose voice I was reading, were one of the things that excited me most as I read this book.  I thought it was a very effective means to convey the shifting and unsteady world in which the characters of the novel live.  Why shouldn't we as readers be unsettled and disoriented as we read this novel - the topic and story are incredibly disturbing and tragic.  I think our discomfort is exactly what the author intended.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, if you stick with it to the end and embrace the authors style, you'll find the ending very satisfying.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|its a really fun game and its easy to wait for the energy to raise. BE PATIENT. and it raised all my buildings, animals and everything tto a timer of 679 hours till I can collect.?! whaaaat.?!
B000001DQI|3.0|I used to have the vinyl version of this album but it was destroyed a few years back in a flood. I so wanted to find another copy but the vinyl versions are all but extinct. So I went for the CD.<br /><br />It works ok, but you can tell in a simple listening test that high crescendos generally result in some quite noticeable distortion and clipping. I first thought it was my equipment but the CD plays the same on other high end players as well. A friend's copy also has the same issue. So the transfer from the tapes to digital wasn't done so well.<br /><br />The CD is ok, but if you can find the vinyl, go for that. (Oh; and a decent turntable and cartridge/styli pair!)  :)
0345803485|5.0|I am not quite sure why this book has caused so much converters. Yes, it contains very graphic sex scenes and it uses strong language; but, honestly why are we blinding ourselves to what is really happening in society. This has happened form many years and will continue to happen. E.L. James does a fantastic job of writing and there is never a dull moment.  She is writing this book about something that has been for so long a taboo in our culture; kudos to you E. L. James can't wait to read the next one!

1400069289|5.0|This is a book that helps us understand how habits work through the findings of neuroscientific studies and real life stories of transformation.  The final version of the book available for purchase will include a reader's guide to using these ideas which I highly anticipate.  Upon finishing the book I reflected on two somewhat competing organizations in my community.  One of the goals of both organizations is to get commitment and productivity from its members.  The more successful organization has habits that have driven them to success.  I realized this particular organization was operating much like one example presented in the book.  Therefore this research does seem to have real life application in one's community. I found the research in this book to be very enlightening so if you are interested in learning primarily about the \\"why\\" behind what we do on a daily basis then this is the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love a challenge and this has proved to be difficult enough to not finish the day you download it. really enjoying it

0670023329|5.0|It's horrific to know that such camps still exist in some parts of the world. Nice read although the author deviates from the story of Shin and starts analyzing the political system in North Korea. I guess we will soon hear stories of Syrian camps as well.
B000002Q88|4.0|Believe it or not, THIS was the Kansas album that converted me to being a fan! Sure, I heard Dust In the Wind and all the hits on the radio in the 70's, and my best friend in High School (Shorewood High class of 1979 - go TBirds!) was a huge Kansas fan. In fact, they were his favorite band. But somehow, most of their stuff passed me by until I bought this as a cutout CD in the early 90's and fell in love with it, then slowly trawled back through the catalog and became a fan of all the early stuff as well.<br /><br />This one still has a special place in my heart. Maybe it's Bob Ezrin's production, or the great overwrought drama of some of the songs.<br /><br />If you've not checked this one out or turned up your nose because Kerry and Robby weren't involved, give it another chance.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was so different to other romance novels that I've read. I couldnt put this down and as soon as I finished it I started on the next! They are all fabulous!!

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I absolutely love the game except when you get up to the higher levels there is not as many quest. for all you kindle fire users out there wanting to know how to beg our without shutting off your device all you have to do is push the blue &quot;stuff&quot; button on the lower right hand side then click the &quot;option&quot; button. after that the kindle status bar will come up so you cab just press the home button to go to your main screen.

1469984202|5.0|A friend recommended this story to me, and I figured any e-book would be written like fan fiction but I gave it a try.  WOW!  Was I ever wrong: this is storytelling of a very high level, and I am hooked!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and immediately read the next two in the trilogy!  I read this on my iPad through my kindle app in Cabo, Mexico on vacation.  So cool!  Suzanne Collins has a wonderful way of getting you enthralled in the the love story and human struggle for survival in this book.
B006X415GK|5.0|This b&w Skull Shores Frankie is my 6.5 year old's first Monster High doll. With all the Friday the 13th hype, I couldn't resist ordering her when she was less than ten bucks on Amazon, and then ordered another for my niece when Amazon offered her for sale for $4.13 for a flash sale on 4/13 (despite the fact that no brick and mortar stores within 50 miles of us offered the $4.13 price).<br /><br />Frankie is really cute and sassy, and the bob is the (black, white, and silver) icing on the cake.  Her hair isn't quite as perfect fresh out of the box, but its very easy to comb and style. Frankie seems well made and her monokini and heels are both stylish and fashionably monochomatic. Love having the doll stand and frankly (no pun intended) I might shop around for deals on basic MH dolls while they still are packaged with stands. Sadly unlike the other dolls in the series, Frankie does not have any accessories like the standard MH hairbrush (talk about cheap, no hairbrush??), the Skull Shores map card, a fruity beach drink, sunglasses or \\"floppy\\" beach hat. Considering that Skull Shores is about her, Mattel could have at least included one of those Frankie-head statues in the packaging or a cute tiki necklace or something. There isn't even any reference to the new character Andy that was featured on the show! Are they together? Just friends? What???? Anyway, when compared with the other MH Skull Shores dolls, it's obvious that Mattel omitted some major details to balance the planned lower price.<br /><br />All in all, great doll if you can find a fair price.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I have not read the book yet, but I heard an interview with the author on mpr.org and thought it would be a very interesting read. I am going to read it when my first child is born in July.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely write reviews, although I appreciate the time others spend giving me good insights into their book lists, but I had to add to the chorus about WOOL.  I was a bit skeptical about a self-published book but downloaded it because of the enthusiastic reviews.  It's a great sci-fi, dystopian future read with strong, multi-faceted characters and a surprising plot.  Much more than I expected!  If it was self-published because the standard publishing houses weren't interested, this will be their loss.  Hugh Howey's going to go a long way with this one!  And I'll be checking Amazon's list for his other work.
B0033AI48Y|3.0|good movie - excellent delivery. We enjoyed the movie but the ending was very depressing.  And the beginning seemed ridiculous.  I kind of wish we hadn't purchased it.  I did so on the recommendation of a friend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game.  great job.  like it almost as much as the original Oregon trail game.  keep up the good work!

B006P0FICE|3.0|The Movie was fun, and well made.  I liked the characters and the directors vision in this version of the Three Musketeers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! Entertaining and suspenseful.  Make sure you have some free time set aside; as you will not want to put this book down.  Bravo - such a unique story and admirable characters!  Loved it, now onto the 3rd and final story.  When's the movie coming out????
B005FI6IRG|5.0|Many in the music world have eagerly awaited the release of this album, which features two of the most gifted male sopranos: Philippe Jaroussky and Max Emmanuel Cencic. Those listeners who have marveled at Jaroussky's exploration of Vivaldi's operas through his \\"Vivaldi Heroes\\" Album, and at Cenci's disc of Handel arias, would certainly embrace an album of duets featuring both artists together. Adding the direction and collaboration of the veteran conductor William Christie simply sweetens the anticipation! However, listeners expecting more music like jaw-dropping Vivaldi arias and exciting Handel melodies will not be getting what they anticipate. Instead, the artists have chosen the more intimate, gentle and introspective chamber music of the early Baroque: composers such as Bononcini, Mancini, and Alessandro Scarlatti. These works were originally composed for the most gifted singers of the day, and were meant for small audiences of musical intellectuals. The instrumental accompaniment is minimal: a pair of violins perhaps, a cello, harpsichord,  theorbo or lute. The choices of music include chamber duets (single duets set to poetry), cantatas for two soprano voices, and solo cantatas. In fact, two of the works recorded here (a cantata by Mancini and a cantata by the great operatic master Porpora) are solo cantatas, and feature Jaroussky or Cencic singing alone. There are a total of eight works featured, and the recording engineers graciously separate the recitatives from the arias and duets so that your favorites can be repeated with ease. The music is quiet, beautifully luscious, and sung with sensitivity and love by both singers. Their voices fit together perfectly, flowing through the music with ease and great sensitivity to text and meaning (as noted by William Christie in the liner notes, and one gets the idea that this disc was his brain child). The best way to enjoy this album is to listen with intent in a darkened room, alone or with an intimate friend, aglass of fine wine, and simply let the gorgeous sounds wash over you. It is a true delight to know that this beautiful music has been resurrected.
B000000993|5.0|I wish Tool would release their music on itunes so I don't have to have their cd lying around.  That being said, the artwork is cool as hell, Amazon shipped it fast and I uploaded it to my itunes so I guess it doesn't really matter after all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love the thoughtful challenges. Nice relaxing music accompanies the levels. What are you waiting for? Play already. Try to beat your old scores as well.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Best app I've ever downloaded. It keeps my entire life organized. It's more enjoyable on the Kindle Fire than any other platform.

1416511946|5.0|I am not an avid reader, but this one has me completely enthralled! What an amazing picture Nikki paints with his diary entries about his constant struggles with his demons. I have already recommended this book to many of my friends, whether they are readers or not. Nice, nice work!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love to read and usually I don't steer away from the author of my choice.  I was told about this book and even warned of it's contents but I can honestly say I loved it and before I knew it I couldn't put the book down for anything.  I then proceeded to purchase the other two books and now I have read all three twice.  It's a book you never get tired of and holds your attention and you don't want to stop in fear you will miss something.<br />Even after reading it twice.  Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game fun to play when board.I play this game every day some time when at work when not busy

B0053XM7ZU|1.0|I have only just started this confusing slow book. I dont know if I will bother finishing it or any others in the series.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I first watched Let Me In on Netflix and was very pleasantly surprised. I know, when you hear Vampire and Romance story it may conjure up images of other contemporary vampire/werewolf romance stories. This is very different. This is two misfits who've been beat down and bullied (watch the deleted scene \\"Be Me\\") finding each other and finding love. I'm into alternative love stories like \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" \\"500 Days of Summer,\\" and \\"Say Anything,\\" and I would say this movie fits well into that genre. It does feature scenes of horror and gore that some would find disturbing but I enjoy horror as well. I highly recommend this movie. This is not a teenage dimestore novel trash romance/horror movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game and doesn't require actual money to keep enjoying it.  however it does take time but since the game uses real time instead of game time you can come back later.
B007I5QNRE|5.0|I was very happy with this enhanced kindle edition. In light of anothers comments I must say that it worked perfectly on my iPad Kindle app.<br />I've been an amateur artist with limited success for a while but this is the first book of many I've tried that has modified my thinking to a point at which I feel I may be able to improve.
B007G5GYHA|5.0|all around good movie.  Granddaughter loved it and Grandma and Grandpa loved it too! Would recommend as good for family movie night
B007MNV5WU|3.0|it looks way too much mony I read some of the reivies and it looks like it has 2 levals or whatever I'm not getting it I don't want to pay 2.99
0385534639|5.0|If you enjoy a magic carpet ride, this book is a feast for the senses.  The story unfolds mythically and dramatically, but one has to be patient to let it develop. There were times I wondered how the comingling of stories would come together.  It does just that however, reaching a grande finale I never saw coming. Morgenstern's imagination is something to behold.  Enjoy the ride.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I love chess but this game doesn't tell you when its check mate all the time.  It is confusing! Don't get this game!!!

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|read the book in print when it was publishd originally - Loaned it to so many people after raving about it that it found its way into someones else's library. Decided that it is a book to be read over and over again and the only way to keep it exclusively with me (I'm a sharer!!!!) Bought the e-book (kindle)version and now it's mine forever!
B002N83H52|3.0|This is a book I have wanted to read for awhile. It was avail be at my library on kindle. I enjoyed it from the aspect of being a book lover and loving old book stores. The author did a good job keeping me engaged in the story and I could feel her angst, Like watching a train wreck right before you. I would recommend.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it. Its just like Mario brothers except with leprachauns and bugs. Nice twist. Very cool and its free!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|i would love to have this on my phone but i own an iphone... wish they could have it work for both :/
0345803485|1.0|I, probably like many others, bought this book because it has become a \\"sensation\\".  Since I read erotic, romance, fantasy and suspense stories, I was looking forward to reading what I hoped to be another good BDSM book - ala Anne Rice's The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.  I looked forward to the irresistible dialogue and interaction between the main characters that I've found in many of my favorite books.  Even though I read fiction, I still like my characters to be believable; does the author take me on the journey with the characters?  Does the author make me experience the roller coaster ride of emotions the characters feel? Does the hot, steamy sex make me want to put the book down and drag my partner to the bedroom?  From the start, when EL James couldn't get the geography correct, my usually pleasant diversion into another world hit its first grumpy bump.  I've lived in the Portland, OR metro for many years so I'm fairly familiar with where destinations are in relation to each other.  In no way does one go south from Vancouver to go north to Seattle - unless they're coming from Vancouver, BC, perhaps.  And, in no way is the Heathman hotel within a 5 mile radius of Vancouver, WA.<br /><br />This was my first clue the author did shoddy research.  The second, the female protagonist, Anastasia, is such an unreal, unbelievable and unintelligent character, it was difficult to turn the pages (figuratively, of course, since I have a Kindle!) to see what other doltish things she had to say (kudos to the reviewer who counted how many times Anastasia said geez, holy geez or some variation thereof - thanks to her handy dandy Kindle). The male protagonist, Christian, also, was really a weak character.  I've never seen a more wishy-washy, hand wringing dom in all of my readings!  And he has, at 27, an established, multi-million dollar company?  Even Bill Gates wasn't a multi-millionaire at age 27!  My roller coaster ride with the characters was turning into a house of horrorride.<br /><br />Okay, I thought, the author doesn't engage the reader with  any kind of witty dialogue and interaction between the main characters, unless you count all the wrenching, waffling indecision Anastasia  goes through with Christian - do I want to do this, do I not, do I want to do this, yada yada yada?  She doesn't make Christian a dom at all - he fluctuates between telling Anastasia one thing and then caving in when she starts on her waffling.  Oh the drama of it all!<br /><br />So, what's left of my roller coaster ride if the characters don't incite passion with their witty dialogue and interaction - sex!  This is, after all, a BDSM story so I was expecting some riveting, intense, mind blowing erotica.  Alas, this, this last part of my ride that should bring me some measure of satisfaction fell so flat that it was all I could do to stay awake during those parts - when I wasn't grimacing during Anastasia's third, fourth or was it the fiftieth orgasm?  Unfortunately, since they had sex on every other page, I was bored and exhausted at the same time and wondering if the story would ever end!  I very much wanted to get off of the roller coaster ride this story put me on.
B004FOA84A|5.0|As most reviews state, the game is quick.  I finished it in a short afternoon road-trip while my husband was driving.  But other than that, I really liked the game/puzzles and they kept me engaged--I didn't put it down until I finished.  I thought the quality of the game was good while playing it on a smaller Android tablet (Archos 43IT).  Again, the only thing I would have liked is if the game was longer and had more puzzles.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love it! this is a great weather app.  it tells you so much info in just one click of a finger. I will use this a lot
B000W91RUG|5.0|Indeed they do and I've met more than a few of them in my lifetime. Four brilliant but socially challenged individuals trying to relate to and interact with one another and with a free spirited girl next door from Nebraska. Throw in a born-again plain spoken mother from Texas, a couple of socially challenged females and the laughs come fast and furious. The Big Bang Theory is a sure cure for a bad day at the office. At times I've laughed so hard it worried my dogs!

B004J4WKS8|1.0|This diet mimics Dr. Atkins  diet and doesn't offer any new brilliant solutions. I joined the support group offered by dr. Dukan, only to find out that the revews were not personalized and my weekly entries, most likely, were not even read by their staff. A total scan as far as I'm concerned...
B0055SWM08|5.0|game is fun and challenging but not super hard to beat :-) if you like to think and have fun get this game. and its not spendy
0345803485|2.0|Anna is a complete idiot. Her unbelievable innocence made me cringe. I believed the hype and the hype was wrong.  She gets on my nerves.  She is not sexy and her conversations she continues to have with herself were so damn boring.. Between her continued use of \\"Holy Crap\\" and \\"Holy Cow\\" and the worse \\"He is so bossy\\" are more annoying then the fact that she constantly complains about everything.  Her friend Kate is horrible.  Why should we believe that Christian Grey, Dominate/CEO is intimidated by Kate, recent college grad?  I truly did not enjoy this book, I will not spend any more money on this series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|pretty fun game too bad some of the things you have to legitimately pay for some of the things in the game
B0067Q04AM|5.0|i am loving every song, evan the ones with guest singers.  However he piced the best of the best to sing on this cd.  Minus Blahyuk. or whatever his name is.  Afro blue remake is the best song on the CD! Pick up if you are a true r&B Jazz lover!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty cool. It is a nice time killer at the very least. The going is a bit slow but it is really not bad for a free game.
B005SEKMH4|5.0|Writer backs up his book with plenty of evidence and written in a clear simple language that is easy to understand.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Bowei here, this is a nice little device for people that need all it's features. If not, then there are plenty of other devices that do some of it's functions but at much cheaper a price. This is for someone who want's everything or wants a DAC and amp with plenty of options! This is the device.<br /><br />For Head-Fi'ers and audiophile's: With the E17 in use as a DAC and compared to the iPod Touch 2G's Cirrus Logic DAC. It is of course warmer. Wolfson magic as well all know it. However this type of warmess isn't the bad warmess where if the song is already mastered warm...it just get's warmer. The warmness doesn't over power the lyrics or anything. It just adds this brightness and ring of ...warmth around it. Compared to that, the Cirrus Logic is noticeable colder, but has more forward vocals. Current generation music actually may have a benefit with the features of the Cirrus Logic chip. If not for the fact that despite it having many qualities that would suit current music better, it is still sonically obsolete compared to the WM8740 in the E17. Despite the Wolfson being pulled down a bit in vocals, it still excels in every area better than the Cirrus Logic, the warmess is actually loved by me for all type's of music.<br /><br />Tips: When you get the device, first make sure the lock/hold switch is disengaged. When it is disabled, you will not see the orange strip. Many users get too excited when opening it that they forget it is usually enabled by default and can't turn on the device...for obvious reasons. Next also remember that some devices will come with not enough power. I've heard of devices that turn on and off right when they get them. Charge it first. For S/PDIF, remember your audio drivers and audio chip NEEDS to support 192KHz for you to use it. USB on this device is Class 1 so it doesn't need drivers but to get 192KHz from S.PDIF, your audio drivers need to support it as does your chip's S/PDIF(not regular) specifications need to support 192KHz.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have read all of Bill Landay's novels and the previous two were fabulous - but Defending Jacob was pure brilliance.  Part of the attraction is I live in the town where the novel is set and I identify with all of the places and character traits he describes in the town - he is dead on.  But more than that - Landay weaves a story with so much detail and so much of the day to day life in these characters that even a non-resident would feel like this family lives in their town.  The twists and turns are subtle but powerful.  I could not put this book down.  It grabs you and takes you on a psychological thrill ride of deceit and fascination.  I highly recommend this book as well as both of the others written by Bill Landay - Mission Flats and The Strangler.

0345803485|2.0|I gave into the hype. Started the book without any preconceived notions. I must admit that I did not know the book was \\"erotic\\" when I bought it. All of the references to it on Facebook and on Good Morning America piqued my interest. I don't get it. Interesting enough story \\"idea\\" but not developed or explored anywhere near adequately enough to rate the book well. The endless repetition of certain words and phrases was distracting - no, annoying.
B00008BXJG|1.0|Others have mentioned this regarding the poor sound quality of this 2003 Remaster. Trust me, they are right! We all know the album is a classic, brilliant music. Anybody who has heard the Vinyl or previous 1994 remaster knows that this 2003 remaster sounds terrible! Its has way too much treble and there is no slam/punch to the drums and bass. It sounds nothing like how this album sounded when it originally came out on Vinyl. If you love this album and care about good sound quality, do yourself a favour and buy either the 1994 remaster or UK Vinyl. You will see what i mean, this just sounds tinny.
B004VF68AQ|4.0|I've been a JA fan since the early 90s... I've been through the ups, the downs, the breakups, the reunions, everything. I remember listening, mesmerized, to Classic Girl on a distant, fuzzy FM station as a kid in the early 90s. Those were the days, indeed. All that said, I think The Great Escape Artist is a very good album from the band that defined alternative rock and provided the platform to launch the grunge movement.<br /><br />Is The Great Escape Artist as genre-defining or influential as their self-titled 1987 debut record or Nothing's Shocking? No. Is the music up to the par set by these albums, Ritual, and Kettle Whistle? Yes. Even the best songs on Strays, an album which I found to be surprisingly middling, can't touch the best songs on Artist. Where Strays sort of flowed along at an even keel, never approaching the heights of greatness (or the depths of mindless pop rock), Artist ebbs and flows all over the spectrum.<br /><br />There's nothing I despise more (well, there is, but my point wouldn't hit as hard if I worded it as such) than a band that doesn't evolve, grow, or (god forbid) mature. Take a band like Faith No More and compare them to a band like AC/DC (sorry, love you guys!) and you'll see what I mean. While the former can churn out an album that'll have you checking the label to make sure you're listening to right group, the latter can (albeit successfully) remake the same album over and over and be content.<br /><br />The Great Escape Artist sounds like the ideal evolution of a band that started out as straight alt rock before they delved into electronic music and finally found a happy medium between the two. I would not be a satisfied listener if Jane's Addiction attempted to remake Nothing's Shocking over and over again. Thankfully, they have not. On the flipside, it's unrealistic to expect a band like Jane's Addiction to repeatedly revolutionize rock over and over again. How many bands can you name that defined an entire genre with EVERY release? While I can think of many great bands, I can't think of any that fit this criteria. People whining about Artist not being as influential or groundbreaking as Nothing's Shocking can therefor go away, for all I care. (Likewise people crying about Eric Avery. He was here, now he's not. Deal with it.)<br /><br />Let's take a look at the music itself, because at the end of the day, that's all that really matters. There's nothing I like more (well, there is, but...) than albums that grow on you over time. I'll admit it-- I wasn't overly impressed with The Great Escape Artist on my first (or even second) listen. Often times, these sorts of albums are precisely the ones that become favorites down the road. In the case of Artist, there is SO MUCH going on sonically in every song that it's simply impossible to take it all in with just one or two listens. Before you know it, you're picking up on subtle nuances in the music and lyrics, actually anticipating your next listen. Songs like Underground and End to the Lies are razor-sharp and hit hard. Not since the one-two punch of Up the Beach/Ocean Size has a JA album opened so well. I'm especially a fan of lyrics on Artist. I've read a lot of comments here panning the lyrics; they're boring, uninspired... Are we listening to the same album? The lyrics on End to the Lies, for example, are far edgier and insightful than anything on Strays. Yeah, Perry no longer sings about jacking razors or pissing on himself in the shower, but then again he's no longer a kid.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, this album is all over the place and much less consistent than Strays or some of the earlier records. In some ways, this is actually a strength. There are moments that really \\"wow\\" you. There are others (not many... ok, maybe one) that have you reaching for the \\"Next\\" button. It's the lulls, however, that make the peaks hit you even harder. The album opens with two power hitters, then sort of drops off for a couple tracks before coming back strong with I'll Hit You Back, one of the album's best. Splash a Little Water on It was initially one of my favorite tracks, after repeated listens, it's near the bottom of my list. Funny how that works out sometimes. Broken People is a beautiful song and fights a good fight for best track alongside End to the Lies. Broken People is Artist's answer to the mellow Jane Says on Nothing's Shocking or Ritual's Classic Girl. I still haven't decided how I feel about album-closer Words Right Out of My Mouth. I like the fast-paced rocker vibe, but I don't know if I like the song structure. Time will tell. Curiosity Kills and Ultimate Reason are certainly more than competent efforts and manage to assert themselves quite successfully with catchy hooks. Ironically, my least favorite track on the record would have to be the \\"epic single\\" Irresistible Force. To me, this song just isn't JA. I can't dig it. This was the first track I heard from the album, before it was even released, and as a result my expectations were pretty low going in.<br /><br />It's no coincidence I've chosen Strays as a point of comparison throughout this piece. Strays is as close a contemporary as you'll get to Artist and features the same lineup (Farrell, Navarro, Perkins, Chaney), even if guest keyboardist-guitarist-bassist-jack-of-all-trades Dave Sitek didn't show up until the Artist sessions. If Strays has any leg up on Artist, it's the mix. I've seen criticisms of this in comments here, and I'd have to agree. The mix is somewhat muddy, and the guitars way too low. Guitars should be front and center on a JA album, and don't even get me started on the whole Loudness War B.S.  I sincerely hope whomever produced and mixed this album is fired for their next outing. Strays, by comparison, sounds very crisp and clear with plenty of loud, rockin' guitars.<br /><br />It's a shame so many people haven't given Artist enough of a chance to really appreciate it. It's much more evolved than Strays and I personally can't wait to see where they go next. Although, I'm not sure why they need Dave Sitek. If they're going to bring in someone to \\"help out,\\" I'd much rather see an appearance by, say, Peter DiStefano. Maybe next time.

1434404374|4.0|Agatha Christie wrote this book -- supposedly after a dare by a relative -- in 1916, although it wasn't published until 1920.  It was her first novel and introduced Hercule Poirot, the retired Belgian detective who was to star in many of her later novels and short stories.  All of the hallmarks of Christie's later books are evident here:  In addition to Poirot, we have narration by Arthur Hastings -- at this point only a lieutenant rather than a captain, as he later was -- who right from the start is oblivious to his own obtuseness and skeptical of Poirot's deductive abilities, a murder at a stately country home, key evidence necessary to solve the mystery given during the narration, and some very red herrings.  As a first effort, it is a bravura performance and it is no wonder that it was enough to launch Christie on a decade's long career.<br /><br />If this novel has any significant drawbacks, it is that some of Poirot's deductions are so convoluted as to be a bit implausible and some of the herrings are a little too red.  I also recently read \\"Curtain,\\" which Christie wrote in the mid-1940s, although she held back publication until the 1970s because it was written to be Poirot's last case.  I would say \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is in most respects a better book, even though \\"Curtain\\" was written near the end of Christie's prime.  Certainly, \\"Styles\\" is a more enjoyable book because the gloom of Poirot's decline hangs over \\"Curtain.\\"<br /><br />I believe the copyright on this book has lapsed and it is now in the public domain.  Hence, the proliferation of editions currently available.  Curiously, the new series of paperbacks by Harper, which include just about every book Christie has written, do not include \\"Styles.\\"  That is too bad because the Harper paperbacks are first rate.  One word of warning:  The free e-book versions apparently do not include several figures that are included in the print editions.  The edition that I read includes these figures,although the printing of them is a bit blurry for some reason.  So, if you are a Christie fan, it may be worth your while to spend a few buck to buy a print edition.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I bought this book at the suggestion of a friend. While I at first found nothing special about the writing itself, Collins has an amazing depth to her characterisation. Seeing Katniss's world through her mind - rather than just through her eyes - makes everything seem much more real and harsh.<br /><br />The writing itself gets better a few chapters in without you noticing, so the book melds seamlessly with your imagination.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book.
143353083X|3.0|This review is for the personal size ESV Study Bible. I purchased this Bible for its portability and lower price compared to the hardcover ESV Study Bible. That being said, I find it difficult to read because of the small font size and single-column formatting.  If you need a portable reference Bible it is still a good buy.  But if you just need a portable Bible without the reference I prefer the Thinline Bible for its portability, larger font and double column formatting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome time waster and its free. I was skeptical at first but it is addictive and worth it. get it you wont be sorry.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|I enjoyed MI-GP for the first hour and a half.  Then I became impatient for it to end.  The action sequences are spectacular - well, as long as you don't think about them.  An essential aspect of an action film is a believable sense of danger.  The problem with making characters impervious to injury is the sense of danger evaporates.  It doesn't matter how scary what they're doing is if you know they will just get up and walk away at the end of the scene.  The many ridiculous aspects of the film wouldn't matter if the characters were believable, but because they are not we are left with a series of fast moving puzzles - it's all about timing and positioning like those old video games where you jump from one platform to another while the clock ticks.<br /><br />It's not surprising that some people love this film and others do not.  MI-GP does whiz-bang action better than anything I've seen to date, and if that's enough for you then this is your film.  If, like me, you need more than that then it will disappoint.  Just be clear on which camp you're in and all will be well :-)

0738711500|5.0|This is only my second tarot deck and it was purchased for me as a gift. My first deck was a miniature deck from Barnes and Nobles bookstore.<br /><br />I absolutely love this set. The book is simple, concise and to the point. The author makes great suggestions for preparing your deck, keeping a tarot diary and really getting to know your cards through some very practical methods (reading the interpretations out loud, for instance). I found that just by studying the artwork of the cards, I was already getting a very good gist of the meanings before even looking at the book. A wonderful gift and I look forward to doing my first reading soon!

0385342063|5.0|It was written by Sophie Kinsella what more do you need to know?<br /><br />Yes again she has published a fantastic novel, I started reading it on the plane and it made the whole journey seem a lot quicker. It was another novel that I started reading and didn't want to put down, so read it in one go. Even made me cry at the end ;)<br /><br />Well done Sophie, cant wait for the next one :)
B000244FDW|5.0|I spin wool into yarn on a spinning wheel and drop spindle everyday. So when I'm spinning I watch/listen to movies.  I love Jane Austen and have watched several movies on PBS and thought this would be a great movie to watch/listen to while I was spinning.  I truely enjoyed watching it while I was spinning and hope to buy another one of these movies soon.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Best new music I've heard in a long time.  The only way I can think to describe the Alabama Shakes is that they feel like little pieces of your entire 60's and 70's record collection rolled into one tight, rocking, soulful modern band.  Does that make sense?  Does to me.
1849163847|5.0|This was a very compelling story in which the murder to be solved took back seat to the human drama played out through the main characters. Moving easily from present to past and back again to reveal the complex relationships of 3 childhood friends and a cast of supporting players, I was fully invested in the outcome, which was somewhat unexpected but completely believable. The narration added to the sense of authenticity, with the scottish brogue adding to the atmosphere heavy with rain, fog and memories. There is a sense of being fully immersed in the culture and traditions of island life that, for better or worse, changes little over the span of years. Thankfully this tradition bound community is not protrayed with a quaintness born of false sentimentality. Real blood runs through the veins of these people. Fin Macleod is a protagonist whose past has been tragic, yet you can still sense life and optimism in him. I am moving immediately to the next in the series, The Lewis Man.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have never been more gratified.  This book and the second truly provides the imagination with a plethora of inspiration.<br />I wish I could forget reading them just so I can re-read them for the first time again.<br />The beginning of a beginning of a beginning.<br />I couldn't even describe the story to my friends and family until half way through the first book. Even then the layers upon layers of story plots made me love it even more.  It was a roller coaster and when you finish you are left with a wonderful memory of love, loss, fantasy, intelligence, passion, courage, hurt and more love.<br />I still don't feel I can describe the book with the justice it deserves.<br />If you read it, no wait, you should read it and enjoy a new friend.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|but it glitched after about a week of playing. everything reset itself to like 80 hours before it would be ready. uninstalled. too bad, it was fun..
B004RLPWXS|4.0|I grew up with Duran Duran and loved all of the old stuff.  Complete albums.  Then I collected all the albums in the 90s and all the ones in the 2000's also.  Then John Taylor left the band and you could really tell.  The whole bass feel was off.  But now he is back, Simons voice is as strong as ever and the band is back with some really strong songs on this album that sound like Duran Duran. Songs like 'Girl Panic', 'And All You Need is Now' are probably the two you'll hear first but the more you listen to the album the more it grows on you.  'Blame the Machines' is a throw back to their very first album.  'Being Followed' has that 'Planet Earth' feel. 'Safe' is a totally different sound for them but you can hear John Taylors Bass loud and clear.  All and all I think it is a good throw back to their roots. If you are a Duran Duran fan you wont be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has a nice selection. The games are simple but addicting, and the coin system is decent. Its nice that you get coins regardless of if you beat your previous score, so find a game you like and rack 'em up.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book / story was good although at first I found it very depressing. Later on though, I looked at it as the spirit of survival and resistance against unfair oppression is part of the human spirit.<br />The one thing I do not like about this series, is that it is written in the first person. I hate books written in that format, unless you are writing an autobiography, a diary, or a blog. It doesn't work for me as a fiction.
0743496728|3.0|It's a little difficult for me to give a star rating -- on one hand, it was a page-turner it most spots, and I enjoyed reading it (again, MOST of the time. It was definitely too long and needed some trimming). But when I was done, I just thought, \\"Really? I spent all this time on THAT?\\" Kinda like eating a bag of Cheetos or something -- kinda fun, but doesn't make you feel satisfied when you're done.<br /><br />I counted no less than five times in this book that someone's \\"jaw dropped\\" or their \\"mouth fell open.\\" Um, when have you *EVER* seen someone's jaw actually drop because they were surprised ... let alone five times in one book?<br /><br />Interestingly, all the descriptions of the victims brought eye rolls from me, and little or no sympathy. Maybe because those characters seemed somewhere between cardboard cut-outs and flat-out dispicable. It also felt forced to me. I didn't feel any emotions about the beautiful girl needing plastic surgery, but I did almost chuckle slightly when she sobbed on the witness stand, \\"I was the homecoming queen!\\"<br /><br />What did I like, then? I read eagerly to find out the ending (which I thought was underwhelming), and I liked that it was basically an easy read.<br /><br />Most of all, I enjoy reading anything with a courtroom scene .... which makes me think that for my next read, I should skip Piccoult (I had been told this was one of her better books) and her \\"jaw-dropping\\" characters and look for a good courtroom drama.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a great little app that's just a pleasure to tinker with. I find myself mesmerized repeatedly. I hope they continue development.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never review books, I read all kinds of different and books and I think whether a book is good or bad is subjective to the reader, however....I LOVED this series. Well written, interesting, fast paced. I hope Hugh Howey continues to write for a long time, I just bought First Shift, and I can't wait to read it.

B005VTGB0S|4.0|This is a nice, sturdy case that holds my iPad securely. It's not exactly fancy (it IS AmazonBasics) but it gets the job done, and has a pleasantly simple design that won't clash with your wardrobe or anything. It's also not very expensive, as iPad cases go. It seems to do a good job protecting the device, unlike some of the cheaper options. The angles set into the casing are also quite handy for whatever you're using the iPad for, from writing in Pages to watching a movie. I'd definitely say that this is a good case to get for your iPad; it's well worth the money.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. just wish the time to get more energy was quicker and wish when you accidental ly tap another person as you are playing,, you didn't have to always find the exsit.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas is an A**HOLE he knows what we want and refuses to give us a blu-ray quality of the actual original production with surround sound. Yet several times he's acted like he was giving us what we wanted then you get it and you find it has crappy video and audio, or like this version where he calls it original when it's the remake.
0786915749|5.0|I don't remember how long it has been now since the first time I laid eyes on the Dragons of Autumn Twilight; I couldn't tell you the date of the first time I cracked the spine, or the first time I sat up for hours glued to the pages, or the first time I fell in love with each and every one of the characters.  I can tell you that since that first time, I have re-read this book, as well as it's two equally excellent (if not, in fact, more magnificent) sequels, Dragons of Winter Night and Dragons of Spring Dawning.  I do know that it was the Dragonlance series that first turned me on to the fantasy genre.  I mean, I had read The Hobbit before, for school, and I'm sure there were other books, but none of them have surpassed the excellence captured between the covers of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's amazing Chronicles Trilogy.  I have come to turn to these books as a kind of support system.  I can recite parts of them verbatim, and if I am ever feeling sad or lost, I can pick up any one of the dog-earred copies of these novels and turn to certain pages-- for instance in Xak Tsroth when Bupu first falls in love with Raistlin (she keeps insisting on trying to give him a dead lizard to cure his magic-related illness)-- that can always bring a smile to my face.  Or, if I feel hopeless and have lost all faith, I can read the part when Goldmoon first uses the staff of Mishakal to save the life of her beloved Riverwind, who was just hideously burned by the black dragon Khisanth.  I cannot emphasize enough how much these books mean to me, or how entertaining of a read they are.  And to make matters even better, this trilogy is only the beginning!!  In fact, the Companions introduced in this book go on to populate the world of Krynn over the course of the Legends Trilogy, the Lost Chronicles Trilogy, and other additional spin off series such as The Chaos War.  It never fails to make me smile when reading a new Dragonlance book and a reference is made to one of the original Companions.  If you love fantasy, if you love dragons and elves and high sorcery, if you love forbidden love and forgotten realms and gods that walk the earth-- if you love any of these things, then these books will thrill and excite you (I hope) as much as they have me.  Welcome to the world of Krynn.  Be prepared to sit back and enjoy.  Perfect to keep you company in front of a roaring fire on a cold winter night, or underneath the sun during a beach vacation.  The Chronicles trilogy provide warmth and amusement, old-fashioned chivalry and never-forgotten jealousy, love and loss and friendship that never dies.  Oh, and did I mention the dragons?  :-)  I promise you will love it.  Dive in.ompanions.

1400069289|5.0|I love reading books on popular psychology but many of them, unfortunately don't live up to my expectations.  This book was exactly the opposite.  It was vastly better than I could have hoped for.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400069289 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business]] is all about the science of habits - why we do the things we do and how those habits come about.<br /><br />The strengths of the book are many.  First, the author is a very talented writer.  He's able to seamlessly blend together scientific studies, business case studies, and personal anecdotes for a book that is compelling to read, and never dry.  Second, this book has a lot of breadth.  The examples he references are varied and he also talks about habit formation among individuals, groups/companies, and societies.  Third, he's a good researcher.  His citations are vast and from talking to my friends who work in the field, reputable and strong.<br /><br />But probably my favorite part of this book was how inspiring and thought provoking it was.  After reading it I immediately began thinking of ways I could incorporate it into my job and my own personal behavior.  I found myself recommending it to other colleagues and sharing favorite quotes.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a fantastic read for anyone who is fascinated by human behavior.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's pretty good, but I don't play it that often because it's not the best game. it's more of an I'm really bored type of games.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I ordered this from the public library but the waitlist was very long so I bought it from amazon. it was well worth the money to get it so fast.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really am enjoying this game.  Some have complained about the slow restocking of energy, but I just leave the game for an hour or two, &amp; it's full energy when I come back.  I like the fact that I can build &amp; buy whatever I need so far without spending real money.  Many other online games get stuck unless you spend some money, &amp; I refuse to do that.  So American Settlers is great in my book!
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book against my better instincts.  Because of all the hype,  I went ahead and purchased it.  Boy do I regret it.  I couldn't get past the first 50 pages. At it's best, the writing was sophomoric, at it's worst, it was embarrasingly bad.  I dry-heaved every time she mentioned her \\"Inner Goddess\\".<br /><br />I don't think I'm a very high-brow reader.  I mean, I enjoyed The Hunger Games series just as much as I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice.  But there is no excuse for this sort of drivel.  It's a waste of good paper.<br /><br />It's going back tomorrow.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I can't even start playing the game. Its all blocky and bad looking. Not worth it! What a joke!! Waste of space and money!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. A great time passer and an amazingly easy to learn system. I recommend it to anyone looking for a nice casual game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book from the beginning is terrible and not relatable or readable. if you are going to write about a place like Â«The CouveÂ» then know about it.  Seriously why is our heroine at a WSU branch campus and not at PSU or UP or any of the other hip private colleges in Portland where a young english major should be attending. the chicks roomate drives a mercedes so they have the money. The writing is stale. Young people do not speak like 19th century characters from a Jane Austin novel.  I couldn`t finish this book, it is so bland and unbelievable (at 22 you will never be with lack of things to do on a friday night in PDX, for christsake the author could have watched an episode of Portlandia to figure that out). They are calling this mommy porn, I am telling you as a mommy, to save your money, Amazon sells a wide array of Â«personal massagersÂ» that will get you off alot faster. Thanks Amazon Prime!
B003CYKCHW|5.0|Granted I've only had it for about a month now, but its still working great.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />The mouse was a little bit smaller than I imagined, but it fits perfectly in my hand none the less (though I have somewhat small hands so it might be an issue with larger hands).<br /><br />It's more of a grippy-textured feel rather than a smooth slick design, but this works out great.<br /><br />The thumb bridge is amazing and you never really notice how much the thumb gets in the way until you have this.<br />The two addition buttons next to the thumb are in a good place and work out well.<br /><br />The DPI settings are nice as well.<br /><br />Cons -<br /><br />The scroll wheel is a little bit clunky - not that big of an issue<br />The cord is insanely long, had to wrap it around a couple of times (again, not a big issue at all)<br /><br />Overall it is a very nice gaming mouse that feels great in the hand and works very well (so far)
B007UXSPK2|1.0|Look, we all know why we watched this turkey: to see Tom Cruise clinging to the glass sides of the world's tallest building.  That's what they used to sell the thing, the rest is just the usual action-movie bag of tricks.  Nothing in the screenplay makes the remotest amount of sense. I particularly like the irony of a movie filmed largely in an Arab country - but featuring a Swedish terrorist.<br /><br />This is unquestionably the worst-written, worst-directed, worst-acted and worst-edited film I've seen in years.  And as for the sequence of Cruise \\"climbing\\" the Burj Khalifa, it had all the suspense of watching Jello set.  It was patently obvious that the film-makers had build a horizontal facade, so that, rather than climbing, Cruise is actually crawling along the thing, wearing a ridiculous pair of suction gloves.<br /><br />Cruise at least tried to juice the thing up.  His co-stars seemed to have drugged themselves in order to dull the pain of delivering their lines.
1594202842|5.0|Just finished Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother and it was fantastic! I loved Amy Chua's honesty and comedic chops. Was she a tyrant to her children? Of course! I wouldn't have wanted her for my mother necessarily, but at least she's honest about it. She was as tough on herself as she was on the girls. Her writing style is wry and funny, and the stories and scenes with her girls were equal parts terrible and hilarious. As a mother of two girls myself, I would be lying if I didn't think some of the things she said from time to time. Would I admit it? Probably not in a novel, I'm not brave enough to say what's really on my mind in some cases, especially with my children. Anyway, if you have a chance, check this book out. It's a quick read and you'll cringe, laugh, and cheer them all on in the end. Thank you, Amy, for being brave and honest enough to write this book!

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|After viewing \\"Sicko\\" and believing that film maker Michael Moore would never decieve us or lead us astray, I have come to sad reality that this government would rather see us DIE than to give us quality healthcare. Rather see our elderly literally walking along the street aimlessly wearing a hospital gown,( after being kicked out of the hospital ) than be given more time in a hospital bed to convalesce.  Would rather desert those heroic individuals who aided and tended to the wounded on 9-11, who are now,themselves, suffering from what they were exposed to at groundzero-- than to make sure they were receiving all that they needed that would aid them in making  full recoveries. NO, attention and care for them was to be had in Cuba ! Who would allow a little girl to die ! Thanks alot, HUMANA ! It's a reality...we are expendable. Have the powers-that-be's consciences stopped talking to them completely? Where is their humanity? It's become blinded... by all that GREEN !
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its fun and simple<br />similar to mario i suppose<br />but very fun<br />keep trying and you get used to the touch screen

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Edited: The game makers have updated and fixed the very bad bugs; much better now! However, I keep getting quests that require things unavailable in the store - for instance, the barber shop does not currently exist as an item you can purchase in-game. Definitely an improvement - more 3.5 stars than 3 - but still, how hard is it to audit quests and the store to make sure they aren't in conflict?<br /><br />__________________<br /><br />note: I use this app on a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />OT is, unlike its peregrinating predecessor, essentially a resource management game, challenging and fun. If it worked right, I'd give it five stars without hesitation.<br /><br />However.  I've been playing for no more than a week, and for the second time it glitches in such a way that my in-process items (like growing crops) are suddenly set to zero percent produced; worse, the time to complete is also reset to some insane multiple. In my most recent glitch, 5-hour crops will now take a bit over 24 hours of production. In the first glitch, my best properties were suddenly set to 150+ hours of production. There is no way short of destruction to terminate a process, so now I either wait it out hoping for no more issues or destroy properties and rebuild, wasting resources that should go to other purposes.<br /><br />This game pushes in-game real-dollar purchases pretty heavily. Would I be so stupid as to spend real money on a game this flawed? No, no I would not.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Rovio has taken the seemingly worn out series to the next level. This game, though kind of short, really makes good on what can be accomplished when the developers put their minds at task. Plays great on the Kindle Fire! Thanks Rovio.
B006ZPJWBM|1.0|I was greatly disappointed as neither of the two cd's would play (two copies of the same, one for a gift)<br />I even tried them on my car radio and had the same result<br /><br />I am still waiting for the credit
B000TEPKS4|3.0|This is a great compilation of some important material from The Band.  That being said, it sounds a little more dated than I would have expected from such an iconic group.
B006RUJST6|5.0|OMG this book was so great, I was randomly looking on AMAZON for a new book to read. I didnt know the Author or never heard of her so I just ordered the sample, I got hooked on the first few pages and bought the entire book immediately. All the characters are very interesting and have amzing personal stories. I love how I can some how feel what the characters are feeling at the time of reading. I love books I can read that make me feel all emotions, and this book just that! Im buying and starting the 2ND book today!
0749942010|3.0|A bit scary, but all in all a good read.  The book club enjoyed it.  Good plot, tension and resolution.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I gave the book 4 stars because I thought the third book was not as good as the first two books.  The third book seemed to me to be rushed and did not flow as well as the first twoo books.  Overall the books were great and I am not person that reads books very fast.  I read these three books in little less than a week.  I did not want to put the book down.  I would recommend these books to everyone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very fun game. you get to build your own village. it is fun especially if you know the ice age movies. those are fun shows. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone with a kindle fire.
B005VR91UW|5.0|Fifty-five years after its initial release, Little Richard's debut LP resounds with the primordial fire of rhythm `n' blues' jump to rock `n' roll. Richard took everything up a notch - the tempos, the innuendo and above all, the volume and energy of his vocals. Recorded primarily at New Orleans' legendary J&M studios, Richard was backed by the cream of the Crescent City's musicians, including Lee Allen, Alvin Taylor, Frank Fields and Earl Palmer. Though the same crew could be heard on other artists' records, with Richard in the lead, they heated up their New Orleans boogie-woogie as on few other sessions. There's a level of fervor, abandon and outrageousness in both Richard's singing and piano playing that none of his fellow founders could match.<br /><br />The original dozen tracks clock in at just over 28 minutes, but it's 28 minutes of killer rock `n' roll, with zero filler. The first hits were \\"Tutti Frutti,\\" \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" \\"Slippin' and Slidin',\\" \\"Rip it Up,\\" \\"Ready Teddy\\" and \\"She's Got It.\\" Three more - \\"Jenny Jenny,\\" \\"Miss Ann\\" and \\"True Fine Mama\\" - charted in '57 and '58. That leaves only three that didn't chart - \\"Can't Believe You Wanna Leave,\\" \\"Baby\\" and \\"Oh Why?\\" - each of which has the same incendiary spark of the better known singles. The CD reissue adds three audio tracks and two videos. The audio includes Richard's two original audition tracks and a previously unreleased interview with Specialty Records founder Art Rupe. Rupe talks about the audition tape, Richard's persistence at getting signed, the New Orleans sessions, the impact of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and the on-again, off-again career it created.<br /><br />The audition tracks - Little Richard originals \\"Baby\\" and \\"All Night Long\\" - are surprising for their lack of indication of what was to come. Richard sang straight blues, with the band subdued behind him, not even hinting at the rock `n' roll mayhem he'd bring to his Specialty sessions. Rupe, looking for a B.B. King-type singer, heard something he liked, but had no idea what he was really getting. The videos are color screen tests (for [[ASIN:B000FKO3US The Girl Can't Help It]]) of Richard lip-synching \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" highlighted visually by his swanky suits, awesome pompadour, pencil-thin moustache and his uninhibited dancing in the instrumental breaks. The set's 24-page booklet includes photos, the album's original liner notes, new notes by Lee Hildebrand, and a poster of the album cover. Rock `n' roll stars simply didn't shine any brighter than this. [©2012 Hyperbolium]ing he liked, but had no idea what he was really getting.

B005M2V2K8|5.0|I was thinking about getting this little kitty for myself since I am away at college and need something to cuddle from time to time, then I read the review where the reviewer's kid asked to send it back and get the \\"right one.\\"  Broke my heart!  I ordered it right away lol.  A lot of reviews are right, the colors are significantly lighter and the cat is a bit smaller than I had anticipated.  The eyes are much closer together than in the picture and makes the little kitty look more like a chihuahua than a kitten.  Oh well though, still cute!  Super soft and a nice little size.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its. like my favorite Mario game I played it on my friends I pod touch but the stupid credit card wont come!!! bye.  :)

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I bought only because the first two 'books had no real ending so you had to keep going. The first was okay but the second was terrible as well from a writing quality standpoint.  It was not just rudimentary or young. It was awful.  The end was a lame attempt at trying not to sell out but selling out in the epilogue.  Just terrible!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I uploaded this app to my kindle fire. I absolutely love it. it took me a second to figure out how to make new folders / notebooks but once I did I cant be stopped. I use it for recipes and poetry mainly. and its awesome so once I'm done writing a poem on my kindle I go to my computer which it is uploaded on and post it to my blog. this app is easy to use no matter what you want it for. so get it!
B0061S0A64|1.0|Really, Amazon... Your quality control staff as of late is sleeping on the job.  Whatever the reason for stating this app was 7.2 MB but having 25.59 MB downloaded upon the actual install even BEFORE opening it for the first launch is totally inexcusable.  The last uploaded version of the app needs to be CHECKED against the product description you have already written.  WAKE UP, AMAZON.  This issue of product descriptions in MANY respects not matching what you're giving people to download is becoming CHRONIC and HIGHLY IRRITATING.  It makes your customers question what ELSE is in the final versions of the apps they download that you didn't bother to check for.  This app gets one star and won't be re-rated until you fix the inaccurate product description -- that is, IF you ever bother to check it in the future and fix it.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|Bought this dvd on a whim a few months ago, mainly because I wanted some insight into the real Anna Wintour. Love love love the way the documentary brings you along for the ride of the biggest magazine issue releasing and the backstory of each of the main honchos at Vogue. Also worth watching are the special features and extras.<br /><br />I was never really a fan of fashion documentaries, but I'll definitely be watching some more in this genre.

B001GMH8RO|5.0|[[ASIN:1441404953 The Harper Trading System]]<br />This movie is a beautiful love story embracing life after death. It is funny, with Whoopi Goldberg really adding a lot of laughs, balancing he sad, scary and violent content. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore never really get over the top pathetic, uncomfortable or cloying - just seems to hit the right note always. The Blu Ray adaptation seems excellent also, as is the sound quality.

B00319ECGU|5.0|[[ASIN:1441404953 The Harper Trading System]]If you love detective films and Clint Eastwood, what better way to spend an evening than to look at The Dirty Harry Collection. Love those one liners - \\"Do you feel lucky, creep?\\", \\"Make my day\\". This is where it all began, with Dirty Harry the Cop who everyone gave the dirty work to. I love it as it reminds me of my life as a social worker. The only occupation dirtier, is being a cop. Except they have a weapon!!! Anyhow, I really recommend it for a very entertaining evening.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very kid friendly! my son love's  this game. I also enjoy playing with him. five stars from us. I hope you find this helpful.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|Loved this movie and am showing it to my friends who also love it. We are keen cooks! The acting is great, I know as I am old enough to have watched the real Julia Child as a young married woman learning to cook myself. Meryl Streep looks and acts just like Julia Child did. She was quite a character! Great for encouraging aspiring cooks - if anyone has a bored moment - what better thing to do than cook. Got a problem - cook and you'll forget it in time, as well as being able to eat the delicious results. Very inspirational movie.
1250006341|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It is very informational and has very beautiful pictures. The book includes a lot of history that relates to the show. I love this series sooo much and this is a great companion to the DVDS. I would definitely recommend this for any Downton lover. It would also be a great gift.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I loved these movies on Blu Ray. For some reason I liked them better in the home cinema than I had at the Movies themselves. They were the first really good computer depictions of dinosaurs and the action never faulted in any of the movies. There is human interest, but always secondary to the creatures themselves, which seem to be realistically recreated. Kids love dinosaurs at an early age. Maybe these could be seen as an ultimate kids movie - check with them first though - don't terrify them. Great Blu Ray recreation in picture and sound.[[ASIN:1441404953 The Harper Trading System]]
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I  read this book because the reviews were good for the most part. The premise was interesting and William Landay used this book to explore the issue of juvenile crime in an upscale suburban community.  The teen characters were authentic and the seamless interplay of social media allowed for credibility.  The court room dialogue allowed the reader to easily follow the testimony while providing an education in evidentiary rules and criminal procedure.  That said the twist at the end was anti-climatic and quite a disappointment.
B00006AW2O|4.0|The Stones took a quantum leap forward on their 2nd LP 12x5 in most everyway imaginable. I recently played this & the 1st back to back & feel the most significant differences are as follows; 1 the sound just came alive on this & thats partly because they recorded about 1/2 the tracks at the famed \\"Chess\\" studios in Chicago the home of their heros. & the engineer finally dialed in Wymans bass. 2 - Their playing & singing is far more confident than its predecessor. You can really tell these guys were taking their \\"bad boy\\" mantle very seriously. 3- The song selection is over all much stronger with the only exception of the ill advised cover of \\"Under the Boardwalk\\" (who's idea was this?). While I do like the 1st lp \\"Englands Newest Hit Makers\\" at least from the perspective that it single handedly along with the Kinks 1st lp started the garage rock revolution in the US. But, the Stones seemed to have found their wings on 12x5. If memory servies it was one of the 1st I ever heard from them & that was a good 5 yrs after it was released & it has aged very well. I understand the new reissue contains the \\"extended\\" version of 2110 S Michigan Ave which is cool. I wonder why they didnt offer the UK version of this in the reissue series?....anywhoo, this'll do.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|i like the game, but this kills it for me. what is up with the ridiculous time limits for each house, business, crop, ect? is it a glitch or flaw easily remedied with a patch or does the game eventually make you wait 150+ hours before getting anything done?
B000ENWKN8|1.0|I have every White Zombie and Rob Zombie CD. I have to admit, up until Hellbilly Deluxe, his sarcasm and hard rock were a good mix. The little snippets at the beginning of some songs were often a refreshing take. However, in this album, I have to say that Rob Zombie dropped out of my list of performers that I will pay for. The songs range from having a very lazy sing-song burlesque rhythm, or they sound like theme songs from a Western TV series, or else he just shouts the song title over and over again. The mix is terrible. It sounds like horrible noise. There are a couple of guitar solos that start out clear and just disappear into the grinding noise that is the back up sound for almost every song.<br /><br />\\"Do ya wanna ride in educated horses?\\" \\"Be an American. Witch. Foxy foxy.\\" These are actual lyrics from the few songs that had more than one verse. I actually have listened to this album about ten times, trying to find one song that I could like. Even the worst albums that I have ever heard, had one or two halfway good songs. However, I can sincerely and honestly say that this is the dumbest bunch of songs I have ever heard. The guitar riffs are gone. It is just the same music from several years ago, remixed and muddled, with lyrics that he must have gotten from a room full of typing monkeys. Then there are the little snippets that get sampled, including western movies. I guess this is his western album. If you have money to waste, donate it to the homeless shelter. This album is the worst trash that I have ever heard.
B000002MFE|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums, love the way Clapton sings the blues. I bought the cassette, and now that no one on earth has a cassette player anymore, it was time to upgrade once again to a CD. Years later, this is STILL one of my favorites. Pop it in the player, pour yourself a glass of wine and just groove with the music. My ears are happy.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this last night in about two hours after seeing yet another TV review talking about the hype. Like others I rarely write a bad review - I would much rather focus on things I like than things I don't. But this book is beyond appalling - pedestrian, unimaginative, boring and unbelievably badly written. In fact, so badly written that I actually wonder if it is an elaborate hoax? Don't waste your money.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Great movie and delivered right on time. The whole family sat and watched it together. The younger ones who never heard of it also enjoyed it.
B005KMX866|4.0|Cover albums can be a tricky thing, especially when the singer is particularly known for their ability as a songwriter. I think this is why Chris Isaak's last (partial) album of cover tunes, 1996's BAJA SESSIONS, is still my least favorite Isaak disc...it just doesn't represent him the way his other albums do.<br />  Needless to say, I was a little worried when I found out that he was doing a full album's worth (or two...I went with the deluxe two disc set!) of Sun studio classics....after recent cover projects from the likes of Cyndi Lauper and Huey Lewis and the News, a visit to Karaokeville was a real concern.<br />  Well, I'm happy to report that nothing could be furthr from that end result...BEYOND THE SUN is an absolute winner on every level! Not only does the album feature Isaak's best vocals to date, but he manages to honor these classics while still making them his own. (In fact, if you didn't know better, you would swear many of these songs were Isaak originals!).<br />  Since there's so much material to cover, and I don't want to short change anything, I'm going to do something different with this reveiw...rather than going deep into each track, I'm just going to do bullet points on each one, highlighting the things that really jumped out at me each time. Let's go!<br />  \\"Ring Of Fire\\" ~ Opening seconds are close to a Johnny Cash rip-off, but by song's end Isaak rights things, comfortably wearing this Cash classic.<br />  \\"Trying To Get To You\\" ~ A totally boppin' lead vocal, killer guitars, SO smooth!<br />  \\"I Forgot To Remember To Forget\\" ~ Romantic, yet spirited. Great arrangement. (And I'll tell you right now..watch out for piano player Scotty Plunkett...trust me, you've been warned!).<br />  \\"Great Balls Of Fire\\" ~ Covers of this song usually sound SO cheesy, but Isaak just NAILS it! Loose, lively, relaxed...the track's AMAZING! One of the disc's best vocal, it's rivaled only by Plunkett's playing. Seriously...he almost steals the show right out from under Isaak, both here and elsewhere throughout the disc. Abso-frickin'-lutely brilliant!<br />  \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\" ~ At first you think this is nothing more than a standard Elvis imitation, then you realize....Isaak is just that good. Nuff said.<br />  \\"Dixie Fried\\" ~ My favorite track. I've wanted Isaak to do a rock album ~ no ballads, just rock! ~ for years, and this track gives a hint of what that album could sound like. A musical party, Isaak's vocal is fun, fresh and fiesty, dancing over the rollicking rockabilly arrangement. (Once again, Plunkett just shines!). Love, love, LOVE it!!!<br />  \\"How's The World Treating You\\" ~ The song just doesn't fit Isaak, but a nice enough vocal, coupled with spot-on instrumentation.<br />  \\"It's Now Or Never\\" ~ Once again, the \\"cheese\\" factor is always a threat with this song, but Isaak brilliantly sidesteps the dairy and goes straight for romantic/dreamy/hypnotic. And that last note?!? MAN, O MAN!!!<br />  \\"Miss Pearl\\" ~ A kickin' rocker. Great vocal, even better guitar and organ!<br />  \\"Live It Up\\" ~ One of two originals. High energy, great vibe, relaxed, assured lead vocal. VERY nice.<br />  \\"I Walk The Line\\" ~ Earnest and honest, Isaak just grabs this baby by the tail and doesn't let go. Yes, it will always be one of Johnny's iconic signature songs, but right now? Right here? It's all Isaak's.<br />  \\"So Long I'm Gone\\" ~ There's just something about this cut that seems...shallow...and phoned in. One of the album's few weak tracks.<br />  \\"She's Not You\\" ~ This cut could have been on the radio 50-60 years ago...in other words, Isaak knocks this one out of the park! Romantic, seductive, infectious...a real winner.<br />  \\"My Happiness\\" ~ I keep going back and forth on this one...at times I think it's a bit calculated (the hiccup in the vocal), and I think it would have benefited from a stronger harmony vocal, but other listens..I like it. We'll call this one a draw for now!<br /> Disc 2 kicks off with:<br />\\"My Baby Left Me\\" ~ Arrangement, vocal, instrumentation...they all shine here. Sheer perfection.<br />  \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" ~ Another dangerous song to cover, but Isaak aces it. He doesn't overdo the growl, he doesn't try to be Roy...he just enjoys himself and the song. The result? By pulling things back and underplaying it (vs. Overplaying it, which most people do when covering this song!), it fits him like a glove!<br />  \\"Doin' The Best I Can\\" ~ Doo-wop heaven. Killer lead vocal, angelic backing vocals. Sweet!<br />  \\"Your True Love\\" ~ Not bad, but not amazing. Just sort of...O.K.<br />  \\"Crazy Arms\\" ~ Sort of has the same cookie cutter vibe as \\"Your True Love\\", but this track is saved by Plunkett's piano.<br />  \\"Lovely Loretta\\" ~ The second original, it's not as strong as \\"Live It Up\\", but I love the whistling and the little \\"Yeah!\\"<br />  \\"Everybody's In The Mood\\" ~ Another favorite. Totally swingin', everything just gels here...great boogie-woogie arrangement, smooth lead vocal, great harmony vocals, nice little touches (sweet harmonica!). Much like Rick Vito's excellent BAND BOX BOOGIE album, this cut has a classic feeling to it, but it also feels new and exciting. One of the prime examples of why BEYOND THE SUN works so well.<br />  \\"I'm Going To Sit Right Down And Cry\\" ~ Nice groove, but the vocal veers too close to Presleyland.<br />  \\"Love Me\\" ~ Another track that's a little too over the top. Love the backing vocals, though!<br />  \\"Doncha Think It's Time\\" ~ Has a nice lilt to it. Smooth, stylish, sublime.<br />  \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" ~ The perfect album closer. Relaxed and bluesy, yet from the heart. Nice. Very, very nice.<br />  All in all, I have to say that BEYOND THE SUN is definiutely one of 2011's most pleasant surprises. Between this gem and 2009's equally strong MR. LUCKY, I can't wait to see what Chris Isaak does next. Rock on, Chris! (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star, not for not including the lyrics as usual, but because I would have liked to have known why Isaak chose each of the songs. With the liner notes as extensive as they are, that's the one area we seem a little shortchanged!).\\"My Baby Left Me\\" ~ Arrangement, vocal, instrumentation...they all shine here.

It is really hip, stylish and great to have playing in the house or car! It's his own..but three things come to mind while listening...the 80's, Sting & funky jazz all rolled into one! Wally's hit \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" is what drew me to his music....but just one hit wouldn't make me buy an entire cd of his music. So after listening to his music on Pandora and Youtube...

This adapter worked very well with any 3.5mm female imput & sound quality is excellent. As usual, my Amazon purchase was delivered earlier than promised.
B007TML4EI|5.0|Wow. What a great game. Tons of fun, challenging physics puzzling in which you have to protect your crash test dummy from various threats. Sometimes you must eliminate another dummy at the same time. At just 25 levels it is a bit short, but there is some replay value to try to get 3 stars. If the developer updates with new levels, this can be a top ten game.

B00005YUAC|5.0|This is a great progressive rock album that was made before it was called progressive rock. This is a jazzy, trippy, rockin, trip into the 70's. A friend of mine in college bought this album because he thought the cover was cool and it was an expensive import. He hated the album, so he let me have it but he kept the cover. Thank God for CD technology because this version sounds so much better than that old LP did. The sound is mostly old fashioned Hammond Organ (Peter Bardens), trippy blues guitar (Andy Latimer), great bass playing by Doug Ferguson and Andy Ward is something special on the drums.<br /><br />\\"Slow Yourself Down\\" and \\"Mystic Queen\\" are a great way to start this trip back in time. \\"Six Ate\\" is one of the highlights with the whole band shining on this instrumental gem. \\"Separation\\" is just a simple rock and roll song, that is well done. \\"Never Let Go\\" is a Camel classic and the one that sticks in your head after the album is over. Just a great classic rock song.<br /><br />\\"Curiosity\\" is a blues influenced song that sounds a little like early Caravan. Latimer is a talented guitar player and with Bardens form a great pair that would go on to produce some of the best mellow rock ever played. I just love the stripped down sound of this song. \\"Arubaluba\\" finishes off the original LP and it is a Peter Bardens written jam. Andy Ward sticks out on this one and proves why he was considered a drum prodigy. Never let is be said that Camel couldn't rock.<br /><br />There are two bonus tracks: one is the single version of \\"Never Let Go\\" and is not really necessary, but the second bonus track is the gem of this package. \\"Homage To The God of Light\\" was recorded live in October of 1974 at the Marquee Club. Taken from a Peter Bardens solo album and turned into a 19 jam session. The quality of the recording is amazing. You will want to hear this one.<br /><br />This is my 50th review and it had to be a 5 star classic from one of my all time favorite bands. This isn't only for fans of progressive rock as it is a very timely early seventies sounding classic rock album, more than a progressive one. Why bother with titles, if you haven't heard this one: Why not?
B007IXWL2C|4.0|When I was absentmindedly browsing the kindle store for another book to read, I don't know what it was that drew me to Fifty Shades of Grey but I decided to give it a shot anyhow.  I finished both book one and two in a matter of a couple of days and I found myself quite immersed in them.  They were incredibly sexy.  They brought me back to the times when nothing seemed to matter except being close to, touching, and making love to the man you love (the BDSM stuff was pretty sexy as well).  I found myself fantasizing about finding my own 'Christian'.  I found that the pros of this book far outweighed the cons.  However, the one main con, in my humble opinion, is just how corny it is!  Now I don't know if it is just me, but who talks like that all the time? The \\"I can't live without you'\\"s and the \\"you belong to me and I belong to you\\"'s.  Perhaps I'm just being cynical or perhaps I just wonder if it's because my man never talks to me like that, but I found it just to be a bit much.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and can't wait to embark on the adventure of the third one.

She has to leave her sister, Prim, and her friend, Gale.  They must leave their home of District Twelve and go to the Capitol of Panem.  They fight to the death in the Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games is an entertainment to those in the Capitol.  They love watching the Twenty Four people fight to the death.  However, these games bring nothing good to the districts and eventually the Capitol, especially when Katniss Everdeen arrives.<br /><br /> In, Catching Fire, President Snow tells Katniss that her actions in the previous Hunger Games have caused a spark throughout the districts.  Her duty is to stop the spark from growing.  But, it is the year of the Quarter Quell.  The Quarter Quell has something special added to the Hunger Games.  And this time, the chosen people come from the remaining pool of victors.  Katniss and Peeta were to go back to the games.  Gale is unhappy about this.  He does not want to lose Katniss and he holds a grudge against Peeta for a romantic stunt in the first games.  Throughout the games they make new friends.  They make friends with Finnick, Beetee, and Johanna.  Will they stop the rebellion, or join it?<br /><br /> Mockingjay, the third book of the series, is a much deeper book.  Katniss has become the face of the rebellion, except, she does not know if she wants to be.  She is in shock learning of all of the trickery behind her back.  She also has lost Peeta.  Is that a good thing?  She cannot decide.  Katniss has to fight through many pains and losses as she fights through the Capitol in this book.  She has to fight off mutations, friends, and peacekeepers of the Capitol.  This is all to do her job.  Assassinate President Snow.  On her way Katniss realizes that this war has brought nothing good.  She realizes this when she loses so many people.  She is set on destroying them once and for all.<br /><br /> The pace of the series varies.  The first book, The Hunger Games, is a very fast paced novel.  The book goes very fast with all the preparations and all of the action.  The characters in this book are very likeable.  Some people like Peeta and some people like Gale.  Katniss is also a very interesting character with her ability to break the rules and shoot a bow.  In, Catching Fire, the pace is also very fast.  The changes made are surprising and push you to read onward.  The conflict between Gale and Peeta grows and makes you like one more and hate the other.  The new friends made are also likeable.  President Snow however, seems like an evil animal.  Mockingjay is a very different book though.  It is deeper and the conflicts bring much sorrow.  The pace slows down for a while and then speeds up toward the end again.  The series indicates through Katniss's thoughts that war brings nothing good.  It only brings devastation.<br /><br />  If you like action and likeable characters along with a fast pace, then you will like this series.  However, do not get too attached to the characters.  If you are someone who does this, then you will not like these books.  Many people die or leave and are never heard of again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game to play. its interesting and very relaxing. I would reccommend this to anyone who enjoys the Sims or other games like it.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Such a great album Madonna released!<br /><br />Deluxe edition is beautiful.<br /><br />Regarding to the album itself, it has a known and familiar \\"Madonna\\" sound, sometimes is more \\"garage\\" than made in a studio.<br /><br />The bit is sincere and honest, as well as lyrics, filled with personal things of Madonna's life.<br /><br />Delivered pretty fast, all new and safe.
0345803507|5.0|I've read all three books and this trilogy grabs you from the beginning of Book 1 and does not let go.  The story is about Anastasia,a young innocent college student at the end of her senior year, who has always been bookish and barely dated. Through happenstance she meets Christian Grey, the 27 yr. old owner, CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings. He's a self made multi-billionaire who's life has been scared by the tragic early life he endured. They both are drawn to each other immediately but try to ignore it. Neither can stop thinking of the other. This story is so well<br />written, it really delves deeply into both characters and you fall in love with both<br />of them. It has so many twists and turns. It makes you laugh out loud, especially the emails between Ana & Christian, and cry at other times. It's a roller coaster<br />of emotions and I felt like I never wanted the book to end.  As soon as I finished one book, I immediately had to start Shades Darker. After finishing Fity Shades Freed, I had to reread them all again.<br />I completely loved all three books and still don't want to let go of these characters.  I love them and want to know what happens next, I want to know about their children and their family members.  I hope E. L. James writes the story of Mia, Christian's younger sister and Ethan, Ana's best friend Kate's brother.  I know there is a story there and I hope she writes it. I just want more about this<br />family. Loved, loved, loved these books! 5 Stars All.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is by far the easiest 1 I have used, gotta love it. I am able to stream stwor to my galaxy tablet and play
B007JRU2UK|4.0|A nice warm George Clooney vehicle, just don't expect any real story.  On the really plus side, the scenery of wild Hawaii is really gorgeous, and we are very glad when everyone does the right thing.  I gave it 4 stars because it is engaging, harmless, and why else would you watch a feel good movie?
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A good solid book.  If this were the only book in the series, I might rate if differently.  However, as the ending of The Hunger Games trilogy, meh.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good trilogy and I am glad that I read them.  The series as a whole is probably 5 star.<br /><br />The problem with this book is the length.  Whenever I read the first two books, I never wished it would end.  20% of this book could have been cut out and it would have improved the story.<br /><br />First, is Katniss a rebel or capital sympathizer?  I understand that war is hell and I really get that, however, after all that she has been through I don't think she would have been so wishy-washy.  There was a point where I honestly thought, I wish this book was about Haymitch.  At least he knows he is in a war.<br /><br />I liked the game part of the first two books and thought this book would have been better if there had been some sort of \\"games\\".  I understand that it was war and that is fine.  Just another reason this book wasn't as high on my scale as the others.<br /><br />Finally, the love story.  I will get this out of the way first.  I hate twilight.  Partly because the author took vampires and, well we won't get into that. Mostly I hated the love story.  I have to say that this one is maybe even worse.  Maybe, but at least Suzanne Collins is a good author.<br /><br />--POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT--  It seemed in this book that Katniss devolved and by the end didn't really love either of the gentlemen.  It would have made more sense if she had chosen no one.  By the end she was so devestated and destroyed by the loss of her sister just let her live her life in solitary.  I would kind of liked to seen her become a female Haymitch.  Sometimes you can't recover from what you go through and at least it would have felt real.<br /><br />This one felt like she just choose the guy that ended up living close too her.  I know what your saying and I did read the sentence that explained, Peeta wasn't full of rage like Gayle but really?  Just my opinion, I personally would have liked it better if it was just more about the games and a more realistic ending.<br /><br />I really wanted to give this book 3 stars but decided that the entire series is good enough to raise the 3rd book up a little.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very very good in every way. I'm not sure how out could possibly be improved. Anything and everything a person would want is available in this program.
B007SPPANM|5.0|In 1997, James Cameron made the most amazing movie in the entire world, and it's name was Titanic. I saw the movie last weekend and it was AMAZING on the big screen. I never had the opprotunity to watch it the first time as I was only 2 years old when it came out in 1997. The movie was beyond comparrison to other films released that weekend. One change I did notice was that the color was enhanced. For example, when Jack and Rose swim up after the back half of Titanic sank, the water was a blue color as opposed to the original greenish color. Another thing they enhanced the color of was the ship itself. I was hoping for some deleted scenes to be included, but that's alright. By today's standards, a new copy of Titanic could run you somewhere between $75 and $100, due to the fact that it's out of print. I will admit, with the re-release of the film in theatres, I knew it would be re-released on Blu-Ray and DVD. There is a Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo also available. The only thing I don't really like is the fact that we have to wait til September to get it. You'd think it'd be more necessary in May or June. But of all movies James Cameron has done, this has to be one of my favorites. I've seen Titanic who knows how many times, and I was shocked to realize I did not yet own a copy. I have already set my money aside to purchase this DVD re-release, and I hope you do the same.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Doesn't seem to install on my G2 (Andromadus a2) but that could be my fault. Either way, it's probably better on the Touchpad's larger screen. Makes nice background music on automatic mode. I can see how it could do even better if manually controlled, but that's not my area of expertise!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story.  There were ironies and plenty of opportunities to dwell on the intricacies of the characters.  Books today are rarely written with the depth of language and description found in Pride and Prejudice.  It makes it even more touching to read knowing that Jane Austin, the author, faced a similar \\"socially forbidden\\" love without quite the happy ending found in this epic.[[ASIN:B000JMLFLW Pride and Prejudice]]

B007DIQC90|5.0|My Head Is An Animal is the latest chapter of an incredible story. In just a few years of existence, Of Monsters And Men have managed to become the music ambassadors of Iceland while slowly and successfully sweeping the U.S. with this amazing debut album.<br /><br />You have most likely been introduced to this band through their single \\"Little Talks\\" and although it is a great song, the rest of the album holds up just as good if not better. This album has no filler songs ... every one of them could be a single. Bottom line is that this band will soon become a household name and anyone who has been searching for a band with quality sound and talent, look no further.<br /><br />Seriously, stop reading and start listening.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a really fun game.  I like the fact you can take a break and your energy is restored.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I heard alot about this book and could not wait to begin reading it.  Something even better than I ever expected!!  There are also two sequels, this was even better!!<br />When I read in the news that there were young students reading these stories at school I thought that the story was a little difficult for elementary age children to comprehend. They may interpret the fight scenes differently.  They haven't lived long enough to learn about wars/government and Post traumatic stress.  I think there needs to be some discussion between children and adults about the consequences of war and some of the frightening scenes in the story. The story has some fight scenes that are pretty graphic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|all ages can play. pretty entertaining cant seem to put it down. so far app runs smooth. build homes. collect rewards. upgrade items. get to be in control of your own village.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|a fun game that i would  recommend to any bored or under-stimulated person who doesnt have assessed to a nes or snes

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I must admit, rather shamefully, that \\"Bared to You\\" is the first Sylvia Day book I've read, something I can't believe myself. How could I go so long without reading this seasoned, talented writer? Day's story enthralls and consumes the reader, and it does so well.<br /><br />Many a reviewer has already examined the plot of \\"Bared to You\\", so I'm skipping that to look at my favorite aspects of Day's writing. The story starts with Eva Tramell's recent move from San Diego to New York City--a wonderful introduction to both our heroine and setting. Consider the following passage from the novel's opening, \\"The smell of vehicle exhaust mixed with food from the vendor's carts, the shouts of hawkers blended with music from street entertainers, the awe-inspiring range of faces and styles and accents, the gorgeous architectural wonders... Real New Yorkers cruised right through it all, their love for the city was as comfortable and familiar as a favorite pair of shoes. They didn't view the steam billowing from potholes and vents in the sidewalks with romantic delight and they didn't blink an eye when the ground vibrated beneath their feet as the subway roared by below, while I grinned like an idiot and flexed my toes. New York was a brand new love affair for me.\\"<br /><br />I adore that line, \\"New York was a brand new love affair for me.\\" With that one sentence, Day's made the setting another character within her story.<br /><br />The story centers on Eva and Gideon, both characters with troubled pasts that influence significantly how they view and react to present-day relationships. Told from Eva's POV, the reader is privy to her inner thoughts, observations and interpretations of events. Lovely. But, unfortunately, we aren't afforded the same privilege with Gideon, which is such a shame. I love a story that lets me experience both of the main characters' POV, when I see the hero's more intimate side--especially when that hero is an Alpha Male--and witness how each event shifts the characters' feeling towards each other until they know they can't live without each other one minute longer.<br /><br />Still, as a fellow writer, I respect everything Day accomplished here. As soon as I finish this review I'm off to find another one.ts the characters' feeling towards each other until they know they can't live without each other one minute longer.<br /><br />Still, as a fellow writer, I respect everything Day accomplished here.

1932100660|5.0|We recently watched \\"Forks Over Knives\\" by happenstance on Netflix.  The movie was mindblowing for us and I had to know more about Dr. Campbell's research.  Let me start off by saying that we are not a family that eats steak every night of the week, which is why we were so blown away by this study.  My husband is a 20-year vegan and I am a 25-year vegetarian.  We are extremely conscious of what we eat, buying only organic produce, but allowing for some processed foods and plenty of olive oil to cook with.  I ate some cheese to flavor my food, had 1/2 and 1/2 in my coffee and ate milk chocolate, but avoided drinking milk and eating eggs.  We thought we were living healthy lives until.....I was just diagnosed with very early stage breast cancer.  I had always firmly believed that diseases like coronary artery disease and diabetes could be controlled by diet, but that cancer was something that was binary and gene related.  You were either going to get it or not.  Since no one in my family has died of cancer, I figured I was good on that front.  Wrong! I am only a few chapters into The China Study, but what I've read so far has just been mindblowing.  I literally can't stop thinking about it.  Everywhere I go, I think about it.  Because my husband was vegan, we ate a lot of margarine instead of butter and used a lot of olive oil to cook with.  That's all completely changed.  We've completely given up on added fats and are now eating more nuts and seeds, more avocados and olives.  Even for a vegetarian and a vegan, it's been a big challenge to figure out how to fry without oil, how to make a salad dressing without oil, what to spread on a piece of toast, etc, etc...but we're finding ways around using these old unhealthy products we'd been so copiously using in our diets.  We'd also been raising our three small kids as vegetarians believing that they needed the additional protein, B12 and calcium that came from dairy and eggs.  We are no longer doing that. We realize now that they can get all of those nutrients in a plant-based diet and take a B12 supplement daily.  The greatest gift we could give to our children is to start them off in life learning about what's healthy and what's not and how to make healthy choices in the way they approach and eat food.<br /><br />The China Study has made me realize that I've gone about my approach to eating in a slightly backward manner.  For years, I've focused on limiting external toxins, like pesticides, in the food I eat rather than paying attention to the food I was putting into my body.  I thought that because I was eating hormone-free, organic milk and cheese, it was healthy.  I've now refocused to what food I'm putting into my body rather than what's on it.  Like the rats in the dioxin study - I don't think any amount of pesticide on an apple even begins to approach the effect casein has on your body.<br /><br />If you're interested in living as healthy a life as possible and being educated about your food choices, do yourself a favor and buy this book and read it cover to cover.  Don't assume (like me) that you already know this stuff because chances are, you don't.  This book will in all likelihood be a life changer for you.  As for me, I'm hoping that the elimination of dairy, eggs, etc... from my diet will permanently cure me (along with treatment) of my recent diagnosis.that they can get all of those nutrients in a plant-based diet and take a B12 supplement daily.

B003AYPMCO|4.0|The \\"Deluxe\\" Edition of British Steel costs approximately twice as much as the [[ASIN:B003AYPMBU British Steel: 30th Anniversary Edition]] because you get \\"deluxe\\" packaging and a music CD that is the soundtrack to the DVD (Priest live at the Seminole Hard Rock Arena in Hollywood, Florida, August 2009). SO...if you want to listen to the live show in your car, or want to listen at home without watching, this is the package for you. There is no additional music when compared to the \\"standard\\" 30th Anniversary CD (the British Steel album) and DVD (the August 2009 live show).<br /><br />That said, it's a nice package to own...expensive or not...and I do happen to like the concert enough to take it with me in the car (and I'm too lazy to do a DVD audio rip for that purpose).<br /><br />I don't believe Priest has a \\"defining\\" album...they all have their moments, some more than others. And while British Steel was extremely popular (it spawned the concert classics Metal Gods, Breaking the Law, and Living After Midnight) as well as influential in the \\"New Wave Of British Heavy Metal,\\" you still can't overlook other classic albums like [[ASIN:B004IY6API Stained Class]], [[ASIN:B00005K9LK Screaming for Vengeance (Exp)]], [[ASIN:B0000630BT Painkiller]], and the live behemoth [[ASIN:B00005R62N Unleashed in the East (Exp)]].<br /><br />My guess is that the overwhelming majority of people reading this review already own British Steel in one form or another, and quite possibly some or all of the other albums I've named. So let's cut to the chase...the main draw here is the Hard Rock concert. Is it worth it? Yes, it is.<br /><br />There's a certain kind of power that Priest has acquired since Rob Halford's return on the [[ASIN:B0007MVXQG Angel Of Retribution]]. In the \\"old days,\\" the band was clawing its way to the top. These days, they have nothing to prove. The \\"Heavy Metal\\" genre of music owes its existence to the \\"big three\\"...Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath. Many people say that Sabbath invented the genre. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. Tony Iommi is certainly the King of the Dark Riff. But Tony has his thing, and Glenn Tipton & K.K. Downing have theirs, and they are not the same thing. To fully grasp that, you need look no further than the jackhammer version of \\"Victim of Changes.\\" It's ironic that it's the crown jewel of the Hard Rock set because the track has nothing to do with British Steel...but it's a beast, a jaw-dropper. All of the elements of every other version are present, but the power...and the audience reaction...just unbelievable. Around the 6 minute mark, we get to the \\"Once she was wonderful, once she was mine...\\" section. At 7:32, as Halford's crooned \\"changessssssssssssssssssss\\" fades out, then Halford screams \\"VICTIM OF CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS, and Tipton and Downing bring down the twin rhythm guitar thunder and you hear a mighty roar rise from the audience. At 7:45, Tipton just STANDS on it, just WRINGS that neck, leaning into one bent note after another as  it resolves back into twin rhythm guitar and a final climactic scream from Halford.<br /><br />Ozzy and Tony don't do it this way. Bruce Dickinson and company don't do it this way. There's only one band that can pull off a performance like this, and it's Judas Priest.<br /><br />So if you buy this (or the less expensive edition without the soundtrack CD), you'll get a prime classic Priest album and a contemporary live show that proves they've not lost a bit of power...where most bands would have slowed down and started phoning in their performances, Priest is still the beast unleashed.<br /><br />VERY highly recommended.

1567184855|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it gave me a different perspective on some things about the afterlife that I've wondered about. It also helped to gel some ideas that I've pondered over the years. I honestly believe our lives do not end when we die. The compilation of interviews offers credence to that. I've read many books about people's experiences when they enter that transitioanl state between life and death and I found this book more detailing, emotional and interesting than others I've read. I recommend this book to those who want to expand their thinking about what could be.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Bought this to perform two tasks related to my iPhone 4:<br />1.  Allow me to keep my Tank case on while listening to music in the car.<br />2.  Enable charging on my old Dice setup in my car.  I think my Dice is so old that it only charges iPods not iPhones.<br /><br />This did both- it takes a few seconds for the Dice/radio to \\"see\\" my iPhone, but once it does it's fine.  A little pricey, but it works.<br /><br />Update- almost a year later and it still works great.  Very handy little item- hardly ever listen to FM radio anymore...

0553582038|5.0|I have all five volumes of a song of ice and fire audio books on my ipod and I love them all. I put them all on one play list and the play list was over eight days long, so they are very, very long. If you don't like long books this series is not for you, if you have hours and hours of driving and/or working and would like to listen to a great story to pass the time these books might be for you. It is like no story I ever listened to before because the number of people and places in the story, the amount of detail about everything in the stoy, and the lack of a main character, there are main people in the story but you never know when one is going to die, it is almost like a very long history lesson from a parallel universe than a story following a few main characters. All the way from the start to where the stoy is now I never know what is going to happen, one minute I am laughing, a few hours later I am crying, and then later I am screaming in anger, it is a great ride! Like I said before they are long, I would never have time to read them, only people who read really fast should read them because if you are a slow reader by the time you finish you will forget what happens in the begining, reading puts me to sleep so I have listen to them over and over again and pick up on something new every time. I like all five volumes equally I think of them as one very long story.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Super fun and addicting game!! My six and four year old love to play it too. Definitely worth the $$.
0553801473|5.0|I have all five volumes of a song of ice and fire audio books on my ipod and I love them all. I put them all on one playlist and the playlist was over eight days long, so they are very, very long.

I like to say i like all five volumes equally and as one very long story, but in truth if A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons were one book ( A Feast for/with Dragons) it would be my least favorate, still five stars, but there was so much climax in A Storm of Swords that now the story has to build up again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a game that you can play for a long time or set it down and pick it back up later.
B003Y5H556|3.0|I'm a (male) fan of Twilight and had enjoyed Catherine Hardwick's work in that film and figured this might be a more...interesting...take on the fairy tale.  And it's not bad.  The casting is reasonable, although Billy Burke and Gary Oldman aren't given much to do and the supporting cast is a bit weak - but the love triangle in the center of the film works well enough.  The biggest problem is that the movie's plot feels like it needed a significantly bigger budget or more time in the editing room to make it more cohesive and flow better.  I wouldn't recommend it for the story alone, but if you tend to like very stylized movies, there are worse ways to spend a week day evening.
0307951529|4.0|I read Chris Guillebeau's first book, \\"The Art of Non Conformity\\" which encourages readers to follow their passion, start their own businesses (which won't necessarily make them rich), but enable them to become independent and live the lifestyles the want to follow. Guillebeau knows first hand how to accomplish this, since he started his own business on E-bay, selling items, then learning how leverage this into a full time business, where he know sells his own e-books and other items.<br /><br />For me, this book was life changing, because it inspired me to begin my own business, last year.<br /><br />Guillebeau's $100 Startup is almost a sequel to \\"The Art of Non Conformity\\". In this book, he provides different microbusiness models that people can follow to earn a living and live a life of freedom. Loves it!
B005GCCJME|5.0|I have been wearing Crocs since 2005, & I just bought my 35th pair, as near as I can figure, so I know what I'm talking about. These Crocs are my favorite pair ever! They are so soft & comfy inside with an excellent arch support, & a very supportive sole. I'm in love! It took me a few tries to get my size right, but I've figured out these are true to size for the length, & the width is more like the original Beach Crocs were before Crocs changed their fit & made them narrower & shorter. They may be just a little bit less wide than the original Crocs, but they're pretty close. That makes them perfect for these big fat, flat, & wide Fred Flinstone feet! So I'm wearing them in the woman's size 12/ men's 10 which is the size I wear in my sneakers. I wear a 4E width in most New Balance shoes. In the Cayman Crocs, now called the Classics, I wear a men's 11. So I'd suggest going with your normal shoe size for a perfect fit. On the Croc's website, they suggest sizing down if you wear a half size. Try these! I hope you love them like I do!! Now if Crocs would just get more of a color selection, I'd be happy as a clam! Whoever thought up the white on top with green on the bottom was thinking backwards! They should have reversed it & I'd be buying pair #36!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have been reading this book since I was 15 (now 31) and it is my all-time favorite book. I have read it several times throughout my adult life and it is still great the entire way through. I love the entire Ender's Series, but this will always be my favorite. Card is an extremely imaginative author that dreams up a world that is so creative and interesting that you will not want to put this book down. I recommend for young and adult readers alike. It has something for everyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it. Can't wait for the movie. I read it twice and still couldn't put it down both times. Reading all of them for a third time.
B005QUQP76|5.0|UPDATE - 2/5/2014<br /><br />After having this mouse for well over a year, I can honestly say this is the best mouse I have ever owned. As I stated in my original review, I'm a CIS major in college as well as an avid gamer. I've got literally millions of clicks on this mouse and it still works magnificently. The corsair logo on the tail end where your palm rests has started to wear, there is a light sheen on the buttons (the mouse is matte) from the oils and sheer friction of my fingers against the plastic after millions of clicks, but otherwise the mouse is still in great shape. I would buy a left handed version as well if they made one.<br /><br />Please note that this is the old version of this mouse. The M65 is now out, which has a higher DPI range and comes in a few different colors. The cost is exactly the same so there's no reason not to buy the newer version.<br /><br />That having been said, I recommend this mouse to anyone considering a new mouse. I've been a big fan of Corsairs RAM and power supplies for years and can attest to the fact that they designed this mouse with the same dedication to quality that they do in everything else they do. Buy one.<br /><br />ORIGINAL -<br /><br />First off I'd like to start by saying that I have been an avid PC gamer for years, ever since the days of Mechwarrior, through the days of Quake III Arena and Counterstrike, into today. I've spent a lot of leisure time on computers. I'm also a college student studying computer programming, so I spend a lot of my academic time in front of a monitor as well as my leisure time.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this mouse after removing it from the packaging was the construction quality. The aluminum frame, aluminum scroll wheel, textured side grips, and matte black design are very appealing to look at. The pinky and thumb grips are textured to make it easier to move the mouse without having to squeeze the hell out of it to lift it, and just allow for a more comfortablegrip overall. It also has some heft to it, and the removable weights allow for you to customize where the main weight of the mouse sits. So far I've chosen to leave all three weights in, as I like the hefty feeling of the mouse. The design of the back of the mouse allows for airflow to the palm of your hand when mousing, whereas closed back mouses do not.<br /><br />I upgraded to this Corsair M60 from a Razer DeathAdder mouse, which had up to 3800DPI, whereas this M60 goes up to 5700 DPI. I also like the snipe button feature, and plan to use it when doing graphic design as well as gaming. I think it could be easily applied to anything that requires extreme precision. One note I would like to make is that the mouse does not come with any software in the packaging, but it can be easily obtained from Corsair's website and searching for \\"M60\\". You will need the software to take full advantage of the mouses capabilites, as with any other specialty mouse.<br /><br />I've only had the M60 for about 24 hours, but already am in love with it. I'll try to update this review in several months to let you guys know what my thoughts are after several months usage. At this point though, I HIGHLY reccomend the Corsair M60 mouse for any gamer, or even just for a PC enthusiest looking for a really high quality mouse.
B003VJTGLQ|4.0|The movie is excellent, but the video quality is not up to blu-ray standards.  The special features are also minimal and not worth extra money.
B007REA0SO|5.0|This reissue is unbelievable.  The sound is pristine.  Listening to it for the first time or the millionth, something new is revealed with each listen.  If you are looking for the roots of rock and roll, this is certainly a great place to start. They don't get much better or original than Little Richard.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I actually bought this on accident, I had intended to get the trial chapter. But having read the first book, and most of the second so far, I do not regret this in the least. The books are so compelling and easy to read. Great books!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I loved this game.  It was intuitive, easy to learn, fun, and a nice little time waster that was playable without spending money.<br /><br />Sadly, when I reached Level 28, everything went wrong.  Crops should grow in one minute up to a couple of days.  Suddenly, the ones that should have taken a couple of hours to grow and harvest, were showing they had 200 hours to go.  So I couldn't supply food to the shops, which means the shops don't supply you with coins.<br />Then, the infirmaries set themselves to 200 hours.  Things that should take a minute or two, take 200 + hours.  Now you can't save the pioneers lives, and your population drops.<br />IF you buy cash, you might stand a chance, but take a look at the Gameloft forum, and you'll see people who paid real money for ingame cash, only to have it go missing.<br />Sadly, these complaints have been going on since last year, and no one had addressed it more than to say \\"we're looking into it\\".  That's not enough to keep me playing.  Which is truly sad since I enjoyed it.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This movie is great, I keep watching them over and over and Im 42 years old. Its not just for teenagers. Im excited for part 2
0439023513|2.0|It built up, built up, built up for an epic ending, and then felt like a wash on the final chapters.  I couldn't believe it.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first book of the trilogy is amazing. The post-apocalyptic future world is intriguing; the characters and relationships are well built. Once readers make it into the arena, there is non-stop action and narrative tension, making the book nearly impossible to put down. The violence is tastefully described and doesn't come across as only being there for shock value. (In many ways the book reminds me of the 2000 Japanese movie [[ASIN:B007MJSYF0 Battle Royale (English Subtitled)]], in which a class of high schoolers must battle to the death for the pleasure of their teacher.) The ending leaves a few questions unanswered and leaves you wanting more, excited to pick up the second book.<br /><br />Catching Fire fills in more information about the world of the novels and answers questions about how the Games function and the ruling political bodies who run them, showing Collins built the world on something more intricate than just random violence. It feels as though there could not possibly be as much captivating action, but Collins keeps the excitement pretty close to the height of the first book. There is a small feeling of repetitiveness regarding the Games, but Collins did a good job making it as different from the first book as possible.<br /><br />From the start, Mockingjay has a different feel from the first two books. Katniss is removed from most of the action, and although her trauma from the Games is realistic, reading about her many mental breakdowns is not nearly as exciting as reading about bloody violence. The entire book has the feeling of Collins writing it to send a message instead of entertaining readers and finishing the story. The love triangle is disturbed and resolved in an unsatisfactory way. Katniss becomes an irrelevant character. She functions as only an inspiring image for her people and her actions hardly effect the world or the war at all. This is an interesting idea, but makes for a boring main character. Katniss' character arc supports theoverarching theme of the novel that that war is senseless and nobody wins. I respect Collins for breaking the mold of this type of genre and having her characters react in such realistic, traumatized, ineffectual, and broken ways, but the reason why most authors don't do this is because it doesn't make for good narrative reading. By the end of the book when things are finally \\"resolved\\", having read this last book seems almost as pointless as war itself.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. Simple to play. And easy to learn all the controls. My family all like to play solitaire therefore a good game for all of us. Works well on my kindle.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh, what a waste! I have heard so much hype about this trilogy that I finally decided to read it. It was such a waste of S10.00, an afternoon, and brain power. The erotic, and I use that term loosely, scenes were so repetative that I found myself wanting to bang my head against the wall. Fifty shades is not what I would consider a good book, let alone a GREAT sensition. The characters were so 2D that I could not get sucked into their world. I usually find myself in the characters world, with this one though, it was words on a page. Now, granted, this HAD the potential to be FANTASTIC, if the author, editorial staff, anyone who actually gae a damn, would have put some thought and time behind it. It was a waste to me and I will not be reading any of the other parts of the trilogy nor any more of her works.

B004EPYZV2|1.0|I seldom, if ever, give reviews; however, after seeing this latest installment I felt compelled to say I found this movie boring, poorly directed, with a terrible plot and zero story line. Don't waste your money on the DVD, rent it once. Trust me.
0060920084|4.0|This book was very witty and fun to read.  When I read the reviews here it seems that many of those who didn't like it were probably expecting more of a travel guide.  This is not a guide to America or it's towns.  It is a recounting  of a personal journey in which Bryson is searching for the American towns he remembered from his childhood.  \\"I wanted to go back to the magic places of my youth-...and see if they were as good as I remembered them being\\"  Because he is searching for the magic and for the most part he is not finding it, there is a lot of negative thinking along the way. But we get to enjoy the ride and the wonderful, funny bits of nostalgia as he recounts bits of the many past family vacations, endearing us to his late father and perhaps finding bits of our own past in these stories. He is giving us his opinion of these places, sharing his feelings  through these humorous anecdotes as he ventures into the towns and cities along the way.  This was a lonely quest but we are allowed to share his thoughts about what he sees has happened to the country vs. his idealized vision from childhood.  The places never seem to have the \\"magic\\" and he is often irritated by this and by the tourists and unfriendly people he encounters.  The closest he seems to come to finding the magic is at the baseball museum in Cooperstown where he loses himself for three hours,  reconnecting to a part of his past that he shared with his sportswriter dad. When he returns home to his Mom's in Des Moines he finds \\"There was just something about it that looked friendly and decent and nice. ...for the first time in a long time I almost felt serene.\\"<br />He has discovered that America has changed but he still finds it endearing when he returns to his home town.<br />Bill Bryson's writing is always enjoyable.  He is not Mark Twain, but there were times I got to thinking about Innocents Abroad as I was reading some of his sarcasm and cynicism.  It was an enjoyable trip.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Every once in awhile I read a book that blows my mind.  A book that makes me read all day, and stay up all night to finish it because I can't put it down.  I rather sleep deprive myself instead of sleeping so I can find out what happens next to the characters.  \\"Bared to You\\" is definitely one of those books.  The first chapter alone had me excited to keep reading it.<br />Gideon Cross, is a dark and dangerous 28 year old who owns pretty much everything in New York.  If you see \\"Cross\\" on a Building, he most likely owns it.  Yes, he's young, but he's business-oriented, determined and intimating at times.  He has skeletons in his closet though and refuses to let them out for anyone.  He doesn't want anything to do with his family for some reason and women...especially, brunettes are what he usually favors.  He has his gal friends he will not bed with and then his women that he has sex with one time and then discards them afterwards.  He's a very mysterious man who every woman wants though.  No matter if he is a player or not.<br />Eva Tramell is a 24 year old strong-willed woman who moved to New York after graduating college.  She's living with her best friend Cary who is a sexy male model who she met through a therapy group she went through.  She landed a job at a advertising company which so far she adores.  Eva has a traumatic experience she's trying to forget, but for some reason it comes back haunting her.  She has a loving father who lives in California, a crazy over-protective mother and a step-father who enables her mother to do the crazy things she does to Eva.<br />One day Eva bumps into the dark and dangerous Gideon and the moment she sees him, she knows he's trouble.  She did not realize she would end up working in the same building as he did though.  Now, Gideon wants Eva and he will stop at nothing to have her.<br />The moment Gideon is described, I even knew he was trouble for Eva, but I also knew I would fall in love with him.  For some reason I always fall for the dark, dominant man in a book.<br />I love how Gideon is so up front with Eva when they first meet and whenever they are together period.  The first time he confronts her in building where she works too...he bluntly tells her what he wants from her.  I think I was just as shocked as Eva...but maybe a little more.<br />Eva tries to avoid Gideon, but who could avoid a sexy, domineering man like him. I sure couldn't.  I do not know how Eva held on for some long.  I would've succumbed the minute I set eyes on him the first time.<br />This book is sexy, beyond-intense, EROTIC (of course), dramatic (warning...two females you will loathe in this book..at least I did...I won't spoil who they are though), and it's also full of twists and turns for both Gideon and Eva.<br />The sex scenes in this book, I had to keep putting down the book after I read them so I could cool off.  Yes...they were that GOOD!!<br />You'll get to feel Eva's pain and understand what her trauma experience was in her past.  You won't really know what is wrong with Gideon, but you will get a hint on what it could be.  He refuses to talk about it though, which frustrates not only Eva...but me as the reader.<br />I recommend this book to readers out there that are addicted to the Erotica Genre and love some BDSM.  Fore warning a head of time, once you start this book,  you will not want to put it down.  The cliff hangers of each chapter, will have you begging for more.<br />I'm looking forward to the next book now because I really want to know what Sylvia is going to do next with the characters.  Between Sylvia Day and Karin Tabke...I'm addicted to the Erotica Genre now.  There's no turning back for me.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed that this book (as well as the third) focused more on the story and the characters development. I felt that the story being somewhat of a thriller and at times keeping you on the edge of your seat to see what was going to happen next is what kept me reading and encouraged me to read it again!!!

0345803485|1.0|This is the first time that I have written a review for a book. I just had to for this one. It was the worst book I have ever read. Even when the books are bad I could finish them but not this one. There is no real story line for me and is all about this sexual relationship that these two people have. The author tried to hard and it just didn't flow. I love romance novel but this did not do it for me. I do not understand how some people love it. What did me in was the 10 pages of a contract. What was the point of that. I should have read the other reviews first.

B003QSHIPS|5.0|\\"Plastic Beach\\" is quite simply a masterpiece, another manifestation of Damon Albarn's music genius. Really, there's no point describing the album itself - for those who want to buy a vinyl copy, everything is almost certainly clear. What I really want to say about this product is that the sound quality on the record is absolutely EXCEPTIONAL. I would never expect that vinyl can sound that good! Also, the cover and artwork are a value in itself.<br /><br />Let there be no doubt - this album is more that worth the money.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|One of the most unhappy, disappointing, and illogical conclusions to any series I've read.  I couldn't have been more thrilled and engrossed with the first two novels (giving the first two books 5 stars), and was even more eager to complete the series.  However, the conclusion to four main storylines left me feeling like I wasted my time.  First and foremost this was a story about a hunter, Katniss, who sacrifices everything to save her younger sister, Prim.  It becomes a love triangle between her and the two men/boys who love her.  She needs to decide between the best friend, Gale, who helped her save her family, and the Hunger Games partner, Peeta, who helped save her.  Along the way this solitary huntress wins over friends, acquaintances, and enemies alike.  Who will survive?  Finally, the story blows up to much more, and becomes about liberty and revolution, and will the long suffering districts rise up to overcome the evil Capitol.<br /><br />I could not have been more dissatisfied with how each of these elements played themselves out in the final novel.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  The first part was one of the most frustrating.  Primrose Everdeen is the person who sets the entire series of events in motion.  By killing off this character I felt like the rest of the plotlines were like a house of cards.  I probably wouldn't have felt as strongly this way, if not for the way it was handled in the book.  Rather than making it a shocking moment of sorrow, it felt completely contrived and unrealistic.  The author tries to explain Prim's presence deep in Capitol territory, but it still makes no sense.  There is no rational explanation for the author to place this character in this place and this time, and ruins any emotional connection.<br /><br />The love triangle killed me as well.  I was pulling for Gale, but would have been understanding of either choice.  I don't think enough was done to differentiate between these two characters.  Other than one being a hunter/miner and the other being a social baker, I always got the feeling that either one of them would have done the same thing in the other's position.  Katniss gives too much credit to circumstance.  However, to have Katniss harbor any ill-will towards Gale for Prim's death is over the top absurd.  She is supposed to be a survivor, hunter, Victor, rebel leader and soldier, and she doesn't understand the disconnect between a weapon, and the person who uses that weapon on a specific target.  Additionally, I felt no conclusion to this relationship.  The conclusion to the entire love triangle seemed hurried and incomplete.<br /><br />Who lives and who dies?  The entire second-half of the novel, Katniss second-guesses herself regarding dragging other people into her personal mission.  Well she should have been, because everyone sacrifices themselves to see her complete the mission, which doesn't happen.  If she had stayed home in District 13, the war would have reached the same conclusion with half the lives wasted.  While this might be 'realistic', it made for a terrible story.  Very frustrated....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book has made me, and every one Of my friends who I have told about it, literally obsessed with it. It is excellent. The only thing I wish I did differently is to buy each book separately so I could loan each one out individually!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book was a pretty easy read.  It kept my intest throughout most of the book which is hard to do.  I have read other reviews in which the reviewers were criticizing the inclusion of his wife's comments.  I thought it was VERY relevant to hear the other side of his struggles and what his fiance's/wife's perspective was.  Since I had served in the military myself I do understand the delicate balance that must be managed in order to be successful on both ends of of a military man's life.<br /><br />I found the content to be a little less interesting than his buddy's book, \\"American Sniper\\" but still a good read overall.<br /><br />I have noticed a common theme with these two and the current book I am finishing up,\\"Warrior Elite\\" in that there seems to be huge concern with the politician's viewpoint in Washington DC and the need to justify their actions and the existance of the SEAL teams.  My opinion, \\"Hoorah SEALS !!!\\"
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent program. well played and entertaining for those who like English drama. I enjoyed the season 1 DVD, so had to have season 2. For anyone who appreciates good English drama, this program will not disappoint.
B00000I3JO|5.0|If you look at the album cover, you understand straight away the mood this album captures.<br /><br />I enjoy this album a lot because the music is very moody and catchy and does a good job of creating imagery in your mind to complement the words. For example, tracks like \\"From A Late Night Train\\" have music that perfectly evoke the kind of imagery you might have in mind when you read the title. Overall the tracks are rather slow and atmospheric -- the whole thing has a kind of noirish nighttime feel about it -- but there is a bit of variety with a more upbeat funkier one, so it doesn't get too samey. The vocals from Mr Buchanan have a lovely, deep and weary feel to them, and the overall production is perhaps a little sterile in an 80's kind of way but is decent. The jazzy touches on the piano are nice.<br /><br />If you want something to listen to later at night, and feel in perhaps a more ponderous kind of mood, you should get this. It is pretty gloomy in parts, which you will either love or hate I guess; I love it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I own a number of knives, and have a number of knife sharpening tools to go with them. This item caught my eye because it is light, easy to use and can sharpen any number of knives. Great for camping or for the BOB/BIB. May not be as good as the old fashioned stone and oil, but, for those who need something light,easy to carry and have the ability to quickly sharpen a number of knives, this will not disappoint. I have used it, and on a good knife that still has a good edge, it will quickly sharpen it. Not what I would use on a cheap blade or one that has seen too many \\"hack\\" jobs. Much better than the ceramic kife sharpeners that you find in stores. The key point to make with this knife sharpener, is that it is so light, portable and inexpensive, that anyone who carries a knife should have one.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoy books about people in a time or life that I haven't experienced and The Kitchen House was the kind of book I didn't want to put down. This is the story of an orphaned white girl who is raised with slaves on a farm.  It is written both from her point of view and the view of the slave she is closest to as she grows up, and it follows a timeline from when she was a little girl all the way into her adulthood.  I became acquainted with many of the slaves as well as the owners.  It is written in a style that drew me in and as I read I could clearly picture the settings and the characters.  It is very realistically written, getting the point across without including too much gory detail.  I made excuses to pick up the book to read more, I am sad that I've finished it, and I am anticipating the next book by this author.
B0073O0AME|5.0|This is a unique album.  A refreshing take on Bennett's hits of the past.  The idea of duets with other contemporary singing stars is wonderful!
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I haven't used it extensively, but with the few times I had I'm not that impressed.<br /><br />First of all, its too small to hold it steadily, especially when you want to move the knife against this at a precise angle.<br /><br />Second both the sharpeners are at fixed angle and this might not be the correct angle for different knives.<br /><br />I would definitely not recommend this for outdoor knives.
0439023513|5.0|I really don't understand the bad reviews.  I read all three books over the course of a week or so and felt that each led seamlessly (no Seam pun intended)into the next.  The final book, Mockingjay, was excellent and to me, a logical progression of the two prior books.  I agree that there was a little less action, but that is to be expected in a good story - a beginning, a middle, and an end.  One common complaint is that the battle scenes are difficult to follow, but I suspect that was the author's intention since in reality war is fast paced and at times impossible to follow clearly.<br /><br />The book is excellent and I the only disappointment I experienced was finishing it - I wanted it to go on and on...
B000K4WLXA|3.0|I bought this set some years ago, back when I was working at the video store still.  I at the time had no idea what FF7 was, other than people played it A LOT years before.  I took home the Advent Children dvd when it was released and really liked it.<br /><br />There seemed to be quite a bit of mythology in place that I wanted to learn and did...I liked Sephoroth's character and enjoyed the end battle very much.<br /><br />When I saw in the upcoming release catalogs we got, that a deluxe edition was coming out I immediately ordered myself a copy.  The big seller for me was the included anime that sort of acted like a prequel/backdrop for Advent Children.<br /><br />This set also was advertised to include a number of goodies and also the case appeared GORGIOUS.<br /><br />Well I got my set and here is my review, years overdue:<br /><br />**Pros**<br /><br />The case is indeed top-notch.  The goodies are abundant.  The anime was included as advertised.  This release like all others also included all cut scenes from the FF7 game as well, to get those not familier up to speed, and also to take the veterans of the franchise down memory lane.  At the time I thought the fight scenes were amazing and like the CG quality overall as well.<br /><br />**Cons**<br /><br />The included anime is only subbed, no dub at all.  Also it really doesn't explain much or appear very necessary to watch.  It is very short and Cloud doesn't hardly do anything in it.<br /><br />The goodies are overated.  The script for the movie is not anything I want to read.  The short stories included are not that great, save for one.<br /><br />There are \\"post cards\\" included.  Filler in my opinion.<br /><br />**And Then...**<br /><br />Like a preverbial kick in the nuts, there is another cut of FF7: Advent Children released on Blu-Ray.  THIS CUT ROCKS!!!  The studio has completely re-done the fight scenes, included blood now, added Sephoroth's infamous one wing and much, much more.  It truly is a different movie.  The movie that should have been released.  In my opinion, the studio rushed out the first cut, then it seems they tweeked around with it for years and then after seeing they had produced a truly SPECTACULAR film compared to the first cut, decided to release it again.  This COMPLETE CUT is the only version anyone should own.<br /><br />If you have not purchased this film yet, PLEASE, PLEASE buy the Blu-Ray Complete Cut, it's the best from the scenes I've seen.<br /><br />I unfortunately plan to re-buy the Complete Cut now.  So they're getting my money twice.  That's dirty pool in my book.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and as always sorry for any misspellings/grammer mistakes, I went to public school...nt movie.

0345803485|4.0|Loved the books! Actually, when I finished the 3rd book, I wanted more. (I read them again) Everyone has their opinion, that's mine :) End of story!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|this movie looks awesome on blu-ray! it comes in dts 5.1 digital surround sound and the scenes are so crisp and clear and realistic looking that you almost imagine that you can step into the t.v. and into kongs world! king kong 2005 is awesome, a great remake of the 1933 original classic. i urge any and all kong fans who havent seen the original 1933 classic to go and watch it so that you can fully realize the passion peter jackson put into this movie. peter saw the original when he was eight years old, and thats what made him want to become a director. enjoy!!!

B0054N73EY|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their opinion and many do not like this album.  This is an excellent album!  The sound and style is fresh and innovative.  What makes RHCP fantastic is their ability to reinvent their sound in creative ways.  Is this Stadium Arcadium? Absolutely not - and I believe it was not meant to be an encore of the fabulous album.  This is an album with a much different theme, structure and sound altogether. It incorporates various instrumental overtones and has a much more driving beat throughout with a personality of its own.  In my opinion this is a fantastic album that showcases the creative and musical abilities of RHCP with a sound that is altogether fun and refreshing!  Truly a another fine addition to the long line of RCHP albums.

1594203334|3.0|Fluff about French mothers.  Borrow this from the library.  Interesting read about how French mothers are different.  I could relate to some of it and was amused by other bits like \\"the look!\\"<br /><br />Poor articulation in the sentence \\"This woman made \\"nipple confusion\\" sound scarier than autism.\\"  I don't find my son with Autism to be scary.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I thought I was gettting an app that would give me the Bible on demand. As other uses have stayed, no WiFi, no Bible. So I can't use it in Church, or work,  or. any other safe location unless I engage my mobile hotspot. Secondly,  you are forced to log onto facebook if you want to use it to its full potential. I will delete this app from my fire and phone as soon as I identify an eBible that I like and will pay for it. The nicest feature is the audio, however,  you can only start the audio at the beginning of each chapter.
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Ah, AMERICAN HORROR STORY. You know, aside from the wonderfully wacky performances by Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, Kate Mara and Denis O'Hare, as well very strong performances by Taissa Farmiga (who looks so much like her older sister Vera that it's creepy), Connie Britton (who is so gorgeous, it hurts), Frances Conroy and her younger, much sexier self Alex Breckenridge, Lily Rabe, Matt Ross, Jamie Brewer, and my personal favorite, Zachary Quinto... there's not much here.<br /><br />Well, you know, except for scenes like Vivien eating a cooked human brain, and believe me, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is LOADED with scenes like that. Ryan Murphy (responsible for another terrifically addictive FX show NIP/TUCK) and his co-showrunner and longtime colleague Brad Falchuk set out to create something that defies expectation of a horror story but keeps you in the game with its deceitfully addictive adult soap opera bits, all the while as parts of the show's mystery unravel as more questions are raised.<br /><br />What caused the house to be like this? Was it just the first murders, or was there something deeper? What does Constance really want with the Harmons? Does each new pope really get a message like the one presented in this show? Will Chad and Patrick ever get their perfect Halloween? Does Ben just REALLY like the stove?<br /><br />Actually, the best question is WHY DON'T THEY JUST LEAVE? That's the question that we all find ourselves screaming at the television when the show is on. And the answer to that question, initially, is this is the stupidest family to have ever soiled the earth with the imprints of their feet. There might as well be a sign out in front of the house that says \\"I'M HAUNTED, MORONS!\\" and the Harmons would keep crossing that threshold without a moment's hesitation. It's really too obvious, but you're having too much fun with Adelaide's constant break-ins, Tate's whole \\"I'm totally tortured and indisputably dangerous, but feel free to date me\\" vibe, Constance's casual racism, Hayden's instantaneous transformation from cuckolded lover to bat-$#1T CRAZY, the twins, the Frankenstein baby and Chad's fabulousness.<br /><br />However, as time goes on, Murphy and Falchuk do a very smart thing. They force a family member out of the house, and just a bit later, they force another family member to stay in the house. I'd hate to spoil anything here (other than Viv eating the brain, because that was awesome), but the answers are shocking. And what's even more important is that they work in the context of the show.<br /><br />The show is about truth and illusion, and coming from NIP/TUCK, Murphy and Falchuk are uniquely suited to do such a show. The illusion that this house will somehow save Ben and Vivien's too-fragile marriage as well as the eternally increasing distance from their teenage daughter Violet (who is already half a sociopath as the show starts). The truth is that the house, and its secrets, will destroy them the longer they stay; ultimately, the truth (no matter how painfully obvious it is) is not as powerful as the illusion.<br /><br />Another big part of this show's success is consulting producer and staff writer Tim Minear. Minear is a singular talent in genre entertainment. His ideas and his energy are always helping to branch out and make better whatever program he's working on. Sadly for Minear, all of the shows he's been a producer of (despite their pretty consistent level of excellence) have been cancelled. FIREFLY, STANDOFF, DRIVE, THE INSIDE, THE CHICAGO CODE, TERRIERS, WONDERFALLS... all ashes either during or just after their first seasons. His other shows like ANGEL and DOLLHOUSE actually lasted for at least two seasons, and AHS will join the ranks of those two shows, since it's been picked up for a second season on FX.<br /><br />Make no mistake: AMERICAN HORROR STORY is not a very good horror show, though. Is it creepy? Sure it is. But this show, aside from a few tingly moments (and that can go a few different ways since the show is pretty sexy at times too) doesn't offer much to actually scare you. It's more \\"How CRAZY can we make this show?\\" rather than \\"How SCARY can we make this show?\\" and that's problematic at times. Also, there are few actors I've seen in my life that are as wooden and utterly charmless as Dylan McDermott. He's always been the poor man's David Duchovny, much as Bill Pullman is the poor man's Alec Baldwin.<br /><br />Whether or not the new season will focus on a new family and/or a new house remains to be seen. Frankly, I hope that it, at the very least, doesn't change location because there's just way too much fun to be had with these characters. The only reason I would actually like them to go elsewhere is to escape from McDermott, because he adds nothing to the show.ew different ways since the show is pretty sexy at times too) doesn't offer much to actually scare you.

B000FC1HBY|3.0|I just didn't seem to become as fully invested in the new characters of book 2. I was still caring about the original cast. Perhaps they were better developed and either more colorful or sympathetic. In addition the lengthy battle scenes were repetitious and I found myself all to often skimming to get on with the plot.<br />Have not yet moved on to book 3 but would consider giving it a try when my reading list has dwindled.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|I just received this today.  Build quality is fine, it's quite a bit lighter than my Canon 5D Mark II grip -<br />guessing it's made out of a lighter metal (magnesium; same as body?) Perhaps that's what gives it the feeling<br />that it is made out of plastic to some. It is cool to the touch, so it is most certainly metallic.  That said,<br />there is nothing about the item that felt so divinely sculptured that it should fetch 450 dollars.<br /><br />I was hoping I would get some incredible packaging or unreal, solid build quality (read: engineered by Porsche).<br />Instead it is solid but not remarkable.  I do not feel like I spent 450 dollars, I feel like I spent maybe 175-200.<br />Very disappointing.  Of course, it is obvious Nikon is able to get this price for it, as that is what I ended up paying.<br />If a third party is able to make a high quality grip for 250-300 (which is more than possible, trust me), Nikon will not<br />sell many of these.<br /><br />Aside from the absurd pricing, it works just fine.  Just not 450 dollars fine.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|Why was this movie made? It is a confused jumble of scenes of Streep playing Margaret Thatcher as a long retired, senile eldely woman. That she was elected Prime Minister three times, survived IRA assassination attempts, was a long time friend and ally of President Ronald Reagan, is all relegated to the back third of the movie.<br /><br />This is arrogant Hollywood nonsense. If a \\"biopic\\" of Reagan or PM Tony Blair were treated this way, it would draw anger or laughter. Instead, Streep wins an Oscar for a farce.<br /><br />Whether the viewer was a supporter or opponent, she was a dominant political figure. You wouldn't know it from this mess. A younger generation will skip it all together having no idea what they are watching. What a missed opportunity.<br /><br />Maybe the backroom script battles should have been filmed instead.
B006XABLAE|2.0|I bought this album on the basis of being a longtime Depeche Mode fan, and accepting that it was not going to be a Depeche Mode album.  I quite like techno and other dance music, but I have to say this long-awaited writing partnership left me a bit cold.  If you are a fan of stripped-down techno, buy this album.  If you prefer your music with more depth, passion and. . erm. . 'dirt' in it (as I do), then dig out Violator and enjoy.....

0307454541|1.0|I read the first book in the trilogy because SO many of my friends recommended it. I thought it was a piece of crap (no need to repeat all the negative reviews - same story for me!). I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only one to have found it painful reading. Enough time has passed since the reading that I just tried to watch the Swedish version of the movie. Ugh! Even in another language it was awful. At the first rape scene I had to turn it off. This is art?? This is clever?? This is CRAP. There is SO much good writing out there (and good cinema). Why would anyone waste their time on this?????

B007PBKG5G|5.0|To be honest I'm almost surprised that this band is receiving the press they are.  Their sound is just so far on the opposite end of the music spectrum from the majority of releases today that I would have expected them to fly under the radar.<br /><br />Their sound is a bluesy rock jam packed with emotional and at times raspy vocals.  At times it reminds me of some of Janis Joplin's work, which is probably why I enjoy the album so much.  At times it rocks, at time it slows down to a painful raspy grace, only to pick back up and jam a song or two later.  It really is great start to finish and the best $5 album I've ever purchased from Amazon.<br /><br />Favorite Song is probably \\"Heartbreaker\\" at the moment, but it's almost unfair to have to pick one.  In reality it's the Band's sound and emotion that carries you and I suggest just listening to it from start to finish (that's how I've done it about 10 times now).<br /><br />Only song I don't care for so much is \\"Goin to the Party\\", and even that is still a good listen, I just feel that the it's outclassed by the rest of the album and always strikes me as out of place when I listen through.<br /><br />Easily a 5 star, no doubt.

My wife is the Android user and loves her Android Tablet almost as much as she loves Angry Birds the only thing she couldn't stand was the constant Ads. Well for less than a dollar Amazon has her covered I paid five dollars for my angry birds App for my iPad. This is a great deal and she finds the game experience much improved.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|A lot of people say it will be a 5 were not for &quot;x &quot; I agree. Graphics are good, gameplay is good once you figure out it isn't something to be played continually.  But glitches like reset timers and disappearing items makes this game unplayable. You should be fine till around lv15 till items take days to save up. And with glitches in the save state in a game like this... not cool.
B005R32L66|5.0|I can't think of anyone that wouldn't love this APP and the wonderful FREE service you receive from Skype. Our whole family uses Skype and we use several platforms to do it. We have iPnone, iPad, android phone, android tablet, MAC and PC even my Tv has a Skype APP. Lots of choices. I added this app to my wife's Android Tablet so she can join in the fun from her Tablet when she travels or just doesn't feel like picking up her PC. There is so much you can do with the totally free  Skype account or for a small fee we are able to group call the whole family and get together even when we live in different cites and country's. If you are not using Skype and you are reading this or if you tried Skype in the past on your android device then give it another try. The android app has improved so much over time and keeps getting better. Come on talk face to face with anyone in the world and all you both need is Skype. This is an outstanding App and Service at a price that can't be beat.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This was a beautifully done movie. While I had not read the book or seen the play, the movie was so well put together. It was a true drama and there were parts where I was definitely on the edge of my seat. The underlying story of friendship though between boy and horse was heartwarming and one that all will enjoy and be drawn to. The battles were well constructed and the overall cinematic effect was amazing. I can easily see why this movie was nominated for the awards that it was nominated for, and I highly recommend this movie to one and all.

1426308469|5.0|this book was ideal for my grandson, who is 3 years old. he knows now that all dinos are different and how to say their names. this book should carry him through his elementry years at school.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|After all the hype this series of books has gotten of late, I thought I would read the series objectively to see if they lived up to all of the praise and attention.  Unfortunately, it failed horribly on account of the author's lack of understanding of core literary concepts: character development, foreshadowing, and subtlety of plot devices.  I was actually mad at myself for taking time to read all three books in the series, but I felt like if I kept at it long enough, the series would end with the main character redeeming herself in some way, making her involvement in the story more than just a one-dimensional and emotionally distant girl with no personality.<br /><br />I've heard so many people defend the writing style of this book, saying that it's a \\"young adult\\" novel and as such should be held to a different set of standards.  I have two grievances with this: firstly, I have read plenty of other young adult novels, most of which side-step the spoon-feed approach to plot and character development that Suzanne Collins favors.  Secondly, it is insulting to young adults to insinuate that they're better suited to read stories that are not fully developed and do not use foreshadowing.  I don't know if the presumption is that they couldn't understand the subtleties of literature written like that, but I can say that when I was a young adult, I was capable of reading fully-developed literary works.  I have no reason to presume today's young adults are any less capable.<br /><br />This review will not touch on many plot points, partially because the stories were so limited in their ability to evoke emotions beyond boredom, frustration, or contempt for the characters, but mainly because there are many summaries of the stories available that focus only on plot details.  The only thing I wish to say about the plot is that, as the story develops over the 2nd and 3rd novels, the main character's thoughts and actions force you to hope and yearn for her to do something useful or redeeming.  About 3/4 the way through the 2nd novel, it becomes clear that the most meaningful thing Katniss could have done in the story would be to have died in some sacrificial way, using her death to somehow improve life for those that she presumably cares about (I say \\"presumably\\" because of her irritating habit of never allowing closeness to any other characters).  Needless to say, her death never comes, and ultimately Katniss never lives up to what little potential she had to truly affect the people she cared about in a positive way.  This should hardly be a spoiler; the novels are written in first-person, and I sincerely doubt Suzanne Collins is anywhere near skilled enough to pull of a postmortem first-person narrative.<br /><br />As the end of the 3rd novel came closer and closer, it had become increasingly clear by the number of pages left that the main character was not destined to evolve beyond what she was at the beginning of the series: a selfish, distant, moody caricature of the average 17-year-old girl.  I feel like I want to apologize to 17-year-old girls on behalf of Suzanne Collins if this is the way they've been summed up.<br /><br />Very seldom do I finish a single book without finding at least one or two redeeming qualities, but The Hunger Games Trilogy comes dangerously close.  The only thing that kept me reading the series was the concept of The Games: the compulsory gladiatorial contest to establish dominance over a people.  The idea was so repulsive that the desire to see how it panned out kept me interested in reading.  It's hard to imagine a group of people challenging such a horrible force in such a mundane way.<br /><br />I am not popular for my opinions about this series, but such as it is, I must stick by my opinion that the author is either incapable of writing with sophistication, or refuses to because she thinks little of her target audience.l or redeeming.  About 3/4 the way through the 2nd novel, it becomes clear that the most meaningful thing Katniss could have done in the story would be to have died in some sacrificial way, using her death to somehow improve life for those that she presumably cares about (I say \\"presumably\\" because of her irritating habit of never allowing closeness to any other characters).  Needless to say, her death never comes, and ultimately Katniss never lives up to what little potential she had to truly affect the people she cared about in a positive way.  This should hardly be a spoiler; the novels are written in first-person, and I sincerely doubt Suzanne Collins is anywhere near skilled enough to pull of a postmortem first-person narrative.<br /><br />As the end of the 3rd novel came closer and closer, it had become increasingly clear by the number of pages left that the main character was not destined to evolve beyond what she was at the beginning of the series: a selfish, distant, moody caricature of the average 17-year-old girl.  I feel like I want to apologize to 17-year-old girls on behalf of Suzanne Collins if this is the way they've been summed up.<br /><br />Very seldom do I finish a single book without finding at least one or two redeeming qualities, but The Hunger Games Trilogy comes dangerously close.  The only thing that kept me reading the series was the concept of The Games: the compulsory gladiatorial contest to establish dominance over a people.  The idea was so repulsive that the desire to see how it panned out kept me interested in reading.  It's hard to imagine a group of people challenging such a horrible force in such a mundane way.<br /><br />I am not popular for my opinions about this series, but such as it is, I must stick by my opinion that the author is either incapable of writing with sophistication, or refuses to because she thinks little of her target audience.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|This controller would be near perfect except for the fact that the wireless doesn't work from 10 feet away which makes them near useless for me. The controller will work for a minute then disconnect for about 5-10 seconds as it tries to reconnect to the dongle and it does this constantly and is unplayable. They work great plugged in though..it was pretty funny to see 2 grown men sitting crossed legged a few feet away from a 60inch TV though.
B005POK858|5.0|I have beat this game after about 20 hours on beginner. Its a great game for those who dig final fantasy type games and have dual core processors going off the reviews that had problems. Im on DROID bionic and it ran flawless at all times.
030788743X|1.0|It's rare I don't finish a book, but I dropped READY PLAYER ONE midway through and never looked back. I was shocked that such a highly-recommended book had such shoddy prose, non-existent characters, and dull pacing. Its attempts to evoke 80s nostalgia read like flat referencing of things the writer pulled from a reference work; they aren't evocative in the least. If it was meant to read like a bad mashup of much better works, well, Cline succeeded at that, at least.<br /><br />I should have taken the hint when, halfway through the first chapter, the writer inserts one of those evangelizing enviro-atheist rants that have no plot purpose and seem to breed in works of bad fiction. (Never understood the point of hardcore evangelical atheism to start with. However, when you're trying to get people to pay you for something, it's probably best to keep your freaky religious natterings to yourself if they have nothing to do with the plot.)<br /><br />Never the less, I slogged on, and wasted another hour of my life on a book that never got any better. Don't make the same mistake. Avoid, avoid, avoid.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|I was okay with the movie, it is the same thing as fatal attraction, accept with a black cast. Movies like this have been made a thousand times already, it would have been nice to see a movie that is not something we have already seen before. I saw this on tv, I do not go to the movies because it's too expensive, just wait a while and the movie eventually come's out on red box for a dollar or on tv.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I love me some anime. I have since I was a teen. My love and appreciation for the genre has only grown and as much as I love it, I'm often disappointed by the lack of feature films that come out. Don't get me wrong, I love a good series, but sometimes I don't want to commit months to watching something. Sometimes I just want a quick fix. Anchor Bay and Manga Entertainment have provided me a much need anime injection of goodness with \\"Redline.\\" It is an amazing film and a testament to dedication. Taking seven years to complete and 100, 000 hand made drawings, in the age of computer animation, director Takeshi Koike brings us the insane, over the top, and completely awesome \\"Redline\\"<br /><br />With fun characters, breakneck speed, and music that will get your head nodding, this film is just plain awesome. I mean it's rare that I'm completely blown away by something but this did it. When you see it the fact that it was hand drawn will not be wasted. It looks beautiful. This was a really fun and good anime, with lots of cool charatcers, and just has a very cool vibe about it. The music is catchy and will have youtapping your toe to the beat as you sit on the edge of your seat watching the insane races. I really don't have anything bad to say except I wish there were more races within the film, but hey I'll take what i can get. It's a crazy fun ride I intend to take again an again. Sequel please!
0307593312|2.0|Is that the point of this book?  Beats me.  It might be; it's part of the lyrics of Paper Moon and they're repeated often enough in the book.  But, then, so are loads of other things, like descriptions of women's breasts.  And women with beautiful breasts are ill-fated in the book.  I don't know what that means.<br /><br />I don't really know what much of anything in the book means.  The two principal narrators, Aomame and Tengo, go from 1984 to a different world, which Aomame calls 1Q84.  The new world is a lot like their 1984, but with some striking differences, like that there are Little People who come out in the night and weave air chrysalises from strands they pluck out of the air.  They are connected to a bizarre, menacing cult called Sakigake whose leader (called Leader) engages in unspeakable acts that bring him to the attention of an acquaintance of Aomame's called the Dowager who runs a private organization that protects victims of domestic abuse.<br /><br />The book is slow--really slow--to develop.  Aomame and Tengo don't seem to be acquainted and it takes several hundred pages before you find out that the connection between them is that they knew each other when they were 10 years old, and once had a deeply meaningful hand-holding session in a classroom before Aomame's family moved away.  They have thought of and even yearned for each other over the 20 years since.<br /><br />Tengo is a math teacher and aspiring novelist whose editor friend persuades him to do a complete rewrite of a novel by a 17-year-old girl called Fuka-Eri.  Fuka-Eri is a beautiful, but odd and affectless girl.  Because of dyslexia, her writing is unskilled, but she has written a compelling story, called Air Chrysalis, about the Little People and their weaving work.  The connection of Tengo and Aomame to Sakigake--Tengo through Fuka-Eri and Aomame through the Dowager and Leader--will draw them closer to each other.<br /><br />So after almost 1000 pages (about 42 hours on audio), you'd figure you'd get an explanation of what the Little People, air chrysalises, Sakigake, and 1Q84 are all about, right?  Wrong!  Page after page of the same stories repeated, characters actually repeating each others' word over and over, banal descriptions of the food people prepare and eat, stunningly un-erotic descriptions of sex; that's what you get.  You also don't get much of a feeling for the purpose of entire secondary characters and their stories.  Aomame's friend Ayumi, for example.  She was an engaging personality, but she didn't seem to have much purpose except to have something happen to her that eerily mimics something that happened to Tengo's mother.  Though what happened to either woman doesn't seem to have much to do with the point of the book--whatever that point might be.<br /><br />And speaking of pointless, when I said that Tengo and Aomame are the principal narrators, that's because suddenly, in Book 3, a third narrator pops up.  Ushikawa is an investigator working for Sakigake and we have to read about his whole back story even though it has nothing to do with anything.  I finally figured out that the only reason why Ushikawa is a narrator at all is because he has a rather necessary scene late in the book with another secondary character without either Tengo or Aomame present.  Since neither of the narrators is present, another narrator became necessary and, therefore, we are burdened with many wasted pages of Ushikawa narrative.<br /><br />Haruki Murakami is practically a rock star among world novelists and it took five years from his previous book for 1Q84 to be published.  Breathless with anticipation, his many fans stampeded out to buy the book, making it an instant bestseller.  But sales dried up pretty quickly and not long after it was published you could get copies for cheap.  I got an audio from Audible for $4.99 (on sale, but still).  And if you read the positive reviews you notice that they're conceptual, rather than particularly descriptive.  The negative reviews are more concrete.  I think that's because you really have to cram a lot of your own meaning into this absurd and surrealistic story.  If you're not earnestly willing to do that, the clunky dialogue, constant repetition and ridiculous (and frequently distasteful) plot are just too much to overcome.<br /><br />I liked Aomame and Tengo and I kept going with the book to hear their story.  In the end, I think the story was about their belief in each other through many years and obstacles, and their making a new world for themselves once they found each other.  But all that Sakigake, Little People, air chrysalis, Fuka-Eri, Ushikawa and so much of the other stuff was all just a silly, repetitive, clunky waste of time to me.  The rewards of reading the book were tiny compared to the tedium and frustrations.  Only a hard-core Murakami fan will be interested or rewarded by this book.  They may say what Tengo's father says: \\"If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation.\\"criptive.  The negative reviews are more concrete.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|VERILY! I saw this in the theatres with my daughter. I've corrupted her into a geek pretty much, and so she was all about seeing Thor on the big screen. What a film! When kenneth Branagh was picked as director I said \\"Well of course he is!\\" His Shakespearean background would be perfect for the Asgardian God and his realm! I must say I'm glad I was very right! This is a very good movie, and adds to the Avengers stable of chracters with true Godly power. Hemsworth nails the part as Thor, and Hiddleston's Loki is suitably devious, but here we actually see why and it all works very organically. Hopkins as Odin the Allfather was absolutely brilliant. The film moves along a a good pace, and though it slows down a little in the middle it does pick up again at the end. i would say that's my one gripe. After the opening battle scene with the Frost Giants, the other action set-pieces just don't feel as strong. That said it's still a great film and worth the purchase. Also the Marvel One-shot \\"The Consultant\\" starring everyone's other favorite S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson, who is featured in Thor as well, is worth the purchase too. I currently own 3 of the 5 Avengers related Marvel films on Blu-ray and have to get the other two to complete my collection (I have Iron Man and Incredible Hulk on DVD). If you want to enjoy some sci-fi/fantasy with a superhero twist Thor is for you! FOR ASGARD!!!! I can't wait for the sequel to take a journey to some of the other  Nine Realms in Thor 2. Also Check out \\"Thor: Tales of Asgard\\" the animated film that features a young Thor and Loki on an adventure with the Warriors Three.
0345803485|2.0|First, let me state credit to the author for having the courage and doing a wonderful thing in writing a book. I'm sure most of us are envious she has reached such dreams. Now for the review. I read all 3 books, mostly because I couldn't stop watching this train wreck of a book...and I really wanted Christian and Ana to die at the end of the trilogy. Trust me, after all the positive reviews, I really did want to like these books...BUT, holy crap! It's crap!<br /> The characters feel so forced and all are shallow (not just Christian and Ana). Ana is a naive 21 year old virgin who doesn't own a cell phone or lap top. Yeah right! She is obsessed with how hot Christian is. He's so HOT. His 50 shades of grey, blah blah blah. Only teenagers use the word hot. Every other page had a mention of his deep gray eyes.<br /> Christian is no better. Christian is moody self indulgent....prick. No woman in her right mind would ever give Christian the time of day. He is bossy and controlling. Every time Ana wants to do something that may \\"cross the line\\" like go out for a drink with her best friend (Oh my!), he overreacts and gets extremely mad at Ana. Give me a break. If my husband did that, his ass would be on the curb faster than he could utter the words. I find him to be a whiny, moaning little dweeb and does not invoke any feeling in me whatsoever. It irked me when he constantly whinged about Ana's choice of clothing. But Christian is the PERFECT man...HOT, rich, hot, rich, hot...holy crap, that's all I know about him from reading all 3 books!<br /> This story is entirely unbelievable. A 21 year old virgin suddenly into bondage and is a nymphomaniac? Give me a break. He never has loved someone before and has used women in the past and all of the sudden, he's head over heels in love with Ana? Come on. He showers her with a car, laptop, cell phone, designer clothes, expensive jewelry...eventually a house. Get real. Then there is the other little \\"cliff hangars\\" in the book. SPOILER alert. Jack Hyde sabotaging a high security place? OK, righto. Jack getting into Ana and Christian's secured apartment (with all the security men)...really??? Christian's brother and Ana's best friend falling in love? How convenient! And now Ana and Kate will be SISTERS!! Oh goody! BFF!! Christian's ex losing control and watching Ana sleep? Seriously? None of it was believable, but some unknown reasons, these little stories in the story kept me reading...it certainly wasn't the main story that kept me entertained...which is boy meets girl..they have sex, sex, sex, get married, sex, sex, sex, have kids, sex, sex, sex. Blah, how boring.<br />  And the sex was BORING. Like other reviewers said, very clinical. \\"He touched me there. He grabbed my sex.\\" Who says \\"my sex???\\" \\"What a tasty morsel you are\\" he says, his gray eyes darkening. What?! No one has sex like this...no one. And if they do, I feel sorry for them! The sex scenes were so dull and stupid, I ended up skipping them. I was so tired of hearing them drone on and on.<br /> The words in this book were mundane and this book (no offense, author) could have been written better by a 5th grader. Like other reviewers, I thought maybe this was written by a 16 year old, it sounds like it comes from a 16 year old's mind. The author throws in a big word every now and then to make Ana try to sound more smart...but it sounds so out of context. ON every single page, Ana says \\"Oh my\\" or \\"Oh.\\" It made me want to bang my head against a wall. And then she always says \\"Holy...::insert word::...\\" Holy crap! Holy cow! How about HOLY CRAP this book is so bad! There is also considerable influence from the English culture. Americans don't talk this way and if you want to make a book believable, stay in the country you know.<br /> Lastly, the obvious. This book parallels the Twilight series which I actually do like, but don't consider myself a die-hard fan. I won't go into details about the similarities as so many other reviewers have already done.<br /> Overall, I am the stupid one for spending so much money on this trilogy. But I do have to say, maybe it wasn't so wasted because I had a good laugh about how poorly a book was written. I really don't understand what people are raving about. This is a HORRIBLE book, but I am giving it 2 stars because the author must be laughing on the way to the bank. Maybe the fact this book is so popular is a reflection on America in general...hmm, HOLY cow, I better not even go there.

B007549YM4|5.0|I saw the cover of this dvd and read some of the reviews. Ok! Thee are many, many post A-bomb movies filled with zombies, gouls and other so-called monsters that are supposed to caused by the blast. In this movie there are none of these. This movie is just about regular people and what they become when trapped<br />in a fall-out shelter. What happends is that the people trapped become the \\"monsters\\". The movie is around<br />2 hours, but it goes by in a flash. I am not going to tell you what happends in the end! You will have to see this gem yourself. All I am going to say that is that the final scene left me with a pit in my stomache!

0307719219|5.0|Acemoglu and Robinson are well known in political science for their work on political institutions. Here, they argue that modernization theory has it backwards - good institutions cause economic growth, not the other way around. They focus on the need for political and economic institutions that allow property owners to invest in new technologies and products that result in \\"creative destruction.\\" In the absence of inclusive institutions, vested elites can stifle creative destruction in its cradle in order to protect the status quo.<br /><br />The book is obviously geared towards policymakers and the general public. There are no statistical tables for game theoretic models. The authors might have gone a bit too far in removing the \\"science\\" in political science, but the end result is a highly readable book. As such, the book probably won't satisfy political scientists, but that's not the point. I'd recommend the book for anybody already somewhat familiar with the broader concepts of modernization theory, but who also do not necessarily need or want formal political science methodology.
B006P0FICE|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! I happen to enjoy fencing & fighting movies as a whole but i really loved this one.I have never read the book but i have seen several adaptations on screen and i have to say this one is my personal favorite. With the delicious Luke Evans and tasty eye candy Orlando Bloom how can i not love it!!I know most reviewers are much more knowledgeable about the plot of the film and i respect that but give me  ANY FILM that has Orlando Bloom and my new onscreen lover Luke Evans  in it and i\\"m going to love it. The only critical thing i can say is i don't think Orlando does a convincing job as a bad guy.

0312641893|3.0|This book sounded like a really cool premise...a dystopian Cinderella...set in the future. Cyborgs, plagues, and an Asian prince charming, what's not to love? I'll try not to give away spoilers, but apologies in advance if I do.<br /><br />This book lost my interest about halfway through. I had to actually MAKE myself go back and read the rest of it, and that's never a good thing for a self-confessed \\"book devourer\\" and fairy tale addict.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. I enjoyed the world. It was very interesting with a very \\"Titan A.E.\\" type feel to me.<br /><br />2. The plague and the Cyborg Draft - these concepts are explained very well and are very real threats to the characters, and I found it interesting the way they were developed and sort of set up to continually be in the background of the story.<br /><br />3. The stepfamily - I like the \\"Ever After\\" type step-family for Cinder...the dynamic of nice sister, selfish sister, nasty stepmother (even if her motives can be traced to an understandable emotion/event) seems far more realistic than the standard Cinderella dynamic.<br /><br />4. The prince - I dare one person to read this and not LOVE Kai.<br /><br />Cons -<br /><br />1. The Lunar Race - This isn't so much a con as it is an observation. The entire race instantly felt like something straight out of Sailor Moon to me, and I couldn't have been less shocked to read on the back cover flap of the novel that the author watched it. From that period on, no matter how hard I tried, I was picturing Queen Berryl's face (main villainess of the series for anyone who doesn't know) every time the beautiful Queen was present.<br /><br />2. I found Cinder's appearance thoroughly confusing, as it's never really described, so it was hard to form a clear picture of her in my head.<br /><br />3. The romance - I wanted so badly to see it, but by the end of the novel, I was thoroughly unconvinced that there was really anything between the two main characters. Granted, they seem to like each other well enough and have some small moments, but for a \\"romance\\"...it just isn't there and left me going \\"huh?\\" during the dramatic climax at the end when \\"I love yous\\" were being boldly proclaimed in front of people.<br /><br />4. The Ball - Judging by the really awesome cover art, I had been expecting something a little...I don't know...spectacular for Cinder's appearance at the ball. But ultimately I just felt deflated and disappointed. It seems Cinder, even when given chances where she's not under her stepmother's thumb, refuses to change out of her mechanic's garb or clean up in any way, and to be honest...that bugged me.<br /><br />5. The science - The plot dragged in places where there was a lot of scientific or historical explanation. Granted, this may be partly my fault as I was expecting it to move more like a fairy tale and less like a science fiction novel, but there you have it.<br /><br />Overall, the novel was all right. I was rather disappointed with it, feeling it had less to do with the fairy tale genre, and far more with the science fiction genre, whereas it seemed to be advertised as the opposite. Those who enjoy science fiction with a dash of fantasy and romance not applied too thickly will adore this book. I give it three out of five stars, and will probably pick up the sequel just to see how the story continues, and if it gets any better in the next volume. However, I may read a few chapters in the book store and make sure I'm in love with the story this time before I decide to take it home.eem to like each other well enough and have some small moments, but for a \\"romance\\"...it just isn't there and left me going \\"huh?\\" during the dramatic climax at the end when \\"I love yous\\" were being boldly proclaimed in front of people.<br /><br />4.

B005SBCVFI|5.0|We love Castle and each episode is full of wit, humor and creativity.  We seldom rate any episode less than five stars.  The character development is rich & the acting truly exceptional on all fronts.  However, we do hate the new Captain!  It would be hard to find something redemptive in her, but we hope the writers will do just that.  The old \\"conflicts with the captain\\" approach is used up.  This is why we especially appreciated the leadership of the sometimes stern, but compassionate...and always saavy and wise, Roy Montgomery.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|It is a great pocket/backpack/tool box/tackle box sharpener! I keep one in all those places. It is fast and works great! Will sharpen 99% of the blades out there (except those rare specialty angled grinds). It even has the rod to sharpen serrated combo blades. You have to be a little slower and a little more careful with pocket sharpeners, but that is what you get for pocket-size convenience. Not sure why others are giving low ratings (unless there is a flaw in the bits), I can use this to sharpen enough to shave arm hair. I have several, they all perform consistently. It isn't THE absolute smallest sharpener on the market, but it is the most versatile, and by far my favorite! If you have never owned one, I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed with this purchase! For inexperienced sharpeners... Carbide till you get a consistent feel of drag on the blade, then ceramic for 5-10 gentle strokes.

The point of the story is not in it's credibility but in displaying how nasty people can be so don't read the following if you don't want to know the problems.<br /><br />Story problems: First, no explanation of why an atomic bomb blast and to what worldwide extent. Second, that the custodian could afford an apartment basement fortress without the owners questioning it. Third, that he has his own unknown power source. Fourth, the bizarre behavior of the trapped people works for a movie but their overly obnoxious, not rational, me-first behavior didn't come across as believable, and it only got worse. Fifth, for some reason shortly after the blast a bio-suit armored group happen to have an acetylene torch to cut through a steel door which of the thousands of destroyed buildings they happened to pick. They suddenly attach miles of plastic tunnels to a crumbling apartment tower and for some never explained reason are keeping people in large incubation chambers with loads of lab equipment. Why they need plastic sheet tunnels when they wear their bio-suits all the time doesn't make sense nor does the fact the tanks run out of oxygen in an hour - then what?
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Loved the first two books but this one... where did that come from? Katniss lost all her appeal in this book -  moody, annoying, whiny, selfish. I couldn't wait for this thing to end. And far from being unpredictable, I thought the ending was contrived. If they ever make a movie of this book, some screenwriter will have to do major surgery to make it watchable.
B000002UTT|2.0|Roxette was a Swedish duo who experienced great success on the US charts in the late 80's and early 90's.  Look Sharp! was their second album and it spawned two number hits, the harder \\"The Look\\" with its rollicking na-na-na chorus and the ballad \\"Listen To Your Heart\\".  The album also produced \\"Dangerous\\" which nearly made it to the top but peaked at number 2 and \\"Dressed For Success\\" which peaked at number 18. Roxette released one more hit album before fading completely from the charts by the late 90's.
B0061S0A64|5.0|When I first started playing around with the app, I wasn't too impressed with it. OK, it can make some musicy sounding notes. But what else can it do?<br /><br />Then I started poking around in the settings. That's where the beauty of this app is. You can completely change the sound of the notes, make them drift around, change scales and octaves and do all kinds of effects. This has the potential to make some very interesting music.<br /><br />My only complaint about the app is it could use more instructions. I had to figure out what a lot of the stuff does through trial and error.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Spent a long time looking at the various cases and covers before I settled on this [[ASIN:B0079R8KO0 Marware Vibe Case Cover]] for my new Kindle Fire, and I'm glad that I did.  Wasn't looking for stylishness as much as pure functionality in a case of cover, as style can often obscure solid functionality and protection of the device.  Will admit that I did like the  [[ASIN:B005I6EUK2 New York Times Case Cover for Kindle Fire]] with the classic Brooklyn Bridge photo on the cover, largely because of a personal involvement with photography, but when it came to making a bottom line choice, went with the Marware Vibe.  But first the good and bad, then the observations as an owner.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Marware's four-point mounting system; holds the Kindle Fire securely without flimsy little elastic straps<br />* Non-slip pad on interior of front lid stands allows for a wide array of viewing angles<br />* Adjusts easily to a rational and comfortable typing position<br />* Cover offers good protection for the screen; easy to clean<br />* Elastic strap holds the cover closed without interference<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* 'Synthetic Leather' cover had an odd plastic odor<br /><br />Observations:<br /><br />As noted above, the cover had what is best described as an odd plastic odor that was quite noticeable when it was first unpacked.  This isn't exactly unusual in 'synthetic leather' (plastic) covers like this, as one discovers from reading reviews, but letting it air out for a couple of hours, then wiping it down carefully with a washcloth dampened with a solution of 50% lukewarm water and 50% household white vinegar and gently drying it cured the problem.<br /><br />What makes this cover so good is the variety of positions with which it can be used.  In that it actually exceeds expectations.  It can be flipped open to lie flat in either a horizontal or vertical position, or easily adjusted to an angled viewing position, which is excellent for viewing videos and movies, along with photo slide shows.  A slight adjustment in that variable horizontal position makes it easy for typing for extended periods when answering emails, or exploring Facebook, LinkedIn and other sites.  And it can be angled almost any way that you might like.<br /><br />The four-point mounting system not only holds the Kindle Fire securely without the flimsy little elastic straps found in some cases.  The device snaps into place easily, doesn't mar the surface, and it also allows for good precision alignment with the speakers, and does not obscure the sound.  The power switch, the USB Micro-B jack and headphone jack are not obstructed, as we find with some other cases that are not certified \\"Made for Kindle\\" accessories.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a 5-star product, and highly recommended for Kindle Fire owners.<br /><br />[Update]<br /><br />Have used this [[ASIN:B0079R8KO0 Marware Vibe Case Cover]] for over five months now, and figured it was time to do an update on my review. My complaint about the \\"odd plastic odor\\" was solved by the solution that I posted above, and I forgot about it until I read this review... no smell at all. I use the Kindle Fire daily, and there is no sign of wear or abrasion. It still functions beautifully, and though I've looked at other general use cases and covers over time, have found no compelling reason to switch to another type or brand. Kudos to Marware for making it right the first time.<br /><br />I do have a [[ASIN:B006G3FFJ6 Timbuk2 Kindle Fire Element Jacket]] for those days that I know I'm going to be out and about in bad weather, and for that specialized function, it's proving to be good... but it's not a replacement for my Marware Vibe Case. Simply put, this one has easily lived up to my original expectations, and if anything, has exceeded them. My original 5-star recommendation stands.<br /><br />8/22/2012movies, along with photo slide shows.

B000FIMHJ4|3.0|Poison quickly followed their debut album with 1988's Open Up and Say... Ahh! The album features their most memorable song, the number one power ballad \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\".  It is a thick slice of hair metal cheese, but even though you know you want to hate the song on principle, you can't help yourself from singing along every time you hear it.  \\"Nothin' But A Good Time\\" is a straight Kiss rip-off, but also extremely catchy.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down. I bought the Kindle Edition because I wanted to read it right away. I wished I had the hardbound book, because this one is a keeper!  IT was a page turner, and what shocked me, was this is happening TODAY, in OUR TIME, 2012!!!!  I walked away from reading this book, knowing that Shin lived for a reason! We still do not know what that is. What he endured is mind boggling. All I can say, is READ THIS BOOK! MORE PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE of what is going on in North Korea! JUST READ IT!
0871404133|3.0|Never afraid of controversy, the Harvard sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson launched a bombshell in his 81st year.  In a coauthored paper of 2010, he disavowed what had been his trade-mark theory of kin selection (aka inclusive fitness) in favor of a new concept of eusocialization.  That is the central theme of this book.  Others more qualified than I will determine the fate of this courageous venture.<br /><br />The earlier chapters of this book are the best.  In these pages Wilson traces the twinned rise of two animal groups: insects (his field of specialization) and mammals, especially humans.  This account is readable and authoritative.  Yet the later chapters are a disappointment, to put it mildly.  Like many observers today, Wilson hopes to bridge the gap between science and the humanities.  Here he spectacularly fails.  He believes that in evolutionary terms religion started with the use of hallucinogenic drugs. This claim is bizarre and unprovable. As a scientist he should know better than to proffer speculation as truth.  As regards the visual arts, he uncritically buys into a current theory that prehistoric pictographs (where nothing is known about the belief systems of the creators) are the product of shamanic visions.  Moreover, he thinks that a simplistic theory of pattern recognition is responsible for our response to art.  A glance at the Paul Gauguin painting on the book's cover should suffice to scuttle this claim.<br /><br />I do not know what the fertility of Wilson's new approach will prove to be in the natural sciences.  In the humanities, though, it is a dud.  It remains to be seen whether others can do better.

1416955070|1.0|I am reading quite a bit of YA as of late, and was encouraged to read this book by a friend. Knowing it was a series, I decided to make the plunge. What a waste of time. While I don't want to spoil it for anyone else, it is beyond me why ANY author would twist a plot in such a way that would turn you off from enjoying the rest of the book, not to mention any further books in the series. Foolishness. I was invested in this book, paid attention to the cultural details because I knew I wanted to read more, and then ....! What a huge, huge disappointment.
B000LXHK2C|2.0|Crowe, and others, do an excellent job in this mishmash of odd storytelling, direction and wrong music.  And the lengths gone to for set decoration and atmosphere were absurd, and needlessly costly.  Let's see the guy do this film without so much cash.<br /><br />The idea that Max would want to \\"shag\\" his new-found cousin is deplorable for obvious reasons, but also because that role is played rightfully young, with far more important things on her mind, and it makes Max disgusting.  This has got to be one of the most unbalanced films ever made, and it is very much an insult to the French people - although the documentary dialogue assures us it is all in good fun.  Meanspirited is what it is.  Irrational.
0786955570|5.0|I bought this set but this review would probably apply to the other 2 D&D board game sets that exist at the moment.  It in itself is a decent game that gives more content than the standard or typical board game most families play.  It is not necessarily an RPG.  But I will say it serves two purposes.  It can be used as a board game or I can be used as an accessory set for your D&D RPG table top adventures.  The board game aspect of it, I rate it about 3.5 to 4 stars.  It can be fun if played with other plays but as a solo game (which it can be played), it gets boring pretty quickly.  I feel it shines most as an accessory product.  In this regard, I find it is the best value accessory item you could buy for D&D adventuring for its quality.  You get quality monster and player miniatures which are better than the flat tokens you get in other sets as well as customizable dungeon tiles that equal the quality of dungeon tiles sold is D&D tile sets, but have the ability to connect to form a dungeon as solid as a mat which wont break apart (because of a puzzle like design at the end of each tile).  If a person bought all the sets, they would have many miniatures to use to never get bored with your D&D RPG games.

0812992792|5.0|Okay, here is my disclaimer:  I'm in love with Adam Johnson.<br />Now, I'm going to talk about The Orphan Master's Son, as a woman who loves a good love story.<br />I know this book has all these other facets to it mentioned in other reviews, like it's a thriller and bildingsroman.  Men I talk to invariably love all of the scenes on the fishing/spy boat but me, I can't help it, my favorite part of this book is the love story. Spoilers ahead:<br />I myself prefer love stories set against a grand backdrop, like war or apocalypse or time travel.  In the case of the Orphan Master's Son, the setting is the real live dystopian regime of Kim Jong Il's North Korea, where the stakes are so high, my hero and heroine must be willing to overcome nearly insurmountable odds, their love for one another is that huge.<br /><br />But so often a love story, even one with insurmountable odds, is marred by the female characters.  God, they're just so sappy and pathetic sometimes!  But Sun Moon, she's no every woman, she's no generic stand-in we female readers can just project onto.  The daughter of a defector, with a voice so enchanting the dear Leader made her North Korean's national actress, Sun Moon becomes a diva, to mask how alien she feels amongst Pyongyang's elite.  Underneath her dramatics, she's a survivor and a mother, with all of the complexities of someone who's compromised and steel-boned at the same time.  Despite an emotional DMZ of mined boundaries, Jun Do starts to break through to her though. It's not just his passion for her that starts to get to Sun Moon.  It's the fact that he speaks truth to her from the moment he first knocks on her door.<br /><br />And let's face it, Jun Do is sexy.  He's a tunnel fighter, trained to fight in the dark and I'm telling you I can imagine those great whirling roundhouse kicks of his.  He's the kind of fighter who asks his attacker to reconsider--Jun Do doesn't really want to kick out the lights and get to work on someone, just because he can.  I love the scene where the Senator's wife, who's a doctor, examines Jun Do's body there in her Texas kitchen, his scars and stitches and best of all that tattoo?  There's Sun Moon's face, tattooed  on his chest like something that's meant to happen, a love story that's written on his body before he even meets her. Then stick the guy in full uniform, with that Speed Battle haircut?  The sexiest thing about Jun Do though, is his passion for Sun Moon.  He doesn't just watch every movie she's ever made.  He also uses his intelligence and perception to study every nuance of her so that he starts to see past her facade, to the hints of her real history. And then there's the balcony scene, Sun Moon with her world weariness, Jun Do with his anticipation and unspoken knowledge of the long tomorrow ahead of them....And finally, finally Sun Moon speaks her heart and her own truth to Jun Do.  What comes after, during the explosions, is a love so grand that even after it all plays out, to the inevitable conclusion, I find myself a weepy teenager, skipping back to page 395 to reread that one passage....well, if you like a good love story, you know what I mean.

B0053VKP8S|4.0|Got great advice from a review I read on here from a guy with the exact same 19\\" TV I had just bought with crappy speakers. Followed his setup to the letter using this converter unit with a 6\\" Toslink cable, a USB to mini B cable for power to the unit(from USB port on TV), and standard RCA cables from unit to my Kantos SYD-5 Ipod dock speakers. really makes the sound from TV boom and gives me many media options for my workout room. Had trouble getting signal at first, but with some adjustments to TV sound out I was able to light the blue signal light on unit and all is well. Only have it up and running for one week, so I can't speak to it's durability, but so far so good. I would recommend.

Loved it on my kindle fire and was really getting into it until,  like so many other users and probably everyone eventually will learn that all your timers get reset to an unrealistic amount of time so you are unable to even play the game. With out this MAJOR flaw it would be THE best game I have played yet. With the glitches its a total FAIL. Hook, line and sinker. You will love it then hate it because its incredibly frustrating.

0307956350|4.0|Chris Pavone's ambitious debut novel about an ex-CIA analyst living abroad in Luxembourg along with her husband and two young children will have readers on the edge of their seats attempting to discover the twists and turns the story takes by way of a multitude of secrets.<br /><br />Kate Moore has given up life as a CIA field agent and has devoted her life to being a wife and mother. When her husband informs her of a job opportunity in Luxembourg she reluctantly decides to pack up and relocate.  While manufacturing a new life in a strange land and busy for the first time with the mundane tasks of setting up house and tending to her children, Kate realizes that her husband is growing more and more distant. She knows nothing about his work in banking and his frequent travel has her becoming more suspicious by the day. In addition, the recent move of a new American couple to Luxembourg has Kate thinking that these two are not at all who they appear to be. Kate makes the rash decision to begin investigating her husband, something she swore she would never do. As Kate descends deeper down the rabbit hole she starts piecing together unbelievable truths about her husband and what his job really entails. As certain alliances begin to change into something more sinister, Kate must fight to uncover the truth and keep the upper hand.<br /><br />Written primarily in retrospect, one single current day where all is revealed starts early and proceeds in increments of time throughout the novel. This may have the effect of slight confusion as would going backward in a story to recall certain events and then needing to switch gears to pick up where left off. This is easily rectified once the reader realizes the style which should take place early on. Font style also distinctively changes and serves as additional reinforcement as to time and place in the storyline.<br /><br />Kate makes an interesting heroine and a likable character. I found myself rooting for her right away and found her the most evolved of all the principal characters. While most were patting themselves on the back for their duplicity and ability to get others to do their bidding, Kate is the only one who realizes that the more meaningful aspects of life and having someone to trust are what essentially matter most. There is a fair amount of daily minutiae to wade through however I believe this makes for a more conflicted Kate, a woman trying desperately to put her past and her overly suspicious nature behind her and create a new life as a wife and mother. Her issues are that she can't let go of her past and can't quite embrace her future. Whether or not Kate fails or succeeds is one of the more interesting questions the story raises.d her the most evolved of all the principal characters.

For those not too demanding, the plot is enough to carry us along and books like this can bring new readers into the fold. My only hope is that people will also read writers like Dexter, Carpency, and Torres. If all the reader wants is the pot boiler, the reader will find that that will soon also be a thing of the past.

0393064476|3.0|Once upon a time there was an English major who came across the poem \\"On the Nature of Things,\\" by Lucretius.  He really liked this poem and decided to write an essay about how it influenced the development of the Renaissance by reintroducing humanist and Epicurean ideals that had been suppressed by the church for centuries.  The essay grew and turned into a book. The resulting book has a fine and interesting thesis, but in trying to prove his point the author goes too far.  Suddenly, a huge amount of the Renaissance flowering is due to the rediscovery of this glorious poem and the church is portrayed in an increasingly evil light for the Greek ideals it has repressed.  This ignores many other major world events which shaped the Renaissance such as the collapse of Constantinople and the resulting influx of intellectuals from there that spread knowledge and humanist ideals across Europe.  Not a bad book, but like an overextended essay it takes a single idea and stretches it way too far.
0385341008|5.0|Really great book.  Shows how people lived through the II World War in England but it's done with style, humor & grace.  At first I didn't think I would like reading someone else's letters but I find it very interesting & insightful.  If you love to read - don't miss this one it's really worth it.

0375851569|5.0|Great price for 5 books.  I read these aloud to my baby boy on a regular basis and he seems to enjoy hearing it as well as the images.  The experts all agree that you can't start reading to your kids too early and this is a really fun way to do it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I hate that you would have to use real money on certain items. I would rather pay for this game and get everything included in in. also the game hardly recharges my energy after I left the game so when I get back into it it still says I have none. that's when I just find another game in the meantime until it decides to start working. all in all it you get what you pay for....
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Evanescence has been one of my favorite bands since 2003 so I was hoping this effort would be fantastic like their other releases. To be honest, when I first listened to this album, very few parts really stood out for me. Fallen and The Open Door were the same for me too. But, the more I played them, the more I loved them. This record is no different in that case.<br /><br />It's one of my all time favorite albums now. I just can't believe the bonus songs weren't included on the standard edition, they're actually better than some of the tracks that are. One thing I love about this band is that they can change their style on each record but they still sound like Evanescence.  I do miss the epic strings and choirs that were used in their other works. The strings are used sparsely and choirs have been basically cut or replaced with Amy's layered vocals. But this album is fun and addictive once you get used to the energetic new sound. The lyrics are also a lot more positive and optimistic than previous albums. Most of the songs use the same basic guitar and drum sounds, with added occasional experimentation. I did welcome the addition of harp into the music, Amy plays it wonderfully and it gives a few of the songs a storybook atmosphere.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to see this material performed live yet but I bet it's a blast. The band sounds like they're having a great time with these songs. What You Want is one of the few singles I haven't gotten tired of listening to and is actually a perfect introduction to what most of the album sounds like, unlike most first singles bands release. Made Of Stone has a very catchy chorus and I absolutely love the guitar solo, I wish there had been more of those. The Change's verses are lovely, I love how Amy sings them. My Heart Is Broken is just perfect. Definitely a stand out song and one of my favorites they have ever done. The Other Side has very catchy verses. I think this could be a decent single. Erase This's intro andverses are my favorite parts. The chorus took me a little bit to get used to because it feels like it drags from certain extended notes but I like it now. And this is one of the few songs that used strings.<br /><br />Lost In Paradise is a gorgeous ballad that still gives me goosebumps. Amy sings it beautifully and pours so much emotion into it. I've noticed some people don't like how the full band kicks in and they think it would have sounded better with simply piano and strings, but I disagree. It doesn't ruin it at all. It reminds me of great ballads you used to hear on the radio back when it was still worth listening to for hours on end. Sick has an atmosphere similar to other rock bands I listen to. I really like the chorus. The vocal distortion at the end is something I didn't expect but welcomed. End Of The Dream has a great beat and verse melody. The chorus was another part I had to get into. Amy sings each one amazingly, especially when she hits the high note at the end of the first.<br /><br />I approve of the synths used in Oceans. If they keep doing that, you won't hear me complaining. I find that song to be underrated. Never Go Back is probably my least favorite track. It's alright until the chorus. It also drags and took the longest to get used to. I'm not sure how this song is on the standard edition when Disappear isn't. The most unique song on this album is Swimming Home. It sounds a little strange when you first hear it and it sounds best on headphones. So many layers and sounds are woven into it and it's mostly electronic and the lyrics are just beautiful. It's the only song other than Secret Door that isn't intense or guitar driven.<br /><br />Bonus tracks: New Way To Bleed: Definitely should have been used in the standard. The vocal fueled intro and the harp parts are my favorites. Say You Will: Very energetic like most of the other songs. I like it, especially the ridiculously infectious chorus.  Disappear: Maybe it's because I can relate to it, I'm not sure, but I absolutely love this song. The chorus makes me want to throw my fist into the air and sing with it. Another favorite since I first heard it. It also has a great message. It's probably the most fun song they've ever done. Secret Door: Harp, strings and Amy's vocals dominate most of this song and I adore it. This sounds like something right out of a fairy tale. I almost wish she hadn't sang the chorus so intensely, I love her soft vocals a lot more. In short, it's a magical song.<br /><br />If I had written a review right after I had listened to it the first time, I may not have praised it so highly. I didn't hate it then, of course not, although it didn't seem to sink in at first. But a lot of my favorite albums are growers. It actually is a busy album and fairly intense but enjoyable.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never read teen books, but the more I kept hearing about The Hunger Games, I ordered a sample to read on my Kindle.  I didn't even have to finish the sample before I realized this was so much more then just a teen book, so I bought it. Though I don't normally like to read first-person, because it takes a very skilled writer to write in that format, I found that Suzanne Collins is, indeed, a very skilled writer. The book was much more then teen...it has great appeal to adults as well because it is written very maturely and also the emotions and observations of this young girl was a mature accounting. The plot was unique, suspenseful, poignant at times, horrifying at other times, and sends you into this society that is frightening. One of the things that particularly caught me and showed me the skill which this writer has, was Katniss' description of Prim's cat. She talked about the cat being ugly, with a face mashed in, half an ear left, and eyes the color of rotten squash. I loved that description! I knew right then I would love the way Suzanne Collins writes. I went ahead and purchased the other two books in this triology as well and loved them also. Plus, my husband who never reads this type of book, was convinced to read the trilogy and so I loaned him my trilogy. He was so impressed and admitted that this was writing at its best!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This cover the first half of the first book and it has all the key moments that sticks out in your mind when you read the book.  The actors do an excellent job with the characters and the set design is amazing.  If your a fan of the book, you won't be disapointed.

B001DF68MA|5.0|We got this about a week ago, we have taken our daughter out in it about 4 times already and she absolutely LOVES it. Our daughter is 20 months old, 33 inches tall and about 23 pounds and she fits just fine in it. My husband is 6'0 tall and says it is not uncomfortable for him at all to ride with her, says he has to bend his legs out a little bit as to not hit her but that it is not an uncomfortable adjustment. The only issue we have is that the little plastic push pins that hold down the fabric on the front where the kids hold onto, the little platform, two of the push pins fell off while they were riding around. If the rest fall off too there wont be anything holding the fabric to the platform. I'm sure we can rig something though if that happens, so I'm not terribly worried about it. Other than that, we love the purchase and would buy again.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I heard so much about the hunger games I was anxious to read it on my Kindle but was not able to download it.  I am totally bummed about and ended up purchasing a paperback copy of the book today.  So I will begin to read the old fashion way, page by paper page.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolotley love the games and the variety<br />of them they are the best I have played on the kindle fire for a long time
0307352145|5.0|Are you an introvert like me who has ever wondered if there is something wrong with being the way you are? Quiet, by Susan Cain, offers a well-researched book about what makes you the way you are from the culture you grew up in to your genetics. American society, in particular, places a lot of value on being extroverted and it proves to be true in a lot of business environments.  Sadly, a lot of talent and vision is overlooked due to the overvaluation of extroverts.<br /><br />Cain does an excellent job of covering the history of why extroversion has become such a valued trait in some cultures, what introverts can do to succeed without changing who they are and even how to do your best to help an introverted child be comfortable in their own skin.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this book very much, for me, the amount of research information was overwhelming at times. However, I would recommend this book to anyone, both introverts seeking to understand their genetic and cultural introvert makeup and to extroverts trying to understand the other 1/3 of the population.<br /><br />I received this book for free from Blogging for Books in exchange for my review.
