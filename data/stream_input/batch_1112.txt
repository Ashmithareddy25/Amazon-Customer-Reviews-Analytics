B003UESJHY|4.0|Christian Bale and Melissa Leo clearly relish their chance to play a manipulative, self-centered pair, with both lending their roles an unusual amount of depth and character. Beneath the dark cloud of bitter dreams and selfishness that surround both, it's easy to tell they see more than just a meal ticket in Micky's unlikely climb up the ranks, though both certainly enjoy the perks of that association. This is really at its best when teetering on the brink of two extremes, with loyalty and family bonds tugging in one direction while self-preservation and a devoted love interest pull in the other, and it feels like a lot of the air goes out of the story when there isn't a big blowoff prior to the finale. The majority of the picture is Micky trying to choose between a rock and a hard place, and in the end he never actually comes to a decision, which I suppose fits with his unsure personality. Interesting filming techniques add a small bonus to the experience, with a drastically different look and feel setting the mood for documentary scenes, family drama and fight nights, respectively. A solid flick, though not one I'd have expected to get a best picture nod.
0739499963|5.0|what can i say about nicholas sparks other than he is one of the greatest author for romance to come out in a long time.  love how he sets things in the south and constantly has twists in his novels.  great author, and of course, great book!
B002JTHFV2|5.0|The book is a very interesting document, with comments of Brian Eno, Danny Lanois, The Edge and others. And the lyrics of every song.  Very nice presentation for a great classic album.
B00428LIXO|4.0|This hammer is pretty cute and simple.  It makes sounds when you hit something and the face pops up.  It also has a disc that spins and a clicker.  The sounds aren't too annoying either and amuse babies.  This is a pretty straight forward and fun toy for any baby.

0937381888|5.0|When I started brewing, this was the book that gave me the knowledge to not fail.  As I've developed as a brewer, the book has stayed with me, informing me at each step.  I know I would be a much less skilled and more disappointed brewer without it.
0439023521|5.0|I first heard of this book from a friend and was a little skeptical to buy it when I found it in the \\"young adult\\" section of my book store. But I had checked out the reviews, which were all positive, so I went for it. Right from the first page I was hooked. I consider this a dark thriller and I am normally a romantic comedy kind of book reader but I have to say that this book has definitely influenced me to branch out on my reading style.     The idea of this world under a government on a control trip instantly created so many questions that were answered throughout the book. I think the main characters were amazing and loveable even if they didnt have the most loveable personalities. With each page turned there was never a moment of true predictability. Most of the time I was shocked at the brutality or the twist of events. Most of all I could relate to Katniss's love for her little sister and her act of selflessness. In addition, the relationship between Katniss and Peeta left me on the edge of my seat wondering when, if ever, Katniss would accept him.....but then there was Gale!? Of course, the games and the harsh reality of what these CHILDREN had to do in order to keep peace was horrible. But out of it came a new respect for the value of life and even new friendships.     When I finished the book I wasted no time picking up the second, as I had purchased the second and third books while I was still reading this one! I would definitely recommend the book to anyone who just enjoys a good read. Its suspenseful, emotional, horrifying, and special. This book is an easy read and truly addictive.

B003UESJHY|5.0|This movie has it all. Action, Comedy, Drama and Romance. Mark Wahlberg as Micky Ward was spot on. But to be honest Chistian Bale was the highlight of the movie. He stole the role in every way. Even in some ways overshadowing Mark. One of the best ways to to show how this movie impacted me was writing a poem for my second book.<br /><br />  Champion Hearts<br /><br />Two brothers are born both daring to dream,<br />Both seen training as engines of steam.<br /><br />One had a desire to get to the top,<br />To fight with his heart and never to stop.<br /><br />The other came out with fists that could sing,<br />With the help of his brother taken under his wing.<br /><br />Though tough times came to the brothers in life,<br />They stayed together through trouble and strife.<br /><br />With hearts and with strength they both came out swinging,<br />At the sound of the bell as it was dinging.<br /><br />Now the brothers have fought and have paid their due,<br />Their pride and their honor will all ring true.<br /><br />The cheers of their fans will always be heard,<br />When you say their names in whisper and word.<br /><br />And when the count is over long after it starts,<br />The brothers from Lowell both have Champion Hearts.<br /><br />  Ronald E.

1558908455|2.0|Potential viewers be warned: It is quite apparent from the rating distribution that the ballot box has been stuffed by die-hards. For there to be so many \\"5\\" ratings is just ridiculous. Essentially the movie has become a cult classic and thus one cannot expect much in the way of objective reviews. Cult classics by definition have a core constituency in love with the movie. It is a \\"5\\" to them no matter the flaws. This is apparent in many of the positive reviews written; they either make excuses for various aspects of the movie or acknowledge that your average viewer may dislike it.<br /><br />I won't waste words describing the story since that has been laid out in rather excrutiating detail by many reviewers already. Things start out very promisingly, with characters that are compelling due to good acting (except for often annoying Juliette Lewis who is well, annoying) and taut atmosphere, and a well-paced plot. That lasts for maybe 30-40 minutes, then all hell breaks loose. And I don't mean just the vampires, although that is the point in the storyline. The plot, characters, dialogue, motivations, etc fall apart and the movie just keeps going downhill until the ending mercifully arrives (though with a cool graphic novel-ish panoramic zoom-out/fade scene).<br /><br />Really, I think as soon as Danny Trejo appears it is pretty clear that things are taking a turn for the worse. Fred Williamson and Tom Savini are the equivalent of \\"B-grade cliche\\" roadsigns as well. Yeah, Tarantino probably cast them on purpose cause he loves the 70s exploitation and zombie stuff. Whatever. If you want to clamber onto the Tarantino self-indulgency bandwagon, that's your call. Either that or if you are addicted to all things vampire, you may like it. If you want to watch a truly well made thriller-horror film that successfully twists from the everyday normal to the mind-bending horrific, try something like \\"Audition.\\"<br /><br />I would have given this only 1 star, but Salma Hayek deserves at least a star all by herself. Tarantino did succeed at least with a truly astounding femme fatale moment for the ages. Hayek's entrance with the snake deserves to be up there with Bo Derek's jog on the beach in \\"10\\", Ursula Andress emerging from ocean in \\"Dr No,\\" and other one-of-a-kind sex symbol/erotic scenes.by herself.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|I love Tim Burton's style, subjects, music choices - have nearly all his movies and even soundtracks to some of them. So I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, it was rather a disspointment. I am not sure what was the reason - but I definitely did not like the music which was jumply and mostly consisted of irritatingly brief and not-finished phrases (with the exception of couple of episodes) and the fact that the actors could not sing to save their lives.     The whole was contantly switching from trying to look as theatrical and artificial as possible to a kind of macabre realism - patchy, inconvincing and out of rythm. The London scenes somehow managed to look both dirty, grim, menacing and coldly sterile at the same time. The coldness, the lack of passion and black dull sarcasm instead of humor is strange to me after previous Burton's movies. Not smth I will re-watch.
030746363X|5.0|I am a 23 year old male. I currently weigh in at 206 Lbs at a height of 6'2\\". I just recently finished the 28 days following just the fat loss portion of the book. I am by no means a stranger to the gym and carry a good amount of mass on my body and for the first time I am down to 12% body fat. Not exactly a body builder or professional athlete, but a farcry from anything I was able to achieve previously. 5 years ago as a senior in highschool I weighed 345 LBs. Mostly fat but with a lot of mass as well. Over the past years I have made numerous lifestyle changes between my diets, workouts, supplements, you name it, I have tried it. I didn't care about what was the healthy way of doing things I just wanted results. So I would shock my body through changing as much as possible and avoiding plateaus. I did really well and lost upwards of 140 LBs. But was weak around 200. So then it was onto muscle building and yoyo dieting and weight changes trying to get my strength back. It was a struggle but I managed. I also managed to get stuck at a point I was happy with strength and weighing around 220 pounds. But I wanted the 6 pack. Every one does right? I tried everything and 220 was where I was staying. No matter what ab workouts I did or how much I crash dieted or dehydrated myself, there was no change in definition to my mid section. Still loose flabby skin from being fat along with the abdominal fat that remained. My abs were in awesome shape and stronger than anyone  else I knew, but didn't look as good as most gym rats. Then came the day I saw some friends talking about the 4 Hour Body program on facebook and decided I would look into it. That was always my kinda thing. Weight loss and strength gain? I will bite. So I did some research. Found it here on amazon and spent the best 13 dollars of my life on a book that everyone wanting to lose weight should atleast read. I will admit I have lost weight in easier ways. It does require will power and proper documentation of all the moves you make with your diet and exercise. But if you have tried everything and still plateau trying to shave off the belly that remains when everything else is toned up. This works. No joke. No one is paying me anything to write this big novel as a review. But I'm sharing my experience so that it may convince someone else out there to give it a shot. I didn't lose 20 in 28 days but I lost a serious 14-15 in 28 days and somewhere around 4 inches off the gut I had remaining. Instead of 4 abs and a spare tire I have a 6 pack now. My only problem is excess skin from the weight losses I have had. And only time or surgery will fix that.     My suggestion is that before you read something and say \\"Oh that wont work for me. I know what causes me to lose weight and that won't work. I'm just different\\" Don't kid yourself. You are obviously wanting or needing to lose weight. Keep an open mind and give it a shot. And don't give up just cuz you lose 3 pounds and stall for a week. Stay with it. Don't cheat. And quit complaining about being fat if you are too lazy to do something about it. Will power and dieting are probably 90% of it. The other 10 would be getting off the couch and going to the gym for an hour a week or something. Anyone giving this book negative reviews either didn't follow the program correctly or at all. Because it worked quite well for me on the first cycle. I plan on undertaking the muscle-building program in the book next and then trying the fat loss again to see if I can achieve sub-10% bodyfat. I trust I won't be disappointed. You can lose weight. But it doesn't matter how good your teacher is if YOU aren't ready to take the test.     Oh yea, buy the book.
B000R8YC1I|5.0|I accusaly am a newbie to THE DARK CRYSTAL. What got me into TDC is how it is very dark but also family-friendly. Yes, this is more Lord of the Rings than Muppetville, but Jim Henson managed to pull off something adults would want to watch but also being child-friendly. Frankly, it amazes me that there was not a single frame of CGI in the film.
0756405890|4.0|I started reading it based on other people's reviews and initially was kind of bored.. I guess maybe it was the fact it tells a story that already has happened and the main character seems like a boring character. But as the story progressed and we start hearing about his childhood, that's when everything started rolling and I was in.    I have read many sci-fi books and my favorites are George R Martin (except for his Feast of Crows which sucks), The Way of Kings (amazing), Dragonlance, Magician: Apprentice, and Sword of Shannara series.     One thing I like about Name of the Wind is that the character seems real. I don't even know how to describe it. Other books, it seems the main character does things that's bone headed and you read in amazement as they do things that frustrate the heck out of you. Well, I never once fell frustrated reading Name of the Wind. Maybe it's because I recently read Robin Hobb's Soldier Son series and was so frustrated by the stupidity of her characters that I gave up on her book in disgust after 2 books. This one makes sense.    I highly recommend it. Plow through the first few chapters and you will be rewarded.    I think I know the word for why I like it. It's not TEDIOUS like so many other books... I noticed many great authors tend to make their books tedious after the first few in a series. They should learn when to end things.
B0000214F0|5.0|i own the single disc re-release of this film which i bought in 2007 by image ent(general media ent) as \\"the unrated edition\\" and is the same time frame and widescreen.    because of how extreme the sex(uality) is for a film of this nature, it's a rare  ocassion when i do watch it because the devient behavior going on makes my jaw drop  in shock, almost making me want to shut it off. but because i have a daring mind,  i don't. for those with innocent minds and weak stomachs, i strongly discourage  buying this film. those with a firm grip on reality whom want a very close representation of caligula's true crazed state of mind, buy it if you dare!
B000VDUWMC|1.0|This is a wonderfully logical argument for how things came to be the way they are, but the Kindle version is a huge disappointment.  First, text-to-speech is DISABLED.  Second, significant figures, particular maps, are entirely missing. Finally, several tables are impossible to read.  For example, Table 18-1 would be a very interesting comparison of many of the issues discussed in the book and would serve as a convenient way to tie several themes together, but it's presented in two chunks that don't fit together.<br />Bottom line: check it out from your local library.  Don't by the Kindle edition.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I don't often write reviews, but this book has moved me to do so.  From start to finish this book kept me riveted.  While I would not have assumed that I would have enjoyed reading about the grueling training regiment of our US Seals, I could not put this part of the book down.  The mission in Afghanistan was written as if we were there with Marcus and his team of heroes - every painstaking moment.  I am not overly sensitive, but the sacrifice, and the bravery of these men moved me to well up at times.  It is strange to rate a book with such a powerful and true story of sacrifice.  The story of these men is 5 stars and the quality of the book as a \\"read\\" is 5 stars as well.  If Marcus, or any other of his SEAL brothers ever read this review, your country loves and appreciates you, thank you for all you do.  SRM
B000FC2PKG|3.0|I thought this book just had too many coincidences....I thought it was an OK book.  But would not recommend it to a friend.
0500543933|1.0|This is a very disappointing representation of what street photography currently is like. It seems as though a group of individuals who were associated in one way or another via possibly the internet, came up with the idea for a book and solicited the work from a number of magnum photographers to give the publication some weight. However, the over all representation is misleading because about 70% of the content is of unsatisfactory quality and should not have been under consideration as actual street photography in the classic sense of street photography which the book initiates in its early profiles and by inclusion of the magnum photographers. A photography collection such as this should be an honest reflection of someones greatest achievement in the context of an even greater body of work. If this book did that then the supplied or chosen work as the photographers best images indicates that the rest of the images would individually be of lesser quality but as a body of work be overal higher consistency, then it speaks volumes about the editorial clout of the authors. I think its was considerably rash of the authors to name it as they did. It really doesn't take much effort now to find master quality street photographers out there in the world of the internet especially with places like flickr etc. It feels as though the authors had more 'pull' then clout.   I really cant recommend this book, its a terrible reflection of the art of street photography and an insult to good street shooters and at worst a disgrace to aspiring social documentarists everywhere.

0316010669|4.0|Blink  The power of thinking   without thinking  By Malcolm Gladwell         Blink, the unconscious awareness that sits in the subconscious helping people assess the situations and problems in their lives. Communities unknowingly have a blink tendency that was experimented on and shown in a study perform by a group of scientist from the University of Iowa that showed with a simple gambling test that anything that is not good for us or that place the slight bit of stress on is recognized but not reacted upon.   The recognition occurs within seconds of any said action/problem being started or observed, this means that people have the capability to access, understand, and adjust to any situation or problem within a blinks time.   The brain sends different signs to inform that it has unconsciously decided what we are going to feel about an object or situation, like the palms of the subject's hands becoming sweaty from the gambling experiment   of the study by the University of Iowa scientist, or the \\"Intuitive Repulsion\\" that Angelos Delivorrias felt when she got the chills and instantly knew that the Getty kouros.        The reader is initially stirring with questions, \\"Why should I trust this response?\\" \\"When should we be wary or trust the intuitive response?\\"        It is very easy to make mistakes; this was shown with the four police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo. One officer, Sean Carroll said that Diallo appeared \\"suspicious,\\" a man sitting around, he then said he was amazed because of the fact that he didn't run at the sight of police and called him \\"brazen,\\" a man standing outside observing his surroundings is brazen?        Finally they said he was dangerous because they miss read the snap judgment, or intuitive repulsion that they felt as he reached into his pocket before they opened fire, feeling as thought there life was in some kind of imminent danger.       Too often as humans do we misread our snap judgments and blink responses because of anemotion, which a previous occurrence has, lead us to form, this is the sole problem that people have with interrupting these early notification signs today. It is good that there was someone who was able to publish work in which readers can understand that they may be making these mistakes without recognition, and doing it in a way that the readers remain interested and entertained. Malcolm Gladwell made this scientific study amusing and easy to understand a great trait to have in any book published for the masses. Because this book was so interesting, it should be instituted in to school classes, instead of some of the books that are so dreadful to read and relate to. This is a great read and I would recommend this book to anyone without hesitation. we

B00127RAJY|5.0|Great, quick workout that does show results if you stick with it!   Those who already exercise moderately and are close to their target weight may not lose the 'up to 20 pounds' advertised on the DVD, but will certainly see results. While I did not lose a substantial amount of weight, the 30 day shred combined with proper diet modifications helped to shrink my waistline and tone up some of my trouble areas - namely -  the lower and upper stomach. I try to stay fit by running a few days a week in combination with other strength resistant workouts, but had a hard time finding the time to fit in a drive to the gym or the park to get it done.   I began this DVD on January 24th 2011. At the end of February 2011, I'm amazed at how my body still shows definition even though I'm only doing the shred 3-4 days a week now. My quads are more defined now then they ever have been - I love checking my legs out in the mirror ha ha! The three separate levels are difficult when you first begin them - I did level 1 for about a week, level 2 for a little over a week, then took the plunge into level three.   The first week of level one, I was so sore I could barely walk. A month later (now on level 3) I can skip two or three days between the shred and jump back into it just fine, only with slight soreness. For those of you (like me) who need a trainer or group to get you motivated - this DVD helps! No drive to the gym, under 30 minutes, and no rest in between sets will have you seeing results in a month.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|I have to start out by saying that I've been a Josh fan from the beginning. I went to his shows before he needed an opening act! I'm saying this because, while I'm a huge fan, I'm not going to gush simply because Josh released another album. I'm going to be honest. I am highly disappointed in Illuminations. The first time I listened to it all the way through, my reaction was a resounding, \\"Meh.\\" I didn't have a desire to listen to it again for weeks, and there wasn't one song that stuck in my mind, or that I found myself humming afterward. \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" is the obvious standout. Other than that, the album is unimpressive. Many songs sound like Sondheim rejects. The rest sound like he's sitting in a smoky French café singing unconvincingly about lost love. The album is devoid of Josh's usual passion. I feel like the album was overproduced, and that Josh was holding back for whatever reason. Even his high notes sound strained. (His falsetto, however, is fantastic as always.) Was he going for artsy? theater? If so, I'm disappointed in the number of songs he \\"talk-sings.\\" (Just get to the melody already, Josh! Oh... there isn't one?) Josh is touring in my city this summer, and I don't think I want to spend the money to hear an album I don't like, as big a fan as I am. I'll save up for the next album and tour... hopefully they will be worth it.
0375826742|3.0|Each book gets slightly worse than the one before. I mean there are enough good elements to these books to keep you coming back (dragons, magical creatures, good vs. evil, battles & violence) but there is so much cheese.  Ergon himself becomes almost unbearable to sit through.  Let's just hope Paolini has saved his best for last (book #4).  I'm looking forward to closure.

B003UESJHE|5.0|A great film with a great story all based on true and extremely historical events. Enough reviews have been written giving a synopsis and everyone says the film is great and worth seeing. I just wanted to further reinforce that opinion and after watching it win best picture over The Social Network, the good but not quite worthy of best picture film (IMHO), I am only more excited about it.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter and of course Colin Firth are all fantastic. They each stand out on their own but it is the way they interact that really sells this story and elevates it above others.<br /><br />An inspiring fact about this film is that it was written by a man who suffered and worked to overcome a stutter of his own, David Seidler. Probably a key reason why the story has such impact and emotion to it. See this movie, it's humorous, dramatic, at parts tender and tells a story on the backdrop of epic events all with a theme that is translatable to us all. We all have a voice, we just have to find it.<br /><br />Also congrats to Colin Firth for a well earned Best Actor award! And Tom Hopper for Best Director! So happy this film took home some well earned Oscars!
B003PIUBZS|4.0|If you loved \\"Rome,\\" (which was AWESOME, btw), you might be disappointed at first in Sparticus.  The first couple of episodes are borderline comic-book comedy in places, as if written by enthusiastic 14 year old boys who were trying to do \\"Rome\\" one better.  But as it continues, the scripting improves tremendously, and I got totally sucked into it.  The plot twists become increasingly convoluted and fascinating, and the performances become more and more layered and nuanced over time.  The violence remains comic-book, over-the-top, but it serves its purpose.  Also, forget history for the most part.  Just enjoy the show.

038572179X|3.0|For me, Ian McEwan's book, Atonement, was mistitled. I think a better title would have been \\"How to profit from ruining others' lives\\". I was prepared to give this book a chance. A slow start, but good use of language, beautifully written, characters to love and hate and what seemed like a good story until the rather grim ending, which made a complete lie of the blurb on the back:  \\"Briony will have witnessed mysteries, and committed a crime for which she will spend the rest of her life trying to atone\\". If doing a bit of wartime nursing and then writing the story of your crime after all the people to whom it might matter have died, first changing the ending so that it will be more acceptable to the reader, then Briony's definition of atonement is something different from the accepted one. \\"Atonement: amends or reparation made for an injury or wrong\\". I felt cheated by the ending for the time I spent on this book. Guess I don't need to try any more by Ian McEwan!

B000000H5K|3.0|To me, Roots sounds like the work of a spectacular thrash-metal band who has run out of ideas.  To compensate, they experiment with different tunings, guest performers, tribal sounds, screaming vocals, simple riffs, and a stripped-down raw sound.<br /><br />Sometimes it works, and when it does, it's fantastic.  When it doesn't, it's just plain boring.  There's a lot of songs on here, but only about half of them are mildly interesting.<br /><br />You just can't expect a band to strike gold every time (Arise, Chaos AD), and Roots is a serviceable release, but for a band as great as Sepultura, it just feels like a step backward.  Still worth a listen, though.
B002VKB0M4|4.0|Paris is one of the world's major cities.  With 2 million residents, and another 10 million living in the outskirts, there seems to be an infinite number of stories that could be told.<br /><br />In this movie, Paris, the focus is on a few stories and how they can intersect.  A dancer with a chronic heart condition.  His sister, the single social worker who solves other's problems.  A middle-aged history professor with his mid-life crisis.  Super models.  An architect.  A produce seller.  A waitress.  An immigrant from Cameroon.  And more.<br /><br />And in the background, all the time, is the Paris skyline, featuring the Eiffel Tower.  It dominates the landscape.<br /><br />The stories are interesting, engaging, and sometimes unpredictable.  This is an \\"artsy\\" film, so don't expect thrilling intrigue.  The individual stories revolve around life and death issues.<br /><br />Pick this one for a movie night with friends.  In French with English subtitles.

A book group leader assigned us this novel.<br /><br />It was slow reading at first--not because of those caps which, in time, came to signify so much in Jack's world. Rather, I needed to stay in the character of the five-year old Jack as his mind was attuned to his surroundings, his days filled with games and imagination. Jack's mother's devotion and the routine she keeps for him while teaching him everything within his grasp in the convoluted world in which they live is remarkable. Any mother who's ever been confined to the home on snowy days can appreciate what it takes to live entirely within the limited 11-feet square windowless cell the two of them inhabit for years.<br /><br />Jack's unbound energy, his fresh perceptions and his acceptance of facts are both touching and awe-inspiring. As the story begins to unfold, we learn of the circumstances of Ma's incarceration, and the adult in us feels the indignation and outrage that Ma hides so well from her son.<br /><br />With sure prose and wonderfully sensitive insights, Emma Donahue also takes the reader through the voyage of discovery of another world, the Outside, and finally to the hair-raising realization that Jack's mother's prison and place of untold suffering will forever remain his \\"home.\\"
B000002B49|1.0|There are examples of artists who combine folk music with modern elements with great success. Boheme by Deep Forest is not one of them. It could have been well-made, but it is not even bearable. I think the problem is that it has no heart; it is like Frankenstein's monster, put together from pieces formerly alive, then animated with a bolt of lightning. Literally.     I am a big big fan of folk music from any part of the world, especially if it is Eastern European. I had listened to this album four or five times, and I liked it less and less each time. I have to agree with another reviewer who describes it as \\"god-awful\\". The singing is distorted and over-synthesized to the point of being downright painful to listen to. I can barely distinguish the language the songs are sung in, which happens to be my native tongue, Hungarian.     I wonder how the musicians who performed the original songs feel about their work being used this way. I wonder if they even know about it. They may or may not have been ripped off, but you and I surely have, along with the Hungarian language, the image of Eastern European folk music, and the genre or style represented thereof. Such a sad affair.
006092988X|5.0|This is a classic that I just got the chance to read. I've seen it on the bookshelf so many times, and never picked it up. Finally, a friend loaned it to me, and I'm so glad.   I liked this book because it spoke to say many childhood that aren't given a voice ordinarily. It's a great story, honestly told.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|Overall a great CD. Some of the tracks don't quite seem to fit, in a way that the flow from one song to the next seems abrupt a few times. This album is definitely another step forward for Linkin Park, a continuation from Meteora.
B000O599WG|5.0|The movie itself is of course one of Wayne's best.  However, I'm just going to mention that the picture quality on this version is significantly better than the DVD my kids have borrowed from my Mom for years.

B004DK5CW4|2.0|It's sad that a mediocre movie like this somehow garners such high ratings on Amazon.  Maybe the story of Secretariat lacks drama - but it's kind of needed for the movie.  Where was it?  I was never convinced that the owner of Sham was a villain.  And was there supposed to be drama in regards to Penny's family situation?  In movie terms - dramatic tension, character development, pacing, emotional resonance - Seabiscuit [[ASIN:B00005JMCN Seabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)]] was by far the superior movie.    If you want a predictable, mushy, mostly-fictional horse movie, you've found what you're looking for.  But otherwise, save yourself the money and go watch the videos for the actual Triple Crown races that Secretariat won.  Nothing beats the thrill of the actual races run by this amazing horse.

B003ODL004|3.0|Except for a couple of truly original \\"musical\\" scores including Hans Zimmer's very dramatic music for \\"Inception\\" this was a very lean year for nominees in the category of original musical score at the Academy Awards.  Not that there were not some very good scores this year...there were, but some of the best were not even nominated.  Of those actually nominated Zimmer's rather crashing approach fit what was happening on the screen enormously well and while perhaps not his best effort recently, it was the best of a limited field and quite an ear full.  Sadly, the best score of the year, Danny Elfman's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" was not nominated but was easily the most recognizable piece of music at the awards last evening.  Solid production values, and adequate packaging.

B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is extremely amazing that I knew all along the this picture was going to won the Best Picture Oscar with Best Actor for Colin Firth, Best Original Screenplay for David Seidler and Best Director for Tom Hooper. I have to see yet but planing to see British history unfold in this small $15 million budget production becoming such a $244 million dollar blockbuster hit. This was the year that The Weinsteins have a Best Picture Oscar winner with great performances aside from Colin Firth, Geoffery Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall and others in this now- not forgoting new classic that people will be talking about for generations that The King's Speech defeated The Social Network for Best Picture and Director at the Oscars. Don't Miss out see either in your local theatre near you or wait for the blu-ray and dvd release.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Great Gods, does this album CRUSH! I was an Accept fan back in the day, and to hear these guys refreshed and reloaded is an absolute joy. You can hear it in the music and the vibe, Accept has returned from the ashes to bring out a surprisingly strong set of songs that only serve to enhance the band's legacy. I'll leave it to the liner notes to embellish the reunion story, suffice it to say that bringing in former T.T. Quick frontman Mark Tornillo as lead singer was a stroke of genius. His snarling vocals are the perfect counterpoint to Wolf Hoffman and Herman Frank's massive guitars and the rock-hard rhythm section of bassist Peter Baltes and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann. Tornillo's presence has obviously reinvigorated the band, and they deliver this mostly uptempo batch of songs with flair and precision.<br /><br />It's difficult to pick a standout track from an album of this high a quality. Opener \\"Beat the Bastards\\" is followed up by lead single and video \\"Teutonic Terror\\", both EXCELLENT songs that showcase the strengths of the band. \\"Time Machine\\" has been getting a lot of play on a few of the internet radio stations (KNAC spins it a LOT), and the title track is killer. My favorite track may be album closer \\"Bucketful of Hate\\", a blistering dose of crunch that displays why these guys can still eat younger bands alive.<br /><br />\\"Blood of the Nations\\" has turned out to be a massive global success for Accept, and these fellows deserve it. Accept was an influence on a lot of bands, and it's good to see they still have the stuff. The production on this record is outstanding, and the sound is incredibly fresh and classic at the same time. Much like Alice in Chains did with \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\", Accept have updated their sound and and integrated a new singer and still managed to keep all of the classic elements of their signature style intact. It's old-school, but it sounds hip and current at the same time.<br /><br />I can't deny that Accept just blew me away with this disk. I've spun it dozens of times and it still gets me going every time. In a day and age where bands are going for the digital download killer single, it's nice to have a group put out a collection of songs in an album format and have every one be a winner. Guys, you did yourselves proud on this one, and I hope you keep on pumping out the anthems for a long time to come.<br /><br />Two BIG Devil's Horns up on this one, kids!

B003UESJHO|5.0|Those of you who haven't seen this really great movie probably don't know that this is less of a film about boxing than it is about a deep, complex, topsy-turvy but ultimately loving relationship between two half-brothers, Dicky Eklund and Micky Ward.  Don't miss it.<br /><br />Christian Bale's performance of Eklund is other-worldly.  Watching his pitch-perfect portrayal of a Lowell, MA denizen, I found myself constantly thinking \\"Remember, this guy is Welsh-born, raised in England.\\"  Like me, all Massachusetts-born movie watchers scrutinize the accent and the attitude, calling out the offenders like the Laura Linneys and Robin Williams (dreadful in [[ASIN:B003ASLJQS Mystic River]] and [[ASIN:0788814664 Good Will Hunting]] respectively).  But of Bale: he's nothing short of amazing.  In physical transformation, talk and character, he is Dicky Eklund.<br /><br />Amy Adams and Melissa Leo are also great.  The awards season has validated that.  But what of Mark Wahlberg?  This movie was his idea, his passion, his long-running obsession.  Why no awards for him?  Bale said it best at the Golden Globes:<br /><br />\\"I've really got to give a shout out to Mark, because he drove this whole movie, and you can only give a loud performance like the one I gave when you have a quiet anchor and a stoic character.  I've played that one many times, and it never gets any notice.\\"<br /><br />David O. Russell's direction is fantastic.  The fight scenes are superb.  He also does great things with Ward and Eklund's pack of seven sisters.  Russell bunches them together on couches or spills them out of a car like in a circus.  In the theater I was in, the audience totally got the humor in those scenes.<br /><br />Other great touches:  the HBO and ESPN commentary heard the movie is the actual commentary from the fights; many of the boxing scenes are punch-by-punch recreations of the original bouts; putting footage of the real Ward and Eklund (2010 vintage) during the credits (which will give you an even deeper appreciation for Bale's portrayal...eerie).Bale's portrayal...eerie).
B000069HJN|5.0|During it's existance Supertramp always seemed to be caught between three very different musical identities:pop,art rock with strong jazz leanings and a bluesy R&B vocal and piano style. To their benifit most of their career they were able to fuse all of these styles into something very memorable and usually very exciting. And considering they always drifted more toward the melodic and highly crafted side of things that meant that huge commercial successess such as [[ASIN:B000068FWC Breakfast in America]] and to a degree the more somber toned [[ASIN:B000069HJI Famous Last Words]]. Several years later they arrived at the mid 80's and pop music was not in a period that strongly emphasized individual expression. Not only that but they were feeling the loss of Roger Hodgson,the bands main creative vessell so it was up to the remaining members,in particular Richard Davies to try to carry things forward.<br /><br />  Especially for the mid 80's this was a rather chancy sort of album for Supertramp to make. The emphasis throughout this album is far less on classically inclined symphonic rock elements and more on tighter and more harmonically demanding aspects of soul/funk and jazz. The album begins of course with it's best known and one of the stronger on the album \\"Cannonball\\",a dynamic piano/horn based disco-funk-pop/jazz hybrid with some slippery instrumental and vocal lines married to this sleek but rather conservative production style. Of course you still have those densely chorded piano rock type songs such as \\"No In Between\\" and \\"Every Open Door\\" which sound more obviously Supertramp-ish yet the sax drenched 50's style rhythm & blues rhythmic pattern of \\"Still In Love\\" and to a degree the slower funky stomp of \\"Better Days\\" are a refreshing surprise. The 16+ minute title song is really surprising. Moving throughout different radio/TV collages into both melodic passages and...a long segement that more closely resembles something along the lines of Ornette Coleman style free jazz does have a strong emotional resonance and conveys a lot of moods in relatively quick bursts.<br /><br />  One may find it interesting when a lot of progressive rock bands were either going into a highly poppified arena rock direction or simply flying off into near total obscurity that Supertramp would be the ones to focus more on keeping a certain progression forward in their own respective genre by bringing new and modern ideas into their sound,much as The Alan Parsons Project and King Crimson were doing at the same time period. The rhythmic complexities and challanges coming from different hybrids of polyrhythmic 70's funk,jazz fusion and even the new wave style obviously had a very strong impact on all of these bands and even though your going to find a good deal of \\"good,bad and ugly\\" types of opinions of this album (mostly relating to it's place in the bands discography) it's actually one of their most fresh and unique releases and merrits a good deal of listens to get the full effect.ong the lines of Ornette Coleman style free jazz does have a strong emotional resonance and conveys a lot of moods in relatively quick bursts.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Hey, it's a portable sharpener, that's all. It's great for those of us who need a quick sharp blade on knives built for every day use like folders and camp knives. I can understand why the pros with very expensive specialty knives may need better equipment for the delicate work of honing the perfect edge but I certainly don't. Besides, I'm not too good with the well oiled stone and tend to mess up the angle and scratch up my blades. If I use the Pal at least my knives don't look butchered. I like its portability also - easy to carry into the bush or around the work area.<br /><br />I found that the fixed angle of the cutters gives me an even edge. You will have to work it a bit more on thicker blades with a fatter edge but once the angle is cut the edge will go sharp... not razor sharp but sharp enough for what I need. HERE'S THE TRICK; I apply even, steady, pressure with the carbide if I need to cut a new edge and slighter pressure with the ceramic if I just need a touch up. Don't be too fast with it though - you should be able to hear and feel it slowly cut the steel as the blade tries to resist. Having the tip of the blade pointed down a bit as you pull it through enhances cutting efficiency. It seems to cut 1075/1095 easier than 440c steel. Good luck and don't cut yourself!.<br /><br />Update: 7 Sep 2011<br /><br />After using the Pal for a few months I noticed that the knife edges have been cutting a notch in the ceramic sharpener and now it just flattens my blades. Maybe I'm too powerful and applied too much pressure.
B000008LAC|5.0|If [[ASIN:B000069HJN Brother Where You Bound]] was any indication Supertramp were headed in the opposit direction from where they began and,as mildly unpopular as it was commercially this album represented that shift most of all. Recorded in 1987 this album found Rick Davies taking the band in a more full on jazz/R&B direction,in this case somewhat more similar to the slickly modern sheen of Paul Weller's Style Council. Full band production and mild hints of 80's synthesized production are blended here in a wonderful way and despite what some may think or say all the songs here are full of strong melodies,hooks and all sorts of wonderful musical surprises. The only thing that may come as a shock is the abrupt veer in direction.<br /><br />  I say veer because if you'd been listening to Supertramps music earlier in the 80's this shift was an enevitabilty. The only song on this album that has an obviously sharp 80's dance flavor is the opener \\"It's Alright\\" but for the most part this album consists of funky and snappy late 80's style \\"Brit-soul\\" along in the place of \\"Not The Moment\\",\\"It Doesn't Matter\\",the title song and \\"Thing For You\\". There are also two very inventive musical moments which both embrace a strong latin/salsa flavor in the place of \\"I'm Beggin' You\\",a standout featuring some extremely catchy and uniquely chorded piano work and the album finale \\"An Awful Thing To Waste\\" which spins out into a pretty full out dance-funk/salsa instrumental by the middle of the song. \\"You Can Never Tell With Friends\\" brings out a meatier R&B flavor,as featured somewhat deeper in the mix elsewhere here with some heavy horns and harmony vocals.<br /><br />  Now for fans of Supertramps classic progressive pop sound of the 70's this album is bound to receive mixed reactions and from all the negative reviews here that might steer a lot of people away from this album. In the end it's more a question of your individual musical taste. If your interested in relatively organic late 80's British soul/funk and R&B with enough exotic touches to make it interesting and some superb songwriting this may be just the Supertramp album for you. However if your taste goes for more extended symphonic runs and more aggresively socio political lyrics you might want to look to earlier albums because this represents an entirely different side of the bands talents.cal taste.

0142410373|5.0|This might be one of the last books that Dahl wrote but this was the first one I read.  I still remember the day I got it, it was a book fair in the library in my middle school, I had 10 dollars to spend on whatever I wanted. I looked at all the books (there must have been about 100 books for sell), then I saw it a yellow cover with a little girl sitting on a pile of books.  Somehow I saw myself in that picture so I got it.<br /><br />In reading the book the little girl, Matilda, was not much like me at all other than she liked reading books.  She had really bad parents but she was really smart and so she did her best to take care of herself (much like Lisa Simpson), she started to go to the library by herself to read books since she was very young.  Then it was time she went to school.  She ended up getting a very nice teacher but the head master of the school was very mean, much like her parents but far worst.  One day she discovers she has powers and that's when the main story begins.  It's basically about how she uses these powers to get the life she deserves.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any girl that likes to read.
B002ZG976U|4.0|This was a great movie!  Admittedly, the plot has been used before and it uses just about every cliche possible.  I don't care if it's a retread of a plot; if it's well done, it's worth seeing.  The musical numbers are dazzling and both Cher and Christina Aguilera do a fantastic job!  Christina really surprised me in that she was able to carry a movie pretty much by herself, but you can't knock Cher. (better not)  I don't understand why there were so many negative reviews about this film.  It's better seen on a large screen, so as to fully take in the production numbers, but I can't wait for the DVD.  It was much better than \\"Nine\\" and \\"Chicago\\".  For a great music, dancing and production, make this a must see movie!
0316067601|4.0|This is an enjoyable memoir written in a vernacular style (with the ghost writer credited right on the cover) that follows Marcus Luttrell through grueling Navy SEALS BUD/s training, and then to Afghanistan to a mission that went horribly wrong.    At times it wasn't clear if they were being attacked by \\"the liberal media\\"or the Taliban (it turns out it was the Taliban), but then again it is interesting to hear the views of somebody who was right in the middle of that conflict.    Personally I don't agree that the rules of engagement (ROE) should be disregarded (like shooting innocent civilians who unluckily stumble upon four commandos, for example), which seemed to be a consistent thesis of this book. True, at times ROE can be inconvenient - that is clear from this story. But frankly the fact that his team did follow ROE probably is part of the reason the villagers protected the author.    Also please consider history, think about armies that blatantly disregarded ROE - like the German Army in WWII. They would roll into town and if a sniper took a couple of pot-shots at them they would select ten random adult men and execute them irrespective if they were snipers or innocent bystanders. This cut down on sniper attacks for the short term - absolutely - but there was no way that they could ever hold the countries they invaded over time by building that type of animosity with the local population. Do we really want to be those guys?    As a matter fact I read this book while on vacation in Panama - a country the US invaded invaded twenty years ago. The US tried very hard to follow ROE and if they hadn't do you think that I (a US citizen) would be welcome there now?    Anyway - the book is intriguing. One reviewer below writes, \\"For a person who doesnt enjoy books i really enjoyed the Lone Survivor.\\" That is funny and I respect that. This book is not written in a literary style, it reads almost as if he spoke it instead of writing it - but it is enjoyable and thought provoking never-the-less, and seems to have a very wide appeal.
B003BVK2ZS|4.0|I found this book intriguing as a case study of a person suffering from what is known as a malignant (also called pathological) narcissistic personality disorder.  Mr. Gilkey met about all the diagnostic criteria and I think it explains his compulsive need to steal these first edition books in order that he may be envied and admired.  He always wanted to seem to be that educated well read gentleman with the impressive library.  If the only way he could achieve that is by stealing--well that is ok in his distorted way of thinking.  He thinks that possessing these books will be his ticket to social acceptance and and an elevated status.  People with this disorder have absolutely no empathy for what they put others through.  Recent research shows that people with this diagnosis have no activity at all in the region of the brain where you feel sympathy and empathy for others.  The neurons in this area do not fire at all, so it is like a dead zone.  Scientists now believe that this is a brain malfunction that helps to explain why these people are so incapable of changing and understandiong the effects of the actions.  I thought of this when I would read all of Mr. Gilkeys convoluted justifications that what he did was ok.  His excuses varied from \\"all book dealers are crooks\\" to \\"the taxi driver picked up the book, not me\\" to \\"how else could I get my library?\\".  I think one of the instances that really showed how out of touch he was with reality is when he told the story of how offended he was when he was ordered to leave a bookstore where he had earlier perpetrated a book theft.  He wanted to sue because he felt his civil rights had been violated.  It's unbelieveable that he sees himself as the aggrieved victim.<br /><br />People with this disorder have a lot of trouble with impulse control.  They take a lot of risks that another person would not.  Somehow, they learn to have a lot of surface charm and are master manipulators.  Evidently Gilkey had this in spades.  He was so deferential and obsequious, that he could get a job at Saks when he was released from prison.  The author herself admits she was taken in by his charm.  She would listen to her interview tapes after being with him, and with just the audio, she would begin to see Gilkey in a different, more sinister light.  I think then she could hear the true awfulness of what his crimes were.<br /><br />I do believe that this book suffered a bit because of the author being taken in by Gilkey's surface appeal and her constant desire to treat him in a nonjudgmental way.  Her biggest concern is not to offend him and not to lose contact with him.  After three years of interviewing and studying the man, I yearned for her make a really insightful, psychological analysis of him.  She held back from doing this, and I think the book suffers for it.  I wish she had consulted psychologists, as it it would have aided greatly in our understanding.  From my reading on the subject, I am afraid that much of her work encouraged Gilkeys already strong narcissistic absorption in himself.  It became particularily disturbing toward the end when he kept coming up with suggestions as to what would make a good ending for the book.  I was alarmed when Mr. Gilkey asked the author if what he should do now is steal all 100 of the Modern Library top 100 books.  He was asking her, in a sense, \\"Is this the ending you want for your book?\\"  I felt then that the author was caught up in the web of this man's illness and delusions, and that she was also aiding and abetting them.  From what I have read, the treatment plan for these individuals is to get them away from their delusions of grandeur, and instead reward them for normal human acts of kindness and connection.  I think the author and her book essentially egged on his delusions.  Is it no surprise that Mr. Gilkey wants Nicolas Cage to play him if there is a movie??  Is it no surprise that although the author sent Mr. Gilkey a copy of her book, he has yetto read it, but he carefully follows the sales records and is very pleased that it is a bestseller?<br /><br />I believe the author may have crossed into unethical behavior three times.  First when she was meetng with the FBI, they asked her, \\"If you knew of any stolen books, you'd tell us right?\\"  At the time she knew of the $9500 set of travel books but wasn't sure the date that it had happened.  She had to go home and check through her notes to find if the 5 year statute of limitations had passed.  She also kept quiet about his stealing covers off library 1st editions, and that he also cut out and stole some maps.  Her third act of collusion is when she kept quiet about the fraud he was commiting on his Americal Express card (making a whole bunch of charges, then claiming that they weren't his.)  I thought the bibliodick Ken Sanders was the one who was thinking clearly about all this and I thought he was correct to chastise the author for her behavior.  I read in an interview that Mr. Gilkey has committed one more criminal act since the publication of the book.  Ken Sanders reports that in 2009 Gilkey wrote a bad check for $500 for a rare book and the check had his own name on it.  One good thing about the press this book has gotten is that it will make Gilkey's name and behavior more recognizable to book dealers.<br /><br />On a lighter note, what did you make of Gilkey's idea to open a rare book store where he would sell a classic book along with a bobblehead doll of the author?

B002MZKQ32|5.0|A great book.  I wanted to find out more about this country and it filled my expectations.  I definitely learned more about the woman's role in Afghanistan.  I found it to be a very sad book.
B00000DGUG|3.0|In the wake of Jagged Little Pill, Alanis Morissette created a sophomore album (not counting her first two Canada-only releases) that was almost nothing like the album that made her famous. This is a feat that many artists don't try, and that a fateful few try and fail at. The result is usually the alienation of many of the fans that allowed you to go ahead making a sophomore album in the first place.     SFIJ is full of classic, unappreciated Alanis songs. Its greatest downfall: like every Alanis album, it has a tendency to ramble in places. It was a brave album to make after Jagged Little Pill, but it wasn't exactly better than JLP. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy SFIJ very much, but it tends to overstay its welcome in places and drags. It has enough redeeming moments to make it worth listening to.     Front Row - 4/5. This is a weird song. It's one of the easier songs to listen to, but it rambles too much to really keep up with.   Baba - 5/5. Critical and fierce. Very much like the Alanis introduced to us in JLP.   Thank U - 3/5. Beautiful song that highlights the gentler and more tender Alanis songs.   Are You Still Mad - 3/5. An intimate song about the things that can go wrong in a relationship.  Sympathetic Character - 5/5. Disturbing and sad. A look at abuse and the complicated relationship between abuser and victim.   That I Would Be Good - 1/5. Drags on too long and is hard to follow.  The Couch - 3/5. A good story song about a man in therapy. You have to be in the right mood to get into it though.   Can't Not - 1/5. In this song, Alanis asks if she is whining. The answer is yes.  UR - 5/5. A charming song about the artist.   I Was Hoping - 5/5. A conversational song that goes in all different directions, but you just can't not listen to it.  One - 2/5. There's not much to this song that you haven't heard before on this album.   Would Not Come - 3/5. Hard to listen to, but too fascinating not to. More self deprecation.   Unsent - 5/5. A sweet look at the men inAlanis' life and how they shaped her. Think along the lines of Head Over Feet but about multiple people, and if they had broken up.   So Pure - 4/5. This song is short but satisfying. Optimistic and cute.   Joining You - 5/5. Heart-wrenching song about a suicide and the best friend touched by it.   Heart of the House - 3/5. Sad song about the relationship between a mother and daughter.   Your Congratulations - 2/5. Slow album closer. Once again about self discovery and listening to herself.
1423101472|5.0|This was a very good book and very good buy. I am very big fan of the whole series but i do have to say that this one is my over all favorite book out of the series. I recommend this series and this book to anyone of all ages.
B002OFWG7E|4.0|As a casual fan this collection was made for me. I did have the first two albums, but you know, you can't stick with every band album after album. Like any hits disc I wish this was in chronological order. Not sure why bands feel the need to shuffle their songs up. My music players have a shuffle button. As far as what's included here it's pretty much what should be. I'd add \\"I'll Stick Around\\", but otherwise not bad. Like the cover art too. This is also available with a DVD of videos if you want. I'll just hit youtube.
1594202842|1.0|I picked up this book after recent controversies about this one in the news. I appreciate some of the good points Ms.Chua puts forward - set high expectations for your child, never let your child give up - but that's about it. A very good book on how *not* to parent.     Yes, there are judgmental, narcissistic people in this world. And there are times when one might have to deal with them. But I am better off spending my time and money by doing something other than reading the autobiography of a psychopath. Ms. Chua is a perfect example for clinical definition of OCD.    I am glad I didn't buy this book (rented it from our local library)
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I'm a deer hunting, steak eating, Texan, but I have to say this movie does connect the dots pretty well about the US food supply and does it without too much bias. In fact the only scenes of chickens getting killed are from the segment on the 'good' farmer who does free range foods.<br /><br />With gas prices over $4, bottled water over $2, how can a burger really sell for $1??? Bottom line is you get what you pay for - lots of calories in an extremely non-nutritious meal. Free range and traditionally grown foods just taste better! If nothing else the movie will reaffirm that obvious fact.
B000002WCJ|5.0|I gotta say, this CD is a gem. One of the rare older discs that sounds better and more relevant today than ever. There are some great Vocals, some good, progressive playing and some incredibly funny, sarcastic, empowering and relevant lyrics. I never saw the brilliance in this CD in the 80's, but have gotten a new sense of interest in the old NWOBHM stuff. I guess I wasnt ready in the 80's for this CD's international feeling and flair. This should be regarded as one of the  best of the NWOBHM era, along with anything Maiden of course.<br /><br />'Rise and Fall' has some clever lyrics that would sound good in this overly political era that has no humor at all anymore. Along with a catchy chorus. Very fun track. 'Dr. Stein' is even more corny, but fun as well. I believe their humorous side of the band was looked upon the wrong way by us teenagers at the time. We American teens didn't get a lot of the sarcasm as the British fans may have.<br /><br />'We Got The Right' is a great, inspiring track with cool lyrics and another stellar vocal performance by Kiske. A Simple sentence 'You Better Believe what you do Has a sense, Its not for Nothing' is so cool to here these days. Good message. There are moments of pure brilliance in these lyrics that I may have thought were cheesy at the time in the 80's when I was a teenager. Problem was, I didn't understand them yet. I didnt THINK when i read them, I just listened to Slayer instead. I wasn't into the positivity then I suppose. Maybe empowering is a better word to describe.<br /><br />'You Always Walk Alone' is good, typical Helloween mid paced progressive style track, with solid performances by all players involved and excellent lyrics. 'I Want Out' is as catchy as it is a simple boost to the listener. Was a great song in the 80's and still is.<br /><br />'March Of Time' is a solid, rocking, mystical song with, again, cool lyrics that make their point. Feel good music with a message that is well performed. The title track closer is another eloquent yet progressive piece for the band, but to be honest, I listen to most of the other tracks more. This CD has Michael Kiske's best Vocal performance on any of their discs I believe. I believe he was enjoying singing these lyrics. It comes through.<br /><br />Their are a couple more songs, but there is no filler here. This was better than Part 1 and just a breathe of fresh air more now than ever. If anyone reads this and liked Helloween in the 80's, please do yourself a favor, and at least re-open your ears to this gem. They were never my favorite band by any means, but there really is some magic here, especially for fresh, wiser ears.ogressive piece for the band, but to be honest, I listen to most of the other tracks more.

B001V5ADS2|1.0|I like the show, but amazon's streaming is so abysmally slow it makes the show unwatchable.  Too bad.  I paid good money to waste my time.
0316069884|4.0|Fantastic book with critical information presented well. The author doesn't overload you with statistics and figures, and writes with a very easy to read style that flows well - resulting in retention of important facts that he uncovered in his research. Could you imagine a label on a pound of shrimp that says \\"26 pounds of other animals were killed for each pound of this shrimp\\"? That's a tremendous image.    His discussion of fish revealed a lot that I did not know about the industry - and added to my recently acquired information The Zen of Fish: The Story of Sushi recently. What was particularly highlighted to me was that there is absolutely no requirement for humane killing of fish.    There are also no standards for chickens, turkeys and pigs. The author uses great images to convey information about numbers of animals and their confinement.    As a vegan for 5 years, a vegetarian eating fish only occasionally to rarely for the previous 10, and only eating \\"white\\" meat when socially compelled or required by personal relationships for the previous 20 -- I rather thought I was doing my part. I write a food blog that provides recipes for friends and strangers, feed everyone I know, help provide information about how to eat compassionately and do what I can to support others in this choice. After reading this book, I am thinking that perhaps that isn't enough - though there are so many problems in the world, one might think that working to educate people about veganism is low on the list of priorities.    However, if you look at it like this - 1/3 of all available surface land on our planet is dedicated to animal agriculture, and 30% of global warming is due to animal agriculture. This doesn't even address issues of pollution & contamination caused by animal agriculture or the devastation of species diversity in the ocean.    If our increased demand for more & cheaper animal flesh as food products is one of the largest leading causes of the destruction of our planet - what sort of legacy is that for future generations? I think the future generations can live better without a steak, hamburger, ham or turkey if it means more equitably distributed nutrition and less disease - and a better, more well fed, happier & healthier planet - for all animals, including humans. Now I just have to figure out my role in all this better than just changing my own diet and encouraging folks in my limited sphere of influence.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Having watched Band of Brothers several times myself, I had no hesitation in ordering it as a gift for my son. I KNEW he would love it, and he does.<br /><br />The shipment arrived exactly on the date forecasted when I ordered, and I have no complaints.
B0000074NU|5.0|This is a great intro cd to British hard rockers icon UFO.  Theses dudes tore it up in the 70s (80s stuff is weaker after Michael Schenker left solo).  Every track rocks the house and great way to get into this band.  Dig a little deeper and check out their catalog from this decade for some deep cuts.
B003TGUSHM|1.0|I am a Mac-user and I bought the Legend of the Seeker so I could watch it on my computers and / or the tv/ ps3. You need a PC to download any and all of the Amazon Video on Demand. Amazon needs to extend their products to is Mac-people. I had to seek  a refund. I did recurve the refund no problem.
B0044E9LW6|4.0|Both of these live sets rock with energy and passion, just like RJD lived his life. The setlists are cool mix of Rainbow, Sabbath and his solo hits.  Only gave this 4 stars, because 1 of the live cds sounds poor.  I am a big live music collector and was surprised to hear lots of hissing when you crank it up. The other disc sounds great though and well worth adding classic metal riffs from an Icon to your collection.  The artwork and inserts are awesome. I wish that I could have seen him live on his recent comeback shows w/ Heaven & Hell.
0596805888|5.0|Too much fun. Tried some of the taste experiments with the kids. Made my own vanilla, finally, for the first time. Very clear explanations. Tried making the bacon infused Bourbon for my husband and friends. It was okay, but used the same process for bacon infused vodka. YUM!!!
B003MOHX8S|5.0|EPIC music, like many types, can be the 'same old stuff' after a while. While choir voices can certainly heighten the emotional impact of EPIC music, (and I do enjoy a good choir of supporting voices in the EPIC genre now and again) too much of it can also make me want to run, screaming from the building, in fear that it might collapse or that my head will explode--I guess that's why they call it 'EPIC.'     I found this album very refreshing in how it remains faithful to the EPIC genre, but stays personal and diverse with every track.    Check out the album by enjoying the samples on Amazon's site. If you like movie music that propels and motivates, but doesn't wear you out with the same driving force track after track, then this album is definitely for you.  There's enough variety on each track that you can listen straight through without feeling like you just completed a round of Wipe-Out.    Oh, and the choir voices are practically non-existent which is another reason it stays so refreshing but still manages to deliver the epic force you'd expect--another reason this album is truly EPIC.

0312600844|1.0|Clearly it is a reading level of grade 4 which speaks to Oprah's education. This book is a insult to intelligent writing. Graphic sex, drugs and violence to cats seem to be the theme  of this low class read. I highly do NOT recommend this as it is just trash and a waste of good reading time. To a true well read educated reader, this is just a example of poor writing, and highly insulting to the intelligence of the reader. The poor use of speech and mis-spoken English grammer here are laughable, as if it were written by a child. The graphic nature of abuse to women and cats clearly is a disturbing picture of what the mind is of the author. What a shame that such trash was printed. And equally disturbing that it is on a best seller list, which is simply marketing by 20 year olds in positions of editor that have no true education in books or reading.
B002ZG994U|4.0|I used to watch the \\"A-Team\\" as a kid, and I was very happy at this adaptation. It was enjoyable, escapist, and fun entertainment and the perfect \\"date\\" or \\"Friday night\\" movie. It was certainly not a \\"Bond\\" or \\"Bourne\\" movie, but given the pervading cheesiness of the orignal TV series, I never expected it to be. Expect lots of chases and lots of explosions, and lots of pretty good one-liners.
0880796863|3.0|These are great cards, the packaging is great and feels complete. However all these cards are discolored as stated by many other reviews here. There is a green/blue tinge on all cards, which is nothing horrible, and adds to the vintage feel, but still would have preferred the original colouring. Also there is a small printed branding on the face of every card. Very intrusive when dealing with these. Otherwise it's a great pack.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|Thought it was  blue ray because I searched for it under blue ray, my fault though. Oscar nominated movie
B000O75F7C|5.0|I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this is probably the best progressive rock album I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, if not one of the greatest conceptual rock albums ever. I don't make this statement lightly. When you start to understand the subject matter of the album, and then feel how the music backs up the grimness of it all...IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.    There literally is not a bad song of these 6 tracks. Musically the album stands alone on its own brilliance. Lyrically, it took some getting used to. The reality of overmedicating and desensitizing the youth of today is indeed real and fearful. The music backs these fears up with spacey, melodic and hard edgy music. It's amazing how it plays background to the subject matter in order to make the fear of a \\"blank planet\\" a reality.    This album is a work of art. It may take a few listens to combine the musical and lyrical benefits of this conceptual piece. But it will happen, and man is it worth the time.     The icing on the cake for this whole experience was seeing this album performed in  its entirety on the \\"Anesthetize\\" DVD. An unbelievable musical experience. I highly, highly recommend this DVD to anyone.     All in all, I cannot listen to this album enough. I cannot recommend it enough. I cannot stress how satisfying it was to listen to this and then see it performed in its entirety on the \\"Anesthetize\\" DVD. Please don't let this incredible album pass you by. It is simply fantastic. ENJOY!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If YOU love beyond-outstanding vocals and stunning music arrangement, I am confident that you'll love... \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", \\"Rumour Has It\\", and \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" These are my 3 favorite songs on this disc. This CD has NO weak songs ...but it's hard to NOT have favorites and these are mine.<br /><br />I have not been this excited about an artist as my recent discovery of Tonya Watts. This joins the company of my favorite discoveries of Patty Griffin, Kasey Chambers, Judas Priest and the Gear Daddies.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|This is my fourth Ricky Martin album and \\"I\\" think it's his best. I don't understand spanish but I love good music and great voices. His other albums, that I have, have great feature songs mixed with some so so. The best songs here are killer and not solely formula hits. They're GOOD. And no so so songs here. There isn't one I don't think stands on it's own feet. I've been playing it for a few weeks and still loving it!
0596007124|1.0|This book is oriented for pre-teenagers. It explains in 10 pages a subject which content could fit in a single page.
0545302862|5.0|I bought this series for my daughter and she loves it with a passion. As soon as she received the books, she was reading everyday until she finished the series.
B0042816YK|2.0|This movie misses the mark in every way.  It never becomes clear what demons Gilbert is wrestling with, she doesn't seem to really learn anything from her travels, and the big questions of life are barely even hinted at, much less seriously engaged.  Having sugary Julia Roberts play Gilbert only makes all of this worse. And to top it off, the movie is drainingly boring, with even the scenery failing to generate interest.  In short, the movie lacks both substance *and* style.<br /><br />I hope the book is better than the movie.  More importantly, I hope the real Elizabeth Gilbert has more depth than the shallow character presented to us.<br /><br />Not recommended, not even to waste time ... on second thought, maybe this movie would work well as a sleep aid.
B000063DFQ|4.0|Piece of Mind continued Iron Maiden's impressive run even if it isn't as strong as what came directly before and after that (The Number of the Beast and Powerslave respectively). The driving \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is an awesome opener as Bruce Dickinson's vocals soar while new drummer Nicko McBrain drives the engine to this riff fest. \\"Revelations\\" is one of the band's most cerebral tracks as it builds from its slow paced (for them) verses before getting relentless during Adrian Smith and Dave Murray's solos. In listening to this album, it appears as the band was really trying for the hit single on \\"Flight of Icarus\\" and \\"Sun and Steel\\". Both songs put a strong emphasis on memorable choruses, the track lengths are under 4 minutes (perfect for radio) and Bruce's vocals actually sound reined in. The live version of the \\"Flight...\\" on their Live After Death album is far superior. The video hit \\"The Trooper\\" is one of the band's best songs, featuring great hooks in its memorable guitar line and its stop/starts during the first verse. Other strong tracks include the heavy \\"Die with Your Boots On\\" and the slow burning \\"Still Life\\". The remaining tracks aren't on the same high level as the rest as \\"Quest for Fire\\" starts out hot but then loses a lot of steam when the verses kick in while \\"To Tame a Land\\" doesn't really take off, even if the playing is top notch. However, this is still a very good album and contains some of their best tracks.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|I was dissapointed that Clooney would have signed up for this movie.  Definitely not the caliber of the Oceans series.  I think they made the movie up as they went along !
0316010669|4.0|Got this book from a reading list for a Critical Thinking class I attended. I struggled through the first couple chapters of the book thinking the support for the conclusions to be rather weak. But as I got further in I was finding it more interesting and meaningful. The book finished strong. I've since purchased a couple of the books referenced in Blink. I gave away my original copy and will buy another. I thinking my second reading will put the first few chapters in a much better light.
0451196716|5.0|I love Stephen King, this was another of his totally bizarre books, only he could come up with this, wonder what it would be like to spend an hour in his mind, don't think I could handle more than that at a time.
B00424F4JC|5.0|We love this game! It is a clever game of strategy, logic, planning and adaptivity. Some parents don't often play games because they don't have the time to sit down. But this game is quick and lets you say yes to your kids more often. It is fun, we love playing quick rounds. You can make the game last long or short, make it easier or more challenging by using two or four men on the board, and it is nice looking because most of the pieces are wood. A great game to leave lying around.
0735619670|5.0|Code Complete is one of the top books I always recommend to programmers whose code needs to be heavily modified after peer reviews. I also recommend this book to experienced programmers so they can improve their coding style and find some new or forgotten coding tricks and techniques. I think Code Complete is one of TOP3 programming books that every serious programmer should read.
0312370849|4.0|This book, brought me too tears! I wished so badly for it to turn out differently. It was heart wrenching but I also have a baby boy near the same age, so it was just that much harder to read. I too struggled with Julias side of the story but suprisingly there were a few times I couldn't wait to get back to her side of things. But like others have said Sarah's side pulls you in way more. All in all I couldn't put the book down but I was also sad for days, even after reading. I would recommend this book.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|We have all eight seasons and found this to be a great series compared to a lot of the programs on TV these days. A lot of great entertainment for the money. Season 8 on Amazon was $19:99 plus shipping as compared to Walmart and a couple of other stores at $32:99 and $45:99.
0452286751|1.0|This novel is clearly a classic as well as a novel of ideas. Therefore, it astonishes me that it keeps being reprinted with missing text and typos. How can this be? I advise everyone to look for earlier editions of this novel. Ayn Rand deserves at least that much respect.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I originally saw this movie in my Production class in art school. I'm not one to be easily swayed by anime but this thing was so gorgeous and touching that I had to have it.
B003UESJFG|3.0|This is a blind buy for the family.  I just watched this last night with my three kids ages 5 and 2 years old.  My two year olds watched it half way then bailed (understandable based upon their age) but my son and I watched thru the entire thing.  It is a pretty good movie.  The storyline and humor is just okay, nothing really special.  The casts are funny and great.  IMO, it didn't bring the real humor of Will Ferrel.  Probably I'm used to his adult comedy humor so this being a kids flick is definitely toned down.  Brad Pitt is only there in the beginning and a little bit towards the en (oops, spoiler alert there).  Had I watched it first in the theatre, I may have a second thought on buying it.  Regardless, I'm not dissapointed, just content.
B0028R3NCU|2.0|Bought this item about 6 months ago. Worked great and was very reliable. Was, because a week ago I started to get a \\"Device not recognized\\" message on every computer I tried. Used my friends micro reader with my micro SD card and it worked fine, so I narrowed it down to the USB adapter. I am probably to blame since I carried it around everywhere on my keyring. It probably got banged up in my pocket on from getting dropped on my nightstand. Still, you would think a company like Kingston would make something a bit more durable.    So be warned....it will work great but you have to take extra care not to damage it.
0316010669|3.0|What provides the best results: Careful and complete deliberation, or making a snap decision; gathering all the information available, or using a few selected facts; a blind audition, or watching the performer? Are our best decisions made by our unconscious mind, \\"behind the locked door,\\" so to speak?<br /><br />In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell uses dozens of illustrations and experiments to answer these and other questions, alluding to a power in \\"thinking without thinking.\\" One of several propositions in the book suggests that too many details actually hamper good decision making rather than helping.<br /><br />After reading Blink, I felt dazed by too much scattered information. Perhaps Gladwell should follow his own advice and cut to the chase rather than dragging his message out ad nauseam.<br /><br />It's not that Gladwell, author of the # 1 bestseller The Tipping Point and staff writer for The New Yorker, has written a boring book. I found the stories and experiments in Blink both interesting and edifying; however, the key points sometime seem illusive and maybe even contradictory on the surface. For example, one illustration emphasizes the importance of, \\"mind reading,\\" by careful study of facial expression, while another advocates blind auditions to avoid letting our eyes, biases, and culture taint our decision when selecting a musician for our orchestra. Blink uses so many stories and illustrations that the message becomes scrambled, if not lost.<br /><br />The final chapter in Blink takes off on yet another tangent rather than developing any sort of conclusion or summary of the previous dialog.<br /><br />Interestingly, the most concise and poignant message in Blink, comes in the \\"Afterword\\" chapter, pp. 273-276, \\"A Call to Action.\\" In two short pages Gladwell presents a convincing argument and recommendation regarding the justice system in the United States.  Move the accused in a criminal trial out of the courtroom, Gladwell suggests, answering questions through an intermediary. Eliminate any evidence and testimony that tips the jury off to the age, race, or gender of the defendant, anything that could affect impartiality.

0316069485|3.0|Crime aficionados take heart.  Half-brothers LAPD detective Harry Bosch and criminal defense lawyer Mickey Haller have return for another outing in Michael Connelly's latest offering, THE REVERSAL.<br /><br />This time out, a series of events have placed both brothers on the same side in the re-trial and prosecution of a convicted child killer, Jason Jessup.  The brothers are both fathers of daughters who are currently the same age as Jessup's victim, so for them this trial touches them on a personal and well as a professional level.<br /><br />I will not go into a re-telling of this look at how politics and public opinion affect the legal system.  Instead just let me state that this is a story with well-drawn forceful characterizations.  Everyone from the two men themselves, to the recovering druggie sister of the victim and from Haller's ex-wife Maggie to the slimy deal making D. A. are fully developed and engaging.  Readers are also given an inside look at the inner workings of what passes for \\"the justice system\\" from the investigative techniques employed by Bosch to the legal maneuvering of Haller and his courtroom nemesis.  This is probably as incisive and realistic a look as most of us will ever get at \\"people who venture naively into the justice system and leave the courtroom wondering what happened\\".<br /><br />While not as absorbing as some of Connelly's previous offerings like The Brass Verdict and The Poet, it's still head and shoulders above some of the other police procedural/courtroom dramas occupying the best seller list.

014241543X|2.0|I bought this (e-book) on the recommendation of a NPR commentator.  He made the novel sound intriguing - a \\"ghost story\\" that rivets.  Now I understand that this is  \\"YA\\" novel.  There is absolutely no reason why a YA novel should not universally appeal to anybody.<br /><br />This book was anything but riveting.  For the subject matter of life and death, it was absolutely bland.  In the end, I couldn't care less whether or not she stayed or went.

B004DK5CW4|1.0|Secretariat was undoubtedly one of the greatest race horses in American history, and thus the telling could not miss as a great story, especially for anyone who loves horses. But this movie by Disney Studios is just plain stupid and factually absurd.  Please read Nack's book! Penny Tweedy was no great saint, and she had little to do with the horse's success. Her husband was no villain, nor was her brother!  Stupid Disney mess as always, and with a truly great story! - this movie offends horse people. Just like \\"8 under\\" - a historical mess.
B003L0HZ5O|5.0|I have almost every album of theirs now which I have bought over the last few months. I love this one especially and I don't know why. I think sometimes a great bands appeal is inexplicable. I know that there aren't too many bands out there making sounds like this. I was raised on really varied music and one of the things my Dad played was CCR and they remind me a little of that great band. No offense to CCR but I think I like the Keys better. They have that same grungy sound but more varied songs. As far as my favorite songs it would be easier to say what songs I don't like on this album. My absolute favorite is \\"She's Long Gone\\". Can't resist that song. I love bands/singers that don't fit in a category like Mark Knopfler, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson etc. and I think this group is like that. If you want more music like this you have to get another Keys album because no one else sounds like this. I highly recommend this album.
B0040QYROA|3.0|This is one of those films where there was a supposedly \\"perfect\\" version at one time that was lost, For decades after, there was an endless search for the missing pieces that would recreate the original supposed masterpiece. This film is probably as close as anything will ever get to the original. And ultimately, for all the good things about the restoration that were accomplished, the film still is a mess with a plot that often makes no sense.<br /><br />Those involved did great work in putting this together. And its definately the \\"definitive\\" version of the film. It looks far better than any previous release. The score very well done and is ultimately better than the material it is put to.<br /><br />The film's plot fails because it presents multiple contradictory narratives. In one, Joh Fredersen, leader of the city, gets into conflict with the workers who maintain his city and he ultimately destroys the city himself. In another, mad scientist Rotwang wants revenge and destroys the city. There is also a sub-plot about Fredersen's deceased wife where the mad scientist wants to make a robot that looks like the wife and get revenge but it seems like that idea was abandoned fairly early. The film also presents a fourth theme which is a christian end-of-days religious theme. But that goes nowhere too. What difference does it make for the robot to corrupt the rich boys in the nightclubs if the main plot is about the robot stirring up a revolution? Then again, what was the ruler of the city's plan which required the city to be destroyed? (he ordered the gates to the heart machine opened). Its possible to contrive explainations for the mangled plot, but no matter how many explaintions are offered, it still looks like a mess.<br /><br />There are transitions and breaks in the aciton which still make no sense even with all the added footage. What seemed in previous versions to be gaps or misorderings in the footage now seems clearly to be sloppy storytelling on the partof Fritz Lang.<br /><br />If anything, this version illustrates the problems of the original film and why many of the American edits were made. The american edits didn't necessarly improve the clarity of the narrative, but they did eliminate many extranious elements in the film.<br /><br />Lang himself didn't seem like the film much especially in later years. To him, any solution to the \\"class struggle\\" other than successful violent total marxist revolution was nonense.<br /><br />The film is visually interesting but ultimately its visual style is rather empty. The modernism of endless concrete was original and rather futuristic when the film was released. But it creates the opposite impression now. The effects for the era are original, creative and outstanding. Its possible to see the influence the visuals of the film had on many later films.<br /><br />For inexpliciable reasons, the title cards are in English rather than the original german with subtitles. If they were going to go all out for a restoration, they should have gone all the way.<br /><br />In summary, this is outstanding restoration of an extremely flawed film. Now that we have what amounts to a full version, people need to take a look at the film objectively. And what I found when I did so was a mixed up story that appears to have changed several times during filming. The failure of Fritz Lang was in not building a stable narrative in editing the film.
B003L20IHE|3.0|Charlie St. Cloud reminded me of the movie \\"The Invisible.\\"  Also, there was a TV show episode with a similar plot many years ago on I believe  Nickelodeon.  For me, this made the movie a little predictable, yet it was still entertaining.<br /><br />The acting was good, but the story could have went much deeper and could have been much more emotional than it was.  It felt a bit lazy.  I thought it was good how the movie had adult themes. I'd say this one is a rental.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|This package far exceeded my espectations!  The interviews and the background info were interesting and the tribute to the deceased stars was very worthy.

B00005JGAF|5.0|Rocket to Russia is one of the great guitar albums ever recorded....it has gone with me on every road trip...airplane trip...hell, every car ride on a Friday night that I've gone on  since I was a kid.    This is one of those albums that most people love the first time they hear it.  The mixture of hard and fast guitar riffs with gorgeous surf inspired melodies and hooks galore is too intoxicating to resist.    If you have a friend or a relative or anybody you know who loves rock music and who hasn't heard the Ramones do them a favor and buy them this album.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I actually pre-ordered this release, as I missed it in the theaters, but had seen the original, Let The Right One In. I was hesitant to see a remake done by Hollywood and assumed it would not be as good. I was wrong.<br /><br />The actors are absolutely amazing, and draw you in to their pain. While the CG effects are a little out of place compared to the original, they did not really bother me, and are a small portion of the movie. Chloe's ability to bring out the primal side of her acting was spot-on.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is beautiful, haunting, painful, and horrific. The cinematography is actually better in this version. It's too bad it didn't get as much publicity in the U.S....it was well-received critically, but a lot of people just didn't see it, which is a shame.

B004H1YH66|5.0|I have always loved the Conan the Barbarian soundtrack. I bought the LP when it first came out with the movie and listened to a cassette tape of it for years. My son \\"stole\\" my tape and the vinyl record went the way of all the earth an age ago. I've never replaced this music and for many years I have not had it to listen to. Now THIS! And is it ever a terrific reunion: and far more than a reunion, since there are tracks I've never heard - and none of them before like this new version. Over two hours of Poledouris at his best. The 96 piece Prague Symphony and 100 voice choir give this film score a fullness and depth that the original soundtrack never had. This recording is definitely better than the sound stage version used in the film. I am happy to have this blasting through my house!...
0307704610|5.0|I absolutely love this book. After trying diet after diet without success, I was happy to read a book  written by someone that actually researched and tested different ways in which our bodies burn body fat.   I have been on the diet for 3 weeks and have lost 12 lbs. I am amazed how fast I have lost the weight  and how little effort it has taken. A definite must read for the person who is struggling to lose  that extra weight.
0439023513|5.0|I've seen a lot of people complain about the ending book of THG series.  If I am perfectly honest, at first I felt a bit disappointed myself... I wanted a pink all is awesome finale.  However, after further reflection, I realized such an ending would be an insult to the series, to what it is really about.  This was a story about war, about children being forced to become killers, and not just any type of killer, but one that murders other innocent children; about rebellion, and fightihg for what is fair.  The ending for such a story could not be gooey, it had to feel real... and it does.
B004MMEIK0|2.0|I was thrilled to find a vampire book that had the word \\"hilarious\\" in the description, and it was free, so even better.  Then I started reading it.  I get why it's free.  If Roman didn't say \\"God's blood\\" on every other page, I'll eat my Kindle.  It would make a great drinking game, not a great read.  And yes, Roman is a monster, forsaken by God...we get it already.  As for the \\"hilarious\\"...WHERE?  The only mildly entertaining thing that happened was Roman losing a fang in a sex doll.  That's it.  Glad it was free because I would have been royally ticked if I had paid money for it.

B004132HZS|5.0|It's nearly diametrically opposed to the recent Hollywood movie version of Holmes and Watson. This is an intelligent, underplayed show with good writing and little need of either star power or over-the-top special effects. Holmes is portrayed sympathetically but as a fundamentally flawed individual. Watson gets to be more than a expository excuse for the Holmes brilliance. A genuine partnership.<br /><br />Highly recommended series!
B001VEHZZ2|5.0|There are at least two stories contained in this short but thoroughly absorbing book. One we have heard before: the young man (or woman in the case of [[ASIN:0767914767 THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA]]) who gets a head start in the American corporate rat race and succeeds brilliantly before having second thoughts about what it is all worth. The second story connects this specifically to the events of 9/11/2001, raising various questions of nationality, culture, and morality.<br /><br />Changez is a Princeton scholarship student from a once-wealthy Pakistani family who gets recruited by an elite Manhattan business valuation firm, rising quickly to become one of their top analysts. He also meets Erica, a fellow Princetonian and daughter of New York society parents. Simple though it is, his story would interesting even without the racial overtones. It is always fun to read about bright young people rising to the top, and his relationship with the troubled Erica (a scenario a little reminiscent of Murakami's [[ASIN:0375704027 NORWEGIAN WOOD]]) has layers of feeling that Moshin Hamid treats with subtle sensitivity -- a subtlety that he also shows in the delicacy of his suggestion that Changez may be more than just another junior employee in the eyes of his gay boss.<br /><br />Reading the back of the book, one might assume that Changez' life changes suddenly after 9/11, when he suddenly finds himself perceived as an alien. That aspect is there, certainly, but in fact Changez prospers even more in both his business and romantic life after the attacks. It is his inner attitude that changes. Again, Hamid is subtle in portraying an America that recasts itself in the replay of a national myth, seeing the widespread efflorescence of patriotism as cover for the assertion of national privilege. As a foreigner myself, I find he has perfectly captured the disturbing changes that took place in the fabric of this country, without taking the easy route of blaming them on a particular administration. He is also very brave in describing the unexpectedly confused feelings that surely most of us had at the sight of the Twin Towers falling. What is most interesting is that Changez does not respond primarily as a Pakistani or a Moslem -- the title is deliberately misleading -- but as a socially responsible human being.<br /><br />All this is encased in yet another story. Back in his native Lahore, Changez opens a conversation with an American visitor to his country, recounting the story of his American experience as he entertains him over tea and then dinner. It gives the book a curiously artificial air, as though one is being addressed by an exceedingly polite waiter, but there is also something almost creepy about it. Gradually, you realize what Hamid is doing. By turning the tables in this way, he makes the American (and by extension the reader) experience what it is like to be an object of suspicion in a foreign land, an unease that starts imperceptibly but tightens alarmingly as the novel nears its intense but ambiguous climax.so very brave in describing the unexpectedly confused feelings that surely most of us had at the sight of the Twin Towers falling.

B004EC3LKQ|5.0|Superior sound and a great classic album. Get the whole vinyl catalog rom the Doors you won't be disappointed. album tracks eclipse the casual listeners who are pulled into the GH discs.
B003L20ICO|3.0|I enjoyed the movie; but was a little disappointed when I discovered it didn't seem to live up to the pre-Academy Award hype.  Annette Bening's performance was good as expected; but I didn't feel bowled over.  Julianne Moore's performance was equally good, if not better. Mark Ruffalo was great in his role. At the end of the movie, I was not left with any emotions at play.  This may be the year of the f-word, given Melissa Leo's performance in The Fighter; but count me as an old fogey if I found that the repeated and seemingly gratuitous use of the word put me off.  At least in The Fighter, the word seemed more likely to be common vernacular for the people being portrayed.  In The Kids Are All Right, it was as if the producers were trying to reach a threshold that would guarantee an R-rating.  However, with the nudity, fleeting though it was, it would appear the R was a certainty even if they reduced the f-bombs by half.   I didn't begrudge the time I spent watching the movie; but it was not one of the best of the year.
0525423273|2.0|I have read the book once and listened to this on tape at least twice.  When I first read it I loved the story and cheered for Anna and St. Claire.  But after listening to it, I was concerned with the cheating and selfishness and wondered if I would have felt differently about Anna if I had read this book from Ellie's perspective. Also, is St. Claire really that different from his unfaithful father?   SPOILERS THROUGHOUT  Anna is sent to school in Paris by her famous author dad.  She meets St. Claire on her first day of school and is instantly attracted to him.  She left a possible relationship back in Atlanta, Ga. with a guy named Toph and wavers back and forth between these two possibilities during her first semester in France.  St. Claire has a girlfriend named Ellie that he has been with for over a year, so Anna is mostly content to just be friends with him.  St. Claire obviously likes Anna but is unwilling to give up his girlfriend and be with Anna.  Toph ends up hooking up with Anna's best friend and Anna gets angry at her best friend for falling for the guy she liked.  This is totally ironic since she is falling for someone else's actual boyfriend.  Toph was free; St. Claire is not.    Anyway, the more I re-read this story, the more I realized that this story was not a good description of a love story.  Going after someone else's boyfriend is wrong.  Sleeping in the same bed, dirty dancing and flirting are not harmless and they both knew what they were doing.  Would Anna think this was harmless behavior if St. Claire was doing it with some girl at Berkley?  The only girl that condones this type of behavior is the one doing it. As readers, we are manipulated into wanting these two together, but imagine if you were Ellie, you would not see this as a love story at all.  What if YOUR boyfriend spent the Thanksgiving break in the bed of a girl \\"friend\\"?  Not so sweet or romantic now is it?    I really like the dialogue and writing style of Perkins, but not the message it promotes  I would be upset if Anna became the Ellie when St. Claire moves to Berkley and found a new \\"Anna\\".  It could happen again.  That wouldn't be sweet and romantic at all; so it isn't with Anna either.  Would I/Did I buy it? Yes  Would I read it again? I have, several times  Would I recommend it to friends? No
B0000025T6|5.0|Nebraska.  The cover looks like the opening shot of a movie about desperation, and in this case, you can judge the album by its cover.  10 songs, mostly simple melodies, picked guitar, a harmonica.  People who have lost everything, who are contemplating losing their morality, their souls.  The innermost meditations of desperation from anguished people, the simple addition that nothing plus nothing adds up to less than nothing.  Flashes of hope that shine like a break in the clouds but are all too often swallowed up in a pouring rain.    The songs are brilliant, performed beautifully with an offhand sensitivity that that is all the more painful when it comes from a man like Springsteen.  When he tells these stories, and most of them are stories, he gives life to his sad characters, wanderers in search of life and recognition.  He gives voice to what they are too beaten down to tell for themselves, and you find yourself understanding them.  Entering into their lives, for a moment.      The Nebraska of this album is not a place that I would ever like to visit in real life, but I must say that hearing these songs over and over again has burned them into my soul.  They whisper in the background of my mind, reminding me that some folks are down on their luck, and I should try and do something to help.  Remember the fallen, the alone, the helpless, the folks who have been hurt so many times that they become like cornered animals and lash out.  I try to take that as the hopeful message from this album--remember, empathize, don't judge too harshly until you know the story, and help where you can.      I've liked Bruce for a long time, but Nebraska is the one that I come back to with the most frequency.  It is the album that I would love to hear live in its entirety, that in my fantasy world I would love to hear Dylan cover (!), that I love to share with people who I think will give it a try.  You'd be hard pressed to find a better album of its sort from 1982, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better album of its sort today.  Pick it up, give it a chance.  Highest recommendation.

On a more serious note, the selection of songs is superb and the sound quality is seamless. Play this one loud for all to hear.

I have pretty much eaten 5x more than I normally do, exercised about the same amount (2 hours a week or so on an elliptical trainer) and I am down over 10lbs in 2 weeks (my wife is down 20). Its insane. This has been done on diet alone. I can only imagine what gains I will see when I incorporate some of the exercise routines as well. I am your average 43 year old male. This stuff works.

Hope you enjoy as much as I did!
B002ZG99TA|1.0|One of the dumbest movies ever made.  When they cut in the locomotive ahead of the runaway and put the rescue engineer in the helicopter - instead of on the far more proximate stopper loco - the shark was truly jumped like the shark had rarely been jumped before.  Subplots sucked.  Washington mailed it in.  Pine should stick to Cap'n Kirk.

0739383728|5.0|This is an amazing book on so many levels!  In addition to being a well-written page-turner, there's a wealth of practical running knowledge here, fascinating historical and cultural facts, and multiple fascinating insights into the role that running has played in human evolution.  I found this book to be worthwhile on so many levels.  I can't recommend it enough!      When I was reading Born to Run, I was reminded many times of Stu Mittleman's great book titled Slow Burn.  Though each has its own unique focus, I found the body of knowledge in the two books to be completely compatible and overlapping.  For not being at all related, these books support each other extremely well.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|This is a quirky drama about a family and about the challenges of being a parent. Some of the plot reflects familiar cliches of a sort of upper middle class, urban, domestic, lesbian lifestyle-- but it doesn't feel cliche because of the smart dialog and phenomenal acting, (and, wisely the filmmakers spare us any kind of contrived meta-commentary about 'lesbian bed death'). I wasn't expecting it to be, but it was really quite funny.    **Note, there is no outside point of view here so if you're looking for a critique of lesbian-headed families you will probably be disappointed. The movie expects that you are cool with this stuff from go. If you don't arrive at the film looking for reasons not to like it, you probably will like it. Well, you'll probably like it if you're up for a quirky family drama that's well done and, despite everyone being very attractive and financially secure, feels like a mostly realistic, though sometimes idealized, generally well-functioning modern nuclear family navigating through changing relationships and personal issues.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|The headset cover does provide reasonable coverage and protection.  However, I wear web belts and the belt clip is not adequate to reach over the width of the belt so mine fell off within three days, fortunately I heard it hit the ground.  I now carry it in my pants pocket, which is how a busted my first headset without the case, and so far no issues have come up so I am happier than being without.    Bottomline, fits small width belts. Avoid wider belts.
B000OCXI3K|3.0|I read this as part of my personal challenge for this year (50 books chosen from various challenges found around the web.) I chose it in part because I so loved the film, and while I know that I can't and shouldn't expect that film and book will be nearly identical, I was a little surprised to find that there was a distinct change in tone between the two.  The film is far more upbeat and light-hearted, and if offers redemption to everyone.  It's message, so well-delivered by the young priest, is about inclusion.<br /><br />Not so the book, which takes a harsher tone to the book's antagonist (The film added a character to spare the priest from his role as primary antagonist, yet redeemed both.) There is no redemption for a priest who is twisted with pain and guilt and the kind of moral certainty that makes people dangerous.  He is a second-rate person and a third-rate priest, utterly unfit to minister to the flock he's been given.  The book is a kind of cautionary tale about how easy it is to persuade the weak-minded and fearful that pleasure of any sort is sinful, and needs to be punished.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Chocolat\\" the book, though I confess not as much as I did the film.  Still, it's well worth reading, even if only for the meditations on chocolate, which are soul-satisfying.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|I am a huge Buddy Guy fan and this is one of his best ever. It is amazing that Buddy can continue to perform at such a high level.     There are rockin blues like \\"Key don't fit\\",\\"Livin Proof\\" and \\"Too Soon\\" that are among his best ever. There are slower songs like \\"74 Years Young\\" and the old school blues tune \\"This is where the Blues begin\\" which should satisfy any fan of the Blues. The last song \\"Skanky\\" is just that and showcases Buddy's manic guitar playing.     If you are a fan of Buddy Guy then you simply must have this CD. If you are a fan of guitar Blues of the Chicago persuasion you must have this CD. Heck just get the CD. It's great.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Unlike so much overproduced commercial pop these days, Adele is the real deal. The music is fantastic and really reaches down inside of you to where feelings come from. Her voice is powerful and delicate at the same time. Reminds me at times of lots of other artists without being derivative, and end the sound is all hers. The only problem is that she is not performing in enough locations in her upcoming US tour.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I never intended to watch this show.  I am not a zombie fan. Nor do I watch shows on AMC besides Breaking Bad. Well, I mostly watch that on dvd. But that Halloween I was at home and flipping through channels when I came to the repeat of the pilot episode. I loved it. I've always been fond of a good post apocalyptic tale of survival and Walking Dead delivered.    I find it odd to see so many reviews regarding weak acting or writing since it is due to the great performances of the actors, which has made me fall in love with the show.  I can not enjoy a tale about survival if I am not emotionally connected with the people who are struggling to survive. I guess for most folk the zombie killing would be enough but not for me.    I recommend owning The Walking Dead not to just to see the zombie slaying but for the characters who you will become attached. You will end up wanting to follow their stories as they attempt to survive in a new world.    Standout performances in my opinion (BEWARE SPOILERS BELOW!):    Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes - Amazing!  He's not Bryan Cranston but he really makes you root for his character.  The cycle of emotions that he had to process alone in the pilot was riveting.   His scene of reuniting with his family was so great. It gets me every time I watch it.      Steve Yeun as Glenn - I hate annoying and whining teens or young adults on tv shows. Thank god, Glenn is brave, smart and capable, while at the same time terrified and disgusted by the horror that has overtaken the world. Yeun does a really good job at finding that balance, which is really harder than it looks.    Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon -Daryl is a walking stereotype that Reedus elevates beyond convention to make you really feel sorry for and root for the jerk.  Seriously, I usually can't stand redneck characters. The nuances that he brings out with the angry pacing, conflicted emotions and grudging cooperation with the group are excellent.    Laurie Holden as Andrea -  Holden successfully conveys a woman terrified not only for herself and her sister but also determined to protect and provide for her family. Thanks to Holden's excellent performance you could tell that her sister was the reason she was holding it all together, which foreshadows her later breakdown. It is a very nice parallel to Rick. Where Rick is able to reunite with his family, Andrea ends up losing her own family in one of the best scenes of the season.  Her story is one I am really forward to seeing next season.    There are lots of other great characters and performances but I just wanted to highlight some of the MVPs of the first season. I can't wait to see more of these characters next season. So, more character drama, I say! I want flashback stories before the zombie apocalypse. I even want a CDC flashback with Jenner and his wife. Let's hopefully get some awesome new characters also!
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|I'm going to watch this movie but certainly NOT based on the prejudiced editorial review written by Ms. Tami Horiuchi. I'm referring to her statement \\"...harsh realities of the manic drug culture permeating some rural areas of the south\\".  I don't usually take offense easily but that was just plain idiotic and factually incorrect. I have news for you lady, the harsh reality is the drug problem is, unfortunately not limited to the south. In spite of your bias against the south I hope I enjoy the movie because I like the actors and I wish them well.<br /><br />Brenda from Texas
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Recently, I received the 3rd generation ipod, and it no longer charges on my Bose Soundock I.  I was just about to sell my old dock and get the 2nd series until I was reading in a magazine that this solves my problem (Macworld).  It works great and did exactly what I needed.  And I saved myself a lot of money with this product! If you're trying to save this is the way to go!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|So i had Rented this because i wanted to see the special features along with the film.    turns out rental versions removed the extra content. offering a movie only disc instead    the quality was excelent for a rental DVD    this movie is a must see by the way    i found online a copy of the alt retail (Movie-Only) disc & it is the same as the rental copy ,   with High Quality Anamorphic Wide Screen Video (video scales full screen on my pc monitor), Optional SubTitles (turn On/Off), no extras  the first time i watched this the subtitles appeared over a clean image that was properly displayed on my monitor    i found in store on sale for $6.99 and lucked out the copy i purchased & now own has the extras (deleted scenes, etc.)....  however the disc i purchased is not like the rental , the movie is letterboxed (Letterboxed means black bars on all 4 sides & lower quality video)   with subs hard coded in the image... ouch...   and the subs appear with stylized comic book square bubbles around them ... i think this is the theatrical edit of the film....  the copy i bought had the movie with black bars all around it     and no changes have been made to any setting on players  simply switch discs and you get different result    someday i will have to re rent & watch the rental version   and rip it... if i figure out how...    Final Thought    Rent watch enjoy , Rent Again Later ... new version every time you watch it...    yes what i am saying is the movie may be the same on all Three DVD Prints  but they are slightly different    1 x Rental  clean HQ video , text overlay subs at the bottom of screen , no extras    1 x Retail  same As Rental HQ , AFAIK, no extras    1 x Retail  letterboxed ALT. LQ video, subs are in the image stylized and text overlay mix , extras are here !    they should copy the video from the rental to the disc with extras and rebrand 2.0     so people can avoid the bad discs

B000001F76|5.0|This item arrived in perfect condition, great audio, and EARLY.  Every time I have ordered something in the past, it has arrived safely within the window given by the seller, but with this seller, it arrived 2 days earlier than it was supposed to, making my little excited heart beat with joy.  (It was also much to the annoyance of my family who was then forced to listen to me listening to this music, because I am the only Hank Williams Sr. fan in my house.)
B004ISVH6G|5.0|I have been a John Waite since The Babys and everything in between then and now.  This is some of his best work in years.  LOVE IT.  Working with Kyle Cook has brought out some of his best work in a long time.  I haven't been able to take it out of my CD player in the car, at home, and at work.  More stripped down and I am thrilled with this CD.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|The screenplay for this movie is well written. Starting with small details that later show to be significant within the story.  The casting was great. The photography was fantastic and tied to real footage.  Being the age I am I very well remember the reign of Secretariat. The movies is informative of the details surrounding the horse and the owner.  I think it was/is very entertaining movie and recommend it highly.  Today it is rare to see a good movie without gore, car chases, sex and vulgar language.  This is very refreshing.....Stan Atkins
0316067938|5.0|Hard to put down book! Well writen,Way different than the movies which I feel could have had a lot more done with them.Myers has Great talent I hope she will continue with the series.
B0001XALT6|4.0|The story is a tale of corruption and coverup, without a lot of romance and even less moralizing.  Stallone proves he can act when he wants to and clearly, this is a time he wanted to.  Putting him up against DeNiro is amazing.  What is more amazing is I think Stallone brought more depth to his character while I got the impression DeNiro pretty much phoned this one in.
B000W4KSVA|4.0|I love 'Trane and the ballads swing with creativity, something most current players forget or cannot do! The disc contains lots of noise  --a poor analog recording! However, the group plays so beautifully a jazz lover will forget this matter.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|You people actually like this? It's garbage! I do not believe you pay money to watch such rubbish. The [[ASIN:031608381X Three Little Kittens]] story has more depth to it!<br /><br />I pay for it too, they did not have a copy of 'How to Make Enemies and Defeat People' so Despicable Me seems to be an acceptable alternative; but i am so disappointed. These three little girls are not amusing! They annoy the great hero at every turn. They thwart his great achievements and distract him from his goal. And they never listen! How is this to be good movie with such characters? It's so fluffy!<br /><br />I will be returning this digital versatile disc to the shop from where i purchased it imminently; no amount of persuasion will convince me to do otherwise.<br />yrs<br />Gru<br /><br />Aargh! Stupid computer!!<br />How can i now adjust my rating, it has posted incorrect?? Pah!

B002PNAY9C|5.0|I LOVE the Eragon series. For all of you out there complaining about not closing it up in this book, I belive that he did the right thing extending it into another book. If he put the entire end in Brisingr, then it would not have very good detail and would have ended up bad. Don't get me wrong, I almost wish it was concluded in Brisingr, but as I said it wouldn't have turned out well. I have read the first three many times, to the point where I could almost recite every line. Se onr sverdar sitja hvass!

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I purchased this item due to the positive feedback over the Revised Razer Nostromo. I'm not fully satisfied with logitech's attempt to compete. Though the LCD screen is helpful the thumb placement is not as comfortable to manipulate compared to the original competitor the Nostromo n52 which I use to own. If you love macros this keypad has them. If you have color themed rig this will become a great addition. As for FPS games and the like there will be a learning curve.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Make no mistake, this is a beast of a knife. I think it weighs about a pound and feels solid in your fist. Just because I could, I chopped down a 3\\" sapling with it when I got it today. Its a bit of a chore getting the knife out of the sheath at first but after 20-30 times in and out of the sheath it comes out smoothly. I'm not a huge fan of the sheath since if you're carrying it on your belt it flops around a lot. Also, it doesn't come from the factory particularly sharp but i'm guessing if you're buying this one you know how to sharpen a knife. As others have said, it's hard to believe you can get such a hunk of knife for such a good deal.
0061433047|5.0|I have to post a review in which I express my love for the quirky, amazingly talented author who has made my heart happy time after time. I just finished I Shall Wear Midnight, the fourth and seemingly last Tiffany Aching book. It made me laugh, cry, swear, laugh again, and swoon with happy at the end. All of the Tiffany Aching books are excellent, but he managed to tie up a lot of things in the last part of I Shall Wear Midnight. I was not left wanting, I was left with a sense of satisfaction, and joy for the characters. What Sir Pratchett writes about what it means to be a witch rings true with what it means to be a witch to me. Thought the Tiffany Aching books are listed as Young Adult, they read as timeless, ageless classics. They are beautiful, witty, and on par with my other favorite Discworld books. Thank you, Sir Pratchett, for your fantastic words and stories.
B001HN69AY|2.0|Okay first of all, I am a huge fan of weird movies, I am not a Terry fan because I actually never saw his movies before this one but I am a tim burton fan, I love weirdness. This movie started out with some promise. The costumes were beautiful, the story was interesting. Then there was a side story to explain what was happening...okay good, now we can get on with the movie...okay, another side story explaining the past side story, hopefully that was it and...oh, okay, flashbacks. Then confusing plot points and, wtf, did I smoke a joint before watching this movie? Did my review really confuse and annoy you to the point of not wanting to read it anymore because it's wasting your time? Good, because that is how this movie is. If you like confusing movies, then this is your cup of tea. I love fantasy movies and I love unique storylines but I cannot watch a movie when it doesn't make sense. And let me just say, I am the biggest fan of johnny depp in the world, I love every movie he has been in, he is amazing, and I still didn't like this movie...not even johnny's amazing acting skills can save this lcd trip of a movie.
1439102813|4.0|Still Alice was an insight into what families are faced with when a loved one is diagnosed with this disease.  It is a very sad situation.  I had hoped that there would be more substance into her life at home and how she managed routine things.  Overall a good read.
B004BLTNL6|5.0|I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978), also known as DAY OF THE WOMAN, is a great exploitation film, and a thrilling movie for people who like revenge pictures.  This film actually shares the same plot as KILL BILL, and KILL BILL gets all kinds of awards and accolades, while I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE gets crushed by the critics, especially Roger Ebert, who called the film \\"vile trash.\\"  For me, the film is just about perfect.  By the way, anybody who says they're surprised and sickened by what happens on screen should have known what the film was about when going to see it.  The reason is because the advertising for the movie was very direct:  \\"This woman will soon beat, chop, burn, strangle 5 men beyond recognition, and no jury in American would dare convict her.\\"  So the film is a simple rape and revenge film, and a great one at that.  Difficult and intense, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE ultimately felt liberating because she DOES get her revenge, and it's only a movie, so for me, the whole thing works.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|I wish I could give it a few more stars than just five. Thank god the Hendrix estate put this out on LP again as my old Reprise version has long since worn thin (bought way back in the early 1970's). \\"E.L.\\" is Jimi's best LP I think.Every cut on the LP is a winner. I compared this rendition to my CD (Started both at about the same time and kept punching the buttons to switch to differant formats on my amp) This Vinyl LP sounds flawless on a good stereo system/turntable, and makes the CD seem to lack charector--sounds a little tinnie in comparison to the record. The LP is almost multi-dimensional) I am very happy with it. Thank you Hendrix Family and Amazon!
0061170623|5.0|Lets start with the book--\\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Burgess grew to hate this book, not because of its contents , but because it so overshadowed all of his other works.  Burgess was a man of divers interests which he wrote about in both fiction and nonfiction.  He was a superb writer.  Words, for him, seemed to come easily.<br /><br />I must say, Burgess deserves mention as a sociological Jules Verne, a man who made stark predictions of future turns that have panned out.<br /><br />In \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" which he wrote fairly early in life, he created a deeply disturbing world in which young teens run free to commit violent crimes of all kinds at night.  The opening pages of this book are filled with gang fights, muggings, rape, beatings, burglary, and car theft.  Alex, the protagonist of this first-person narration, never shows even a smidgen of remorse about the crimes he has committed.  He simply relates his tale, including a scene in which he rapes two girls he estimates to be pre-teen.  The only violence the sociopathic Alex regards as problematic is violence against him.<br /><br />In the story, he is arrested and eventually introduced into an experimental new program that uses drugs and hypnotics to make people incapable of violence.  Note, this does not mean he sees it as wrong, just that he cannot become violent without being sickened.  He is a cat without claws or teeth that is placed back in a world filled with enemies (many of whom are the good people he tortured) and the results are as cruel as he is.<br /><br />The story is simple, the telling is sublime.  Alex speaks \\"Nadsat,\\" a slang language of Burgess's creation that mixes Russian words, rhyme, and English slang.  A good portion of the novel is told in these words, so the reader needs to pay careful attention in the beginning, learn a new vocabulary, and apply that vocabulary to every paragraph.<br /><br />In my case, I was not a reader but a listener, and that enhanced the experience greatly.  It enhanced the experience largely do to the amazing talents of Tom Hollander, a gifted character actor who injects so much into this book.  You may know Hollander.  He played the parson Mr. Collins in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and the officious Cutler Beckett in the second and third \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" movies.  He generally plays the short guy with the big ego.  If I had his reading ability, I'd have an ego the size of a mountain.  Hollander adds a brash, boastful, cockney attitude to Alex.  His range of voices and characters seems endless as he brings old men, politicians, prisoners. thugs, policemen, prison guards, priests, and psychologists to life.<br /><br />There have been a few perfect pairings of reader and text.  If you try this audio book and agree with me, you might also want to listen to \\"The Anansi Boys\\" as read by Lenny Henry; \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" read by Bernadette Dunne--there are other productions of \\"Memoirs\\" with readers. I can neither recommend nor criticize other versions as I have not heard--I highly recommend holding out for Ms. Dunne's reading; and \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"Freaky Deaky\\" read by Frank Muller.ely do to the amazing talents of Tom Hollander, a gifted character actor who injects so much into this book.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I was surprised when i saw this on my kindle.  I had thought rick was done with mythology.  I was so sad when he had finished the first series so this was awesome. I bought the book right away and started reading.  I read until five in the morning reading lost hero.  I liked the idea of having each person view.  I honestly can say as a twelve year old this is going to be a great series!!!!!!
B000NH7SZ0|4.0|I have a dell 2135cn which I like, but has memory issues - bought this to solve the problem (didn't want to shell out $70-80 for the Dell branded memory).  Unfortunately, this module is not compatible, so I'm back to the drawing board.  Odd, though, since on paper it should be compatible and it's the correct size/format.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Loved all the characters except for the heroine.  Spent the entire movie wanting to undo her hippy hairdo.  Wanted to get rid of the bangs hiding her face.  A different heroine would have made the ending more believable for me.   Just couldn't picture her with Darcy.  I know she had an image the producers wanted but it didn't work for me. I loved the other characters and the plot, but not sure about the ending.

1439102724|4.0|Zoe Baxter's dream is to have a large family, but even one child proves difficult to come by. Zoe, a music therapist, and her husband, Max, spend many years and countless dollars trying to conceive. Finally pregnant, Zoe thinks that she is in the homestretch; during her baby shower, she is rushed to the hospital and gives birth to a stillborn.<br /><br />Despite the trauma, Zoe is eager to use the remaining embryos from the IVF. Max, on the other hand, has had enough of false expectations and decides to leave the marriage. Feeling lost and betrayed, Zoe finds solace in a new friend, and the friendship soon turns into something much more. Her friend, Vanessa, happens to be a woman.<br /><br />When Vanessa offers to have a child for the couple using Zoe's and Max's embryos, Zoe is over the moon at the prospect of finally becoming a mother. However, a simple release form becomes a sticking point as Max, newly a member of an Evangelical church, sues Zoe for the rights to their \\"unborn children\\". Suddenly, Zoe and Vanessa's desire for a family puts them in the midst of a public storm surrounding their rights, or lack thereof, as a married couple, their sexuality and their ability to raise children.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors, and in my mind, she can do little wrong. As most of Picoult's books, Sing You Home is inspired by the controversial topic of gay rights. The book, accompanied by a CD of songs written by Picoult, is touching, well written and will have you questioning your own beliefs of what constitutes a family.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|I am still shaken! My husband watched this film with me last night and I am researching for produce in our area as I will not buy any chicken, pork or beef from the supermarket anymore.   Growing up in Europe American Supermarkets make me angry anyways! Who needs that abundance of artificial food? Who needs 101 different cereals?   I have been buying organic and green products for quite some time. It is more expensive but isn't everything else too cheap? I have become more conscious about the whereabouts of everything as I don't want to die from food poisening or cancer anytime soon.   Who is to blame for the death of children who have died in agony over contaminated meat products? What should we learn from little Kevin's death 12 days after he ate an \\"innocent\\" hamburger (contaminated wih e-coli)?   Look closely! The film makes clear that we vote every day when we buy groceries. We can choose! Personally I choose life!  A family of 4 eating a meal for some $11.00 from Burger King; because it is cheaper than having to buy produce and cook at home?! Oh, but fat Daddy requires expensive meds for his diabetes. Well, take that money and buy healthier food for you and your family! Oh, but they believed they were eating healthy. Rule number one: Cheap food is never healthy!   I checked [...] for more information about farming. I will buy their DVD for $60.00 and this one and have it presented at our schools. Kids, teachers and parents should see the cow with 2 broken hind legs being forced to climb down a ramp from a truck, the half dead chicken kicked around the filthy stable, pigs screaming in agony shortly before getting killed in bundles, how?  Everybody needs to know! We have a choice for crying out loud!

B003EYVXUU|5.0|1983 in Los Alamos New Mexico at Winter time, 12 year old boy Owen (Kodi-Smith Mcphee) has been bullied many times for one night, a mysterious girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz) with her weird father (Richard Jenkens) move next door. Owen and Abby become friends later on as she has a dark secret is that she is a bloodsucker including her dad who must feed on blood all the time at night, however she can change Owen's life forever.<br /><br />A surprisingly excellent yet un-needed remake of the 2008 Swedish masterpiece \\"Let The Right One In\\" when it's a re-adaptation of the Swedish novel from Joe Ajicde Linqvist for American audiences. In fact the author approved of this movie as a respectful re-adaption of the novel, this is Hammer's first movie in many years since the 70's as they are back in business. The film's acting is truly terrific even by Elias Koteas who plays the police officer in this movie and there's some good gore effects that are well done, it's also a kind of retro movie that takes you back to the 80's as there is even some pop songs from that time like David Bowie's Let's Dance and it's a very respectable remake that does things as both the same (But not all the way like that horrible Psycho remake) and new in some parts. It's by far one of the best horror remakes of all time as it earned it's critical acclaim, watch both films of Let The Right One In and this one at the same time to see how good both are. I applaud writer-director Matt Reeves of \\"Cloverfield\\" fame of doing a terrific American rendering similar to how \\"Magificent Seven\\" was a great American remake of \\"Seven Samurai\\" or \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" was a terrific American/Italian/Spanish remake of \\"Yojimbo\\".<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives off quality flawless picture and sound like you would see in a theater with good extras like audio commentary, featurettes, car crash sequence step-by-step, poster gallery and trailers.
1439133948|2.0|Imperial Auditor, Miles Vorkosigan has been sent to Kibou to investigate a proposed corporate investment in one of the Barrayarian Empire's worlds. He thinks he's on the right track when one of the businessmen offers him a bribe, but his investigation is temporarily disturbed by a kidnapping attempt. A dissident group, dissatisfied with Kibou's proxy government (when near-death, citizens freeze themselves, turning their proxy-votes over to the corporations which keep their frozen corpses ready to be revived when cures for their illnesses are finally discovered and these votes now allow control of the government) manages to drug Miles, but he somehow escapes and wanders around drugged and incoherent, until he is discovered by a runaway boy (Jin Sato) whose mother, coincidentally, holds the secret that just might topple the Kibou corporations.<br /><br />Once he is able to get the drugs out of his system, Miles goes into investigator mode, trying to uncover exactly what the Kibou hope to accomplish by their Barrayarian investments, and to find where the corporations have stashed Jin's mother.<br /><br />Author Lois McMaster Bujold continues her Vorkosigan series with a story that simply doesn't live up to the best in this series. Bujold is a wonderful writer and the Vorkosigan series is a superior SF adventure. CRYOBURN gives us some thoughtful comments. What, exactly, will it be like when people can be frozen, still alive, yet not really animate? Will they have rights? Will the corporations responsible for keeping them alive be allowed the political power to represent their silent but un-dead residents? Surprisingly, it's in the execution that Bujold falls short. The coincidence of the drugged Miles being rescued by the one child who can lead him to the secret behind the corporations is extreme. Miles himself is never at risk and the danger to the Barrayarian Empire is remote, especially in light of the drastic way that Barrayar has in dealing with its enemies. The danger to Jin seems to be that he might have to leave his pet chickens and bugs behind when he's sent to live with his aunt.<br /><br />Bujold is a powerful writer, and she was able to draw me into the story despite its flaws, making me care about Jin, his sister and mother, and about the mysterious amateur-death-cult that had been taking care of Jin since he ran away from his aunt. Ultimately, though, this story just isn't up to what I'd expect from Bujold in terms of character, plot or emotional depth.anger to Jin seems to be that he might have to leave his pet chickens and bugs behind when he's sent to live with his aunt.<br /><br />Bujold is a powerful writer, and she was able to draw me into the story despite its flaws, making me care about Jin, his sister and mother, and about the mysterious amateur-death-cult that had been taking care of Jin since he ran away from his aunt.

B003I55BIA|5.0|This is an amazingly perfect book!  The story of totally opposite types of cliques falling in love is beautiful  I immediately fell in love with Alex, and Brittany seems so surreal, and the way she cares for her sister is cool. I don't know of a teen that would care so much for a person like that.  At one point of the story I did cry I have to admit. Alex with is gang background is characterized good. Simone Elkeles is a really good writer. I would suggest this book and her other books to any teen and maybe older people.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Hypatia is one of my heros. I think they did a great job putting us back in Alexandria in 391, and were faithful to the spirit of Hypatia, something Rachael wasn't when she was promoting the movie with the \\"hot slave\\" comments.  As christians are the villians, I can understand why it did not find screens here in America. No one wants to report on how Christianity was primarily responsible for the Dark Ages. It also is a terrible tragedy, so no happy ending. I enjoyed it very much.

B004HWR406|4.0|Although we don't get a deep view of the main character's soul (if he has one), I thought it was interesting to see him get semi-rejected by the lawyer who was talking to him like he was a normal person. She was the contrast of the Erica Albright character and was nearly the \\"2nd girl\\" in his life after he got dumped in the opening scene. In a way, both girls are right about him. The difference is the lawyer girl wasn't dating him and gave him the benefit of the doubt.    As he was continuing to hit refresh on Erica Albright's personal page, it was interesting to see someone who had become so powerful be so anxious about whether his ex-girlfriend would accept him as a friend on his own website. Many of us have wondered if we really should try to add certain people from the past because we are unsure of whether that person still wants us in their life even if it is only FB.    Mark is vulnerable in only 3 scenes and they all have to do with his former love interest whom he can't impress because of his classist and arrogant personality.    The final scene makes me wonder if he would have been happier just being a normal Harvard student without the Facebook site and dating a cute BU undergrad. In some ways, that might have been worth more.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|i started off writing a detailed synopsis of the movie but that's pointless...writers with much greater skill have already done so.    really, i just needed to rate the movie and make sure people realize this is quite the addition to their anime (or non-anime) collection of blu-rays.    first off, the movie is very entertaining.  it is well drawn, animation smoothly done...artistically, its unmatched by most full feature length animes from japan.  although i typically cringe from cell-shading, it works well the cyber environment created.  the fight scenes were fast paced and exciting, dynamically different from most other animations where mechas blow up ninjas and high schoolers take on demons.  my complaint here would be that there wasn't enough action...but the time spent on such a unique story made up for that.    characters do grow, but there ALOT of them...in fact, an entire family reunion to keep up with.  overwhelming as it is when you first see all of them, you grow to know each of them if only briefly for some.  comedy and a tragedy, this movie is quite a gem.    the story from what i hear is not as original (something about digimon) as i had hoped, but seeing that the same person wrote both stories, i'm not going to fault him for reusing his own material and create a new product for another audience.  i have no interest in watching digimon ever (tried it, not for me) even though i'm an avid fan of japanese animation.      and you can relate to the movie.  cell phones, laptops, and tvs integrated with the internet all connected to a giant cyberworld that uses avatars to complete transactions, socialize, and conduct business...we already live in that world!  they do this today on secondlife, world of warcraft, etc...but on a much grander scale.  (albeit, the \\"having a life\\" factor does weigh heavy in our own reality ;)

6305426651|5.0|Comedy and Tragedy are locked in a unique struggle around the main characters of this story set in WWII Italy.  Guido is a mad-cap Jewish waiter, a self-designated \\"Principe.\\" Dora is the adored sweetheart that Guido calls \\"Principesse.\\"  Joshua is the son that they have together, a darling kid who looks just like his father.    The action of the story begins when, due to faulty brakes in a friend's convertible, Guido is driven at breakneck speed down the main street of a country town where he is mistaken for the King, whose arrival the townspeople are awaiting.  The people hail Guido as he races by, and he waves back at them, assuming the character of the King.    The love story begins when Dora falls out of the sky and lands on top of Guido.  The two raise themselves up from a pile of hay and look at one another with pleased wonder and surprise, falling immediately in love.  Guido insists upon sucking a wasp's stinger out of Dora's thigh!    Notice that Dora is wearing a big, pretty summer hat with a small black veil when she falls from Heaven into Guido's arms.  Notice that there are lots of hats in this movie.  A lot of hat-play goes on.  What meaning, if any, are we to deduce from the hat motifs?    Back in the city, on the streets, other encounters between Guido and Principesse occur.  One is a freak accident in which Guido lands on top of Principesse and the two are splayed on the ground while school children laugh merrily at the sight!    Later, the couple are thrown together again by circumstances and, as they walk about the city streets together, Guido is trying to get Principesse to say Yes to him and she says she doesn't know what the key to making her say Yes is.  She says that her father used to know very well how to get her to say Yes. Guido gets the bright idea to look up to Heaven and ask Mary for the key to make Dora say Yes.  Immediately, a key falls down from Heaven!  Each time that the couple prays to Mary, they get an immediate answer to theirprayer.     Guido and Dora long for one another, but Dora is engaged to marry someone else.  Her engagement party takes place at a restaurant where Guido is a waiter.  Alarmed to learn that Dora is engaged to another guy, he sends her a great big cake that says, \\"Bon jour, Principesse,\\" which is the greeting he uses often to please her and to recommend himself to her.  When Guido has to get down on the floor under the table to clean up something, Dora crawls under the table, too.  Tete-a-tete, she requests, \\"Take me away.\\"  Guido hastens to comply with her wish.    Next scene, Guido calmly and proudly enters the banquet hall seated upon a white horse that had been standing outside the hall and that belongs to a family member of his.  The horse is painted over with a lurid green color.  Vandals have written upon the horse, \\"Achtung, Jewish Horse!\\" and they've drawn a skull and crossbones on it.  Dora climbs up onto the horse with Guido and they ride out of the hall.  The horse is an emblem of the Jewish persecution that has begun in the city and that about six years later will send the married couple and their little boy, Joshua, to a Nazi prison camp.    In prison, using his clever mad-cap ingenuity, Guido is able to hide his son in his bunk with him and to keep the boy distracted from the truth about the horror around them by making up a game about a contest for winning a tank, which is something Joshua wants keenly.    The ending of the story when Guido is killed is heartbreaking and unbearably sad, but then, the sorrow is immediately uplifted.  The action of the film does not stop to dwell on death, but moves on, on a rather light note.  Joshua is now happy in his powerful, big tank that the liberating American soldier allows him to drive.  It's a bigger tank than he probably ever dreamed of winning.  He and his mother are together again and have one another.      Guido, the clever fool, has saved his loved ones, especially his son, and Life will go on for them in a mildly Beautiful way, but it will not be even nearly so Beautiful for them as it was when Guido was leaping onto bikes and racing about and serving his son and his Principesse.    I could understand all the slapstick involving hats was in the movie because Guido was a mad-cap character.  Guido's little family all wear hats, which seems fitting.  I couldn't understand all the slapstick involving eggs.  Was it just incidental?    A nice thing about the film was, I thought, that we get to see the Yanks who liberate the camp in the role of strong, beneficent rescuers, as they used to be portrayed in the good ol' idealistic days following WWII.    On first viewing, it's difficult to comprehend what's going on in the action of the movie.  It seems like jumbled nonsense because your attention is divided between trying to read the subtitles and watch the movie.  On second viewing, you can focus in better on the plot and characters and details of the action.
B000089HCR|4.0|Wasp is a very good metal band. It has amazing songs with great lyrics and very good vocals (especially the chorus on most tracks are very good). I wanna be somebody - Love machine are masterpiece songs and the rest are great. A must for all heavy metal fans
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen exploded onto the heavy rock scene in 1978 with nothing short of atomic bomb power. Their debut became an instant classic and for many remains the shining jewel of the catalog. The band had been tearing up the LA club scene and had brought a perfect combination of top musicianship with an almost vaudevillian old fashioned showmanship into American heavy metal. Edward Van Halen was the new guitar god and the most influential guitarist since the halcyon days of Jimi Hendrix. Both Eddie and his brother Alex had trained as musicians growing up as boys in a musical family in the Netherlands before coming over to Southern Cal as young teens. Michael Anthony's thunderous bass and soaring harmony vocal perfectly complimented the brilliance of front man David Lee Roth who like Anthony was a Midwestern transplant and the transformation was complete. The foursome who probably became the closest thing to an American Led Zeppelin blew away any headliner that dared allow them to open for them as `Van Halen' raced up the charts. Produced by Ted Templeman, the man behind Montrose' debut five years previous had caught Van Halen's club act and was excited to produce this new find.  The most famous cuts are all classics in their own right and included \\"Running with the Devil\\", \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\"  and an absolutely blistering cover of the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me.\\" The one cut that probably did the most to create the Van Halen legend, especially in Edward's case was a short two minute instrumental called \\"Eruption\\" that is only the most famous guitar solo in rock.  Two promo videos were shot for \\"Got Me\\" and \\"Runnin'\\" at the Whiskey a Go-go and are brilliant time capsules of one of rock's most exciting bands when they ready to take on the world (hard to believe there was a time when Dave was the coolest man on the planet!). Anyway, `Van Halen' is that special case where almost every song demands airplay (aren't the guitar effects on \\"Atomic Punk\\" ridiculous?? Man talk about obscene!). This record will always hold a special place in my heart and for me; they never topped it...not even close!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|What more can I say about this movie that has not been said.  A very interesting look at a brilliant young man.  Another FB movie that I can recommend is \\"Catfish\\". THis is a real live documentary about FB.
B000EGDC0A|4.0|Goldfrapp's third album, SUPERNATURE, follows close to their second, BLACK CHERRY. Perhaps too closely. Whereas the change from their first to second albums was startling, SUPERNATURE seems to continue BLACK CHERRY's glitzy, glam formula. \\"Ooh La La\\" and \\"Number 1,\\" especially seemed destined for the top of the pop charts, while \\"Ride a White Horse\\" comes directly from the land of disco balls. The songs are definitely agreeable, from the pleasant \\"Fly Me Away\\" to the peppy \\"Koko.\\" There's not a clunker on here -- though \\"Time Out From the World\\" sounds too reminiscent of the superior \\"Pilots\\" off FELT MOUNTAIN. But Goldfrapp's musicianship remains undiminished, even when they go for a more straightforward pop sound. \\"You Never Know\\" pushes up the dynamics on the off-beat for musical pulsation. The old-time saloon piano on \\"Satin Chic\\" is a smile-inducing addition that belies a careful consideration of tonal quality. And the slow, aquatic \\"Let It Take You,\\" one of the strongest tracks, offers some depth to the album's surface, enhanced, as always by Alison Goldfrapp's dreamy vocals. Personally, I would have liked to have seen Goldfrapp push themselves in another new direction, but even if they repeat themselves on SUPERNATURE, it works and works well.
0452289963|5.0|Got this book from my uncle with a note in it saying \\"You're ready for this\\". I started reading this book at a very interesting time in my life.  Every chapter spoke to me and I truly understood where I was going wrong.  Material things, drama, money all seem meaningless to me and the true power lies in the moment RIGHT NOW.  It is such a unique concept.  I was living my life using alcohol and lies to allow the ego to thrive.  In the book he says some people arn't ready for it, others already have the spark and just need to be helped along.  I just needed help.  I had a great sense of self (inner) but the outer was deterring me from my purpose and the past and future was tricking me into what was important.  I can honestly say this book changed my life.  I feel very sad knowing it hasn't touched other the way it has me but ever life's journey takes a different road.  I hope to all be enlightened at one point.      I also find it interesting that he says your purpose arn't things like \\"helping people\\" or \\"being first place in a challenge\\".  For that to be the case, others must suffer and fail.  Truly inspiring.  The things we only have control of is happening right now. Be your best self now and don't drag the past along with you.  I'm very lucky to have a partner feel the same way.  I can see where one you are enlightened and the other person is not yet the relationship can fall apart. Anyways, great book and I hope to see him live at one of his events!!
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Say what you will about Daft Punk, but they were never really boring... not even with HUMAN AFTER ALL. Sure, the title track could have come off DISCOVERY, but \\"The Prime Time of Your Life\\" sounds like a skit choreographed by Gary Glitter then put through the spin cycle of a washing machine. \\"Robot Rock\\" is glam-heavy, while \\"Steam Machine\\" is heavy with hiss, but both go on too long. The musical ideas are there, but they don't go anywhere. Need proof? Listen to how \\"Make Love\\" is one loop, repeated for 4 1/2 minutes. The mantra of \\"Technologic\\" gives it a bit more texture, but \\"Emotion\\" just grinds along until it finally ends. Human after all? Not when you just hit the \\"repeat\\" button and walk away.

0307454541|3.0|This was a good book, but it was nothing earth-shattering or different. It started off promisingly enough, then evaporated into yet another SVU-serial-killer-mystery. Also (spoiler alert) I found that the author started a lot of ideas but never brought them to fruition. What was the point of bringing up Harriet's interest in the Apochrypa? Why did the author not delve in-depth into the Bible verses significance? We learn little to nothing about Martin and Harriet's father--why was he killing women? Why introduce Cecilia at all--she just seemed to serve as Blomvkist's bed buddy who later gets mad at him. I didn't buy into the attraction between Blomvkist and Lisbeth. Also after the rape Lisbeth went through, it seems unlikely that she'd go straight to trying to seduce Blomvkist. I don't know, the book held my interest but I was expecting a lot more given the hype, and I could care less about reading the sequels. It seemed like a lot of sloppy writing and I'm not always one to pick up on sloppy writing, so if I'm picking it up, it must be bad!
0307272702|5.0|Few issues are sure to arouse more passion than the causes and cures of the current epidemic of obesity.  Those of us with expanding waistlines look for authoritative advice only to find a mass of conflicting theories, ideas and remedies.  Since they are saying very different things they can't all be right.  These differences are not simply to be found amongst the popular media but also amongst the medical profession.  Whilst the issue is clearly complex, one would have thought that in this day and age a profession that prides itself on being driven by the science would have be able to arrive at a consensus for action, but it seems that the \\"professionals\\" are no different from the rest of us.  The great achievement of this book is its single minded focus on the science of nutrition.  Each of the passionately held views on the subject is held up to  a clear and fair-minded scrutiny.  I have to say the analysis persuaded me to let go some of my firmly held views on the issue.  Ultimately it is our  mindset that drives our waistline and changing that is no small matter.  So does the book's practical advice work? You bet!
0756404738|5.0|Fantasy isn't my normal genre, but even so I wouldn't have missed these books for the world.  This new installment of the series is only the second one, but if you haven't read the first (The Name of the Wind), please do that first.  The first book gives you the main character's back story (and what a story it was!) and now his story picks up in current day -- or at least the character's current day, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I'm sure there will be a ton of reviews that recount the plot, so I won't go too deeply into that here.  What I do want to say is for those who haven't read fantasy or have tried it in the past and didn't like it, please set that aside and read these books.  A friend of mine purchased me a copy of the first novel and I was simply amazed.  Rothfuss has a way of giving attention to detail without making the reader feel bogged down and his characters are so life-like they almost jump off the pages.  He truly is a masterful writer.<br /><br />It's been a long, long time since I was so excited and enthralled with a novel that I stayed up all through the night and into morning in order to read it, but that's exactly what I did with The Wise Man's Fear last night.  And I wasn't disappointed....this second installment is every bit as good as the first and if fans have to wait another four years to get something this good, I'm willing to wait.
0439023513|3.0|I couldn't get enough of the first 2 books of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  They were fast reads because I couldn't put them down.  Then everything seemed to fall apart with this final book.  I felt like we lost Katniss - like she was just going through the motions and was no longer the strong character we got to know in the first 2 books.  And the way some characters died in this book - it was just like \\"buh-bye\\", with no real meaning behind their death, which seemed like a waste.  There were too many questions left hanging in the book.    Spoiler Alert - - - - - - -     First off, why was it never questioned why Prim was even sent to the Capitol?  Wouldn't that have been a big clue behind who was behind the attack?  We never got a clear answer about the double-bombs either.  I pretty much predicted who Katniss was going to shoot with that final arrow.  So it wasn't really a twist when I saw it coming from a mile away. Finnick shouldn't have been killed off - that was pointless and didn't even have meaning, and it should have been a bigger deal than it seemed. What happened after Katniss went back home could have been a book all in its own. I just feel things were rushed, left hanging and almost like the author didn't know how to end things, so just started throwing things out there to get to an ending.  I would still recommend the whole series to readers, but give them a warning that the ended was a buzz kill.
0007250916|5.0|At one time or another, it is likely that most of us will bow down before \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\", the title of Siddhartha Mukherjee's epic account of the history, politics, and and biology of cancer. He is clearly in the company of other outstanding contemporary physician-writers, including Atul Gawande and Abraham Verghese, with a gift for being able to distill complex medical issues into managable parcels, all the while celebrating the joy and anguish of caring for patients in their most vulnerable hours.       In the mid 1970s I worked as a lab tech in the Division of Investigational Chemotherapy at Sloan Kettering. My boss was Dr. Joseph Burchenal, an indefatigable pioneer of modern cancer research, who assembled an array of antimetabolites to transform childhood leukemia from a uniformly fatal disease to one in which prolonged survival was the norm. We were foot soldiers in Nixon's recently declared \\"War on Cancer\\", equipped with the crudest of weapons to undermine the enemy's ability to replicate DNA, while inflicting substantial collateral damage among innocent cellular bystanders.       Our laboratory was on the ninth floor of the research building, and Burchenal, who regularly scaled peaks from the Adirondacks to Nepal and New Zealand, never took the elevator. Though 40+ years our senior, he would regularly embarass his young entourage with his athleticism by ascending stairs 2 and 3 at a time. His drive and determination were no less apparent in the lab, where he sytematically evaluated every compound he could get his hands on for the greatest benefit, and the least toxicity against mouse leukemias in vitro and in vivo.        Thirty five years later, the heroic legends of early cancer research are mostly gone, but new stars are shining in the field as science marches on, now with the mapping of the human genome and a better understanding of the biology of specific tumors. Newer cancer therapies such as Herceptin,Avastin, and Gleevec are more like laser guided weapons, relative to the chemo, radiation, and surgical trebuchets of the 1970s.        Yet, the enemy hardly presents a fixed target. Mukherjee alludes to the admonition of the Red Queen, in Lewis Carroll's \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", who tells Alice that the world is shifting so quickly that she has to run briskly just to keep in place.       We might think that we are gaining the upper hand, but cancers are constantly evolving by virtue of both predictable and random mutations. Modern oncology is akin to great chess matches played out every day, pitting modern science against the ancient and devious foe that is cancer. Each side is pondering several moves in advance. The era of early \\"blitzkrieg\\" victories is past, but Dr.Mukherjee urges us to stay in the game. We are seeing more and more cancers yield to sheer persistence, and a draw may be no less a victory than checkmate.    Robert S.Kiefner,MD  Concord,NH

The movie blames all of the problems in the middle east on America, and oversimplifies everything in the process of doing so. I could have forgive it that if the script had been good or if it had been even mildly entertaining.     Do yourself a favor and skip this. They must have paid the actors involved even more than usual to get them to participate in this film. Ugh!

0756404738|5.0|If, like me, you were so impressed with The Name of the Wind that you neglected all but the most pressing business until you turned the final page, you may have decided to give it a quick re-read in anticipation of the sequel. If you did, you probably spotted this quote in Chapter 43: \\"There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.\\"    After a long but worthwhile wait, we now have the second novel in The Kingkiller Chronicle, and its title refers directly back to the quote: The Wise Man's Fear. (And by the way, if you didn't feel like rereading book one, Patrick Rothfuss posted a wonderful web comic recap on his blog.)    Saying that the level of anticipation for The Wise Man's Fear was high is an understatement, especially given that The Name of the Wind was only Patrick Rothfuss' debut. It's not as if this is the concluding volume of a long multi-volume saga, decades in the making. The Name of the Wind struck such a powerful chord with many readers that, before long, messages started popping up left and right, complaining that things were taking too long and couldn't he write a bit more quickly?    Well, merciful Tehlu be praised, Patrick Rothfuss took his time, polishing and refining his manuscript until it stood up to his own standards. The result is The Wise Man's Fear, a novel that for the most part fulfills the promise of The Name of the Wind. You'll find the same sweeping prose, deft characterization, rousing adventure, emotional highs and lows, and just plain and simple gripping reading of the \\"I couldn't put this book down even if my house caught fire around me\\" variety.    Also, there's much more of it, in terms of sheer length. Weighing in at about 1,000 pages, The Wise Man's Fear is a heftier tale with a much broader scope. Where most of The Name of the Wind was set in and around the University, the sequel starts off there but soon has Kvothe venturing out into the world. As a result, some of the blank spaces on the map start to get filled in, giving this fantasy world a welcome new level of depth. Make no mistake, Kvothe is still front and center, but the details of the world's geography are starting to come into focus, as well as its history, with the central mystery still being the exact nature of the Chandrian and the Amyr.    And Kvothe... is still Kvothe. One of the most memorable characters to appear in fantasy in the last decade, he again carries the tale easily. Let's not forget that The Name of the Wind's blurb, as well as the title of the series, seemed to spell out several major plot points: anyone who read the back cover of The Name of the Wind knew the edited highlights of Kvothe's life even before opening the book. How often do you see that, and even if you did, how often did it actually succeed?    Here, Patrick Rothfuss makes it work purely on the strength of his main character. Kvothe, telling his own story to the patient Chronicler, has so much sheer panache that his personality has the same effect as a minor tsunami on the people around him. In some ways, he's like a taller, more musically gifted version of Lois McMaster Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan. Sure, when he describes a noble as being as \\"self-centered as a gyroscope\\", you can't help but think that this could easily apply to him too, but his charm, brilliance and inexorable forward momentum easily make up for it.    Then -- next brilliant trick -- to forestall those readers who might get annoyed at an impossibly brilliant and already semi-legendary character, the framing story shows us a much different present-day Kvothe, now going by the name Kote, who seems to be a shadow of his former self: a small town innkeeper with the lowest of profiles and the gentlest demeanour. The fact that we still don't know exactly how we got from Kvothe the high-flying warrior-arcanist-singer to Kote the soft-spoken innkeeper creates the tension that makes these novels so powerful. Evil is abroad, war is coming, and Kvothe, so different from how he describes himself in his story, hints that he is somehow responsible -- and, to top it all, we still don't know exactly how and why. Maybe most disturbing (or exciting, depending on your perspective and amount of patience): if Kvothe is recounting his past to Chronicler in three days, does that mean that the real conclusion of the story, describing the current and future state of the world, will only follow in books 4, 5, 6... ?    Regardless,The Wise Man's Fear is another excellent novel. Just getting to read more about the young, brilliant Kvothe at the University is a pleasure, although it did feel as if the first few hundred pages of this novel moved a bit more slowly and actually could have been part of the first book, with Kvothe's eventual departure making a perfect starting point for the sequel. Then again, we know this is meant to be one long tale split across three days of narration by present-day Kvothe to Chronicler, so it makes sense to think of these books as one big story with somewhat arbitrary cut-off points. (And oh, I don't think it's a spoiler to mention that the ending of this novel is once again of the somewhat anti-climactic \\"and then they all went to sleep to continue the story the next day\\" variety.)    Patrick Rothfuss's prose is still a pleasure to read. He does high comedy as expertly as heart-breaking tragedy. He occasionally throws out a sentence that's so perfectly on point, it's not hard to see why his book-signing events draw such huge crowds: \\"Hespe's mouth went firm. She didn't scowl exactly, but it looked like she was getting all the pieces of a scowl together in one place, just in case she needed them in a hurry.\\"    If the plotting is sometimes a bit transparent, with the timing and sequence of some events being so convenient that it flirts with improbability, it's all easy to forgive because -- and this is really all that matters, in the end -- The Wise Man's Fear is more sheer fun to read than most fantasy novels I've read since -- well, since The Name of the Wind, come to think of it. Plus, we finally get to read the bit about Felurian...    If you're looking for solid, character-driven, consistently entertaining but occasionally quite dark fantasy that has more heart than several other series combined, you couldn't do much better than Patrick Rothfuss' KINGKILLER CHRONICLE. And now the long wait begins for book 3...
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I dont know why it took me soo long in getting these. These are INCREDIBLE !!! and yes you will hear sounds in your game you've never heard before. The Bass is thunderous, in fact I feel the set bouncing off my ear a bit during explosions ! This is not the top of the line Turtle beach headset. It sure sounds like one! I bet the Turtle beach DPX21 will be alot more impressive. But I dont have the coin for those. My budget lies with this set. Yes I am very impressed with Turtle Beach. I never really thought of getting a headset with a mic because I rarely talk when I play my COD games. I used a Sony stereo headset for months for my night gaming. And I used a Motorola Bluetooth for chatting. But no more ! If you're looking for a Great headset under $100 this is IT !     Now I just want to respond to the negative previous comments on this product :  Slight Hissing sound = Yes, But it is \\"slight\\" and that will never go away with any headset.  Lots of wires = Yes, But you'll get over it.  Cheaply Made = Looks like it. It will last longer if you take care of it and not throw it across the room because you suck !  Breaks easily = Look above response.     I will say one thing I didn't like about this set is I have to change the sound setting on my Ps3 to watch dvd's and Netflix.   NO BIGGIE when the end result is an AWESOME gaming headset ! SHOP NO MORE !
B000002OOY|5.0|What is there to be said about the creative collaboration between master film score composer John Williams and director Steven Spielberg that hasn't already been said?  Such close collaborations between composer and director are extremely rare in Hollywood any more; and theirs began on a small scale with the Americana-tinged score Williams supplied for THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS in 1974.  Since then, of course, as Spielberg's films have grown in size and scope, so too have Williams' scores.  That was clearly evident with the score Williams supplied for Spielberg's 1993 sci-fi/suspense thriller JURASSIC PARK, about a theme park where dinosaurs are genetically revived with deadly results.    The now-famous main title music, with its majestic sound heralding the creation of what is supposed to be the ultimate theme park, zoo, and prehistoric museum all rolled into one, in retrospect sets the mood for a lot of adventure; but what follows is very heart-pounding in nature, not too much unlike JAWS with its primitive Stravinsky-like rhythms, or the Bruckner-influenced score that Williams supplied for the John Frankenheimer-directed 1977 thriller BLACK SUNDAY.  Pieces like \\"Hatching Baby Raptor\\", and \\"Remembering Petticoat Lane\\" are the ones where Williams' score is clearly more delicate, as we see, respectively, the birth of an animal that had not been seen on our planet for sixty-five million years, and where John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) reminisces to Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) about his early years as a promoter in Scotland.  Even in these quieter moments, however, there is a sense of menace and terror as the audience ponders the implications of Attenborough's grandiose illusions and the baby raptor's birth (as it will eventually become a full-grown velociraptor).     Both Spielberg and Williams have been accused on more than one occasion of being manipulative in their approaches to their respective crafts when they've collaborated, but that really isn't true with JURASSIC PARK (if it ever was in any of their other projects).  In only two other cases I can name--Bernard Herrmann's collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock; and Ennio Morricone's with Sergio Leone--has a composer/director relationship been so locked into the popular imagination as the Williams/Spielberg one.  Clearly that collaboration has paid off huge dividends for both men, as it did here with JURASSIC PARK, and as it continues to do so up to the present day.
B00005N6KG|2.0|i really like the feel of them but i found out after i got them that i really needed a great sound. if you dont mind having not so great bass and heavy sound then you would like these. light as a feather.
B00383UJ2U|5.0|I can't tell you enough how fantastic this album is....I am super bummed that they are not HUGE in the US right now.  They are pure perfection.  I hope more Americans catch on so that they can start touring here.  They will be at Coachella this year (2011),hopefully they will do well there so we can see them at more intimate venues all across the US.
0385340540|1.0|But after reading some of the reviews, particularly the incomprehensible 5-star ones, I'm going to knock it down a notch.      Hard to find anything to say about this book that hasn't been touched upon.  Nearly impossible to believe this is the same person who wrote \\"A Painted House\\" which is even better than his legal-thrillers.      Most inexcusable is the inexplicable disappearance of one of the villains introduced earlier in the story, but there's a lot here to be disappointed with.  There are many more clever wits than I that discuss how much of the Italian language one can pick up from this story (if one were so inclined).      So, boo on this one, but Mr. Grisham has plenty of other stories that are worth reading, so don't give up on him entirely.
0743496736|5.0|This book was wonderful. I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult so I had high hopes for Nineteen Minutes. Jodi Picoult did not disappoint me at all. The plot was well developed. She had great character development and that is very important to me for some reason. I enjoyed this book tremendously and I am looking forward to reading more of her books.
B003INBOEM|5.0|IP Man is an excellent martial arts masterpiece. My main motivation for watching it was Donnie Yen, he's my favorite Martial artist, and this is one of his absolute best films. it's now my 2nd favorite Martial arts film, behind \\"The Legend of Drunken Master\\". I was surprised to find out that it wasn't choreographed by Donnie himself, it was choreographed by Sammo Hung, whom should gain a ton of praise, the fight scenes were epic. The story was intriguing and kept my attention through the entire movie, it's not \\"just\\" a Martial arts film. If you're a fan of Martial Arts films check this one out, there's no way you can be disappointed.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|I knew I was going to love this release, before I even heard the very first note! Liam is back with his Oasis band mates, minus Noel Gallagher.  Of course, it's all under the name Beady Eye. Oasis is no more, obviously.  Anyways, you can't get any better than this, especially if you're a hard core Oasis head, you know what I mean?    The album starts off with a kick in the teeth, in the form of \\"Four Letter Word\\". It actually sounds like something coming out of a James Bond picture, seriously.  Producers, take note! Lol. Anyways, it's a journey that you're never ever going to want to end, trust me. It rocks, rolls, and everything in between! Liam is in fine form, the best he's sounded in years! If I had to guess, I would say this wasn't recorded digitally, because of the rawness it has. It sounds like tape to me, for all your producers/ recorders out there.    Hopefully, you purchase the Deluxe Edition, because of the bonus tracks, and the 12 minute interview, which has some great insight to the band!!    1. Four Letter Word- 5/5 Rocks pretty hard. Very electric. Fantastic way to kick things off  2. Millionaire- 5/5 I'll predict this being a single, at some point. Very classic rock. Acoustic based. The melody is very catchy! Another home run!  3. The Roller- 5/5 The official first single. Very Instant Karma. Double fantasy, yeah. What is there to complain about. This should go over well, live.  4. Beatles And Stones- 5/5 Got a WHO vibe. You're going to find these similarities throughout the album. But if you're down with Liam and the rest of Beady Eye, this shouldnt bother you. Very proper rock tune, all the way!  5. Wind Up Dream- 5/5 This is another classic rocker. Believe it or not, you'll notice the John Fogerty influence, lol. Very obvious in the intro, but I love it!!!  6. Bring The Light- 4/5 I wish they would have done more with this track. It drags, very early on. It could have used another verse. Very Jerry Lee, but it grows on you.  7. For Anyone- 5/5 Short, but perfect!!! There's nothing wrong with a song that just edges 2 minutes. Really intersting, lyrically and musically. This should be a great tune to hear live. Acoustic 60's vibe.  8. Kill For A Dream- 4/5 Lyrically, the best on the album, by a mile. It reminds me of something off STANDING ON THE SHOULDER OF GIANTS. \\"Who Feels Love\\", maybe?? I see this being a single...  9. Standing On The Edge Of The Noise- This one rocks, hard! Very tight and dynamic!!! I love guitar sounds. Liam's got that bite. YOu could tell he had fun with this one!  10. Wigwam- 3/5 This one I can't into. Very very oldies. It just doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the tracks. It's also way too long. Clocking over 6 minutes. The only time it was cool for a song to be that long, was on BE HERE NOW. Sorry, boys!  11. Three Ring Circus- 5/5 This reminds me of Elvis, in a way. Great stomper!!!! This is a perfect tune to bob your head to.  12. The Beat Goes On- 5/5 My favorite track on this release! I love the arrangement of the key's and all the other instruments. I could see this being a single, as well. Hopefully, they'll do this live. Lyrically, it's great, too. Very warm, and very heartfelt track.  13. Morning Son- 4/5 Good track to end the album with. I just don't get the drums at the end. Almost like they jacked up the Delay effect and looped the drums in every way to make it sound trippy! A little over produced. But still has a great feel.    I gotta give this album a 5, overall. The holes in this album are very minor. This album is basically Oasis, like I said earlier. So, if you're a fan, you gotta give it up for them. They're very confident in being the best, again. Believe me, they will be. Take cover, America.
B003A9SYTW|2.0|Wow, another album from BRMC where they cannot decide what kind of music they want to make: Rockers or slow, drawn out (and IMO dull) folk songs.  I really liked WAR MACHINE & AYA.  Those I bought and enjoyed.  I'll be glad to never hear any of the other tracks ever again :)
B002ZG997C|2.0|This is going to be a plain and simple review.  If Denzel Washington wasn't in the film you never would have heard of it.<br />A blind middle aged man that knows self defense that can soundly whip the asses of multiple threats simultaneously, and oh yeah I almost forgot, can also journey thousands of miles on foot after being shot in the stomach.  Like the premise of the story but the execution of said story is full of nasty holes.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|Yes, the rumors are true: John Lithgow is amazing as the main villian in this season. The biggest dissapointment to me was the conclusion, everything leading up to it though was amazing, but the finale (for the first time for me) was a letdown. The image in the finale was pretty upsetting too, I won't say anymore for those who haven't seen it yet. All that side, the acting was incredible, who could imagine JL as a cold-blooded killer? Well, anyone see Cliffhanger? Obviously, he had alot more development in this, and better script.
B003EQN6C6|3.0|My copy of this was one of the limited edition collectors series and sadly the only thing I can play it on is the computer. My Philips system refuses to recognise the disc. To hear the album I have had to burn a copy to play on my Stereo system. This appears to be a problem with the disc as nothing else creates this problem.   The music itself is pure beauty. I would highly recommend that everyone finds a way of hearing this album but be wary of the numbered collectors edition.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Normally when I say 'this re-make is much better than the first version' it's small praise. Not this time!   This remake is better scripted, better acted and directed, the tortutre scenes made some of the traps in SAW look like child's play, yes the gang-rape scene is more drawn out, but that makes her revenge more fun to watch...if you can stomache it, that is. In a revenge fantasy movie, I don't always come out of it unscathed or fully satisfied, 'Last House's re-make was better than WC's version in many ways, esp. the vengful tactics of the victims parents, but here, as you probably know by now, Jennifer survives the attacks of the chauvanists that rape her, and becomes a vigilante exacting her own justice, you're definately hoping with how truly cruel most of the pig-like men are) that she will have her revenge in this film, there's even a wild twist towards the end that you may not see coming, but I won't even hint on that. Anyway, if you did like the 78 version, you'll probably like this one too. If you're too close-minded about re-makes which I obviously am not, don't waste your time.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|This is the third version that I have purchased of this movie, and I am glad to support it with my copious amounts of money! I did know at the time of my second purchase (wide screen instead of full) that the movie came in Unrated edition, but I could not find it (too young to know about Amazon at the time) but I recently remembered that this edition existed, and alas, here it is!  This movie is so much better than the original, but a few lines here or there do change, and a couple scenes are a bit different.  All of that aside, this movie is much better than the original version and I am so glad that I purchased it.  It includes bloopers, and a ton of deleted scenes (if you are as into special features as I am) which were entertaining, along with other bonus material.  It was a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone that has not seen the movie, or to people that already own it but in PG-13 format.

B002VJ0576|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic character Sherlock Holmes has been on screen since the days of classic serials right up until the modern era, but never like this. Written by Asylum partner and acclaimed 2010 Moby Dick scribe Paul Bales, the film opens in 1940 amidst the German blitz of London. An aging \\"Professor\\" Watson is on the verge of death, and wants to commit to history the true secret of Sherlock Holmes and how he saved London from unspeakable (until now), unimaginable destruction. Cue the flashback.    It's 1882, and in the English Channel a clipper ship carrying precious cargo finds itself under siege from a large, tentacled creature. Not the typical start to a Sherlock Holmes story, but that's part of the brilliance of this script. While the creature-context may seem out of place for a detective story, it isn't out of place for the source author. Doyle, after all, also wrote creature fantasies, the most recognizable among them being \\"The Lost World,\\" which has been the basis for no less than half a dozen films, including the second Jurassic Park and a certain Asylum monkey movie.    But back to the actual story: ashore, Holmes (Ben Syder) appears to a younger Watson (Gareth David-Lloyd) mid-autopsy to announce their summons to investigate the attack on the clipper ship. Holmes' acumen is quickly illustrated when he frees up Watson's afternoon by visually surmising all evidence any autopsy would have revealed. So let's see...smug, off-handed, unintentionally-condescending intelligence? Check.    So off go the original dynamic duo to a hospital where the lone survivor of the kraken attack, a midshipman with more than a quarter century before the mast, is emerging from his coma just as Holmes and Watson arrive. Nice touch here: when Watson bends to examine the midshipman, the tentacle-look to his stethoscope visibly freaks out the sailor. This is followed by his account of the attack, the what of it all, which Watson is quick to skeptically dismiss as shockmanifesting as delusion. Holmes, of course, finds something in the midshipman's story worth believing, and so the investigation continues.    It's here another neat twist of plot first manifests itself: seems Holmes has an older brother he hasn't seen for seven years who's reported to be back on the London scene, and something about an embarrassment of some sort that resulted in said brother's full-paralysis. But this is just a quick hit, and the story moves on...    In London's seedy East End (Whitechapel-area, Jack the Ripper's hunting grounds), a young, naive virgin goes to visit a lady of the evening - appropriately named \\"Mrs. Pinchcock\\" - but this illicit tryst is unfortunately interrupted by the appearance of a ravenous dinosaur. Yep, that's right, you read me correctly: a dinosaur (at this point, my half-asleep wife muttered from the couch, \\"Wait, why is there a dinosaur?\\" Why, indeed, my love? Because The Asylum has learned a secret long known to purveyors of the fantastic: everything gets more interesting when a dinosaur enters the scene. Think about it, any movie you can name - Battlefield Earth, Annie Hall, Chariots of Fire; as great as they are, they'd be better with even one dinosaur thrown in for good measure. You know I'm right.)      So, just to catch you up, there's now a kraken and a dinosaur, and we're maybe half an hour in at this point. Awesome? Check.    Back to the bickering co-dependency of Holmes and Watson over breakfast and the morning newspaper. The story of the devoured virgin is there, and naturally captures Holmes' attention. The two take the customary perambulation for thought, which itself is interrupted by a hysterical and hysterically-high-pitched old man screaming nonsense about a monster in the woods. But it isn't nonsense, oh no. Cue dinosaur chase.      No spoiler to say our protagonists survive this scene, and it only fuels Holmes further, so he retreats to his experiments while Watson is called to see a patient, a wheelchair-bound man (Dominic Keating, a sort of British Jurgen Prochnow) attended by a beautiful young woman, his \\"niece.\\" He requires medication for his many painful ailments, including the potent narcotic morphine. Watson is hesitant but eventually concedes, due in part to a shine he takes to the girl. He starts to make evening plans with her but Holmes cock-blocks him with an invitation to the East End to further investigate the findings of his analysis of the boy-monster(dinosaur) murder.     Our characters all now firmly in place, the rest is spoilers.      Okay, so that's a lot of plot, but believe me when I say my assessment doesn't do justice to the tightly-crafted twists and turns and melding of myth and literature this script accomplishes. Ultimately, I found this to be a thrilling film that hit on a cerebral, adrenal and even comical level.     One of the ways Sherlock shines and sets itself apart from other Asylum films was its lavish style, courtesy of the eye of director Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Each scene was replete with hue, texture and ambiance melding together to form a sepia-style, Burton-esque fantasy London, opulent in its steampunk-design that melds the worlds of Doyle, Jules Verne, and the recent filmography of Robert Downey Jr. into the perfect setting for an intelligent, action-packed sci-fi spectacle comparable in enjoyability - to me, at least - to its Hollywood tie-in. Aiding this effect are assured performances, atmospheric locations, accurate and fashionable costumes - I'd dress like either of these guys any day of the week, but I'm odd - astounding art direction, intense, well-designed and believable FX and a pulse-racing score. The script was inventive, respective, labyrinthine and familiarly comfortable, and easily the most engaging Asylum script of the year, with the possible exception of another Bales' project, a certain aforementioned whale movie. Goldenberg's direction was intense, exhilarating, ambitious and as such successful. Sherlock is the second film Goldenberg has directed for The Asylum, the first being Sunday School Musical. Her next project is the Asylum-family venture 1st Furry Valentine.    As for the performances, Ben Syder - for whom this is the only credit listed on IMDB - plays the famed sleuth as dismissively deadpan and admirably foppish, as though a brilliance such as his was to its bearer a frightful bore. David-Lloyd as Watson is the perfect counterpart to this, placidly skeptical and pointlessly loyal, a true sidekick.    Overall, and I know I'll get comments like I did when I made a similar declaration about Monster/Cloverfield, but I enjoyed this film more than I did the recent Hollywood version; for all their reinvention of the character, Ritchie and Downey turned him into a sort of lampoon of himself, too self-awaredly self-destructive and reckless for the legacy's own good - he's not a Victorian Indiana Jones, after all, but that's what Hollywood would have him. The Asylum's character feels just right, a balance of tradition and innovation that maintains the integrity of Doyle's hero. Syder may not have the swagger or smarm of Downey, but Sherlock Holmes isn't about swagger - he isn't a Victorian Shaft, either - he's about acumen, subtlety, and in those regards, Syder triumphs. A truly unique Sherlock Holmes experience awaits here, oddly appropriate for its liberties, and all-in-all, just plain entertaining.    What more can you ask for?
B00004SVIK|5.0|I have rarely posted a review on anything(even a cartoon) on the web(whatever/wherever I am), so I want to make this good.       Although I totally agree w/reviews by Ethen Kolenberg, \\"Chris\\" & Weinraub; I have to add this:      When I first listened to this CD that I received as a gift, I thought, this can't compare to \\"The Wall\\" studio version.  BUT then I \\"really\\" heard it one time, and this is by far one of the great \\"live\\" albums of all time(& I have been around a while!)  As with all of Pink Floyd's music, I feel they were always walking on the edge of the razor blade & this album sharpens the blade to a fine edge.....................if U luv Pink Floyd you have to have this album.  It's the samuri sword shapened to an even finer edge.....and now at at this late hour, I  can't really explain it, but this is \\"The Wall\\" with even a finer razor's edge...................  thought I had more to say.....
0743496736|5.0|Peter has been humiliated since his first day at kindergarten when his superman lunch box was thrown out of the school bus window. He has suffered his entire life until he can't take it any longer and he goes to school armed with more than one firearm and more than one hundred bullets. 19 minutes is all it takes for Peter to shoot more than 29 students killing 10 and wounding the others. After 17 years of constant degradation and bullying is he guilty or is he just another victim?<br />Jodi Piccoult excels when it comes to moral dilemmas and this book will leave you thinking of your kids and how much you really know them; how much time you spend really listening to what they have to say and also to their body language. This is a tragic story where many young people die and Peter kills himself. Jodi deserts him when he needs her the most and true friends end up distancing each other because of their kids. All in all an intense story of loss, loneliness, hopelessness and the illusion of love versus true love. All of you parents should read this novel, it'll stay with you long after you finish the book.
0142429104|3.0|I think Amy has some great ideas about maintaining high expectations for you kids. America has become way too accustomed to accepting second best and overall mediocrity, but not Amy. Not a bad read,however some of her ideas about sleepovers, practice etc are a bit over the top and don't make a lot of sense or appear to have any real purpose.

1439133948|4.0|I did not wait for this book to come out in libraries, I downloaded it from Baen to my Kindle. I also had been waiting for a long time to meet again one of my favorite fictional character.    Cryoburn did not have the rush and speed and  the unexpected events that are the usual fare of any books with Miles, he is a bit too tame for my taste. I loved his craziness and the speed of his mental process in solving  any situation, his fearless spontaneous acts which always brought Chaos in the life of anyone trying to follow him . Miles was always a few steps ahead of everyone around him, thus a lot of confused people who got caught in situation not of their own choice , but eventually Miles would save them. In all previous books you are waiting for disaster to happen. In this book most of the time he is not the master puppeteer.  This book seems to be a beginning of the New Wiser and sedate Miles?  I Hope i am wrong.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Come on, George, enough! This ridiculous CGI nonsense is garbage. Stop messing with the films, and give us the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES already! If you had to mess with them, you could at least have done a decent job of it. Look at how realistic the Lord of the Rings films looked. Now THAT'S how you do effects. But if you're going to do the crappy CGI stuff, don't bother doing anything at all!<br /><br />I just can't understand WHY it is so hard to just give the fans what they want. Stop assuming what fans want and insisting on forcing this crap down their throats, and give them what they are actually asking for!

B00006JSS8|5.0|I love Stevie and have been a fan all my life. He is the greatest artist of all time. Yet, some people may not be familiar with his music and this greatest hits collection is more for those people. This album has all his popular songs (and some of my favorites) like ''Overjoyed'', ''Boogie On Reggae Woman'', ''Part-Time Lover'' and the classic '' My Cherie Amour''. I could listen to this collection everyday for the rest of my life and would never get tired. It's that great!

Great Buy for me!
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece. Every song is perfectly written and the beats don't take over the song which is rare when it comes to todays hip hop. There is nothing I could write about this album that hasn't already been written so I won't try. I will write that ''Flashing Lights'' is a classic. I love Kanye!
B003SLE4DW|3.0|Child's first Jack Reacher novel actually reveals the main character to be highly unappealing. He resembles the literary Rambo from First Blood but missing a personality and humor (do not confuse Stallone's Rambo with the original book). The plot sets a style used in many of the Reacher novels - where he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case it is near the town of Margrave, Georgia where upon arrival he is almost immediately arrested as a murder suspect. It soon gets personal because one of the dead is his brother.<br /><br />Reacher has an entertaining backstory as a highly competent and decorated ex-military policeman. In military circles, their police are tough as they have to chase down members of the military gone bad. He soon uses all his skills with some help along the way to bring justice to the town. Critics have seen the early Reacher as \\"creepily amoral, violent, and generally unpleasant\\". As the series moves on, Child gives Reacher an attitude and personality adjustment by better explaining his past and providing him with more humanity. Ultimately, Reacher is on his fictional planet to right wrongs with military professionalism and on that level the book delivers.

B000001ELR|5.0|\\"Creatures of the Night\\" is epic, every last one of the songs that Gene sings is a brutal mean reminder of what a real beast this guy's voice can be. Paul proves on this cd that his wail and vocal range is in my opinion, unmatched.<br /><br />The cd starts off with the title track \\"Creatures Of the Night\\", a song that right away tells you what's in store. A Heavy hard driving crazy album, with loud guitars and mean vocals. Paul has a sinister sound to his voice on this one, to go along with a great guitar solo in the middle.<br /><br />\\"Saint and Sinner\\" is a great beginning to the cd for Gene, the lyrics are catchy and Gene really puts some soul into his vocals here. The guitars are heavy and the solo in the middle really has feeling. A catchy song that is underrated.<br /><br />\\"Keep Me Comin\\" has a very heavy and very catchy guitar riff with a great chorus of backup vocals from Gene and the boys. Pauls voice sounds different on this song than from ANY other song he's ever sang in KISS. It's hard to explain but a great catchy tune nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Rock and Roll Hell\\" is one of the best KISS songs around, this is where Gene Simmons voice transformed into a Metal Machine. This song pounds you in the heart as soon as it begins with some of the loudest Bass licks I have ever heard in any song ever. When Gene starts yelling \\"GET ME OUT OF THIS ROCK AND ROLL HELL, I NEED TO GET AWAY\\" you feel like your ears are having an orgasm, it's that badass.<br /><br />\\"Danger\\" is I think slightly above average, but the cool guitar riff helps make up for it. Pauls vocals are loud, and have an interesting arrangement. The lead guitar in this song is where it really shines in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"I Love it Loud\\" was a smash hit, Gene once again has that voice that sounds so damn brutal. The song is very loud, and is so catchy. The Drums are ridiculous, ridiculously heavy, you can hear what Eric Carr brought to this band. He brought a new attitude and heaviness to KISS, and this is where it all began.<br /><br />\\"I Still Love You\\" is one of Pauls hidden treasures, his voice here sounds better than Robert Plants ever has. He starts off as soft as can be and slowly gets louder and holds a high note and gets louder and louder for what seems like a full minute towards the end of the song.<br /><br />\\"Killer\\" has grown on me a lot, Gene Simmons vocals are sooo good. His scream is so addictive, you have to listen to it at least once a day. He rocks, when he starts yelling \\"SHE'S A KILLAARRR, STONE COOOLDD KILLLLLAAAARRRRR\\" you just can't help but pump your fist. The song is just plain heavy and fun to listen to.<br /><br />\\"War Machine\\" is a HUGE song among hardcore KISS fans, we all cherish this song with our lives. War Machine has an amazing swagger and brutal heaviness that is just flatout unmatched. When Gene screams at the top of his lungs \\"YOU BETTER WATCH OUT, CAUSE IM A WAR MACHIIIIINNNNNEEEEEE\\" with that signature growl of his you know, you just know that you have to listen to this album again. It's too good, we will never hear this kind of real Heavy Metal or Rock and Roll again.this is where it all began.<br /><br />\\"I Still Love You\\" is one of Pauls hidden treasures, his voice here sounds better than Robert Plants ever has.

B00005UEAR|3.0|Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is yet another Dream Theater album with the same bag of predictable and cliched tricks.  That being, a very typical way to write progressive metal music.     However in this particular case the band decided to tackle the subject of stem cell research in a song titled, yes, \\"The Great Debate\\".  Perhaps the cheesiest idea known to man, they actually put bits and pieces of the news stories pertaining to the subject and included them in the beginning of the song.  To my fear and amazement, these stories are actually played for a few minutes.  However it turns out the vocal melody that immediately follows is even worse not only because it's generic, but because it's just not melodic enough for my tastes.  These guys should listen to more Rush, King Crimson and Yes to discover where better vocal melodies originated.    I'm not personally angry they'd choose to bring up stem cells.  It's more like \\"Why in the world would THEY bring up stem cell research, and who in the world would take lyrics seriously connected to an important subject when they're being displayed by a progressive metal band?\\"  I sure as heck wouldn't.  If you would though, by all means- that's your choice.    Other songs like \\"The Glass Prison\\" contain a fair amount of decent writing, guitar solos and vocal melodies to allow me to bring the overall rating to a 3 out of 5.  However it's nothing Dream Theater hasn't already done in the past.  At least on this album -besides \\"The Great Debate\\"- there seems to be less focus on lyrics and more on heavy progressive metal elements, which can only be a good thing (despite being overused ideas that have completely run into the ground by this point, of course).    Overall, it's Dream Theater.  If you've liked previous albums by them you'll like this one as well.  Unless of course, stem cell research is a personal subject for you.   Me?  I've just had enough of the bands usual tricks.  They don't work for me anymore.
0439023521|5.0|I, like almost everyone I'm sure, could absolutely NOT put this book down.  It is by far the best book I've read in a long time.  And don't let the young adult category fool you.. I could see this book being enjoyed by all age groups!
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|I wasn't going out of my way to see this movie, but I had the chance to and I figured I might as well. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. Not only was it not interesting in the least, but it was very boring. This paint-by-numbers action/adventure movie is so inorganic and artificial that you'll be craving a sense of individuality when it comes to this movie. Unfortunately nothing sets it apart from the rest, and it ends up being a bad B-movie through and through. The fact that the point of this movie is to read the book it's based on is consistently hammered into viewers' heads to the point where it actually seems like a better option. Being someone who has read the book, I can tell you that it is 100 times better than this movie.    For those thinking about seeing this or those who are fans of Brendon Frasier, imagine a crappier, uninteresting version of The Mummy, and that's what you get here. The characters aren't fleshed out at all, their motives are very poor and not explained well, and overall this movie has no substance to it at all. Skip this one out, or else you'll regret it.
0786868724|3.0|Have a Little Faith is a touching story about Mitch Albom's journey with a Rabbi and a Pastor. I especially loved reading about the Pastor who was named Henry. I always find it refreshing to read about people that are snatched from the devil's clutches and used mightily by God. Despite his criminal background, Henry developed into a wonderful Preacher and Pastor.<br /><br />I appreciate that Mitch was completely honest about his initial reluctance to enter a Church and his anxiety about spending time with the Jewish Rabbi. This book was funny and interesting from cover to cover.<br /><br />I was disappointed that by the end of the book, Mitch was only slightly more attuned to God and his significance as a Child of God. I debated about rather to assign this book a 3 or a 4 because it was a wonderful read. However, if the goal was to lead others to \\"have a little faith\\" then it fell short. Even the author lacked complete faith after enduring the experiences that he so eloquently describes in the book. So, 3 stars it is!<br /><br />I pray that Mitch's relationship with God becomes more developed and significant as time passes.<br /><br />Dr. Angela Isom<br />Author of Quitters Never Win & Winners Never Quit
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Not much to add that hasn't already been said by everyone else that reviewed this book. It helped me better understand my natural talents and gave me sound suggestions on how to turn those talents into strengths. Like many that buy this book I recently lost my job and wanted a new experience rather than just looking for a paycheck. By doing the online survey that comes with the book I was able to craft my resume to attract the kind of employment experience I am looking for and have the personal insight to avoid the kinds of employers I don't want to work with (yes even in this economy I believe that you can and should turn down a job that you don't want).<br /><br />Don't expect to read this book and then fully understand your strengths, there is work involved and you will need to figure out on your own how to leverage your strengths in the work place. The book is an excellent tool and one that I believe should everyone should have.
0399156577|5.0|I literally could not put this down. I read it in 2 days. All the dog training was essential in that the psychology involved parallels that of the dominance/submissive involved in the killer/ victim storyline.
B003EYVXTG|1.0|This is a very bad movie, not worthy of your time and attention.  I can't believe it has gotten so much attention, it is like the Emperor's New Clothing, there is nothing there.  If you want to watch a movie about hillibillies, watch the Ma & Pa Kettle series.  At least you will be entertained and not have to say to yourself, \\"Why did I watch this?\\"
0553062182|3.0|Wow . I don't think anyone could have been more excited than me about this book. I want to keep this brief though and say that the writing, at least for me, is so uninteresting  that it cannot hold my attention. Research Psych is my field too and according to the author I am a hardcore HSP.        I do believe in the concept of Highly Sensitive People and applaud the writer for making this her life's work. But am hungrily anticipating further work from different perspectives/authors. Perhaps less fluff/opinion/anecdotal stuff and more science?     To be fair I should read it cover to cover before posting my opinion. But some things are easier said than done.
0756404738|5.0|I had this ordered in the Kindle version and downloaded it as soon as it was available. The hardcover is on its way. I didn't get any sleep last night because I couldn't quit reading. As I had hoped, Wise Man's Fear was worth the effort.<br /><br />The story is that Patrick Rothfuss originally wrote the Kingkiller Chronicles as a single volume and the publisher broke it into three books for marketing reasons. After the first book become such a success, Rothfuss, took a couple of years revising the next installment. Was it worth the wait? That's a difficult question to answer. Wise Man's Fear is excellent, easily the best fantasy I've read in years and as important as Brandon Sanderson finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Do I enjoy the book that much more than the first that I think the wait was justified? Actually, no. The writing quality was already of a high order. The characters were complex and richly rendered. The story line was absolutely compelling. Does polishing a the sentences to make them shine a bit more make up for my impatience? No.<br /><br />That said, this book is excellent and has none of the sequel letdown so common in publishing. You can read this on its own and enjoy it, but then you would be depriving yourself of the joy of reading the wonderful first installment. If you did enjoy that, you will love this. It is written with more polish and the story is still compelling.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I love sports movies so I knew that I would go see this movie the 1st weekend it came out, and the critics had given it great reviews but it definetely exceeded all my expectations. If you truly love movies and when actors transform into character perfectly to make a incredible story and narrative then this is the movie for you. Mark Walberg did a great job, but Christian Bale was simply incredible in this and it is a must \\"own\\" movie..     I walked in with high expectations and \\"The Fighter\\" overdelivered in every way possible having me leave the theatre and pre-ordering this movie the same night..
0439023521|5.0|I just finished reading the Hunger Games Trilogy yesterday. It took me 1 week to read all 3- I couldn't do anything else!  The best part of the books is Peeta's character!  I love him! If you want a good book at any age~ read this one!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I saw this film theatrically today . With my eighty year old mother (who wished to see it again) and one of my brothers . This film is an instant classic and i feel the academy folks got it right . I've yet to see THE FIGHTER and loved TRUE GRIT (another instant classic in my opinion) . Some of the ten nominations for best picture did not belong in the top ten (in my opinion) . Films such as the deeply flawed THE KIDS ARE ALLRIGHT , The overratted INCEPTION as well as the over praised but very good WINTER'S BONE . This is a brilliant film though and truly earned it's various awards and nominations . Quite awesome .
0143118706|1.0|I thought this would be another Eat, Pray, Love book; however, this book would be great if you are taking a preparing for marriage or divorce book.  Could not even finish it.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I bought this for my fiance since he is studying Wing chun. The cinemeatography in this movie is awesome! the acting is superb. We loved it from beginning to end..... would watch this over and over again.
B002E01MHY|1.0|Typical horror flick with some gory stuff thrown in.  Nothing new nor inventive for suspense or excitement.    tlee
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I can't think of a better way of spending a few hours than listening to this wonderful set. Ichida provides beautiful readings of these concertos, with crystal clear fingering and long melodic lines. Her playing is always precise but never mechanical. These are limpid, lovely performances and Tate and the orchestra provide a suitably dynamic accompaniment.<br /><br />Of course, the final eight or nine of these concertos are well-known among Mozart's greatest works. But I found equal pleasure in listening to and becoming acquainted with the less-well-known works which show the composer developing and feeling his way toward greatness. There are lovely moments in all of them and many are hardly ever performed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a quick and easy read. It sucks you in from the first chapter. Would recommend this to anyone.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I have to go along with all the other reviews noted here. One thing I will point out is that when I originally saw this series on TV Sigourney Weaver did the narration. I much preferred hers to David Attenbourghs. Other than that the magnificent cinemaphotography shows through on this Blu-Ray edition. Without a doubt the best documentary of it's kind. Some of the images are simply stunning. Especially liked 'Deep Ocean' where some of the lifeforms are right out of some science fiction writers imagination. My wife is a teacher's assistant and I let her borrow this film to show to her students. She tells me the kids were totally absorbed and facinated by this film. Kudos BBC
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book, and the rest of the series, was absolutely riveting.  I could not put it down once I picked it up.  The characters pulled at your heartstrings and the story line kept the pages turning.  This tragic, but heartfelt and engrossing series is one I will recommend over and over again!
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|My grandson loves this \\"Train movie\\" No longer in stores after the Holiday so Amazon was the place to go!
0670022411|1.0|I really wanted to like this novel. I love the supernatural, history, and biology, so I thought this novel would be really compelling and interesting. It wasn't. It was 600 pages of boring fluff. It dragged on much too long and there was nothing resolved. I understand the author is writing a sequel and that the story line wouldn't be wrapped up in one novel, but I was so frustrated by the lack of any progress or development of the story. Take for example, Harry Potter--J.K. Rowling had an overriding arc for her series, but each individual book had it's own conflict that was resolved. Even Stephanie Meyer knew to do the same for her Twilight series. But Deborah Harkness doesn't. I hate starting a novel and not finishing it, so I forced myself to read A Discovery of Witches in its entirety. I was hoping something interesting would happen, but I was sorely disappointed. What the author did write about, time and time again, is that Diana loves tea, rowing, eating, yoga, sleep, and her research--very mundane facts that were repeated a thousand times. Diana was depicted by her actions as a weak damsel in constant distress despite the author saying Diana was confident and strong. Major contradiction by the author there.    Finishing this novel just left me completely frustrated that I wasted my time. I felt like there was no purpose to this novel, except as filler for the next. We get a lot of background and history on the characters and the supernatural elements, but that's it. The story was barely developed, and nothing was resolved. Overall this novel was just boring, frustratingly so. I don't recommend it, especially since it's 600 pages of pure fluff.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Not much to say, but I enjoy the album a lot. Reminds me of some of the old classical rock songs.
B000YDCFRE|5.0|They arrived as promised and are very comfortable.  The construction is very sturdy yet they are not bulky.  I am very happy with them.
B003UESJF6|4.0|You know what I hate?     Paying for a DVD and having to watch ads for everything from anti-pirating to some movie I'd never watch voluntarily [Transformers 2: Electric Boogaloo].    Thanks to Dreamworks for making a Blu Ray that loads directly to the main menu.
0751517089|4.0|Over 350 pages (small pages)and easy to read, chronological and a little funny.  Entertaining and very detailed account of what Nick Leeson did to cause Baring's Bank to collapse.  I would have liked the book more if Nick described his trading in the pit more in his career than just when he was doubling down on his huge losses at the very end.  He shows several official statements from authorities and people at the bank.  Many people around him were described.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in futures trading, bond trading or the Baring's collapse.
0439023513|4.0|I didn't like the ending at all. I felt it could have been better. It almost felt like Suzanne Collins was tired of writing this series and didn't put much thought in the ending for the characters.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Provocative from the beginning, disgusting, filthy, violent, brutal, primitive and insultingly simplistic.  I am so glad we have he freedom to make trash like this, and that I was able to view it and to write what I think about it; I'd not have it any other way.  Freedom of speech is so important to all of us...however...this film is a joke.<br /><br />It seems to have been designed for those with the smallest of brains (and penises) and greater interest in war and conflict...than peace and understanding.<br /><br />I can see this as a sort of twilight zone episode, if it were tweaked a little, but this is too severe and caustic for my senses...far too thin to be of what the bible speaks of or what it has spawned in man and culture.  I did not find much here of any value.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|I just finished the 2012 movie by watching it on Netflix. When i saw the trailer over a year ago i got really intrigued by the scene where the water pours over the mountain and the Asian religious man is swept away as he rings a bell. As i saw more of the scenes I thought it might be worth watching just for the special effects.<br /><br />Well the special effects sometimes were over the top as I suppose was the concept for this movie. I DO NOT believe the world will end this way, so this was purely an excercise in fantasy as I watched Roland Emmerich direct his view of the Apocalypse.<br /><br />The cast was well arranged as the main character's role was aptly filled by John Cusack who is usually loved in every role. Even the small part carried by Woody Harrelson was entertaining as he was so believable as a conspiracy shouting radio jock who is met by \\"Jackson\\" in Yellowstone National park.<br /><br />Perhaps the most troubling scene for me was when the earth's axis was supposedly rearranged ny 28 degrees and the guy who assumes command after the president is out of the picture says you mean the north pole is now in Minnesota? Another guy says, \\"That is the SOuth pole.\\" Sorry guys, but the shift would have to be much more than 28 degrees to realign the poles!<br /><br />If you like large scale disaster movies like \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" then you will like this movie also. If seeing major landmarks destroyed bothers you, then stay away!
0143038419|4.0|When I saw the preview for \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" I immediately thought that I had to read the book first.  I still have not seen the movie, but the book itself is excellent!  People may complain that the author is too into herself and her problems are ones that people experience every day, which may be true, but this is her book!  Her sort of published diary and I loved following her year abroad.  Excellent read, keeps you entertained and wanting more.  Highly recommended.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie has been extensively reviewed so I will just indicate this. I did not get a chance to see it in the theater so I picked up the Blu-Ray since so many people told me how great it was. I've watched it three times in two days in an attempt to make sure I got it through and through. The reality is, any  movie that is good enough to watch three times in two days is worthy of 5 stars and a recommendation to others.
B003Q6D25U|4.0|Although I thought the novelty had worn off after Blair Witch, Session 9 (undiscovered classic) and the first Paranormal Activity, this \\"found footage film\\" really got to me. Although I liked Rec, I didn't care for The Last Broadcast or Clover Field (I figure it's kinda bad when you root for the monster) It's fair when people compare this film to the first, absolutely fair. This one didn't scare me as much as the first, but the tension and suspense was much greater. I'm not a fan of the mythology they seem to have created, but only because it seemed to come out of the need to create a series of films rather than actual organic storytelling. With a lesser quality film I would have no quibble. Which is good and bad. Anyway, this movie scares you, builds tension to nearly unbearable levels, serves as both a prequel and epilogue to the first film, and leaves you wanting more. As you lie awake sleepless that first night of viewing.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I just love BBC's Masterpiece Theatre and any movie based on Classic love stories. Jane Eyre is no exception. I loved it so much when I watched it on Youtube that I bought it. I watch it all the time and I love it. Great story. Great actors. Great movie.
B00005ATZT|4.0|If you enjoy white knuckle thrillers dripping with suspense and crammed with (often really over the top) heart pounding action, then THE FUGITIVE is a must-see.  I caught this little jewel on the tube recently and quickly was reminded how I sat mesmerized in the theatre back in the early Nineties during THE FUGITIVE's initial release.  Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are grand fun to watch as a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife (the sensationally gorgeous Sela Ward) flees from the law (while simultaneously identifying the real murderer, don't ya know) and is relentlessly pursued by a pit bull of a U.S. Marshal.  My goodness, we have train wrecks, jumping off of hydro dams, falling through skylights, and much more carnage requiring titanic suspension of disbelief, but come on, Ford plays a doctor who always manages to stitch himself up.<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally fun, led by Joe Pantoliano (one of my fave character actors), Jeroen Krabbe, and Jane Lynch in a very brief role (long, long before 'Glee' fame).  A young and sizzling Julianne Moore also appears as an overwhelmed ER doc.  Sure, the action comes in metric truckloads, but the suspense, plot, and pacing are finely tuned, and Ford and Jones play well off one another.  THE FUGITIVE is one fun rollercoaster; sit on your sofa and hang on.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I grew up on comic books and video games, and if you did too, then you will love this movie. The movie is very fast pace, often jumping quickly from one scene to the next. Very, very hard to describe what kind of genre this movie falls into. It combines excellent action scenes with off-beat humor all the while pushing along a rather simple romance plot. Just like a comic book, Scott Pilgrim is meant to be watched multiple times.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Honestly, when I first heard this album, it was very different. Not like the other albums. But after listening to these songs a few times, I knew I was in love with this album. It made me want to get all of their other albums and listen as well. I liked MCR before, but not as much as now. The C.D. is literally one of the greatest. It made me want to buy merchandise, gave me inspiration for art and just to try songs out a few times before you decide you don't like them!! I'm not going to give a review on every song on the track list, because every review would be amazing. I love this album. MCR gave me motive to make a Twitter account, \\"like\\" them on Facebook, join the MCRmy, do missions:) And listening to them when I'm upset, always brings my spirits up. I love MCR!   Buy this album!!!!    ~Angelica
B00001QEE5|5.0|How can you not love a classic? This movie has entertained my granddaughter every time she watches it! If you have a Tinkerbell fan, they have to see where she got her start!! :)
B001V7YJMG|5.0|For all the people complaing about the subtitles, I kindly ask you to shut the hell up.<br />This is my first time seeing this movie and I thought it was great, whether it's traslated \\"right\\" or not.<br />Plus I got to see it for free. I love you Amazon Prime. &lt;3
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book, and so did everyone in my book club.  It grips your heart from beginning to end, and you will fall in love with the dog. A must read for dog lovers, and even those who are \\"cat people\\".
B00006LPER|2.0|The acting was good for what it was.  The opinion I have after watching it was the movie was someone's spoof of what BDSM was.  The ending just left me with my mouth hanging open and shaking my head in wonderment.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie \\"Secretariat\\" is one of the best, if not THE best movie I have seen in a very long time.   The acting was spectacular! The places where everything took place were sooo beautiful.    The horses were fantastic!  I did not see the name of the horse who played Secretariat, unless his name was \\"Big Red\\" but he was beautiful.   The costumes were authentic.  I loved everything about this film.   The trainer was terrific and of course Diane Lane was perfect.   I really liked the way they showed the actual races, horses running, dirt flying and everything. I also really liked the way they showed the connection between Big Red and Penny.  They way the horse observed her as if he could read her thoughts.     It was fabulous!     I also liked the way they showed the real Penny at the end of the film in the grand stands.  That was subtle and great.        I am very happy that I purchased this DVD.    You should also.      As far as what I would have wanted to know before purchasing,   I have always been interested in horese racing, just for viewing; although I would love to see a live race sometime.    I don't think it is necessary for any information other than the trailer for the film that we see on TV.  It was a great movie.       I have purchased many of my DVD collection from Amazon and have always been satisfied.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|This Cold Steel SRK knife is a fine blade, indeed.  Made with the San Mai III technique, where a hard carbon steel is encased in their VG-1 stainless steel, makes for a knife able to be super sharp and durable.  Out of the box, this knife as exceedingly sharp, made even better when I stropped the edge with leather and jeweler's rouge.  This is one of the few knives that I joke with friends about it being so sharp that I blinded myself just looking at it.    Along with the durable and super sharp blade, the grip on this knife is fantastic, as well.  The checkered Kraton (a kind of rubberized material) makes for an excellent grip, even when wet, and even when oiled.  I have knives with better grips, however, yet the lesser Kraton material does NOT detract from the overall quality of this knife at all.    I have collected knives for many years, and actually count this one among my favorites.  I've always favored a balanced blade over larger blades, and this knife is very balanced.  It IS a large knife, but not to the point of being unwieldy, and can be used for any purpose...from being a camping utility knife to a great fighting knife.  Truly, an all-purpose survival knife.    This is the point, however, where my review differs from all that have come before.  The sheath included with this knife is different from those past customers have apparently received.  In all previous reviews, it appears as if customers have been receiving Concealex sheaths with this knife, which is a mainly nylon type of sheath with a hard-ish blade holder, designed to be placed more or less covertly about the body.  The major grip has been that when turned upside down without the handle clasp snapped into place, the knife will simply fall out of the sheath.  I did not receive this sheath with my SRK.  Instead, for some reason, I received the SecurEx sheath that Cold Steel includes with many of their knives.  Even without the handle snaps in place, my SRK will NOT fall out of the sheath.  It is fit snugly and securely, with the sheath having a snug hold on the upper portion of the knife's handle.  I'm not sure just how recent a change this is; but there you have it.  I was surprised to see this sheath included with my SRK, as I was expecting the Concealex sheath others had been getting with this knife...a very pleasant surprise.
1599219751|4.0|Over the years there has been considerable speculation regarding the authenticity of Rawicz' story. I started reading about the controversy mid-way through my first reading of the book and it didn't dampen my enthusiasm for this wonderfully written story. In fact, I have just finished my second reading and purchased a copy for my son.     It's a wonderful story of hardship, struggle, friendship and loss, set in inhospitable lands and you will find it difficult to put the book down once you start reading it. It's also a great read for all ages teen and up.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|highly recommend this vendor!!! would use him again in a heartbeat!  quick and easy purchase! pleasure to deal with!
B004LGPBZI|5.0|I've had the album for a couple of weeks now, and while I've been a huge Oasis fan, I haven't enjoyed a record this much since 1995's \\"What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" The album shines most brightly in its consistency and variety. There is arguably no filler on it, and even the track or two that some may consider filler have their place on the album. The songwriting trio of Liam Gallagher, Gem Archer, and Andy Bell brings a variety of songs that I can listen to no matter my mood, and it is for this reason that the album hasn't left my CD player since I first started listening to it two weeks ago. While it will not have the same impact as WTSMG? did upon its release, it contains the same lighthearted vibe and has gotten better with every listen for me.     Track by track with the songwriter in parenthesis below.     Four Letter Word (Bell) - Another strong Gallagher album opener. Straight up rock and roll with Liam reminding us that \\"nothing ever lasts forever.\\"     Millionaire (Bell)- From the electric fast paced FLW to the all acoustic Millionaire, the album gets off to a strong start with some of the most interesting lyrics on the album referencing Salvador Dali and a trip from Cadaqués to Figueres.     The Roller (Archer) - A good choice for the first proper single. Shades of 'Instant Karma' all over this one but a really upbeat song. It's supposedly about a person that can always be counted on to be strong for a friend in their time of need.     Beatles and Stones (Gallagher) - One of the tracks some might consider filler, but it definitely has its place on the album and has Liam passionately voicing his opinion about wanting to \\"stand the test of time, like Beatles and Stones.\\"     Wind Up Dream (Archer) - One that has gotten much better over time for me. I didn't really get this one at first, but it's a good listen with a cool harmonica solo towards the end.     Bring the Light (Gallagher) - A shocker when it first came out as a free download in November, fans fears that the entire album like this one can be laid to rest. While an album full of Jerry Lee Lewis type tracks like this one would be a bit much, it sounds fresh on every listen. Recorded live, and the rawness comes through well in the final recording.     For Anyone (Gallagher) - One of Liam's finest vocals on the album. A nice little number that will undoubtedly draw comparisons to 'Songbird' for it's just over two minute runtime, acoustic guitar, and lyrics.     Kill for a Dream (Bell)- Perhaps the most Oasis sounding track on the album. Shouldn't have anything taken away from it for that though as it is one of the highlights for me.     Standing on the Edge of the Noise (Archer)- Perhaps the weakest song on the album, there are some strange effects going on with Liam's voice here which may turn off some. Should be great live.     Wigwam (Gallagher) - A six and a half minute epic that starts off completely different from how it ends. One of Liam's finer songwriting efforts.     Three Ring Circus (Archer) - A great rock and roll tune by Gem here. I can already hear people singing the big chorus at the gigs.     The Beat Goes On (Bell) - Another impressive track by Andy Bell with a big chorus with Liam singing retrospectively, \\"So long, so long, someday all the world will sing my song,\\" but also staying positive saying \\"It's not the end of the world, oh no, it's not even the end of the day.\\"     The Morning Son (Gallagher) - A beautiful album closer both musically and lyrically. Liam admits that if there is ever a track he's written about his brother it's this one. He sings \\"he's in my mind, he's in my soul, he's even in my rock and roll\\" before the song really takes off into a \\"Champagne Supernova\\" esque outro.       Overall, I didn't expect anything nearly this good from Beady Eye. While some songs could be improved, the album would not be better off without any of them. Oasis fans shouldn't be too quick to dismiss them for not having Noel Gallagher as there is a lot here to like. There's no reinvention of the wheel, but it's still the best album featuring a Gallagher brother since 1995.
1400052181|5.0|Henrietta Lacks was an unknown person. She walked anonymously among us. She did our dirty work. Lived a life that most white people would shudder to find themselves living. She was an honest, simple, hard-working person who society assumed could be used when needed but otherwise ignored --even abused. We see such people among us every day, or more accurately, we don't really see them at all. Except when we feel threatened by something or someone and we are looking for a \\"usual suspect.\\"  But for the readers of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, its intrepid, patient, diplomatic and skillful author Rebecca Skloot, has performed a remarkable service. She has forced us to \\"see\\" Henrietta Lacks and her progeny. She has gone where most \\"sane\\" white folk fear to tread. She has been patient with rightly very skittish people. She has allowed them to speak as themselves. To convey their beliefs and fears untarnished by the paternalism of white interpretations. She has told a chilling story of medical ethics from all sides, with sympathy, tolerance and understanding. She has conveyed a cogent, easy to comprehend history of cellular biology, sufficient for a lay reader, always using language that most of us can understand.   The conflation of the human experience, of genuine feelings, vengeance, anger and resentments, with the compulsions, megalomania and rationalizations of driven, and yes dedicated, scientists is in itself a remarkable story, but there is so much more. There is primitive theology faith and a desire for immortality beyond rational, but treated without disparagement or condescension. All of it occurring within its proper historical context. And to top that off, there is the no-holds-barred confrontation with the realities of a society morally, politically, economically and mentally crippled by pervasive and insidious racism.   As I turned paged, I marveled. \\"This woman really gets it,\\" I said to myself over and over. She gets it and she's brave. She wiseenough to subsume her ego and just tell the story. She's skilled enough to tell the story in a compelling way. She's dogged enough to go everywhere and talk to everyone. She's engaging enough to get people to talk to her. She's professional enough to get it all down.   Our entire society, top to bottom owes Rebecca Skloot a debt of gratitude for what she has accomplished with this book. I hope it is placed on reading lists, not just for African-American studies, but for ethics, theology, history, politics and economics, in every college and university. I hope that it is discussed frequently in classes. I hope that it becomes a classic -- a point of reference and departure for genuine debate of a wide spectrum of the issues that confront us as a society.   I don't like to think of myself as an easy grader. I've given some other books five stars. This one should earn more.

B0042JTDXK|4.0|This is definitely a departure from Josh's previous albums. The styles of the songs aren't what one would normally expect, but I do find myself loving it regardless. It's not my favorite Josh CD (it's actually my LEAST favorite!),  but it's still miles above the other things being put out and called \\"music\\" nowadays.     My personal favorite tracks: Higher Window, Galileo, Bells of New York City.

B004HGBUVG|5.0|This is excellent new music from Lucinda Williams.  My favorite track is the title track \\"Blessed\\".  This song is a reminder that blessings can come from unexpected sources  The lyrics of this song is very moving.<br /><br />\\"Buttercup\\" is a song about refusing to be an emotional crutch for someone.  I love the electric guitar playing on this song. \\"Born To Be Loved\\" has a bluesy tone to it that I love.  This song is very soothing.<br /><br />  Another moving song is \\"Soldier's Song\\".  This is a song about the thoughts that go through a soldier's mind when they are at war.  This song is also about the sacrifices a soldier makes for their loved ones.\\"I Don't Know How You're Livin'\\" is a song about all the little things a person does for the people they love.<br /><br /> \\"Seeing Black\\" is a song about the burdens of life can cause someone to take their own life.  Elvis Costello lends his talents playing the guitar on this track.  \\"Copenhagen\\" is an unusual song title.  This song has nothing to do with the place, but it is pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />  \\"Convince Me\\" is another song I like.  There is something about Lucinda's voice that is appealing here. This song is a reminder that everyone needs someone to lean on in life. \\"Ugly Truth\\" is a song about how mistakes and memories can haunt a person if they do not deal with it properly.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Love\\" and \\"Kiss Like Your Kiss\\" are beautiful love songs. The second disccontains the unplugged versions of these songs.  They feature Lucinda playing the guitar.  I enjoyed both versions of these new songs by Lucinda.  This is excellent new music.
B001AW156U|5.0|PROS:     * These easily snap right on your PS3 controller and make the L2 and R2 buttons actual triggers (as the name of the product implies) and not just rounded half-triggers that slip in your fingers.    *You know how sometimes when you set your PS3 controller on a table and you accidentially fast forward/rewind your movie or fire your gun? well with the \\"real triggers\\" on this doesn't happen since they are flat on the bottom.    * The color and texture of the triggers are nearly identical to that of the other gray buttons on the controller.    * They are very cheap (but you already knew that) :P      CONS    * Well, the only thing bad I can say about them is that when I get in very suspenseful sections of games (like in Heavy Rain or Killzone)I tend to squeeze the triggers way harder than is needed and they do come off sometimes... it doesn't happen too often (and they just snap right back on) but it can make you mess up in a game if you don't react quick enough.            All in all, these snap-on triggers greatly enhance the design of the PS3 controller, and make playing games and watching movies on your PS3 even more enjoyable. Truly, this product is something every PS3 owner should get for their controllers.
1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one author well known for writing about controversial issues. Her latest novel, Sing You Home, is sure to evoke strong emotions among some of her readers. The novel encompasses such diverse issues as, gay rights, evangelical Christian beliefs, in vitro fertilization, suicidal teens, divorce, discrimination and even music therapy. The essence of the story is told in alternating chapters from the points of view of three primary characters.<br /><br />Zoe Baxter, has longed to be a mother. She's approaching 40 years of age, has been married to Max for nearly 10 years, and the couple has been unsuccessful at bringing a child of their own into the world. Zoe has had several miscarriages, and her last pregnancy resulted in a stillborn birth. After undergoing IVF (in vitro fertilization), spending thousands of dollars, and experiencing one disappointment after another, Zoe still has not given up hope. Her husband Max, on the other hand, is through.<br /><br />Max is a recovering alcoholic. He cannot endure the thought of more attempts at conception, and he wants out. Max files for divorce and he slowly slides back into drinking once again.  When he is involved in an automobile crash while under the influence, he soon realizes he needs to change his life.  He moves in with his brother Reid and his wife. Reid suggests that he come to their church, The Eternal Glory Church, and listen to their pastor, Clive Lincoln speak.  The pastor happens to be a radical fundamentalist with an anti-gay agenda.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Zoe throws her emotionally wounded self into her work as a Music Therapist, working with hard to reach individuals. She is asked by Vanessa, a school counselor, to work with a suicidal teen girl. Zoe agrees, and before long a relationship which began as colleagues then friends, develops into romantic love.<br /><br />The couple, from Rhode Island, get married in Massachusetts, where gay marriage is legal, since Rhode Island does not yet recognize such unions.  The lesbian couple, very much in love, wish to complete their union by having a family. Zoe tells Vanessa about the fertilized embryos which she and Max have stored, and Vanessa is more than willing to try to become pregnant using these embryos so that the couple can experience parenthood.<br /><br />Unfortunately when Zoe approaches Max, now born again Christian, he is vehemently opposed to the idea and a vicious court battle ensues, over who has rights to the embryos when a couple divorces.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS - Having read all of Picoult's  novels, this one --her 18th,  is probably her most controversial yet. The author presents a powerful story about what constitutes a family, and why committed gay couples should be seen no differently from straight couples when it comes to marriage and  raising a family.  It is a timely story told in voices that are real and heartfelt. The message is one of acceptance and tolerance, and it is certainly a story which will provide for lively discussion among readers and book clubs everywhere.  Included with this book was a music cd which includes (10) soundtracks inspired by Zoe's work as a music therapist, and the songs are reflective of her feelings throughout the novel. The lyrics were written by Picoult, and the music was sung by Ellen Wilbur -- the music was lovely.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough -- a must read.e, very much in love, wish to complete their union by having a family.

B002ZG99TK|2.0|\\"Unstoppable\\" was directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, and Rosario Dawson in this story of a half-mile long runaway train that is compared in dialogue to a missile heading towards very populated areas. These characters all dance around the train, but the train itself in all its fire engine red glory is the star. How I wish they had just put more stuff in front of the train for it to destroy...<br /><br />The movie introduces the characters quickly. Chris Pine is Will, a rookie conductor trying to make ends meet while being separated from his wife and kid after a misunderstanding. Denzel Washington plays Frank, part of the old guard in the train yards and resentful of newbies coming in and taking their jobs. There's a bit of tension but eventually they will begrudgingly respect each other through the upcoming crisis.<br /><br />Some dimwits eating fast food and rushing their word accidentally set a large train in motion that has failed air brakes and accidentally put itself into gear. In a different light, the director could've played the possessed train with a taste for vengeance card, but instead it focuses on the fact that the doofusses were being morons. Rosario Dawson plays Connie, the woman communicating between all the trains and attempting to avert disaster while being stuck under management's thumb.<br /><br />Something that really bothers me about Tony Scott films is the shaky, blurry camera work to introduce a movie and make it INTENSE. He did the same thing with another train film, this one underground \\"Pelham 123\\". It's almost unwatchable. Very predictable. Dan turned to me before it started and asked, \\"How much you wanna bet it opens with a sunrise coming over the train yard with a train drifting into view\\" and BAM! There it was. Our big bad mean train is so cleverly painted RED so you'll never miss it in any shot. The little tiny train that Frank and Will drive is blue, the same color as Thomas the Tank engine and it's old and has everything against it, but darn-it-all, it's going to be the \\"little engine that could\\" by the end of this, you can just smell it.<br /><br />The train's speed starts high and just gets higher. Even when it's going 10mph, it looks like it's going 60 in the opening shots so the challenge Tony Scott has to face is how to make an already ridiculously fast looking train, get FASTER! There are tons of close calls and a cheap teases that children are going to be injured. And \\"Unstoppable\\"? Spoiler alert, it's false advertising. ;-)  Fine for a random high-speed action movie, but you won't really care about the characters, just the train hitting stuff.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The Bonus Features are all starring THE TRAIN. In \\"The Fastest Track: Unleashing Unstoppable\\", Tony Scott discusses his love affair with helicopters, using them, shooting from them and how no one does train movies (except him I guess) and he really loves trains. In \\"Derailed: Anatomy of a Scene\\", you get to see the behind-the-scenes look at...a really fast train and the stunts that go along with it. Specifically in \\"Hanging off the Train: Stunt work\\", you see Chris Pine getting pelted with Sugar Puffs five inches away from serious injury. \\"On the Rails with the Director and Cast\\" is where the cast and Tony Scott stop and talk about how important it was to have such a good story and these \\"well-developed\\" characters (two of which work at Hooter's) and how that factored into deciding to do the movie.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech deserves all the praise it has received for it is truly the year's best film and one of the most heart-warming, inspirational films I've seen in years. This is not a political film. It hinges entirely on the relationship between Firth's character and Geoffrey Rush's character. One King, one mentor. It is about friendship, a unique bond in which trust is of the utmost importance.  That is what truly makes this film so special. It feels so genuine and interesting and even when there are conflicts( and there are a few of those) you can't help but hope that everything will work out in the end.     The performances are simply stellar. Colin Firth truly transforms and with each and every stutter, it never looks forced. He is truly in a class by himself. Geoffrey Rush is a man that can act in his sleep. Talk about someone who actually manages to steal the spotlight away from the affable Firth. One of his best acting performances in recent memory. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight to watch. She has a particular manner of speaking with such ease and just a hint of snootiness which I find quite entertaining. Her role is smaller but no less important. These three fine actors work beautifully in sync and have created something of a masterpiece.    The musical score is suble, yet admirable, the cinematography is perfection and the costumes are never overdone. All these details make up a film and are no less important than the actors and when all these elements are combined, they create a film such as this. I can literally find not one single complaint about The King's Speech and I find it even more intriguing and wonderful knowing it was based on factual events. I was truly inspired and I'm certain the results will be identical to all who watch this.
0982743726|5.0|This is a fantasy novel of two depths. On the surface it is a well crafted and straightforward adventure tale utilising oppression as its theme. The perpetrators? One delightfully petulant Earl, and a deliciously malevolent priest. Add in two idealistic youngsters - one with healing powers - and a rather confused swordsman with a complicated past, and you have a great read, a fast moving page turner.<br />Yet look a bit deeper and you'll find subtle insights into the characters' minds and morality which add a richness to the novel's tone. The three main protagonists - Malik, Noah and Jasmine - are complex and inspiring characters who make some unusual decisions. It is this quality of surprise, along with the free flowing prose, which lifts The Bone Sword out of the ordinary. Read it on any level - you'll enjoy it!

B001P9EQH8|2.0|Got this product with my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Studio Monitor Headphones and FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone. I must say. I was happy with the product for the days that it actually worked.. Battery life was without problems. But just after 3 days. After I try many different ways to get it to play.. I get no reaction when I plug in my headphones and the (LOD) to my iPhone. Or with the other audio cables that came with it. Nothing. I kind of feel like a sucker buying this, but.. what do you expect from something worth only 20$? I will try my luck again with a different headphone amplifier because I did notice the improved performance from my headphones. But.. the bass boost on this product? No difference at all. It may as well not even be there. Worthless junk now..     Don't even waste your money. Get something a bit more reliable.
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is a beautifully universal film about the expectations and obstacles that are passed down to us, and the means by which we can all manage to overcome them. With some terrific performances and superb work by director Tom Hopper, the film also garners some important and inspiring messages. It is rated-R for the use of one or two naughty words--an unfortunate truth. It is a wonderful film that is more than suitable for a wider age group than its rating permits.    The film opens in 1925 as Prince Albert (Colin Firth,) son of King George V, is preparing to give a speech to thousands of eager listeners at Wembley Stadium in England. His dearly supportive wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) stands close by, gazing over at her husband, hoping for success. Alas, Albert's voice refuses to cooperate, and his stammering speech gets the best of him.    Because Albert is in such a prominent sociopolitical position, he dreads the frequent speeches that he must give to his country through the radio. He hires many different speech therapists, all knighted and credentialed, but no techniques they offer can cure his stammer--not even a mouth full of marbles does the trick.    His wife therefore decides to seek out a lesser-known speech therapist, and we finally meet Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush.) Logue is known largely for his relatively unorthodox methods, and when Elizabeth first meets him and asks him to help her husband, it is clear that he knows he is damn good at what he does.    After his father dies, Albert's brother David (Guy Pierce) briefly takes over, but due to his plans to marry a divorced American woman, he quickly steps down and Albert inherits the throne as King George VI.    So begins Albert's struggle to conquer his stammer with Logue's help. These are some of the most wonderfully written scenes I have seen in film, as Logue manages to peel away the layers and reveal the roots of Albert's stammer. As Humphrey Bogart once said, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Through these scenes, we actually get to witness the birth and growth of a true friendship, one that is built on trust, courage and the need to overcome the challenge of being unable to speak publicly in a job that demands it.    Firth has already won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for this performance, and he will no doubt win once again at the Oscars. It is a tremendous performance that resonates strongly with anyone who has ever felt insecure or had stage fright.  Being put on the spot is never a fun experience, especially when you are addressing a nation that is relying on you for guidance at the onset of WWII.    Rush is equally brilliant in this film. He is an actor who can blend seamlessly into any roll he is asked to perform, from the Marquise de Sade to Peter Sellers, and Lionel Logue is a perfect fit. Rush's tone and delivery in every scene are marvelous. As Logue's confidence in his work and in Albert remains intact throughout the toughest of times, we see their relationship become deeper and more genuine each time they meet.    Pierce is terrific as Albert's unreliable brother, and brings an authentic nuance to their relationship which suggests that he has forced his own insecurities upon Albert, as in one particular scene when he reminds his stammering brother of a cruel childhood taunt, calling him \\"B-B-Bertie.\\"    Gambon is also very good as a father who couldn't understand his son, and wouldn't try to. In one scene, he commands Albert to just spit it out for the sake of not sounding like a fool, and thus risk tarnishing the royal name. It's a cruel world that Albert lives in, and Logue is his guardian.    \\"The King's Speech\\" is one of the best films of 2010.    GRADE: A-
B002OG5GT8|4.0|I read several places talking about using an amplifier like the E5 with low power devices such as phones, ipods, ipads, and even some computers. I've been using these with some Sennheiser over the ear headphones and they seem to do a good job so far. I really have no complaints, but perhaps to my non-audiophile ears... I really don't notice that huge of a change. But for this cheap of a price, you really can't go wrong.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|In 2004, a comedy troupe made up of five guys called \\"Broken Lizard\\" released what I thought was an absurdly funny spoof of horror movie conventions called \\"Club Dread.\\" A shape suddenly appears behind a character, and a loud music queue goes off making the audience jump, or a series of contrived twists turn the plot into Swiss cheese--\\"Club Dread\\" simultaneously mocked and embraced these kinds of traditions. Although as we can usually expect this protocol in most run-of-the-mill horror movies, never did I think that visionary director Darren Aronofsky would stoop to that level, and all but disregard the integrity and grit that he has layered into all of his previous films.    But I think I am getting ahead of myself. Aronofsky's new film \\"Black Swan\\" centers on Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a ballet dancer who is technically proficient, but lacks the raw emotional element of the craft. She lives with her mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), who once a dancer herself and now wants Nina to succeed farther than she ever could. Erica had to stop dancing after she got pregnant, and she now is the ultimate stage-mom, controlling every moment of her daughter's life and browbeating her when she questions her guidance.    Nina's other instructor in life is the suave, challenging Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel.) He casts Nina in the duel role of the White and Black swans in his new \\"stripped-down\\" production of Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake.\\" Leroy tells her that she is perfect for the White Swan, but that in order to play the Black Swan to perfection, she must let go and feel the passion and the intensity.  Perfection is the key word here. Aronofsky has called his new film \\"a perfect companion piece\\" to his previous film, \\"The Wrestler,\\" which, along with his previous three (\\"The Fountain,\\" \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" \\"Pi\\") also dealt with obsession and addiction. This time, Aronofsky tackles the obsession with perfection, and Portman is his puppet. After a rival dancer (Mila Kunis) arrives and seems to be out to get her, Nina slowly begins to deteriorate mentally and physically, as she descends into a downward spiral that only Aronofsky could possibly have envisioned.    Portman has received much acclaim for what many film critics have called the performance of her career.  I don't want to spoil what Aronofsky and crew have cooked up for a finale by talking too much about specifics in her performance, but in the final third, audiences can expect to discover a side of Portman that almost unrecognizable, as she seemingly goes to a dark and sinister place in her mind to become the duel role. Trained for almost a year to prepare for this role, and the hard work definitely shows. It is a stunning balancing act of technical and emotional skill, and she is superb.    Portman's performance is complimented by some very good supporting work from the always-terrific Cassel, Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis. Unfortunately, this is where the film becomes harder to discuss.    SPOILERS FOLLOW:  When talking about the characters and their intentions, the lines between reality and Nina's imagination become so profusely blurred that I am left asking myself, \\"Who cares?\\" I don't want to be asking that question, and I almost feel guilty considering how much I have admired Aronofsky's work in the past--\\"The Wrestler\\" was one of the best films of the past decade. But this time around, he has ventured into horror movie territory and fumbled the raw passion that Nina herself actually does finally realize with her final transformation, a stunning visual effect and an image that still haunts my mind.    I understand that this movie is pure melodrama, and that the stakes are raised to the nth degree in order to achieve the grandest of finales. We are shown absurd images of Nina's degenerating mental state, as her psychoses lead her to transform into the swan (an elongated neck here, bird legs there, black feathers all over), and it is a fascinating concept.  But the concept is immersed in heavy-handed symbolism and disconcertingly average \\"jump-scares\\" and other horror conventions that have no place here. I have given a lot of thought to the ending, and have decided that it works better than I originally concluded. This movie most certainly deserves a second look, but right now I think that it is Aronofsky's weakest outing yet.  END SPOILERS:    The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (another Aronofsky regular) is also worth mentioning, as it is the most distracting and irritating work he has done. That is a mouthful, considering that he worked on the erratically filmed \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" and \\"Pi.\\" He did not work on \\"The Wrestler,\\" but it seems as though he is trying to replicate that same style of following closely behind the main character wherever she goes. It is way too shaky this time around. I will say that the ballet scenes are wonderfully captured. Handheld cameras were used here to a greater advantage, so the dancers could be chased around as they flutter on and offstage, creating a wonderful flow of movement.      What works best in \\"Black Swan,\\" aside from the performances, is the wonderful use of Tchaikovsky's music, arranged and (I assume) remixed by the brilliant Clint Mansell, an Aronofsky regular whose work never fails to send chills up my spine. His music is like another character in the film, as it lives and breathes just like Nina does. Now if Aronofsky could have only managed to breathe a little more life into the film itself, it could have been far more interesting than this end product.       GRADE C-
0756404738|5.0|There really isn't much that needs to be said about Patrick Rothfuss and the first book in his New York Times bestselling series, The Name of the Wind. Anyone who is at all interested in books dealing with fantasy, magic, or amazing writing has heard the tale of this freshman writer who blew onto the publishing scene with such a ferocity that everyone stopped to take notice.<br /><br />Of course, what everyone also knows is that it has taken four years for the next book in the series, The Wise Man's Fear, to be released. Some lost interest in the series, others feared this day would never come, and reviewers feared it wouldn't be able to keep up with the hype that has built up over the years.<br /><br />But these fears turned out to be unnecessary. The Wise Man's Fear is a fantastic book that is just as good, if not better than its sensational prequel. The story takes readers on journeys past the University we grew so accustomed to in The Name of The Wind. Instead, we are shown our first glimpse of the fey with Felurian, we see the roots of Kvothe the bloodless, we travel to the ends of the earth to learn the art of Lethani from the famed Ademre, and most importantly we see Kvothe learn the name of the wind.<br /><br />Of course besides amazing travels and engaging plot lines, we are also introduced to even more engaging minor characters that help color in the details making the book into the masterpiece that it is. Besides this, fan's will love Kvothe's sarcastic yet endearing voice, the detailed yet gripping writing, and the ever evolving mystery of what happened to this once great man, that we all grew to love in The Name of The Wind.<br /><br />Fans should rejoice for the day has finally arrived for this fantastic sequel to grace our hearts and minds. Yes, this day was long in the making, but it has more than paid off. As The Wise Man's Fear is not only an incredible book, it is also one of the few books of any trilogy that is not merely a bridge between the first and last book, but is in its own right a fantastic book that all should read and cherish.
0307454541|2.0|This book disappointed me! I am surprised so many people found it enjoyable. The slow-building storyline drug on and on and on... the book didn't get interesting until 3/4 of the way through... and its a thick book.  I would've put it down and stopped reading it, but I have a complex about not finishing a book I started.  Wan't worth the effort.

Depth? to this season as the Tennant years that preceeded it, but it was enormously entertaining, and I like Matt Smith and the new companion so very much. It seems very smooth production-wise. Very much the distillation of the most successful elements of the last several seasons (or series as the case may be).
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I liked this movie, although it looked silly.  You can't really go wrong<br />with a cast like this.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, most of their movies<br />are good.<br /><br />This movie is unrealistic, just to let you know.  But, it is funny and<br />lots of action.  We watched it as a family and everybody liked it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This video is an absolute classic. This made an excellent gift for my wife on Valentine's Day. I even enjoyed watching it with her. (Of course, we didn't do all 6 hours in one sitting!) An excellent buy- great price. The characters are awesome and the actors do a great job. The BBC did an excellent job (though I can't say I've read the book so I can't compare how closely it adheres to the original story). Even a man can enjoy it. (If he's at least a little sentimental.)    Love it and can't wait for my daughter to see it when she's old enough to enjoy it :-)

B00000DOXS|3.0|Man, did you know in prog circles it is highly esteemed to make long songs instead of short songs? So if you were a prog band and wanted some 'prog-cred', then you'd go out and make an album of only long songs! None of this short song rubbish that Genesis were doing, what only a single 20 minutes song in their discography? They ain't prog! Yes, with their many exercises in making songs last over 15 minutes is a 'prog' band!!!! Now here's an idea, lets have a Long album with Long songs, Long song titles and ... give the album a BIG title with BIG BIG words. So you get 'Tales from Topographic Oceans', a big, long, double album. However, this album is actually considerably shorter than Genesis' 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway', at least by 12 minutes, but it feels much longer, mainly because 'Tales from \\"Topographic\\" Oceans' is a tedious exercise in longevity.     That said, this 1974 double album has some saving grace. Although the Yes albums surrounding it were almost solely focused on being complex, Tales is more about spirituality and exploration than complexity. Steve Howe's guitar work on 'Ancient: Giants under the sun' invokes images of Heavenly Beings and distant, far away places in the clouds. But the real opus here is 'Dance of the dawn; the revealing science of God' (remember, long song titles) it's so floaty and airy and pleasant, dripping in good-will and with a deeper knowledge of the placement of the stars and the moon. It's actually a very melodic song and has a catchy chorus, surely one of the best 20-minute songs going around. The other two songs are varying degrees of 'so-so', but 'Ritual, Nou Somme Du Soleil' is enjoyable for the most part.     Overall, the album is intriguing and keeps the attention of the listener because of the ability of the musicians involved to conjure up some great ideas, and because of the overall melodic mellowness to the whole thing. Worth picking up for a kind of 'experience'. Rating ***

B000B8657S|5.0|If, like me, you've wistfully stared at this box as one of the holy cornerstones of a good music collection, it's time to take action now. A particular vendor has somehow found the ability to offer this jewel for the insanely low price of $175, less than $4.40 per CD. If you check the prices of the individual CD releases from this collection, this is a huge deal. As long as that price remains available, all concerns about paper CD notes and the like fly by the wayside. With the money you save, you can buy [[ASIN:1901341003 The Schubert Song Companion]] as I did, as well as take advantage of Hyperion's PDF files that accompany each individual release on the Hyperion website in order obtain all of Mr. Johnson's notes. You can download every note on every CD now, people! Heck, you can even get every original issue's album cover and photoshop a collage, if you want to! So what complaints and/or excuses does that leave us? There may indeed be better interpretations of certain lieder on other CDs, but that's not why we're getting this set, is it? It isn't to provide a definitive version of these songs, but rather to lay the foundation upon which you can place your other recordings for added dimension and appreciation. I do this all the time where I create an itunes file with two different recordings of the same work. In forming an audial comparison, we greatly add to our understanding. For this same reason, I often turn to the contents of the Brilliant Classics Mozart box or their Bach box. It's time to make this investment in the art and understanding of one of song's greatest masters.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Eccentric. Musical. Classic.  Janelle Monáe's creative mind takes you to a place that you've never visited before.   Her strong vocals and message is the magic of this album.  A very transcendent album in which you time travel from 1950's to the future. I appreciate the quality of lyrical content that totally dismisses sexual references and vulgar language that continues to cloud the airways in this day and age.  This album gives you the opportunity to be contained by REAL MUSIC from beginning to end without interruption.  Thank you so much.  A true artist and visionary.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|Introduction: This is a film essay that is intended for only those people who have already seen the movie. There are some spoilers, so if you haven't seen the film yet, I suggest you quit reading this essay at once.   My intentions where to write something in the style of my all time favorite film commentary track, which exists in The Criterion addition of The Sam Pekinpah film Straw Dogs 1971. A scholar named Stephen Prince who specializes in violence in film gives what is in essence a master class on the subject while pointing out thousands of little subtleties playing beneath the narrative, the effect is simply brilliant. I feel that my film watching strengths also lie in observing such subtleties, and Let Me In is chock-full of them. The reason is that director Matt Reeves does not insult the intelligence of the viewer by trying to explain every little thing to them. At the same time he uses visual and character behavior to tell the story. This makes Let Me In a joy for the sophisticated movie watcher. For those of you who feel that my essay is self indulgent, I must remind you that self indulgence is simply self expression, and all I am really doing is working on sharpening my writing skills. I had submitted this review about three weeks ago without this introduction, but I noticed that some people didn't really understand what I was actually intending. I also removed two paragraphs that in hind sight where kind of like boulders in the flow of the stream. One was about the camera work in the scenes of violence, the other was about what a great expressive face Kodi Smit-McPhee has. Hopefully people will find this version of the film essay to be a bit easier to read. Regardless of how this is accepted, at least I will always know that I am proud of it. In the end that is what really matters, but I still secretly hope some of you enjoy this film essay anyway. Thank you.     Virginal Footprints in the snow,   Left there by a mysterious vision.  Came out of that black shape,  Like a black cape,  In answer to my invitation...    He might as well be on the moon.    The main character in Let Me In is a 12 year old by named Owen who lives alone with his mother in a low rent apartment complex. Since Owen is only a child, he lacks the developed ability to express the many levels of suffering and confusion he is currently feeling. Like Owen, the film hides most of its meaning beneath its narrative, suggesting many dark ideas without ever explaining any of them to the audience. Owen is a frail middle school student without a single friend in the world. He is a timid boy that is being systematically bullied by the toughest guys in his grade. Owen is often shown wearing this puffy metallic silver jacket that gives him the look of an astonaut, while in his bedroom, an entire wall is given over to a giant mural of the lunar surface. The implication is obvious, Owen might as well be on the moon himself. Even God and country have turned their backs on Owen. There is a rather subversive use of a Ronald Reagan speech in the opening section of the film in which the president is glorifying the supposed righteousness of all Americans simply for being born an American. This fallacy is echoed a few scenes later when Owen is shown reciting The Pledge of Allegiance in class. While the entire class is saying 'One nation under God' in unison, Owen is struck on the right arm by a giant spit ball right on th word 'God'. In a later scene, Owen tells his mother that he cut his face during a fall in the school playground, when in reality the alpha male bully Ken had whipped Owen across the cheek with a broken off radio antenna. Rather then do the parental work necessary to fully uncover the reality of her sons painful situation, his mother just tells Owen to be more careful next time and then immediately launches into the dinner prayer. In Owen's bleak world, God and country have become perverted insults that only further alienate him. Even when we do seehis mother up close her face is all out of focus, the rest of the time she is always shown from a distance. This visual depiction matches her near nonexistent parenting. Even Owen's father is nothing more then a voice on the other end of the phone that fails miserably to listen to what Owen is so desperately trying to tell him. Though none of these institutional and parental failing are ever being discussed anywhere in the dialogue itself, the audience still picks up on them through these various clues. The sad truth that is being revealed to us shows that like every other institution in Owen's life, his parents have done nothing for him at all, except to continually let him down.    Owen with Abby colored eyes.    Despite his ineffectuality, Owen has still managed to get himself into some disturbingly unsavory activities. In an act of transference Owen is shown bullying his own reflection at knife point in his bedroom mirror while wearing a clear plastic old man mask. It is a wonderfully ambiguous visual choice that suggest a number of intriguing possibilities. By wearing this mask over his face, is Owen being something that he is not, or is he being something that he might become in the future? This moment is immediately fallowed by the creepy business of spying on his various neighbors with his bedroom telescope. Since Owen is both interested and overwhelmed by the mysteries of sex, he quickly focuses his spying upon his sultry neighbor Virginia who is in the very beginning of make up sex with her boyfriend. Virginia is a strikingly beautiful woman in her mid 20's and is clearly the object of most of Owen's sexual fantasies. These various elements are laid bare without any narrative explanation, but beyond this, an even more curios visual effect takes place. The light shining back into Owen's eyes through the elongated telescope almost matches Abby's ghastly white vampire irises when she is in the throws of a feeding frenzy. This is a most ingenious visual cue, because it is at this point that Abby makes her first appearance in the film. From his bedroom window, Owen watches Abby get out of the passanger side of a moving van, at first she appears to be nothing more then a black silhouette. Then from out of this darkness emerges this cloaked angelic figure who proceeds to lead the way through the snow in her bare feet, looking for all the world like a homeless squatter. She is being fallowed by a 60 year old man who is struggling mightily with an oversized trunk held awkwardly in both arms. Through Owen's eyes we see much that is not revealed within the narrative itself, the most striking of which is that this barefooted child vagabond appears to be in charge of the old man.    Abby, the enternal adolescent.    It becomes clear when you watch the interaction between Abby and the 60 year old man, that the old man is still very much in love with her. He hates to disappoint Abby and is clearly jealous of her seeing 'that boy'. Abby and this old man have been a couple for a very long time, and their scenes together eerily answer the eternal quesion of how long Abby remains passionate with her human provider. Though their current situation seems to be that of a passive aggressive marriage rather then a fervid love affair, one gets the feeling that they have remained actively affectionate with one another a lot longer then one would care to think. What is clear is that Abby no longer seems physically attracted to her current boyfriend.   Just how long Abby has been a vampire is never really answered in the film, but we do know that she has been with the old man since he was a preteen himself, which is close to 50 years. Yet despite being possibly houndreds of years old, Abby still acts like a 12 year old kid, for one thing, she seems either unable or unwilling to provide for herself independently. This would all be fine if it wasn't for the fact that people keep dying around Abby at such an alarming rate. From the clues I gatheredfrom watching both versions of this story, I have come to the conclusion that on average 10 people have to die each month for Abby to live. It is also clear that it is her human provider who has to do all of the dirty work for her. This means that in all the years he has been with Abby, the old man has had to either kill or dispose of the bodies of roughly 6000 people.  Richard Jenkins who plays the old man in Let Me In is the person who came up with the idea of wearing a dark colored plastic trash bag over his head with cut out eye slits when he captures his victims. The visual effect is as horrifying as it is wickedly subversive. Whether aware of it or not, Richard Jenkins had made this character look exactly like a KKK member, only with an opposing color for the hood. The subversion digs even deeper in that Richard Jenkins is only shown killing white people in this film. Even his method of killing matches a KKK lynching exactly, except that much like the opposing color of his hood, his victims are strung up to a tree upside down by their ankles rather then right side up by their necks. From here he sets a large plastic jug with a funnel in its top underneath his strung up victim and then cuts their jugular to drain their life blood into this crude take home receptacle.  Seeing a Rubix Cube become the catalyst of Abby and Owen's courtship was a deeply satisfying moment for me, because I am someone who is able to solve the cube in under three mintues. It is in this scene that Abby decides to pursue Owen, yet even this apparent innocent budding romance can be looked at in a more sinister level. Abby just had a nasty fight with the old man who had returned home with an appetizer rather then a meal. During the arguement, the old man tells Abby that he has grown tired of killing and might be getting sloppy on purpose in order to get caught. This leaves the door wide open for debate as to whether Abby has really fallen in love with Owen, or whether this is just a set of calculated moves to manipulate Owen into thaking the old mans place on 'the day shift'.    Leopards can not change their spots.    If Owen's beautiful neighbor Virginia is his sex siren, then Abby is Owen's otherworldly virginal Goddess. Abby represents everything that is meaningful, eternal, nurturing, and magical in Owen's deficient existence. The contrast between these two feminine influences in Owen's life is greater emphasized by constantly showing Virginia in an ornamental subservient roll to her rugged boyfriend Larry. Not for one second do we ever see Abby in a subservient roll to anyone in this film. There is something ultimately twisted about Abby's attack on Virginia. Virginia is after all the object of Owen's lust. It is not just that The Madonna is killing The Whore in this scene, it is that Owen's Madonna is killing Owen's Whore. It only took being in close proximity of a few drops of Owen's blood for Abby to attack Virginia in such a state of uncontrollable animalistic bloodlust, that it makes her vampirism seem like some kind of unstoppable hormonal reaction to puberty. Like everything else in this film, the visceral nature of Virginia's attack also effects the viewer on a subconscious level due to its underlying symbolism. Abby leaps on Virginia from the top of a tree, and then bites into her throat immediately. This is the exact same method that a leopard utilizes when attacking an antelope in the wild. Virginia is also wearing a fur coat at the time of the attack which further depicts her as being a jungle cats prey. These visual choices makes the attack look just like something one would see on Wild Kingdom.   When Abby talks to Owen, her words carry the same kind of symbolic connotations. Everything Abby says can be taken as literal prophetic truth. When they first meet, Owen points at his bedroom window and nervously tells Abby where he lives. You can clearly see all the flustered emotion on his face. Owen is so instantaneously attracted to this mysterious cloaked little girl that he nearly falls apart in her presence. Instead of reciprocating his longing, Abby tells Owen that she can not be his friend. This is actually a much truer statement then we could have ever realized. When she tells Owen that if it comes down to it she will help him fight the bullies, she backs this statement up with all the force of an army. What this implies about her constant insistence to Owen that 'she is not a girl' and is in fact 'nothing', staggers the imagination. Was she making these statements simply because she is a vampire, or is she in fact implying that she has no sexual organs at all? If there is one thing we do know for sure about Abby, when she says something she generally more then means it.    Home is where you're currently living at the time.    There is a curios line of dialogue that forced me to examine whether it was a cinematic flaw that went unnoticed by the director. After Abby scales the outside of the hospital building, she taps on the window and asks her human provider if she can enter his hospital room. The old man is unable to speak due to the self inflicted acid burns on his face, so Abby has to remain outside in the cold. There is a scene a little later in this movie in which Abby proves her devotion to Owen by showing him what will happen to her if she enters his home uninvited. The scene sets a clear timeline for how long it takes for Abby to reveal her vampire nature involuntarily to an outsider. Within just 15 seconds, Abby begins to shake uncontrollably, then by half a minute blood starts to gush from all parts of her body at once. Owen ultimately proves his love for Abby by frantically granting her permission to be in his house. Owen then runs over and cradles Abby in his arms and asks if she would of died had he not of said anything. She replies.  \\"I knew you wouldn't let me.\\"  Though this scene is remarkable for managing to be both moving and alarming at the same time, the problem with it is, is that we see Abby enter four other buildings uninvited. One location was the front reception desk of the hospital, another was a convenience store, then there was the apartment complex recreation room, and finally the indoor pool at the middle school in which she entered through the skylight to save Owen during the films climax. This paradox is one I am willing to concede with the simple excuse of 'home is where you are currently living at the time'. By being hospitalized in intensive care, that hospital room had become the surrogate home for the old man. Abby was now unable to enter this 'living space' without his permission.  Another potential problem was Owen's discovery of the photo booth pictures that showed Abby and the old man when he was a 12 year old boy himself. Since the events depicted in this film are shown to be taking place in 1983, this would mean that those photo booth pictures where taken some time in the mid 1930's. The question is, did photo booths even exist in 1935? What I found was that the photo booth was invented in 1889 by a man named Matthew Stiffens, and where later mass produced throughout America on March 27th 1927 by The Photomation Company. The discovery of the photo booth pictures not only checks out, but is astoundingly accurate. Due to the relative freshness of this national phenomena, taking a phto booth picture would have been a very popular thing to do in 1935.  If there is one clear error in the film that I am not willing to concede for any reason, it's the lack of proper police procedure demonstrated by the police sergeant. He had been finding bloodless bodies for several weeks, and had even witnessed Virginia burst into flames in her hospital bed when she was hit by the morning sunlight. Even his one and only suspect had fallen ten floors to his death after mysteriously being drained of blood himself. About the only clue he had left to go on was that a 12 year old girl was somehow tied to all this murder and death. The problem occurs when he hears the floorboards creak from inside of Abby's apartment. He quickly draws his fire arm, yells police, kicks down the door, stalks through the house for a good three minutes finding evidence of the murder victims, before eventually finding Abby sleeping in the bottom of the bath tub. Yet in all this time, he never does the one thing that any real cop would have done first thing before doing anything else...Call for back up. I really wish that the film would of shown the sergeant lose or break his police radio during the raid to fix this one trouble spot in the film, because the rest of the movie is damn near perfect.    Evil needs love too.    Once Abby decides to pursue Owen you will notice that she never takes her eyes off of him, unless it's to coyly look down in alluring shyness when the conversation borders on what makes her tick. In their very first scene together the audience becomes fully invested in seeing them end up as a couple. Yet as captivatingly beautiful as their romance is, Owen is eventually going to have to provide blood for Abby, and we already know what that entails. It is equally disturbing that she enters Owen's bedroom window like a succubus mere moments after she drained the blood out of her last long term partner. How subversive is it that thier bedroom conversation seems so tender and innocent when considering all the other implications? Out of the two movies, I definitely prefer how this moment was covered in Let The Right One In. I really miss the 'Bulleri bulleri bock' Swedish children's guessing game thing in which Eli has Oskar guess how many fingers she is tapping him with. I also wish that Abby would of caressed Owen's shoulder and arm the way that Eli caressed Oskar's in Let The Right One In. I find it weak that Owen was wearing a shirt in this scene, unlike Oskar who was shirtless and quit possibly naked. There is something ultimately dementedly satisfying about watching Eli indulge herself on touchingthe silky skin of her prey. The consolation for me is that there are two fantastic versions of the same tale, and I just happen to be wise enough to love both of them equally for the different strengths that they bring to the table.   Even though the viewer can interpret the subtleties in this film many different ways, I still believe that Abby has ultimately fallen in love with Owen. Why else would she have offered to eat his human candy when she knew it would make her choke? There is a real attraction that Abby feels for Owen that goes far beyond necessity. However, it is still so disastrously sad that Abby isn't going to turn Owen into a vampire and stay with him forever. The real tragedy of this story is that Owen  is going to grow old on Abby and eventually outlive his usefulness. Maybe that is how her evil really works. For unlike Owen's parents, school, God, or country, Abby is never going to let Owen down. This is the whole essence of the story. For once in his miserable little life, someone is actaully willing to do what ever it takes to make him feel like he actually matters. Unfortunately for Owen, that someone just happens to be a living dead monster. But in the end, who could really blame Owen for loving Abby? When you really consider the amazing way in which she rescues him at the end of the film, there really is no Earthly reason for him to look back at all. As for Abby, who could blame her for loving Owen?...After all, romance is for the young, and evil needs love too.
B00377V6J2|5.0|This album is well worth having in any collection, due to it's excellent sound and the live recording of these songs. Next you can't argue with the fact that two of the greatest blues guitarists to ever influence generations of guitarists : Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughan, are playing so well together, that this album is way above a compliation of jamming tracks. Every song is a pearl, and worth listening to, and this album is one of the best!

0393061310|4.0|This book is about a few of my favorite things, as well as some of my favorite things to kill (er...the microbes). Diamond wrote \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\" in response to \\"Yali,\\" a New Guinean politician who once inquired \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" Historically, colonizing despots, theologians, and scholars, alike, have answered such questions with \\"superior genes, superior deity, and superior culture, naturally.\\" Diamond, meanwhile, painstakingly investigates how incidental factors, such as geography, weather, resource availability, and prior antigen exposure, are the primary determinants of the success and failure of civilizations.<br /><br />For one, latitudinal contiguity allows for a rough climate homogeneity, meaning that chicken, rice, apricots, and peaches from China and millet and cumin from Central Asia were able to rapidly diffuse across the so-called \\"Fertile Crescent\\" and become Roman staples. Hitchhiking along with these adaptable seeds and domesticable creatures were the wheel, metalworking techniques, beer and wine production, and other fundamentals of the good life. And then, Ducatis and Brunellos were born. In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa's latitudinal orientation, with its significant variations in average temperatures and day-length schedules, allowed for little cross-adaptability of temperamental plant and animal species. Nor did the presence of an almost 10 million km of desert, replete with sandstorms and dust devils, help foster neighborly exchange. Similar challenges in the South Pacific and the Americas made it difficult for certain groups to shift from being hunter-gatherer nomadic groups to farmers who are linked to and can invest in their land. And groups required to invest all their time obtaining food are unable to develop stratified societies with labor further divided among people who shipbuild, swordsmith, or songwrite for their supper.<br /><br />Diamond acknowledges that both abundance and necessity can be the parental units of invention. As mentioned above, agricultural wealth allowed for the leisure time and population growth that breed strapping young tinkerers. However, Diamond also cites populations that, despite relative wealth, developed or even reverted to elementary technologies, simply because they had no impetus to maintain sophisticated systems. For example, 10,000 years ago, when flooding at the Bass Strait separated Tasmanians from Mainland Australians, the Tasmanians, unencumbered by the pressures of competing tribes, gradually lost knowledge of pre-existing technologies, which may have included fishing, awls, needles, and perhaps even the boomerang! Thus, writes Diamond, \\"When finally encountered by Europeans in A.D. 1642, the Tasmanians had the simplest material culture of a people in the modern world.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, the arrangement of letters in the QWERTY keyboard is due to a conspiracy concocted by THE MAN in 1873, to ensure that users push keys as slowly as possible, lest the typewriter become jammed. And yet, the lack of urgent Darwinian selective pressure means that this anachronistic design strategy remains the primary keyboard layout used to command the Cray XT5. Ultimately, it is difficult to know why some civilizations flourish and others flounder. However, Jared Diamond reminds us never to ascribe to stupidity that which is adequately explained by dumb luck.Diamond acknowledges that both abundance and necessity can be the parental units of invention. As mentioned above, agricultural wealth allowed for the leisure time and population growth that breed strapping young tinkerers. However, Diamond also cites populations that, despite relative wealth, developed or even reverted to elementary technologies, simply because they had no impetus to maintain sophisticated systems. For example, 10,000 years ago, when flooding at the Bass Strait separated Tasmanians from Mainland Australians, the Tasmanians, unencumbered by the pressures of competing tribes, gradually lost knowledge of pre-existing technologies, which may have included fishing, awls, needles, and perhaps even the boomerang! Thus, writes Diamond, \\"When finally encountered by Europeans in A.D. 1642, the Tasmanians had the simplest material culture of a people in the modern world.\\"    Similarly, the arrangement of letters in the QWERTY keyboard is due to a conspiracy concocted by THE MAN in 1873, to ensure that users push keys as slowly as possible, lest the typewriter become jammed. And yet, the lack of urgent Darwinian selective pressure means that this anachronistic design strategy remains the primary keyboard layout used to command the Cray XT5. Ultimately, it is difficult to know why some civilizations flourish and others flounder. However, Jared Diamond reminds us never to ascribe to stupidity that which is adequately explained by dumb luck.
B002OT731E|5.0|This was another great live recording! Made somewhere in Europe. Some were recorded in the studio some were live, all were great.This is the best example of latter Stones live records in my opinion. Although now it was 16 yrs ago. Thats 4 Stones yrs for those keeping up. I Won't go through track by track but Wild horses and Let it Bleed are awesome. So is Dead Flowers. Hell the whole damn thing  is great. Pick it up if you don't own it. hope this helped.
0756405890|5.0|Loved it! I read all sorts of fantasy and scifi. I was looking for a good long book to occupy my time and I picked this up purely for the volume of it. It was wonderful. A different way to tell a story. I can't wait until tomorrow for the next one.
B004HO6HWA|2.0|I don't understand hollywoods deal with remaking every movie they can think of. The original was fine and this movie has very little to do with the original. An assassin starts training a kid. That's about all they have in common. That's what I don't get, why even bother calling it a remake. Just make a new movie.    The original seemed to focus more on the details of the hit while this movie just focused on the death scene for the most part. And god forbid that every movie not end with a happy ending. Sometimes the good guy/main character dies, it keeps things interesting. Which is one of the things that made the original better.    It's worth the $1 rent but not worth buying.
B001GCUER0|4.0|Plenty of variety.  Good acting.  Too much smoking and drinking, but that's the way it was back then.  Women treated as second class citizens.  Philanderers all over the place.  Life on Madison Avenue much different than life in the hinterlands.  Well worth the time to watch.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Inside job is a masterful documentary, and is going to do a lot to wake people up. However Ferguson is misleading in my opinion in the following respect: because he doesn't quite go far enough to rip away the curtain concealing the ADDITIONAL culprits.  The Global financial cartel, a.k.a. the Inter-Alpha Group at the center, is not just Wall Street. The bubble is truly international with enormous derivatives and other speculation continuing to hyperbolically grow as long as we bail. But the Titanic is going down without question and cannot be bailed out. Impossible. The bubble is hundreds of times larger than any real wealth existing or to be created any time soon. SECONDLY FERGUSON LET'S GEORGE SOROS, a mega speculator looter off the hook. And somehow he makes the IMF look like nice guys. AIN't SO McGEE! THEY ARE PART OF THE SAME PROBLEM, enforcing IMF Austerity is genocidal.  Without Glass-Steagle being reimplemented we are never getting out of the continuing collapse because as long as we continue the bailout the economy will continue to be cannibalized. Not to mention the Global hyperinflation which is the underlying the food shortages throughout the world getting worse. CAUSING THE MASS UPHEAVALS TOPPLING IMF-emforcing regimes. We require an alliance of the leading nation states of the planet, namely USA CHINA RUSSIA INDIA plus others to agree to a new system for development where the nations retain sovereignty but agree to development cooperation on a very large scale. BUT,  We won't get out of the global breakdown without GLASS-STEAGLE reenactment, and this on a GLOBAL SCALE BY any nation that wishes to survive. The DEBT structure will not be paid -- because it could not ever be paid. THIS REALITY IS STILL NOT SINKING IN COMPLETELY, ESPECIALY IN CONGRESS. We have to bankrupt the system globally. Known as the BRITISH EMPIRE SYSTEM OF FREE TRADE, for it has failed and can't be put back together any more than HUMPTY DUMPTY. NAWAPA has to be implemented next andthe FEDERAL RESERVE essentially nationalized in bankruptcy reorganization. CONGRESS CAN and MUST DO THIS IF WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT CONTROLLED BY WALL STREET AND THE BRITISH EMPIRE. THANK YOU CHARLES FERGUSON FOR PROVOKING THIS DEBATE.
0316010669|2.0|Most people have always grown up with the belief that good decisions require planning, and lots of time to take in details. Malcolm Gladwell, writer for New Yorker and best-selling author of The Tipping Point, Outliers, and What the Dog Saw: and Other Adventures suggests we do not give our own intuitions enough credit.   Blink shows us the many times where split-second decisions have ended in positive results. Gladwell shows us scenario after scenario of times when our intuition gave us the ability to make accurate decisions.   In one example, Gladwell talks about a musician named Kenna. Immediately upon hearing ten seconds of Kenna's music, Craig Kallman, co-president of Atlantic Records, decided the Kenna's music may have a home with his company. In the end, Kallman didn't rely on his sixth sense and decided research Kenna's selling ability. Though Kenna already had a small fan base, according to the research apparently the selected audience seemed very unexcited to hear anymore of Kenna's music and Kallman never signed him.  Through the example, Gladwell poses the question that perhaps if the Kallman had listened to his instincts instead of doing a load of research Kenna may have proved to be a pretty successful artist.   The book consists mostly of more examples among these lines, constantly showing how some of the best decisions have been without having to give them much thought. The idea is very interesting, and the first few chapters and examples are very thought provoking. However, the book quickly digresses into heap of repetitive examples. The book leaves us convinced but confused, without any explanations of how or why our brains make good quick decisions. After awhile the book became difficult to read.   The book seemed very good overall. It has very exciting ideas. However, I believe that it could use some more insight and fewer examples. This book entertains the audience and will leave the reader wanting to know more.
0316098337|5.0|I enjoyed reading this absolute page-turner. Jack has to be my favorite little boy in all of fiction! And I can't think of a protagonist I admire more than his mother. Buy a copy for yourself and a friend. You'll be glad you did!
0756404738|1.0|I do not understand why people defend things that hurt themselves. Overpricing on kindle is one of them and this one is a prime example why I am giving it this rating. If you think the author has no options on what the price will be on his book than you do not know anything about it so please dont come off your high horse saying they dont warrant a low rating because of the price. The funny thing is I would not have even posted at all except I saw how many people were attacking the other raters who gave low stars. It is free speech it is their opinion anyone can post whatever and wherever they want....the point is THEY are hoping this is an effective avenue to MAKE THE DAMN POINT. Anyone attacking raters really needs to take a chill pill and should understand what is making the raters unhappy. Do you see the author coming here and defending himself? How do they justify having the cost of the Ebook equal the cost of an actual hard cover edition?     On to the positive side I loved the first book. I wish the author would write a bit more maybe even some short stories. Sad to say though I will hold off purchasing it because of the price it just does not sit well with me. Just a tactic of people trying to squeeze more money out of the world. If it wasnt so blatantly done, but that is my point if nobody complains now then the price you are paying wont be so blaringly offensive in the future.
142313494X|4.0|I remember telling several people how much I disliked the \\"Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief\\" movie and they all said the same thing - read the books.    They were right.  The books are a blast to read.  Writer Rick Riordin writes for middle school students but he does not talk down to them.  That means adults can  enjoy them too.  Percy is a half blood - his mother is human but his father is a Greek God.  After introductory matter, the story becomes a quest adventure, but this one covers a lot of ground in a relatively short space.    The story jumps from one adventure to another, but with more than enough breathing space to develop characters and fill in the mythological background.  Riordin also does not shy away from the less famous mythological characters and beasts, and he is not afraid to throw in an occasional Greek word or two.      Where the movie indulged too much in special effects and some adult humor, the books are witty and ingeniously constructed.  I especially like some of the tongue in cheek chapter titles like \\"I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom\\" and \\"I Accidentally Vaporize my Pre-Algebra Teacher\\"  Isn't that something every middle school student dreams of?    It is true that there is more than a little whiff of \\"Hogsworth\\" hovering over these stories, complete with a school/camp invisible to humans and a plethora of magical items.  But Percy has enough of his own identity to stand on his own.  Also, for all their power, the Greek Gods can be pretty dense at times (on the other hand, if they knew everything, there would be no story).      This series could make one re-read all those old textbooks on Greek mythology all over again.  I am looking forward to following Percy and his friends on the remaining four books in this adventure.    For those who have seen the movie and not read the book - not only is the book better, there are some significant differences in the story line.  I will not give anything away, but some of the villains and background story was changed or completely ignored by the movie.  If they do continue the movies, I seriously wonder how they will fill in this missing and altered information.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am pretty sure I'm going to quit my gym membership... this DVD's workout gets me the same work out in 20 mins that I do in an hour and a half at the gym (your always taking so much time to switch machines, etc)!!! very intense, I am a military member and have gotten WAY out of shape over the holidays (oops) and need to lose about 10 lbs to get to a good weight, but want to lose 30 overall. I consider myself to be at a medium fitness level, and this workout is hard! it WILL get you results though, the things jillian does in her workouts is the same concept of the exercises we did in basic training. I am a single parent in full time college, and I work after school, so I am always short on time. with this DVD I can do a 20 min workout equivalent to like I said before, about an hour or more in the gym! thanks jillian!  p.s... I was a little hesitant to buy this dvd, I dont like Jillian in the biggest loser some times, but her DVD is awesome!

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES is bad.  Trainwreck bad, the kind of awful you can't look away from.  The narrator is the most flagrant Mary Sue I've run across in a loooooong time.  First we find out that she's a tenured professor at Yale at the age of 35.  Anyone who knows anything about getting tenure is probably already laughing, but if the process is unfamiliar that's kind of like saying she achieved world peace or found Atlantis.  Really, really unlikely.<br /><br />But it's not enough that she's the wunderkind scholar of her generation.  No, she's also the greatest witch of her generation.  Her mother and father were two of the most powerful witches in their day, and now Mary Sue...er...that is, Diana gets to be as powerful as they were combined.<br /><br />She's also a star athlete, super hot, and, oh yeah, she's got mysterious otherworldly eyes that are like five different colors!  Her hair too!<br /><br />A superwoman like Diana ought to be up for some pretty major challenges - it would take something pretty epic to give her a run for her money - which is why it's so very, very strange that NOTHING HAPPENS.  I mean, NOTHING.  The \\"plot\\" (and I use that term verrrrry loosely) gets rolling when Diana calls an enchanted manuscript up from the bowels of the Bodlean Library in Oxford: Ashmole 782.  She's trying to deny her magical heritage, so even though she can tell the book is more than it seems she just takes a peek and sends it back.<br /><br />It turns out that supernatural creatures of all sorts have been trying to get their hands on Ashmole 782 for more than a hundred years.  They can't call it up, they can't open it - the enchantment is too powerful, it defeats everyone but Diana.  So now all these scheming supernatural creatures start scheming after Diana, hoping to use her in order to gain access to this book.<br /><br />So what happens next?  Well, let's see.  She goes rowing.  She takes a run.  She goes out to breakfast.  She has lunch.  She goes to yoga class.  I don't mean that she thinks to herself, \\"I'll go out for a run,\\" but before her run is over, something dramatic happens to further the plot.  Oh no.  When she goes for a run, she clocks her miles and gets home without incident.  Same with the rowing and the yoga and the lunch.<br /><br />So back to the main plot.  She calls the book and opens it within the first couple of chapters.  She doesn't try to look at it again until about 25% of the way through the book.  Does anything dramatic happen between the beginning and the 25% mark?  Well...she has a couple of tense conversations, does that count?  And she meets her boyfriend.<br /><br />Speaking of the boyfriend, Matthew...well, don't get your hopes up for an exciting romance.  Here is a quote, totally in context, where the narrator gushes about how great her relationship with Matthew is: \\"This was so different from books and movies, where love was made into something tense and difficult.\\"  She is NOT KIDDING.  There is NO tension.  They meet, they're soulmates, the end.<br /><br />Once Matthew takes over, all Diana ever seems to do is sleep and eat.  There is one passage that made me laugh out loud.  Matthew has been away accomplishing things and he's due home, so Diana is \\"determined to be waiting when he pulled up.\\"  OK!  Now we've got some courage and strength on display!  She's determined to be waiting!  The very next sentence begins, \\"First I waited in the salon on a sofa by the fire...\\" and the next couple of pages describe all the other ways she waited.  Nothing interrupts her, nothing distracts her.  She really spends the afternoon waiting, and we're really expected to read about it.<br /><br />I could go on and on.  A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES is like a pinata, in a way, I just want to keep bashing at it.  There's just SO MUCH to dislike.  Like, imagine all the \\"spoilers\\" I'm not spoiling in my review (hint: there aren't many, because NOTHING HAPPENS).herself, \\"I'll go out for a run,\\" but before her run is over, something dramatic happens to further the plot.

B003OC99HQ|3.0|Perhaps i have seen it too many times on DVD. I have only seen it a few times, but after watching it again after several years, i found the pace slower than i remembered and i think the composer used too much piano music.<br />I got tired of hearing that piano over and over again. I think this film has great lightning effects, like the many different colours that is used in this film.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4/5<br /><br />I think it`s an improvement over the old Anchor Bay DVD that i have. I found that the colours looks more sharper and detailed + vibrant. This is how the colours should look like.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 3.5/5<br /><br />I saw this film with the English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. I must say i found this remix disappointing. First of all, i think the bass when we hear the theme song twice (you know the one in the end credits), sounds a bit canned. I think it lacks bass. Too bad, because when i saw Arrow Video`s BD of City of the living dead, with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track, it sounded much better in my opinion.<br /><br />At least the theme song there i think did not sound canned or lacked any bass. Hm. Apart from the canned sound of the theme song and lack of bass, i think it sounds only good. Strange thing, the flames we hear, i think have good, but not great bass. The sounds of the flames had more bass than the theme song.<br /><br />I thought the 5.1 audio track would at least sound just as good as Arrow Video`s BD of City of the living dead. I hope their future Blu-rays with DTS-HD MA 5.1 will sound better than this films audio track. If they sound as good as their BD of City of the living dead, i will be happy to buy Blu-rays from them.<br /><br />film: 3.5/5<br />Overall: 3.5/5
B001FB55L2|3.0|Filmakers are starting to make hay with stories from the past 10 years of America's wars in the Middle East. Here, it's the age-old tale of two brothers, one bad and one good, who end up dueling over a woman and only one can come out a winner. There's a side plot involving some torture in Afghanistan. Really, only Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good acting job here. Tobey Maguire comes off as too shell shocked and blank for most of the film. Natalie Portman is neither here nor there as the long-suffering military wife. The end is unsatisfying.
B003OY91HW|5.0|I was skeptical buying this, because there were some negative reviews about the cupcakes. They don't come out dry, in fact they are light and moist. I am not a cupcake fan, because they are usually too dense. I have never had a better cupcake in my life. The recipes are rich, but each one is outstanding. I was actually afraid to spend the money on all of the ingredients only to turn out a flop. Hasn't happened yet. I have tons of cookbooks from all reputable authors and chefs. These recipes are actually easier than most, and the results are really to die for. And the funny thing is that I went to the Magnolia Bakery in NYC, and I actually prefer the homecooked stuff better.

0061726826|5.0|After hearing how wonderful this book was about a zillion times, I picked up \\"Delirium\\" when I found it for a good price.  I have been readaing a lot of dystopian fiction and I wasn't sure I was really ready to read another one so soon, but I started the book anyway.  I am very suprised that \\"Delirium\\", in my opinon, lives up to the hype.<br /><br />I thought the book started off pretty strong with all the ever-so important world building. I was interested in Lena and her family.  Lena is living with her aunt, uncle and younger cousins.  Her mother died years ago...from a disease.  Love.  The cure, performed as a surgery, is mandatory for everyone as they become an adult.  Lena is counting down the days.  After all, everyone is happy once they have had the cure.  No more emotional feelings and ups and downs.  Everyone is content and obeys the society they live in.<br /><br />Then things start to happen that changes Lena's view of the surgery.  She starts to see things that the government has done and is doing.  Then she meets Alex.  Alex isn't what he seems and Lena soons finds herself seeing a whole new world through him.<br /><br />The book does lose a little pacing in the middle. It never was truly boring but a few times my mind started to wonder.  But with \\"Delirium\\" even the smallest details could later come out to be a big deal.  And the last third was absolutely amazing.  At first I wasn't sure I 'felt' the romance between Lena and Alex but man was I convinced toward the end.  He truly gets Lena to see with new eyes and to value the little freedoms she doesn't have.<br /><br />The ending is a horrible cliffhanger.  They used to bother me more than they do these days and I guess thats because they are so common now in fiction, especially YA fiction.  I actually cried tears at the end of this book and I haven't done that since \\"The Hunger Games\\".  (Also, besides being Dystopian fiction, there is nothing similar about the two books, and thats a positive thing, although I loved both).  Plus I know I will be right there to read the next volume.I know I will be right there to read the next volume.
B003UESJFG|2.0|I love animated movies and was particularly interested in this one due to the high profile actors, but is was extremely disappointing to the point of giving me a headache.<br /><br />The story is a good one, but it never really gels enough for anyone to care.  Finally, the viewer never buys into pulling for any of the characters.  This is a major flaw.  Who cares which characters make a surprise comeback as you didn't care when they left in the beginning.  Plus, was Megamind that terrible to begin with?  Maybe, but you had to search for clues to find out if you cared or not.  Again, great story line but poorly developed.
B00000DGXN|3.0|Individually, I love all these players. Here, they join forces for the first time. Nothing wrong. Nothing especially notable either, especially when compared with the best work of each man individually. None of the tunes stick. It's all very smooth. Great background music. You won't look up from whatever else you are doing as you listen, though...Worth buying? Yes, for background music.
B0013GH9AO|3.0|Em is the saving grace of this album as far as emcees go... of course the production is solid but the lyrics are lacking and dated(self serving and ego centric). One can always argue, \\"yeah but it's a classic\\"... sure, any album that received as much airplay as this one is a classic(hell Bobby Brown is classic), but that doesn't make it amazing. What is amazing is the credit people are willing to hand out to these commercial rappers just because their record labels own the airwaves. I'm not saying I don't like a few songs on this album, but front to back it is fairly average in comparison to underground West Coast Hip Hop. I give it three stars because thats the front to back truth of the matter(now, in 2001 that might have been a different story), that being said, I do like Dre and his entire crew much more than the \\"we're so cool\\" rappers of the new mainstream drowning out our radios with their repetitive malarkey. Hopefully these guys make a swift comeback, but don't lie and say they're old work is better than it really is. You want to hear a good representation of west coast Hip Hop, check out Blu and Exile \\"Below the Heavens\\"... thats a way better album by far.
B001HQZKF6|5.0|...It's hard to put such wonderful sound and images in just a few words... but there is a unique sense of wholeness and refinement on this delivery that makes this BD/concert simply the very best I have ever heard of The Police... truly amazing sound from three absolutely wonderful musicians which became the very best paid musicians on the year of this performance... even after 20+ years gone... Simply incredible...<br /><br />...The BD sound is pretty deep (at least 96Khz of sampling rate as reported by my PS3/Onkyo setup), and it is certainly a tough balancing act between capturing the openess and depth of stage-sound, as well as the crispness of up-close listening... Overall a pretty good job, and recording levels are there for you to crank-up the volume as much as you can handle (could not notice clipping/chopping, etc.) High-frequencies seem slightly muted, but, again, emphasis is put on reproducing the \\"ambient\\" rather than individual/up-close sounds.<br /><br />...This BD/Concert also represents among the best memories of an era that is highgly regarded by many of us, and \\"Wrapped Around Your Fingers\\" seals such era with absolutely gorgeous sound, talent and sensitivity.<br /><br />A must-have, an all-time keeper.<br /><br />Enjoy!

0756404738|4.0|[This review is based on an Advanced Reading Copy - 1109 pages.  Please note I also own a final copy of the book.]<br /><br />\\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" is book 2 of Patrick Rothfuss' \\"Kingkiller Chronicles\\" series and continues directly where \\"The Name of the Wind\\" left off.  Kvothe, the orphaned Edema Ruh and childhood prodigy grows up quite a bit in this coming of age tale.  Unlike \\"Name of the Wind,\\" the back teaser of \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" is completely accurate.  All things mentioned occur in the book, which was one of my gripes with the teaser of the first title.  Kvothe continues to search for answers about the death of his parents, the Amyr, the Chandrian.  Taking a term off from the University, sponsored by Count Threpe, Kvothe travels to the kingdom of Vintas in search of the patron which he is still lacking.  Of course things don't go exactly as planned in Vintas and once again Kvothe becomes involved in turbulent and potential deadly treachery against a prominent Vintish lord.  Kvothe also ventures deep into the foreboding northern forest of Eld in search of bandits.  It's in the Eld where he stumbles across the insatiable Felurian of the Fae, ventures to her realm of existence, learns many secrets and lives to tell about it.  Finally, he travels to the land of Ademre where he's put on trial by the famed and reclusive Adem mercenaries.  I'm happy to say that the continuation of this character driven fantasy is grand, epic and largely an improvement over \\"Name of the Wind.\\"  Here are my thoughts on Wise Man's Fear;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Extremely well written and edited.  An improvement on the first book which is indeed impressive.<br /><br />+ Introduction of some new and interesting characters as well as more back story of previous favorites (Elodin, Devi, Auri, Manet, Bast).  New personalities I enjoyed were Tempi and Vashet (Adem mercenaries), Marten (Hunter/woodsman mercenary) and of course Felurian (legendary Fae woman).<br /><br />+ More action this time around as Kvothe travels around the land.  There's one particular action sequence with the bandits of Eld forest which I thought was remarkably well done and really showcased Rothfuss' talent.<br /><br />+ More interaction with travelling Tinkers.<br /><br />+ Lengthy and engrossing story.<br /><br />+ Gorgeous cover art.<br /><br />+ Semi-cliffhanger ending<br /><br />Cons &lt;CONTAINS SPOILERs!  Read at your own risk><br /><br />- Kvothe continues to be a cocksure and arrogant a$$.  Humility is not one of his strong points if it's even a point at all.  As I mentioned in my \\"Name of the Wind\\" review many times this made him a rather unappealing main character and it was difficult to pity him during unfortunate times.  A quote from one of the characters in \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" summed it up best when they said to Kvothe, \\"You, are one great gaudy showboating b*stard, you know that?  Get over yourself, you melodramatic a$$.  You can fool them, but not me.\\"<br /><br />- The same incomplete and undetailed world map is used. I continued to reference the map to get a better understanding where the places being mentioned were. Unfortunately, the majority of the time they weren't listed anywhere, rendering the map largely useless.  For example, I still have no idea where \\"The Waystone Inn\\" is or where in Vintas the city of Severen is.<br /><br />- The sea voyage to Vintas is completely skipped.  It's stated that the story is omitted because there were other more important stories that needed to be told.  Yet, it's stated that Kvothe endured a storm, piracy, treachery, shipwreck, drowning and robbery.  I'm not sure about you but I definitely would have liked to read about those things.<br /><br />- Nearly 2000 pages of Kvothe courting his love interest Denna and they have yet to even kiss.  The whole relationship is becoming a bit tiresome.  Not to mention how often they conveniently bump into each other while travelling around the corners of civilization.<br /><br />- Narrative can sometimes slow to a crawl.<br /><br />- Some predictable parts.<br /><br />- Semi-cliffhanger ending<br /><br />Fans of \\"Name of the Wind\\" will not be disappointed with \\"Wise Man's Fear.\\"  If you didn't enjoy the first book then you'll most likely want to skip this one as some may consider it more of the same.  While I don't consider this series the best fantasy I've ever read I do enjoy it, particularly for its characters.  Much like the first book it's not an action packed high adventure which will turn some fantasy readers off.  And as I mentioned in my review of \\"Name of the Wind\\" you can easily draw a few unoriginal comparisons to Harry Potter and other similar novels.  However, Rothfuss skillfully and slowly unravels the stories of Kvothe's legendary rise to fame in a way that's delightful to read.  I think fans will be more than satisfied after their four year wait.  Hopefully it won't be another four years for the final installment of the trilogy, tentatively titled \\"The Doors of Stone.\\"tive can sometimes slow to a crawl.<br /><br />- Some predictable parts.<br /><br />- Semi-cliffhanger ending<br /><br />Fans of \\"Name of the Wind\\" will not be disappointed with \\"Wise Man's Fear.\\"  If you didn't enjoy the first book then you'll most likely want to skip this one as some may consider it more of the same.

1401300529|4.0|My Dad served in Korea attached to a MASH unit as a medic/lab technician. I bought the book for him as a gift and eventually read it myself. While I had read various other books on American history that covered the time period and the war in general, this is the first book I read devoted exclusively to it.  I'll need to view others.  My Dad did not talk much about the war, other than to say he enjoyed a few leaves in Japan and to express the sadness/guilt he felt when he learned his bunkmates were killed while he was away...always with the sad sense of \\"there but for fortune...\\".    The treachery of the Korean terrain and weather are well documented, particularly from the perspective of the foot soldier.  Halberstam is excellent conveying settings, personalities, army and civilian politics, and the main characters including Truman and McArthur.  Other's have commented that the book is unfair to McCarthur, which I don't share, though it is highly critical of him.  I'm a long way from the knowledge required to give an informed answer, but the book's appraisal is consistent with much of what I've read elsewhere.  In hindsight, McArthur should have been relieved much earlier as his whole command was dysfunctional and his position as emporer of Japan cut him off from the reality in Korea.    Per my reading, the main characters in the book are the winter and the terrain, and you can almost feel the bitter cold and the miserable slogs the troops endured up and down the peninsula. The decrepid state of the state of armed forces and our equipment following the WWII demobilization is well documented, which explains the poor showing of US forces early on in the conflict.  McArthur's ingenious leapfrog behind the enemy at Inchon just when it looked like we might get pushed into the sea is readily acknowledged and praised.  However, the brinkmanship of McArthur going too far north (contrary to orders)and without the necessary forces and intelligence, results in the last thing needed, an all-out invasion by the Chinese, which McArthur thought would never happen yet seemed all to eager to provoke.  Once it was belatedly recognized that the Chinese were full in, the desire of McArthur and others to use air power and the full weight of our atomic arsenal inside China is frightening and the best proof ever for the importance of civilian control.       The brutal fighting and heroism of all parties is acknowledged, and I felt horror, pity, sadness and admiration for our men and the tribulations they endured...and similar respect for our enemies.  The book can be a little dizzying when it bounces from big picture to small and back again, as numerous characters seem to come under scrutiny in considerable detail, which leaves you struggling to remember them for appearances later in the narrative that don't materialize. Though the view of the war from the fighting soldiers perspective far overrides this concern.    I confess, I like Halberstam and his world view, and \\"The Best and the Brightest\\" (regarding the Vietnam War) was one of the most important books I read in college.  This book on Korea helped me appreciate what my father had been through (yet reluctant to talk much about), and now I understand his reticence. There are many sweet things in life, and it's sad but true that we constantly need to be reminded that dying in battle isn't one of them.  The possibility to create heroes in war should only happen after intense reflection, fact gathering, assessment of interests, honesty about the risks, and the informed consent of \\"we, the people\\" and our representatives.  Based on this book, I believe we did do the right thing in Korea. As for our current involvements, much less so.
B003L20ICE|1.0|The story was not bad, until the last 10 minutes, in which the guy was the only one who was condemned and held responsible, while the Moore character who started the affair, went back to her relationship without a problem or any consequences. Who the hell wrote this story?<br />I was baffled AND disgusted by the sheer hatred against the man, that's displayed in it. My stomach got totally upset.<br />I've never seen anything as cold and cruel. I really wish I could flush this story from my memory. Minus 5 stars for this one.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|Duh! This movie is just Awesome. I wore out my dvd so I got the bluray on sale super cheap! Thanks Amazon!!!
B001BNFR6W|1.0|The Will and Grace series is wonderful in itself; however, the CDs are of poor quality.  I had to return the set once because several of the discs were scratched out of the box new!  I exchanged for another set and the same thing happened with them.  I honestly think the problem is with the way the discs are removed and put back into the cases.  I think that is what is scratching them.  The covers are hard cardboard and too tight for the discs.  Both of my sets were new so I don't believe I received them like that.  I believe the problem will be the same with all of them.  If you do buy the set store them in another type of protective sleeve right away.
0756404738|5.0|Just as captivating as its predecessor, brilliant plot, characterization and prose. There's not really much to say if you liked/loved the first book then you'll like/love this; and for any new comers don't ruin the Kingkiller chronicles for yourself you have to start at book one (the name of the wind).     I just hope the writing practice has made Patrick faster or we've all got another long fours years ahead.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I will make this brief and to the point. First, ignore any reviews that do not give this 4 to 5 stars. Second, if you love or even like the Stones order this DVD immediately. This is that rare glimpse of the Rolling Stones in their legendary prime, having just recorded \\"Exile\\". This means the superb Mick Taylor on guitar playing at the top of his game, the great Nicky Hopkins on piano (unfortunately they practically never show him, but as other reviews have noted the 70s camera work does leave something to be desired), Keef, the subtly in-control bandleader, Bobby Keyes wailing on sax, Charlie Watts drumming brilliantly - better than I have ever heard him, and Mick roaring fantastic vocals seemingly from an endless sea of life force (that continues to this day).So really, do yourself a favor. By the time this one ends, you'll be knocked out. And during this era, yes, they were the greatest rock and roll band in the world.
0545265355|5.0|I could not put any of these books down, I read the first two for school and loved them so much that I had to buy all three. Each book took me less then a day to read. They are a quick read but are extremely entertaining and impossible to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading. Best book series I've ever read!
030726999X|4.0|If you liked Stieg's first two books, this one will not disappoint you.  Full of action and and information.  This book completes the trilogy of The Girl Who books, but is a great read on its own.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|\\"Blood of the Nations\\" is a album that illustrates perfectly how Heavy Metal is supposed to sound.  BIG hooks, BIG Vocals, THUNDERING Riffs, and electrifying songs that make you want to crank the volume to 11 and beyond.  I was a very casual fan of Accept before purchasing this album.  I knew the hit \\"Balls to the Wall\\" from back in the day, but not much else.  After hearing Eddie Trunk plug this album on \\"That Metal Show\\" I knew I had to give it a listen.  I never expected to hear what I heard, and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be a huge understatement.  This album has been in my rotation since purchased, and gets better with every listen.  The album hooks you from the opening riff of \\"Beat the Bastards\\" and never lets up.  Every track is great, but my personal favorites are \\"Beat the Bastards\\" \\"Teutonic Terror\\" \\"Blood of the Nations\\" \\"Rolling Thunder\\" and \\"New World Comin'\\"      Any fan of Hard Rock/Heavy Metal, or just good music played by legit musicians should pick this album up.  I didn't know new music like this could still be made in 2011.  Bravo gentleman.
1594488843|4.0|Great book.  I'm not sure that I found much \\"surprising\\" about the fact that people are greatly motivated by work they find interesting, absorbing and challenging, perhaps the \\"surprising\\" part was more the studies that showed how money can, in certain cases, be a disincentive.  If you've read  [[ASIN:0712657592 Flow: The Classic Work on How to Achieve Happiness]] you'll find a lot if similar themes.  On the whole I found the book interesting and enjoyable.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|While I am a huge fan and appreciate the quality and content of many BBC productions, this movie is quite possibly the greatest romantic film ever made.  Even though Jane Austin purists may think it is subpar, I advise taking it for its own qualities and strengths.  This rendition of Pride and Prejudice is simply a masterpiece!  Kiera Knightley should have won best actress and this film should have won best film of the year.  The acting by the two leads is exceptional, the musical score is moving, the choreography is beautiful, the storyline terrific, the humor is engaging, and the romance inspiring.  This film holds you in its grip and does not let go.  It is a movie to watch over and over again.  Joe Wright did an outstanding job directing.  (This is far superior to the movie Atonement, by the way).  If you are truly a romantic at heart you cannot miss this movie or deny its intensity.
B004A7OQKY|2.0|What a disappointment! I didn't like it at all!<br />She is all over the place running from the coffee table to the love seat to the sofa?!<br />Not organized at all which makes it difficult to follow. Bad lighting and sound.<br />Wouldn't recommend it at all.<br />I wish I could get my money back.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I enjoyed this BBC movie version much more than the book.  Richard Armitage was stellar as Mr. Thornton.  And, something unusual in a romance, his interactions with supporting characters were as interesting as those with the heroine. Acting, directing, filming all very good. Some striking cinematography of cotton floating through the air in the working mill scenes, the green paradise of Helstone, and the bustling manufacturing town of Milton. This film should have won a cinematography award for use of light and shadow. It was an interesting change for a period piece to show the darker, grittier side of life in that era. As far as romances go, this is one of the best- the kind you revel in rewinding. If there are any flaws, I would say they consist of some overly long strike speeches, and to some extent the heroine herself.  She's a strong-willed character but not always likable, and the voice of the actress was a bit annoying at times.  The ending train scene, in spite of being too far ahead of the time period, was so moving that it now makes the list as one of my favorite screen moments.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I think there is so much we can learn from this movie. Courage, perserverance, hard work, thinking outside the box and much more. This movie makes the watcher want to be better and stirs the desire to do great things. Great things don't have to be known by the masses like Secretariat was. Great things can be what you do in your own world - the effect you have on your community and sphere of influence. The only downside to this movie is that movies like this are so few and far between. We would be served better with more like this. I have heard it said that movies can change culture. What would it be like if the powers that be in this industry decided to make more movies that have the values and integrity like this one. Bravo to those who produced this film for us to see.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|I enjoy watching last year's Glee episodes- what remarkable talent.  Also have all the CD's.  Great to hear that the Glee cast has broken Elvis' record for most songs ever on the singles charts.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It's so refreshing to hear a talented artist (finally) instead of the likes of Katy Perry and Lady Gaga.  Rather than a distorted voice, and practically naked (and weird) music videos, Adele refreshes the music industry with a breathtaking voice, the likes of which haven't been heard in a long, long, long time.<br /><br />The genre is quite varied.  Some songs are soul influenced, others maybe more pop, or even rock.  The main thing is, though, they are  all fantastic!  I've never bought any music I've enjoyed as much as this.  I purchased this on the Zune Marketplace 3 days after it was released, having never heard of her.  I already have over 600 plays of it, and it's been something like 4/5 days since.<br /><br />True talent is such a gift in todays music, when everything isn't filled with profanity and distortion.  To find a low-key gift like this truly is a blessing.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|I forgot how much I loved this until I was listening to the CD on the way to see her recently in Indianapolis.  Wow, what a show!  Pure energy and entertainment from start to finish!  Love it, love her!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am extremely pleased with my box set of Friends.  Had no issues with any of the discs, all were brand new and unscratched.  The box itself was in pristine condition, and the booklet was included.  I ordered straight from Amazon, and it was in my hands within a few days.    If you are a fan of Friends, this is a must get!
B0046MOVD0|3.0|Pros:  + Zombies are cool   + Explosions    Cons:  - Explosions are far more important than plot or acting    Overall it's just what you would expect from an RE movie. I personally like them but the mindless violence and mediocre CGI isn't for everyone. If you like the other ones, you will probably like this as well. It's nothing new.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|So great to have all the SATC DVD's in one place! I got mine used, and it was absolutely perfect. Awesome deal!
B000002WPH|1.0|This review is for the vinyl release of 36 Chambers. The album itself is classic, no need to review the content, rather I am reviewing the quality of the pressing. It is terrible! Don't waste your money, it sounds as if it was pressed using a dubbed cassette as the master tape. It's all muddy mids. It's as if no one listened to it after it was pressed. Shame on the folks who were responsible for this debacle. Can't give it zero stars for some reason, but that's what it deserves
B0041KKYDI|4.0|A true story of a man (Franco) who gets his arm stuck after falling into a canyon and discovers the will to live.  After falls into a canyon in the middle of nowhere, a boulder falls and smashes his arm between it and the canyon wall.  Little food and water and noone knowing where he is he fights to escape.  For the 2 or 3 of you who don't know how it ends I won't ruin it, but this movie really explores the human condition and shows what we can overcome if we really want to.  This is a movie like \\"Castaway\\" and \\"Buried\\" as it involves basicly one person the entire movie.  The movie keeps you entertained the entire time, and it is a very tense situation.  There are large chunks of the movie that have no dialog, but unless you realize there is no talking you don't really notice it.  Franco does a great job with this part and is very enjoyable to watch.  Very worthy of a best picture nomination.  This is not a movie to just put in and watch, this is one you have to prepare for, the ending is very intense.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I might, but this is another movie that would lose the impact in repeat viewings.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|Had a friend who loaned me season 1,and after watching it I ordered seasons 2-4.This show has plenty of drama,to many twist's and turns to figure out what's next. Lot's of humor (you can't help but like Dexter's one liners!)Just waiting for season 5 to come available!
B00042YL4A|5.0|I love ABC.  I've been a fan since Lexicon was released.  I saw the band in concert in Cleveland, Ohio in late 82 or early 83 and I was one of many fans dressed in the classic gold lame suits they wore.<br />The deluxe edition is amazing and features live versions of virtually every song from the album.  There are remixes included and the booklet alone is worth the cost of this CD.  Lexicon of Love is one of the best albums in my collection and is truly an iconic classic.<br />While Martin Fry still tours he never seems to make his way to the US and I really wish he would. I'd even break out my gold lame suit for the concert!
B0029SCFE0|4.0|Loosely based on a Japanese Manga of the same name, Old Boy is the second film in Park Chan Wook's \\"Vengeance Trilogy\\" and the recipient of the coveted Grand Prix award from the Cannes film festival.    The story focuses on a middle-aged wage slave called Oh-Dae-Su who gets detained at the police station after a night of drinking and bad behavior on the night of his daughter's birthday. His best friend bails him out and when he turns his back for a moment, Oh-Dae-Su vanishes without a trace on the rainy streets.    Oh-Dae-Su spends the next 15 years mysteriously imprisoned in an apartment. A small television set and 3 square meals of Gyoza a day are all the luxuries he is afforded. He experiences important events and watches the outside world change only through his television set.    He shadow-boxes and trains every day in the hopes that one day he can exact bloody revenge on his mysterious captor. He scars and inserts wire filaments in the flesh of his arms to mark the years that pass him by. He imagines fire ants crawling all over his body and under his skin. He attempts suicide. Several times. His bewilderment turns to rage, his rage turns to grief and his grief gives way to gradual acceptance. But his thirst for vengeance remains unsatiated.    Then one day, after 15 years of imprisonment, he is knocked out by gas emitted into his room and he awakens instead in a briefcase on the roof of a building. Oh-Dae-Su sees the sun and breathes in fresh air for the first time in 15 years.    The world has passed him by; his wife was murdered years ago and his daughter was subsequently adopted by foreigners and migrated to Europe. Thus begins Oh-Dae-Su's odyssey of vengeance to uncover the identity of his captor and unravel the mystery behind his abduction.    Old Boy is a film that pushes the envelope, not in terms of violence (violence is not used excessively in the film but always in the most potent and effective manner when employed) but rather in terms of the themesthe film explores; loss, vengeance, guilt, hatred, isolation, love and even incest.    Park Chan Wook has crafted a thought-provoking, unsettling and at times touching movie, one that actually transcends its source material.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I ordered the white gamecube controller and thats what I got. Its the same one as pictured with the japanese writing on the box and the extra long cord. If you do not get whats pictured then you show double check your order and send it back, because you got the wrong one. This is the controller to get. It has defiantly been refined a little which makes it more responsive. And works great with the wii. If your thinking about buying this then you already know that you want or need it. So spend the extra coin and get the best controller you can besides it looks great.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|A prescription drug salesman falls in love with a woman who is not as together as she seems.  After meeting Maggie (Hathaway) in a doctor's office, Jamie (Gyllenhaal) tracks her down and the relationship begins.  This is not at all what I expected, it was so much better.  Going in all I heard about it from the interviews was...Anne Hathaway is naked alot, there is rampent nudity and sex.  This movie is much, much more then that.  This is a movie about two, for lack of a better work, selfish people who start a relationship based solely on sex.  They begin to develop real feelings for each other, and thats when they start to have problems.  Much like \\"Get Low\\" this is another movie that got passed over at the \\"Oscars\\".  I'm not talking best picture, but Anne Hathaway was fantastic in this and to not get nominated is a huge oversight.  Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have great chemistry and it really helps you get more involved with the characters.  This was a great film, full of laughs, tears and it makes you think.  I highly recommend this movie and I guarantee you will not be dissapointed.  I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutly
B0041KKYCY|3.0|I remember the original I Spit on Your Grave from 1978!! It was BRUTAL, DISTURBING and SADISTIC!! Now, this remake is also very disturbing but it borrows A LOT from Saw. :(<br /><br />The rape scene in this movie is not SOOO graphic as the original 70's version but the revenge scenes are WAY MORE BRUTAL! Also, the acting is actually good (unlike the original) and the production is much better in this new version.<br /><br />I still preffer the original 70's version because it was a DISTURBING SADISTIC SEXUAL MASTERPIECE that was very shocking at the time. This one is also shocking but the revenge scenes are very alike to the Saw movies. If you liked the traps in the Saw movies then you might enjoy this movie because is pretty much the same thing but with a sexual touch.<br /><br />Adios.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|This recording is rather disappointing, to a certain degree, if you are familiar with Hahn's potential.     First the Higdon: there is no doubt that Higdon is an accomplished composer. In true post-modern fashion, she shows off her knowledge of the modernist and not-so mdernist canon with numerous references to her predecessors, most obviously the homage to the Berg concerto in the opening of the first movement. But one doubts whether this melange will have meaningful staying power as the years go on. While there are some truly engrossing moments, there are others that sound like average film-music: not terribly inventive and actually quite cheesy, especially in the second movement. That said, Higdon certainly knows how to orchestrate and knows how to throw her solist a few bravura virtuoso bones, which Hahn of course knows to make the most of. She is most dazzling, as usual, in her superhuman control of double-stops - a trademark of which Higdon must have been aware, for she gives Hahn numerous opportunities to display this skill.     That said, one wonders how much is rotten in the American classical music business, when a new concerto written by an American composer on a commission from several American and Canadian orchestras (Baltimore, Indianapolis & Toronto) and one American conservatory (Curtis) gets its world premiere recording at the hands of a distincly second tier British orchestra? When will American musicians wake up to the fact that their prehistoric contract structures are doing long-term damage to American musical culture by forcing artists to go abroad due to the prohibitive costs of recording stateside?    The Tchaikovsky shows Hahn falling into her worst habit: obsessive-compulsive cautiousness. I have heard Hahn perform this work live and this recording falls leagues short of her potential. In an effort to make everything sound as meticulously correct and finely calibrated as possible, this studio recording robs Tchaikovsky's blockbuster of allspontaneity, fire and sweep. Perhaps the one to blame here is not Hahn, but Petrenko. While his Liverpudlians boast some fine woodwinds, the other sections sound distincly anemic. They sound overrehearsed, tense even, sometimes falling into march-like heavy downbeats, and never really seem to let the music take off. There is nothing particularly wrong that Petrenko does anywhere in his conducting. He observes the right dynamics, accelerates and slows the tempo in the right places, but it never sounds remotely organic. One thing never seems to directly grow out of what preceded it. It is as if you were listening to a patchwork of very carefully assmbled bits from different rehearsal sessions. There is no cohesion to the whole. Hahn's technique of course is beyond reproach, her mastery is a given. But this remains a deeply disappointing performance, especially knowing what she is capable of and therefore knowing what could have been.     It seems that Hahn was very enthusiastic about the Higdon concerto, which shows her much more at ease and inspired in her performance, while the Tchaikovsky was tagged on as a populist blockbuster to help sell the disc. I do wonder whether that was really necessary, for musically the Tchaikovsky is her weakest recording yet.
B0000041BX|3.0|Like many authors of 5-star reviews on this page, I am a big fan of Quartetto Italiano and try to grab their CDs where I can. However, this compilation of their Schubert recordings made for the Philips label in 1965-1977 is marred by idiosyncratic interpretations of Schubert's scores. The positive moment is that listeners can enjoy the lush string tone and virtuosity of Quartetto Italiano in a descent stereo sound. But in two works recorded by Quartetto Italiano earlier - the `Rosamunde' Quartet in A minor, D.804 (CD 1, tracks 5-8) and the `Quartettsatz' in C minor, D.703' (CD 2, track 5) - they lose a comparison to their own mono versions [[ASIN:B0009VNCXM String Quartets]] in all aspects, except for better studio sound: the early versions are winners - they are warm and natural, while here the performers are obviosly trying to make the music seem even more poignant by inserting micropauses, underholding the notes etc.<br /><br />The main failure in this compilation is Schubert's last quartet, (No. 15) in G major, D.887 (CD 2, tracks 1-4). Incidentally, this is one of last recordings of Quartetto Italiano, made in  7/1977. They soften the dramatic first movement of the G major quartet and consistently drag fierce transitions from major to minor episodes. As a result, the movement that should take ca. 14-16 minutes is blown up to absolutely insane [22'58]. In the finale, Allegro assai, Quarttetto Italiano voluntarily split the main 6/8 subject into two parts by making a tiny pause in between: true, Schubert asks for a brisk dynamic contrast (from fz to p) in the same bar, but he still wants one subject, not two, and insists on dramatic development, not monotonous repetition. Instead of a hectic ride the Quartetto Italiano invite you for a lulling walk. Try the great performance of the Busch quartet [[ASIN:B00000DOJS Schubert: String Quartets 14 \\"Death and the Maiden\\" & 15 / Busch String Quartet]] to learn how this powerful this Schubert score can (and should) sound. I understand that different interpretations are possible but this experiment does not convince me.  There is however one episode where the Quartetto Italiano is absolutely gorgeous - the trio of the Scherzo (CD 2, track 3): with the return of the Scherzo the magic disappears, at least for me.<br /><br />The approach of Quartetto Italiano to the D minor Quartet D.810, the `Death and the Maiden' (rec. 1965) is more conventional what the tempo regards. But this is not the most distinctive performance either - try the Juilliard quartet [[ASIN:B0009VY6T6 Juilliard String Quartet Plays Beethoven, Schubert]], the Emerson Quartet [[ASIN:B00000I0L8 Franz Schubert: String Quartets D 804 \\"Rosamunde\\", D 810 \\"Death and the Maiden\\", D 887, D 703 and String Quintet D 956]], and especially, the Hungarian Quartet [[ASIN:B0000CE7FV Schubert: String Quartets 13 - 15 & String Quintet;  Hungarian Quartet]].

There is however one episode where the Quartetto Italiano is absolutely gorgeous - the trio of the Scherzo (CD 2, track 3): with the return of the Scherzo the magic disappears, at least for me.    The approach of Quartetto Italiano to the D minor Quartet D.810, the `Death and the Maiden' (rec. 1965) is more conventional what the tempo regards. But this is not the most distinctive performance either - try the Juilliard quartet [[ASIN:B0009VY6T6 Juilliard String Quartet Plays Beethoven, Schubert]], the Emerson Quartet [[ASIN:B00000I0L8 Franz Schubert: String Quartets D 804 \\"Rosamunde\\", D 810 \\"Death and the Maiden\\", D 887, D 703 and String Quintet D 956]], and especially, the Hungarian Quartet [[ASIN:B0000CE7FV Schubert: String Quartets 13 - 15 & String Quintet;  Hungarian Quartet]].

B002WY65W4|5.0|This is one of the first movies we purchased to view on our new Blu Ray player. It looks great. This is a crazy, bloody, action packed comedy for the whole family. The movie was great, however, the additional DVD with the included digital version is locked and apparently no longer available for free. Great price.
0553212478|3.0|It is most unfortunate that this was the height of frightening literature then.By todays standards however it would be considered laughable.Older folks can still appreciate the beautiful way Shelley wrote her masterpiece.The use of language and the victorian way of speaking is quite charming and took some time to get used to.I should have read it years ago but only got to it recently.I felt I had to and was glad I did. Of course when one does actually read it one finds nothing of what Hollywood turned it into and now I know why. Deep down it is a story not of horror, even though one can feel the distant and at times rather close sense of dread the monster instills in Dr. Frankenstein but moreover it is a story of love.All this creation wanted was to love and be loved,to trust and be trusted, to live some semblance of a normal life. Alas, his horrific countenance proved his undoing,repulsive to all and even to himself. His want for normalcy,his ability to educate himself and to think in terms of future goals yet was forced into murder to obtain it is a lesson to be learned by all.I fear that with the exception of english majors and the literary curious, books like these are destined for extinction.What typical kid today would want to read it and if begun would finish it without going to cliff notes. This novel must be read cover to cover to be properly understood.It is and will always be a classic.I enjoyed it and highly encourage others to read it too especially the younger generation who might dismiss it after a few pages but should stick it out. They just don't write them like this anymore.I know there are other editions out there with more to offer the Frankenstein expert but this edition was just fine by me.Plus it begins and ends in the deep, dark,frozen wastes of the Arctic which was also a plus for a guy who digs the polar regions as much as I do.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|the version of Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" fast became a house staple of mine. Everything from the perfect casting to the lively and twisted melodic turns of the soundtrack - it is just one of those movies you can count on. It's rewards are balanced perfectly with its moments of somber reflection and grieving.  Even my husband - who doesn't like tv or movies in general - enjoys this when I put it on. Because the characters are so close to real people. You grow up with Emma, every time. Austen shines just like she should.
0786852550|4.0|I had never heard of the Bartimaeus Trilogy written by Jonathan Stroud until Amazon.com recommended it. In the past, I had greatly enjoyed the Harry Potter, Eragon, and Percy Jackson series. I went to the Amazon.com website looking for something new and saw the Bartimaeus books listed in the section marked, Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought.... I decided to give it a try and ordered the Amulet of Samarkand on audio CD. I listened to the book on my daily commute to and from work.<br /><br />This was a fun story with action and narrow escapes. The book alternates between a first person perspective of events by Bartimaeus, a 5,000-year-old djinni, and a narrator's view of events involving Nathaniel, the apprentice Magician. The first half of the story jumps around between the current events involving Bartimaeus and a flashback to the past events surrounding Nathaniel that led him to the point where he summoned Bartimaeus. Nathaniel had a lonely and frustrated past as the apprentice to Arthur Underwood. Nathaniel only had two friends, his teacher Ms. Lutyens and his \\"mother,\\" Mrs. Underwood. After an encounter with the main antagonist, a magician named Simon Lovelace, Nathaniel begins to plot revenge.<br /><br />In the second half of the book, the story continues to alternate between the events involving Bartimaeus and the events involving Nathaniel but there are no more flashbacks to the Nathaniel's past. Although Bartimaeus and Nathaniel are working together for the same purpose, they don't spend a lot of time together. There is a lot of action with Nathaniel and Bartimaeus each getting captured and then escaping from different situations until the end when Nathaniel, with the help of Bartimaeus, saves the day.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the story, but kept waiting for Nathaniel and Bartimaeus to become friends. It was easy to follow and I always looked forward to having the time to continue listening to the story. I think I enjoyed the 1st person perspective of Bartimaeus more than the narrator's perspective of Nathaniel.than the narrator's perspective of Nathaniel.

1439102724|5.0|I almost don't know how to start this review. I am a Jodi Picoult fan girl through and through. I have been waiting for Sing You Home since I closed the covers of House Rules. Given those facts, you'll probably be totally shocked when I say that I 100% loved this book. Or not shocked at all.<br /><br />Where do I start with Sing You Home? Picoult's writing, of course. When I read a Jodi Picoult novel, I encounter sentences I wish I had the brilliance to write myself. I get lost and tangled up in the people she creates and the scenarios she details. Picoult can break my heart into tiny pieces and then put me back together within a few pages. Her novels make me smile, they make me laugh, and often, they move me to the point of tears. Her writing is beautiful without being sappy; detailed without being overdone; masterful without being pretentious; amazing in a way I can't even describe.<br /><br />So, I obviously like her writing style, but what else? Let's talk about her characters. Although this does go back to Picoult's writing style, it never fails to amaze me how one person can write in so many voices. What do I mean? Picoult's novels are general told by multiple narrators. In the case of Sing You Home, there are three primary narrators: Zoe Baxter, Max Baxter, and Vanessa Shaw. It's incredible to me how one author can make each of those narrative voices so completely unique. Reading a chapter that is narrated by Zoe is a completely different experience than reading a chapter narrated by Vanessa. It provides so much more insight to the characters to read the experience as told by them, rather than be told how that character is feeling about a situation by a third person narrator.<br /><br />What was so delightful and heartbreaking about Sing You Home was that I loved all the characters. Zoe is such an amazing character who wants nothing more in this world than to be a mother. Because I had such sympathy for Zoe, I wanted to dislike Max and view him as the \\"bad guy.\\" But no, that is not how Picoult constructed the novel. She wanted you to like Max as much as you liked Zoe because it creates internal conflict for the reader. I was totally and completely pulling for Zoe, rooting her on at every turn. But, I liked Max, too. I understood his side of the issue, his struggle with the decision to be made, and his struggles as a (albeit fictional) human. I don't think I would have or could have liked Max as much as I did without \\"hearing\\" his voice. It would have been all too easy to designate him as the bad guy and not fully experience all sides of the struggle that is at the heart of this novel.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Vanessa and Zoe's mother Dara, as well. I think Vanessa, being so different from Zoe, help to round out an area of characterization that would have otherwise been missing. Zoe's character presented a completely strong female, but Zoe was soft edges and beautiful music. Vanessa presented a strong female character that was quite as soft, in my opinion. She was by no means hard or masculine or unfeeling, she was simply a different kind of strong from Zoe. Her strength was more understated when compared to Zoe. You know Zoe is strong because of all she has endured to have a child. You learn more about her strength along the way, however, but you know her mettle up front because of her infertility battle. Vanessa revealed her strength in small doses. She revealed herself through what she had endured because of her sexual preference. She revealed herself in her tenacity and unwillingness to give up on what she believed in. And she revealed her strength and beauty as a character through her love for Zoe.<br /><br />The plot was masterfully crafted. Picoult always picks a topic for her plot that is at the very pulse of modern culture. For this novel, Picoult actually used two hot button topics: the rights of the unborn and gay rights. While the rights of the unborn was a secondary plot device, Picoult still managed to shine a light on the sticky topic and make the reader think. On the front burner of the plot, was the rights of gays and lesbians. Whatever topic(s) Picoult is highlighting in her writing, she always manages to bring out both sides of the issue, another reason that multiple narrators are such an asset to her stories. It is clear that Picoult is on the side of equal rights for gays, her own opinion is never heavy-handed. I don't ever feel preached to or that Picoult is trying to sway me to her thinking. She merely tells her story, from both sides of the argument, in a way that captures the attention of the reader and makes them think.<br /><br />I thought the plot moved very quickly and was engrossing. The crumbling relationship between Max and Zoe, the unfolding of the relationship between Vanessa and Zoe, and then the struggle to be treated fairly no matter how or who one loves, was purely captivating. I simply could not put this book down. I was in a reading race with myself because I couldn't consume Sing You Home quickly enough. I wanted more and more and more of the dynamic relationships, the heartbreak of loss, and the legal struggle for equality.<br /><br />Sing You Home is Jodi Picoult's finest novel since My Sister's Keeper. I absolutely and highly recommend it to everyone. Fans of Picoult's work will love this novel. Newcomers to her work - this novel is a fantastic place to start.e the reader think.

Look, this was not a movie that was going to rival \\"Black Swan\\" or \\"Rabbit Hole\\" for the Oscar even had it been done better, but that said....It could have been a movie that fit it's slot of \\"Just entertainment\\" far better.  I find no fault in any of the acting and the music was fine but it was the simple script that seems like it may have been written while shooting that failed.I found myself saying \\"REALLY\\"????

Off course that said, I did order the dvd (it's cher after all!!!!) and it's not THAT bad...but it could have been so much better.

1558908455|5.0|The story is preposterous, as two brothers criminals kidnap a family hostage in a hotel along the road, and continue to meet their cohorts on the border with Mexico, but must wait until the day dawns on a mix of house and bar concerts in the desert. What we do not realize is that the bar served only for facade and would need all sorts that might have to cross that night. The film is excellent, classic horror mixed with action, very well written and directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. It also has an amazing soundtrack to the music of Tito & Tarantula, great actors are cast as Salma Hayek, George Clooney, Juliette Lewis and Quentin Tarantino movie in a lot of suspense and action all the time, with many special effects and a pace frantic.

B004HGBUVG|5.0|With the eminent status she has achieved in American song Lucinda Williams could not be blamed for coasting a bit. Much time has passed since the two decades of largely unheeded obsessive perfection that predated her late-90s breakthrough.<br /><br />How fortunate that \\"Blessed\\" finds her lyrical and melodic powers at their zenith. Fresh, blazing inspiration is especially evident in spite of her droll, cool-as-cucumber delivery.<br /><br />The tempo is subdued, but not in the vein of \\"Essence\\" or \\"West,\\" which were immensely tortured and soul-searching by comparison. A decidedly less precious approach to the songs' overall execution plays to their strengths because Williams' outlook, while still immense with thought and world-weariness, is less clenched and more relaxed. Clipped, factual acceptance is therefore fitting in its thematic dominance.<br /><br />\\"Buttercup,\\" one of the few upbeat selections, does not set the stage with its classic rock feel and almost boisterous sense of levity as Williams criticizes a former flame in a nonetheless dignified manner. Its chorus is ingratiating with full throttle guitars and percussion. \\"Seeing Black,\\" written for Vic Chesnutt, does not cast judgment on the troubled singer/songwriter's suicide but scratches the wounds of those left behind. She probes his motivation with a series of unanswerable questions amid searing guitar work from Elvis Costello.<br /><br />The shrewdly observed, expertly executed title track finds affirmation in unlikely places - \\"we were blessed by the neglected child who knew how to forgive/we were blessed by the battered woman who did not seek revenge\\" - and exemplifies Williams' signature incisive simplicity, the backbone of her talent. It informs more than a few songs here, also among them \\"I Don't Know How You're Living,\\" typical of her slow-burning, marinated, downbeat best. Her vocals wrench as she contemplates what has become of a former love without any bitterness or self-pity - just acceptance of what has happened - and declares her continued good will.<br /><br />\\"Copenhagen\\" is lullaby-like and huggably warm as it offers an olive branch to an estranged friend, while \\"Born to Be Loved\\" is deceivingly simple as it insists upon its title phrase. \\"Soldier's Song\\" comes from the perspective of a departed serviceman and the family he has left behind. Her sparing matter-of-factness maximizes the songs' effectiveness.<br /><br />\\"Awakening\\" is a swirling, epic tour de force with deadly serious percussion and guitar work. Her vocals, hanging loose and icy in the mix as she repeatedly declares her intentions to accept the unchangeable are bone-chilling in their funereal restraint amid the song's topsy-turvy arrangement - and appropriately so, since the song is a death of sorts in its resolution to put an end to habits that, for more than half a lifetime, have proven unsatisfying.<br /><br />\\"Kiss Like Your Kiss\\" with its summery, meditative imagery sounds like a safe haven in the storm as it waxes love and comfort. It is the most resolute, unambiguous closing track of Williams' career.<br /><br />\\"Little Honey\\" had many incredible songs, but it was more a hodgepodge than a fully focused, clearly inspired album. \\"Blessed\\" is a welcome return in that regard. Her major artistic assets are in full evidence, but she also demonstrates a personal growth that provides a unique listening experience from those she has previously offered and that stands well with the quality of high-watermark albums that cemented her reputation. \\"Blessed\\" is destined to join that much-lauded company.<br /><br />4.5 starseclares her continued good will.      \\"Copenhagen\\" is lullaby-like and huggably warm as it offers an olive branch to an estranged friend, while \\"Born to Be Loved\\" is deceivingly simple as it insists upon its title phrase. \\"Soldier's Song\\" comes from the perspective of a departed serviceman and the family he has left behind.

193413712X|5.0|I was simply blown away by this one.  So profound.  So deep.  So moving.  The descriptions of nature and how the old peddler feels about his relationship with nature as he lumbers his horse, cart, and trinkets through back woods of pure beauty are perfect in tone and mood.  They create a stillness that is part painting and part meditation.  And, I deeply felt his ache as he drives his cart past his home, knowing he can never go back.  It was haunting and stayed with me for days.<br /><br />Our main character's final days were equally moving.  The idea that space, dimension, and time begin to unwind before us in our final moments was presented as both plausible and eloquent.  The mixing of the old clock manuals was also highly effective.<br /><br />Perhaps the books greatest achievement is how is mixes art, experiment, and strong story telling.  Despite all of its broad scope, the story never waivers.  It never takes a back seat to all of its other achievements.  I can't say enough about this one.

B0000696I1|4.0|First, don't be mislead by all the bad mouthing.  This is not the worst movie of all time.  I thought this was a solid Ninja Turtle movie; I loved it when I was younger and still today I find it entertaining.  Like it or not, this is the way the great live action trilogy came to an end.  After this we had to wait years for TMNT, and that wait was not worth it.  I don't know why it is so hard for some to appreciate this movie (I am still appauled by the amount of people who disliked Secret of the Ooze!!!)    Is the writing weaker than the previous movies?  Yes.  Is this a strong finish for the trilogy?  No.  However, I think all of the Turtle quality is there.  One complaint I see is that the Turtle's mouths don't line up with the words well.  In my opinion, no more so than in Turtles 1 and 2.  I never even noticed the slip ups until they were pointed out and I started looking for them.    Someone said the story was far-fetched; the idea of time travel was too sci fi.  REALLY?! A series based around 4 turtles mutated into humanoid form living in a sewer eating pizza, trained as ninjas by a mutated rat that come out and fight crime at night whose main enemy is a ninja who calls himself Shredder?!  Yeah thats A LOT more realistic than time travel.  The main antagonist was killed of in the last movie, I give them credit for thinking up this plot.  Turtles 3 had a good storyline although not executed to its full potential.    Main characters such as Splinter and Casey did not have much face time.  I would have loved to see Casey accompany the turtles, but he did not.  This is cleary a weak point in the movie, but nothing I couldn't live with.  As I said before, Shredder is dead and I like this (in a way as he was one of my favorite characters), it opens chances for the Turtles to fight new evils, not just the same old fight Shredder/beat him/he returns thing. Maybe an emergence of Crange could have been in order?  Some people say \\"Shredder couldn't be in 3! He died!\\", maybe Crange could have used some Deminsion X technology to revive him?  Hmmm, might be a nice idea for the rumored new live action Turtles if they intend to continue the series rather than reboot it.    As for being goofy, yes it was.  Secret of the Ooze was too.  And this is why I think so:  Us, the old school comic fans, got Turtles 1.  Then, they saw the influence it had on the younger crowd.  It was a potential marketing giant, therefore the next 2 films were aimed more at this age group.  Think of the possibilities! Toys, cartoons, costumes, clothes, video games....So I understand why 2 and 3 were a little immature.    But when it all comes down to it, its still the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!  Its done in their fashion.  The idea of the Turtles using a magic septor to travel back in time, save April and defeat an evil warlord was out of left field, but it worked.  You get a change in scenery, not the same old grungy city.  There are some good fight scenes, you get to see the Turtles working on their inner selves to become better warriors.  The costumes are the same quality as the previous movies.  I really don't see a reason to absolutely hate this movie.  It is the weakest of the lot but look what it had to compete against! 1 and 2?  Out-doing those would be no small feat.  Come on, TMNT was pretty well received and it was more out there than this movie.  And most importantly, this was the last live action Turtles (I don't think it will be for long though :) so appreciate.

142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan is a fantastic read! This book is ideal for all ages, but I believe the intended ages are pre-teens and teens. Woven into the unpredictable adventure, a small romance of the thoughts from the main female character brings many surprises, as well as happy endings to this book.      The Lost Hero is the first book is the Heroes of Olympus series. This series is written by one of New York Times Best Selling Authors Rick Riordan. Rick Riordan is also the author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series and the Kane Chronicles series. Like the Percy Jackson series, the Heroes of Olympus is a mythological fiction dealing with Greek mythology. Unlike the Percy Jackson series, this book also contains many references and appearances of Roman gods and goddesses. I will judge this book based upon the fact that it is intended to entertain while educate. The book begins with a boy who has recently lost his memory. He doesn't know that his name is Jason and he has no clue where or when he is.  Soon after his coach (aka his teacher) is taken into the sky by a storm spirit Jason, Piper (one of Jason's apparent friends) and, Leo (another friend) make their way to Camp Half-Blood to make sense of what has been going on.  Soon they are on an adventure getting closer and closer to death as they continue on. This book is certainly a must read!
0756405890|5.0|I don't want to sound like a snob, but I generally don't enjoy fantasy.  A great deal of it is just rehashed ideas taken from previous stories.  In general, The Name of the Wind is a coming of age story, however, what makes it special is Rothfuss's narrative voice.  The way he tells the story makes it so interesting.  It's fun to read about how a regular guy goes about his life, and as things happen, those events get spun into legend.  Kvothe's legend grows, some of it based on fact, some based on speculation, but you get to see it all from the inside as he tells it in first person.  Really entertaining and highly recommended.

It has very familiar rhymes and illustrations.  I have gone through many copies of Goodnight Moon with my four children. They love to finish the sentences and point out the telephone and the stars and other things not mentioned in the text.  They love the sounds of the words.  It's often a child's first introduction to the cadence of poetry.      I frequently buy this as a gift for a new baby.  I recommend buying it as a board book as it will last longer.

B00000IMYA|5.0|Forget the confusion (and the underlying sham) about what is live and what is not. ALL that matters is that \\"Diminuendo In Blue And Crescendo In Blue\\" sounds AMAZING. Where it was done? Who really cares? The point is that it WAS done and now we can hear it in all its glory. The rest is just details. God bless these guys for making such AWESOME music.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Hehehe, yes I wanted to make up that joke.  I love all the hit songs, especially my new favorite \\"Count on Me.\\"  Every time I hear a song from him, it makes me smile for no apparent reason.  Somehow he just makes your day bright when things go bad. This is what we all need when it comes  to good music. We need something to listen to while the day goes by, or something to cheer  us up when things go bad.    Thank you Bruno for delivering such amazing songs, especially \\"Just the Way you are.\\"  Also....he's pretty cute.
B003WMX3SY|2.0|Let me start out by saying this case is awesome. Period. Read the other reviews for why. The two stars are for....    Amazon. I bought not one but two of these great cases, and BOTH were missing the toolbox of screws. Oh, you know, no big deal, you're only missing 80+ something odd screws so when you go to excitedly install your stuff into this bada$$ case, you get that wonderful feeling of being ripped off. Then you stare at it fondly, raising a silent fist to the deity that off'd you.     Or not. Amazon, read this and fix this crap. Stop selling products with missing parts marked as \\"new\\".
1846142733|4.0|While I suspect that David Starkey would violently object the two current giants of television history in the UK in terms of providing a worldview are the left leaning Simon Schama and the combative neo conservative Niall Ferguson. Their dust up at last years Hay Literary festival in Wales was a colourful sparring session between two big intellects firing verbal potshots at each other and a joy to behold. Schama concentrated on providing a robust defense of Barack Obama while Ferguson spent much of his allotted time dissing the President's now famous speech delivered in Cairo in 2009. Indeed he has described it as \\"touchy feely nonsense\\" and has in recent weeks sent out lurid warnings about Obama's failure to anticipate the demise of Mubarak and to come to terms with what Ferguson sees as the potential rise of the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt and the possible \\"restoration of the caliphate and the strict application of Sharia\\". Strong stuff, but Ferguson does like a good row. (see his feud with the nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman)<br /><br />These themes above are the heart of this new book \\"Civilization: The West and the Rest\\" since Ferguson comes from the controversial standpoint that Western dominance has on the whole been a progressive force and that on the basis of a cost benefit analysis the good outweighs the bad (it is a constant theme in all his books). He recently argued that \\"the rulers of western Africa prior to the European empires were not running some kind of scout camp. They were engaged in the slave trade. They showed zero sign of developing the country's economic resources....and the counterfactual idea that somehow the indigenous rulers would have been more successful in economic development doesn't have any credibility at all.\\" This is a bold, confrontational, contentious and provocative thesis and his new book reinforces these arguments postulating that there were six killer \\"apps\\" which propelled the West to a position of predominance. These were competition, science, property, modern science, consumption and work ethic all with a dedicated chapter in the book.<br /><br />Space precludes a detailed debate on each theme but for example he contrasts how China was the world's most advanced civilization in the 15th century but stagnated and was overtaken by Dutch mercantilism and the rise of capitalism employing his six \\"skills\\". He will equally generate a furious response to the view that scientific development was \\"by any scientific measure, wholly European\\". Other ideas that the spread of the market was as influential in the rise of the West as the role of force tends to neglect that the often were inseparable and rather evil twins. Just look at the bloody history of German East Africa prior to the First World War, But even more close to home Ferguson has himself previously recognized in another part of his prodigious output that \\"When imperial authority was challenged - in India in 1857, in Jamaica in 1831 and 1865, in South Africa in 1899 - the British response was brutal\\".<br /><br />That said all Ferguson books, whether you love or hate his arguments, are immensely readable and his historical sweep is vast. There is little doubt that he relishes the big strategic themes and his tone is one of super confidence and often compulsively provocative not least in his view that the West must relearn some of its old tricks to maintain its position. His ability however to take a small example and write it large often leads to accusations of research selectivity and the fact that the successful Chinese business city Wenzou also has 1,400 churches is used to tie some of his \\"apps\\" together in what is a very unconvincing argument. The title for this narrative is oddly lifted from another very recent book by the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton albeit the latters theme was Islamic terrorism. Similarly other historians such as Ian Morris, Eric Ringmar and John A Hall have covered these issues with muchmore subtlety and nuance. Yet Ferguson's strengths are his readability, populism and his headlong assault on some sacred cows. His weaknesses are the employment of the sweeping generalization and a strong streak of cultural arrogance. You can clap loudly or boo vehemently at Niall Ferguson when the television series to accompany this book commences on US television.ance.

B0025KVLUQ|3.0|Musically and sonically, this is probably one of the best-produced albums The Beatles ever did. My caveat about it comes from when it was first released in the fall of 1969. To my teenage ears at the time, after having enjoyed what sounded like a cohesive GROUP effort from the band on prior releases, ABBEY ROAD really did sound like John, Paul and George were off in their own separate corners, with Ringo and George Martin as the only common denominators. Knowing 40+ years later how disconnected they were with each other at that point in time only reinforces my own disconnection with ABBEY ROAD even now. No question, you'd have to be born without ears to say that \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Here Comes The Sun,\\" \\"Because\\" and many parts of the Medley on what was \\"Side 2\\" don't have the engaging songcraft and performances that The Beatles were known for. But as an ALBUM, ABBEY ROAD has an aura of something constructed to LOOK like it's complete, even when it sounds hollow inside. I admire the technique and craftsmanship....but I don't love it. And I can say that about no other album in The Beatles' discography except LET IT BE, which, not surprisingly, was largely recorded with the same inter-group dysfunctions in place.
B004F5E9IA|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 'UK BLU RAY' VERSION ***<br /><br />\\"Meet Joe Black\\" is the kind of film that elicits derision and affection in equal measure - well if it's one of your guilty pleasures - then you need to own it on BLU RAY.<br /><br />I've had the now defunct HD-DVD format of Martin Brest's 1999 movie for a while now to have the film in High Definition - and this Blu Ray reissue uses the same menus (has extra subtitles in the languages department). But it's the print-quality that will be the big draw here. With an aspect that fills the entire screen, the transfer is lush, detailed and a pleasure to look at practically all of the time. In short - \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is beautiful on Blu Ray...<br /><br />Mixing the supernatural with romance could have been awkward and even 'silly' in places (it sometimes is - Pitt speaking jive in the hospital to a black woman who knows he's the Grim Reaper is cringing), yet Brest has achieved an assured beauty throughout. This is a nice film in so many ways. And possibly because of its themes of loss and how we live our lives, it manages real warmth and a rare intelligence. The growing attraction between Claire Forlani (as Susan Parrish) and Brad Pitt (as Joe Black) is nicely set up in a caf&eacute; at the beginning of the film and then played out against preparations for her father's 65th birthday in his mansion throughout the film (Death has taken over his body and is being shown around by a reluctant Hopkins). Thomas Newman's lovely score also adds a classy feel to the film too and is used when it's needed.<br /><br />But it's the cast that make you watch - Claire Forlani is luminously beautiful as Daddy's 'too busy to be in love' daughter - she has eyes that could make most men literally lose their balance - while Anthony Hopkins as the corporate mogul William Parrish brings a sheer decency to the piece that gives it a beating heart (his dialogue above). The scene where he gets a heart attack in his office and the voice of death condescends and ridicules his advice to his daughter - is brilliant. You 'feel' his terror and disorientation. Throw in great supporting roles for Jake Weber as the dastardly boardroom schemer Drew, Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor as William's sister Allison and his bumbling but honest friend Quince - and it zips along very nicely indeed despite its 3-hour length. Pitt is hugely impressive too - handsome, sinister, controlled and funny too. He may be eye-candy to some, but there's real talent there - and often.<br /><br />Niggles - the USA HD-DVD has a 'Photo Montage' (still photographs of the cast and crew on location and on sets) and a lone extra called \\"Spotlight On Location\\" that features interviews with all the key people. It's barely 10-minutes long (and very lo-fi in terms of picture quality) but it's hugely entertaining. You can literally feel the awe and affection with which Anthony Hopkins is held by the entire cast - and short as it is, the featurette provides genuine insights into why and how the movie got made. Why a niggle - because it's 'not' on this 'UK' Blu Ray (licensing rights - laziness - who knows)? This UK version is also 'not' Region coded, so those in the USA and other parts of the World wanting to import it may have difficulty playing it on their players defaulted to wherever they live. My best assessment is that this UK BLU RAY is Region 'free'. You'll need to check to see if that works on your machine.<br /><br />Audio is English 5.1 with Subtitles in French and English For The Deaf And Hard Of Hearing.<br /><br />\\"Meet Joe Black\\" is never going to trouble an Oscar List or be a discussion point at the next MENSA Annual General Meeting, but for those touched by its gushing romance, themes of living life while you have it and love triumphant - this BLU RAY will do nicely.<br /><br />\\"I want to see you get swept away...\\" William Parrish says to his daughter.<br /><br />Well, now you can...es his advice to his daughter - is brilliant.

B004HGBUXE|4.0|Having nearly given up on Lucinda Williams after her distinctly average 2008 release \\"Little Honey\\" it is a rare pleasure to report a real return to form on her 10th album. While \\"Blessed\\" may not be another \\"Car Wheels on a gravel road\\" its probably grossly unfair to ever expect her to scale those heights again, but its a excellent album of blues rock and also showcases her gentler side. On display as ever are the raspy Southern drawl and her ragged heartbroken delivery making her one of the most distinctive voices in American music. But equally for your listening pleasure are some great songs and lyrics to much her status as the unofficial poet of the deep south. Opener \\"Buttercup\\" is a hard edged country rock break up song with Williams dispatching an ex boyfriend with her customary disdain and spite. The brilliant aching lament \\"I dont know how your living\\" alternatively is a song underpinned by latent regret and remorse and the type of song that Williams 58 years allow her to sing with the benefit of genuine experience and understanding. No one charts an emotional car crash in the way that Williams can. Speaking of which \\"Seeing black\\" is a song about the late Vic Chesnutt the American singer songwriter who recently tragically committed suicide at the age of 45. Williams sets questions throughout the song about when he \\"made a decision to jump ship\\" and \\"when did you start seeing black\\" and the song is set alight by a blazing guitar solo by that notorious axeman Elvis Costello! (we urge him with skills like these to undertake a forthcoming album of Hendrix covers).<br /><br />Its clear that producer Don Was has brought new discipline and focus to Williams's songs and gently rolling \\"Sweet love\\" will not leave a dry eye in the house. Its followed by one of the rockiest songs on the album the excellent soul ballad \\"Convince me\\" where Williams Southern drawl is most pronounced and most persuasive again punctuated by a raw guitar solo . It is however the slower songs which really grab you and both \\"Soldiers song\\" which resonates with some of the themes in PJ Harvey's new album, sees Williams most poignant singing for at least a decade and the stellar title track, which is my own personal favourite thus far, are absolute stand outs. If your lucky you may catch this album still streaming in full on the NPR site and its well worth setting aside a quiet hour to emerse yourself in this deeply powerful record which is easily Williams's best in a very long time. We are blessed indeed.gs which really grab you and both \\"Soldiers song\\" which resonates with some of the themes in PJ Harvey's new album, sees Williams most poignant singing for at least a decade and the stellar title track, which is my own personal favourite thus far, are absolute stand outs.

B000G75ANY|2.0|I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.  However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here.  Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed.  If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only.  Disappointing.  I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The Phenon II X6 1090T processor has lots of power for present day needs as well the needs for the next few years. Without overclocking and multiple virtual machines setup on it, I don't see the CPU usage reaching beyond 10%. For the price this processor is a great bargain investment. Hats's off to AMD for bringing such a powerful CPU at this price point.
030746363X|5.0|I cannot endorse this book for someone who is just starting on their weight loss or body transformation journey. I think it would be too overwhelming to read a book like this for someone just starting out. You have to be a little bit of a science/nutrition/fitness junkie to understand what this book is all about. You also have to be willing to have the people in your life look at you strangely when you put an icepack on the back of your neck every evening for 30 minutes and do air-squats before a big meal. If I could make a promise about this book it would be: this book will definitely focus your efforts and give you a jump start with motivation and dedication. Sometimes that is all people need - something to motivate them and get them off their keester. If you are already eating healthfully and exercising regularly, I doubt this will do much more than give you some alternative exercise moves and supplements to buy/take. Despite my criticism, I wholeheartedly think this book is worth the money. It is fascinating and will forever be a part of my fitness/nutrition/life library.
B00009R86L|4.0|In many ways this shoulder pad is a microcosm of Domke's bags--tough, effective, and not exactly sexy.  Like Domke's bags, there's nothing better out there, and alas like Domke's bags the question should be asked--why the heck isn't this included with the bags?  Seriously, bags that easily eclipse $100, especially those approaching $200, should come with some type of shoulder pad beyond a mere canvas strap.<br /><br />That issue aside, the strap does a good job of making the the task of carrying loads of heavy camera gear bearable.  I've yet to encounter the shedding others have described, and I found the width perfect for the strap on my [[ASIN:B000AEEXPO Domke 700-10D F-1X Little Bit Bigger Bag (Olive Drab)]]. If you're buying this for another manufacturer's bag or other heavy load, do check out the other comments and the listed measurements.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I found out about this game through browsing online reviews for highly rated DS games that I've never heard of before. If you're into story-driven puzzle adventures, then you'll enjoy this game. Not only did I play through this game at least seven times, but also dreamt about it when I wasn't playing it. While the replay value is high until you uncover enough of the story, I'd say beyond that point, I will likely never pick up the game again. That being said, I definitely got my money's worth. The story is revealed through the \\"choose your own adventure\\" style gaming, with earlier playthroughs making more sense in hindsight. Brilliant and original in approach, the game is effective in its \\"can't put this down until I figure out why\\" narrative. If this is representative of a new (to me) genre, then I'm hooked and am looking forward to more.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|So I didn't want to spend over $65, and was trying to decide between this model and the Sharkoon xtatic, I read all the reviews I could find patience to sift through and was torn.  So I ordered both.  Well I can tell you that these are definitely better in performance than the Sharkoon.  They provide great directional sound, and come with everything you need to hook up to your PS3.  when I was playing BFBC2 and had a sniper above me on a hill and to my 4 o'clock, I heard him moving and found him hiding there which allowed me to put a shotgun shell through his head.  sorry mr. sniper!<br />Some people commented on the looks, I think they look great. Besides, when I'm gaming I don't care what I look like.  Sometimes I'm playing in my boxers and a t-shirt. I don't get dressed up to game you know!<br />You hear stuff you never heard before playing games with these on, like teammates reloading, or launching grenades etc.  sometimes I hear someone behind me and turn around only to find a squad mate who has just spawned on my location.  They are awesome. just get them, you won't be disappointed.  by the way, i sent the sharkoon headset back. thank you for the great return policy amazon!

B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|The new album from Motorhead delivers just exactly what fans of the band expect.  Heavy rock n roll (not necessarily metal), delivered in a fast paced somewhat throwback style, that just plain rocks.  Motorhead have been on a bit of a comeback lately since 2004's excellent \\"Inferno\\" album.  Lemmy is 65 (not sure how old the other two guys are, but they are no spring chickens) and shows absolutely no sign of slowing down.  This album is chock full of songs that are actually kind of catchy.  Lemmy's growl is as course as ever and he even gets close to modern death metal vocal territory on \\"Brotherhood Of Man\\".  Phil pulls out some great guitar solos and Mickey is rock solid on drums.  Highlight tracks include \\"I Know When To Die\\", \\"Devil's In My Head\\", \\"Rock N Roll Music\\", the single \\"Get Back In Line\\" and the closing pearl of wisdom from Lemmy \\"Bye Bye Bitch Bye Bye\\".  Ya gotta love it!
B004DK5CYM|4.0|Being that I'm in my mid 50's I actually had the pleasure of seeing Secretariat run. An amazing horse to be sure. I like the fact that it's a Blu-Ray/DVD combo and the extras included on the disc. The movie is very well done and the racing scenes are particularly good. It didn't have the breadth or depth of Seabiscuit but still a good movie and worth owning. You will watch it multiple times.
B004C4IIPY|5.0|This is really a terrific album.  It has a sound all its own--and while one grasps for parallels in order to give it some context, I am surprised that I have not seen Chris Issak mentioned. It has a similar quality of some of his best songs in that the sound is rather otherworldly--it suggests/evokes the past, but yet is firmly entrenched in the present.  This is what makes it otherworldly.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|This by far is one of the most energetic and entertaining Billy Joel CD's ever released.  A great live version of his earlier work with his original band (no Piano Man here!) that really rocks the house.  Highly recommended.
B000001F7R|5.0|When listening to this album it takes me back, and I just cant believe how much they have changed over the years. This is the era when Def Leppard rocked. This is just a solid album with great songs. Its a shame that Joe Elliott disowns this album and sticks to their pop garbage during the shows. I appreciate all their albums up to HYSTERIA and Retro Active of course.  I have not really heard to much of their later albums except a few songs and they are all terrible in my opinion. I bought EUPHORIA used at FYE for $3 cause it got such high ratings on amazon. I cant believe that its the same band that produced Hello America, and Wasted. It was just generic pop music. But going back, this is an amazing album and if you are a Def Leppard fan and want to go back to where it all started purchase this album and enjoy. RIP Steve Clark
B0043GAZYS|5.0|If this film shows up in your recommendations, give it a chance. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I queued this up to rent a little while ago. I didn't expect it to be any good or memorable in the least. I was horribly wrong. This film is definitely now in my top-10 list of favorite movies. There is so much in here for the general audience to enjoy as a standalone from the graphic novel series, and quite a bit in here for the fans (after watching this movie, I ordered [[ASIN:1934964573 Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Boxset]] and I have recommended the series and the movie to everyone that I know).<br /><br />Now, I do have to admit, you may notice the generation gap in this film - some people just wont get it because this just isn't their world. Most teenagers and 20-somethings and a few older than that will surely admire it.  It's just the nature of this sort of movie.<br /><br />Give this film a chance and you may find it to be a new favorite.
B003L77GVK|5.0|Is there anything that we viewers can do to convince the SGU makers to reconsider cancellation? I can see there are fans all over and everybody seems to be sorry for the disapearance of the series. Come on, guys. Those of us who have been enjoying the show ask you to talk the matter over. This is a successful production and I'm sure something can be done to keep it going. Think about it.

0142000671|5.0|Yeah, I said it; this book is better than The Grapes of Wrath. It's also better than East of Eden. In fact, it's the best thing Steinbeck ever wrote. The author's use of interesting, human characters, quick dialogue and fast moving scenes is breathtaking- This is the only novel I have ever reread immediately after finishing it.    I will not discuss the plot because everyone else has always done that. I will only say that this is one of the four or five most important books of my life thus far. It opened my door to American literature, and really gave me an appreciation for reading.    After reading this, I was excited to read Steinbeck's \\"best\\" books, but it turned out I had already read it. Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, while both quite good, were both a little bit too long. Of Mice and Men, on the other hand, is not a word too long or too short. It's a beautiful, short character study, and you will be better for reading it.
0553381687|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read, and now I'm almost regretful about reading it.  For one, the book series may not be finished in more than a decade and it's just too good to wait for, reminds me of Dark Tower.  Another thing is that now I'm comparing every book I read to it and most other accomplished authors don't hold a candle to this man's ability to write.  Be warned, if you read this not only may not never see the end resolution but you will be spoiled and may never find another good author.
030745455X|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable literary ride which takes his first novel in the series to another level.  This is a spellbinding, page burning thriller that can rightfully claim:  Never a dull moment!  As the conclusion approached I wanted to stand up and cheer.  It is hard to imagine a more enjoyable read!
0786939532|4.0|I wholeheartedly enjoyed this novel.  The culture captivated me, and I'm interested in reading many more books not just about Drizzt, but about where he comes from.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I feel very few books are worthy of 5 stars and I did have some annoyance with how the author would talk about Drizzt's feelings of righteousness at times (not the fact that he had these feelings, but how they were described).  I have finished the first three books, and may eventually move on to the rest.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I read the free preview in its entirety hoping to really find an intelligent well researched witches and vampires story, but I was not impressed by what I read. The final blow came when the protagonist claims to have seen a lion chasing and killing an ibex in the Serengeti. The problem with that claim is that if the author had really done her research, she would have easily discovered that the ibex is mountain animal, while the Serengeti is a savanna without a mountain in sight. That made the claims of scholarly research done for this novel suspect to me.
037582913X|5.0|I read this as a child, and now I'm reading it to my child.  My daughter and I have so much fun with it, and she used to beg me to read it to her again and again.  The first time I read it to her, she was a little nervous about getting to the end!  Nothing wrong with this feel good kids book.

B004HW7JMY|5.0|I absolutely loved the first season and was really looking forward to this prequel, especially to see how some of the other gladiators got to where they were before Spartacus showed up. And I gotta say, I LOVED it! Seeing how Crixus joined the ludus was great, he's definitely one of my favorites. There were plot twists, great new characters and very different characters before we saw them in the first season. This show is awesome, visually amazing, and I love John Hannah and Lucy Lawless. They give wonderful performances of twisted, complex people.     I'm looking forward to season 2, although am saddened with the loss of Andy Whitfield, but am eager to see what they come up with next!

0060005696|5.0|It is rare to find a book that perfectly crystalizes a nagging feeling that you've had for a long time, but could never put into words.  The Paradox of Choice did just that for me.  It isn't much of an exaggeration to say this book changed my life.  Reading it makes you keenly aware of the folly of rampant consumerism, and just being aware of why the purchases you make may not bring you the satisfaction you hoped for puts you halfway to solving the problem.  Letting go of the need to have the absolute best of everything is very liberating.

0802130208|3.0|This novel is like a hairless cat -- cute and revolting. Undeniably, Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the most monstrously original characters in all of fiction, taking a back seat not even to the great worthies drawn by Dickens. He is all the more compelling because he is contemporary--and growing more contemporary all the time. All he needs is a cell phone and a computer and he threatens to become a generational representative of the 21st Century. He is surrounded by an almost equally zany and memorable cast, though the story itself is scarcely worth the price of the Big Chief tablet it was probably written on. The book defies categorization in the same way that junk food fails to fit into a food group. It is not \\"literature\\" in the sense that it deals with significant themes worth thinking about. Nor is it a good story, well told. But neither is it wholly worthless tripe. Perhaps the passage of a hundred years will transform Ignatius J. Reilly into a character of Ahab-like stature along with Moby-like dimensions. For now, it's just an ugly, amusing, disgusting, memorable, absurd farce that both appeals and repels in equal parts, like a comfortable, yellowed bedsheet that hasn't been washed in six months.
1416972242|4.0|City of Ashes is definitely a book that suffers from middle book syndrome. It feels like a bridge book that was just there to fill the gap between books one and books two and didn't really have any particular purpose of its own. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy reading it. I did. I just don't think it measured up to the first book, and now that I am well into City of Glass, I can say that it doesn't even come close to measuring up to the amazingness that is that book.<br /><br />The main reason I felt this book fell a bit flat was the plot. It just didn't seem to get going until the very end, and then everything seemed to get resolved rather quickly. However, there were a couple scenes in the middle of the book that I absolutely LOVED, but also hated at the same time (for those who have read the books: the Seelie Court scene and the Jewish graveyard scene). Those scenes will probably stick with me forever.<br /><br />One thing about Cassandra Clare's writing that I noticed in this book but didn't notice much in City of Bones was the fact that she REALLY likes similes. Now, I don't have a problem with similes in moderation, but I think she over-did it a bit in City of Ashes. Some of them work, but some of them are a little contrived and tend to take me out of the story. I found an example of a simile that I thought worked and one I thought didn't from the first chapter of City of Glass to illustrate my point:<br /><br />\\"Her suitcase was open like a clamshell on the bed...\\" This one didn't really work for me. I don't think it was necessary to convey the image of an open suitcase and it just took me out of the story for a bit a made me aware of the writer.<br /><br />\\"She sounded as tense and fragile as an overtightened violin string.\\" I liked this one because it didn't seem forced and didn't take me out of the story. I feel like it was necessary to describe just how Maryse's voices sounded, while the clam simile wasn't necessary to get across what the suitcase looked like.<br /><br />I haven't noticed many other similes in City of Glass that bothered me all that much, but they littered the pages of City of Ashes and prevented me from being as into the story as I could have been.<br /><br />More reviews can be found on my blog. Link in my profile!d many other similes in City of Glass that bothered me all that much, but they littered the pages of City of Ashes and prevented me from being as into the story as I could have been.

0385341008|5.0|This was my favorite book EVER EVER EVER.  Better than everything else.  The characters are SOOO great and quirky, and the humor is so side-splitting--I laughed and cried all the way through it.<br /><br />I was quite surprised, actually, to realize that the authors are American and not British as I had thought.<br /><br />I don't have much stomach for violence so the heavy part was difficult enough...but it did involve an occupation after all...so I guess that part and the ensuing plot points that go with that were necessary and also beautiful.  Don't want to write a spoiler so I'll remain vague.<br /><br />A beautiful book, delightful, quirky, hilarious.  At one of the scenes toward the end (involving that funny lady and some hiding out and running off a bad man) I laughed so hard I cried.  My husband started laughing from across the room it was so contagious.<br /><br />I SOOOO wish there could be more from this author!  I do hope her niece will write more.

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|The Pacific follows the stories of three Marines thru the Pacific Theater, as we go to Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pelielu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa before returning home following the war. I eagerly expected Band of Brothers II since most of the production team from BOB was involved in this series. What we got was a \\"Band of Brooders\\" as our three heroes spend nearly every waking hour \\"brooding\\" over something; the horrors of war, women, petty disagreements, more horrors of war. Yes, this did often happen during lulls in fighting, but these guys \\"brood\\" 24/7 (a recipe for getting killed quickly in combat).   We don't identify with any of these 3 characters, and the rest of the marines sort of come and go like cheap soap opera extras. If we are to believe this mini-series, the Marines were a haunted, untrained gaggle who somehow whipped the Japanese while constantly engaging in war crimes. I had the sense many of the battle scenes were mapped out by an 8 year-old playing Army Men in the back yard. What a disappointment!    Positives:  The music is beautifully done, even better than BOB (which says alot).  Great attention to detail was placed on getting all the equipment correct.  The naval landing scenes were well-done.  The final episode was nicely done, in stark contrast to much of the rest of the series.    Negatives:  If you don't know your WW2 Pacific history, you won't have any idea what is going on as the war progresses. There are no epilogues, just a Pacific map now and then with Hanks giving a mediocre explanation of a particular island.  Episode 8, Okinawa, was someone's attempt to steal the crown for most persistent use of the \\"F Bomb\\" from the movie Scarface. I have yet to talk to a WW2 vet who remembers cursing on the scale of BOB, much less like this. So much for realism...  Training is shown as almost non-existent for the Marines, as is strategy, tactics, cohesion, morale, etc. They just muddle thru it (sort of like most of the writing, directing and acting).Of course anything associated with HBO has to have gratuitous nudity, and this is no exception with (again) much more than BOB.    Summary: I liken The Pacific to the 2010 economic stimulus; you can throw lots of money at something but if your overall plan is flawed you're still doomed. It's really a shame.

B004HGBUVG|4.0|This new release of Lucinda's contains a great mix of \\"touching/heart-felt\\", original, \\"folk rock\\", songs. Lucinda is legendary for writing these types of songs. Once, \\"London Rocker\\", Elvis Costello even compared her to Hank Williams, when it comes to writing songs, \\"straight from the heart\\". Also, she is similar to William Falkner, when it comes to \\"telling stories\\". Terry Lickona, producer of Austin City Limits TV Show, has described Lucinda as \\"simple folk, gutsy blues, heart-worn country, American roots, & rock & roll. However, the bottom line, in my opinion is that Lucinda has her own unique style of singing & songwriting, that sets her apart from Hank Williams, or any other living or deceased artist. Her style cannot be duplicated.  Anyway, her legacy of her unique type of singing & songwriting continues in this great new release.    Also, Lucinda is originally from Lake Charles, in my home state of Louisiana, where she continues to be very popular. Lucinda's Dad, Miller Williams is a well renouned poet.  Lucinda was covered in the recently released book \\"Louisiana Rocks\\", by Tom Aswell. Her and this album are also featured in the current issue of \\"American Songwriter\\", magazine.    The music on disc one of this deluxe edition, is \\"rich, full & deep\\", because you get a rich mix, of 11 other musicians, playing all kinds of instruments, on these songs, accompaning Lucinda. Even, Elvis Costello, is included on some tracks playing lead, electric guitar.    Overall, the songs touch on emotions, both positive and negative. The song \\"Blessed\\", is a great theme song for this album, and it points out the \\"heart-felt\\", ways we are blessed.    If you like Lucinda Williams, you'll love this album, plain & simple. Thanks & enjoy!!!
B003EY7IUY|2.0|I wish I had read the reviews of this book before I purchased it for my kindle, because I might have saved myself $13.  It is the same old storyline, recycled (for the what, seventh time?)  I adored the other books, but I think Becky and her schtick got old for me.   I found myself skipping over entire portions of the book and actually disliking the Becky character.  What a shame!  I won't waste my  money on another book in this series.
B004DMIIOG|4.0|Anime should always look this good. The funniest part is how the Japanese can't find another villain outside their borders except for the United States of America.. just can't. The family part within is the heart of the movie and it should be applauded for it and the moments without stand above all. Mamorou Oshii rebellion against his country bleeded into absolute Hatred for America and you see it in almost everything he's done, and so too does it effect the ones who follow him. This is why ragheads continue their rage against whatever they've been raggin' against now. That's a shame this movie had to do this and not something new and unique.  _  Overall, it's a great looking Anime. If you like that kinda of stuff, this is a Must Buy!  _  '88 veteran
0792844882|3.0|I have seen it before. It was what I had expected.   I just wanted to share it with someone.
B002L5R75S|1.0|After my sister gave me an incredible review of this group, I was quite hopeful. My sister (a 49 year old single mom) said that they practically saved her life. So with an open mind I gave the CD a spin.<br /><br />I don't see how anyone can possibly enjoy the CD. The songs all sound the same, and the production values are absolutely terrible. Every song has what sounds like the same banjo strumming in the background and the same background vocal ensemble and instrumentalists, and even if the banjo and the ensemble were good, they're mixed so badly that the result is a muddy mess, reminiscent of the Phil Spector \\"Wall of Sound\\" without the clarity or inventiveness.  Marcus Mumford uses the same vocal \\"hook\\" throughout the CD, and it sounds like nothing more than an affectation.<br /><br />Lyrically I thought that their target demographics must be freshmen lit majors. While now and then there's a good line, like \\"For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt\\" for the most part the lyrics remind me of a poet who is just learning to write. Even a bad poet occasionally stumbles upon a good line. Most of the lyrics are on par of \\"I never meant you any harm/But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm\\". What next, is he going to write about the single strand of hair left on his pillow after his lover left him? Or, take this: \\"Weep for yourself, my man/You'll never be what is in your heart/Weep Little Lion Man/You're not as brave as you were at the start/Rate yourself and rake yourself/Take all the courage you have left/Wasted on fixing all the problems/That you made in your own head\\" - Again, this sounds like high school poetry, filled with angst and emotion.<br /><br />My wife and I both gave up after listening to about half the CD. The next day, I tried again, and practically had to grit my teeth. I made it through the cd to the live tracks, and by then I was desperate to get that noise out of my ears. My wife and I both found the CD to be supremely irritating.<br /><br />Perhaps this CD suffers only because it's their first album. Maybe they'll improve, or get a different producer. But I will never willingly play this CD again. I'm listing it for sale through Amazon.s only because it's their first album. Maybe they'll improve, or get a different producer. But I will never willingly play this CD again. I'm listing it for sale through Amazon.

B0034G4P7G|3.0|Aaron Sorkin won an Academy Award for his adapted screenplay for \\"The Social Network\\", which takes inspiration from Ben Mezrich's book \\"The Accidental Millionaire\\", an agenda-driven account of the creation of the world's most popular social networking web site: Facebook. Director David Fincher brings his dark palette and perfectionism to the story, which begins in the fall of 2003 on the campus of Harvard University. Sophomore Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) hacks the web sites of student houses in search of photos of female undergrads, which he then uses to create a face book where students can vote on who is hotter. Charming. That prank attracted the attention of a pair of blue-blooded identical twin jocks, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer), who solicit Zuckerberg's help in building a social networking site for Harvard.<br /><br />\\"The Social Network\\" uses the subsequent lawsuits against Zuckerberg by the Winklevoss brothers, their business partner Divvya Narendra (Max Minghella), and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) to follow the creation of the web site until its millionth member. There is not much to this story. Facebook was created by a bunch of guys sitting in front of their laptops for days on end...coding. The lawsuits allow the film to jump around in time in order to keep the audience engaged. I have to give David Fincher credit for doing the best job yet at making typing and staring at a computer monitor interesting. The non-linear narrative helps. But mostly Fincher accomplishes this through fictionalizing the history of Facebook.<br /><br />There is a lot of cross-cutting to scantily-clad young women at various raucous parties. It helps that Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) of Napster fame is in the mix as one of Facebook's early advisors. He was forced to leave the company after a cocaine bust. \\"The Social Network\\" is a creation myth. I don't object to that in itself. It's an entertaining movie. I was amazed by how fast the 2 hours flew by, especially since nothing much happened. But a movie about the creation of one of the internet age's most influential social instruments needs to either give us the facts for the historical record or say something intelligent about the implications of this open global community. Barring that, it could at least provide an accurate representation of the personalities involved.<br /><br />\\"The Social Network\\" doesn't attempt any of those things. It doesn't have any ambition. It's a showcase of impressive craftsmanship without substance. Mark Zuckerberg seems like an upbeat person in interviews and comments by his friends. He's brooding and sullen in the movie. Not only does the film fabricate a lot of narrative, it omits too many of the details of Saverin's ouster from the company and of Zuckerberg's less savory activities. No one comes out looking good, but that's not because the film is critical; it's just because everyone is obnoxious. I came away from \\"The Social Network\\" impressed by the editing and struck by how unambitious the film was.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|AFTERTHOUGHT:  What Wall Street greed did to the economy with the aid of its corrupt US Government enablers, the US Government did to US society and to global stability, spending trillions a year on the wrong things for the wrong reasons.  See my chapter on \\"Paradigms of Failure\\" in the book (both here at Amazon and free online) ELECTION 2008: Lipstick on the Pig.<br /><br />The other reviews are very good and I strongly recommend that whether or not you buy or rent the DVD (or watch it in a hotel as I have just done), that you read all the reviews, especially those that provide summary detail.<br /><br />For myself, this movie is most extraordinary for the manner in which it pieces together the story to include very compelling interviews with many of the culprits including professors of economics who themselves were corrupted.  Those who declined to be interviewed, including Laura Tyson, Paulson, Geithner, Greenspan, Summers, and a few others, are the worst of the culprits.<br /><br />Compellingly--and consistent with all my reading on the two-party tyranny and the corruption of the US Government--the film is especially strong in showing with absolute clarity that the Obama Administration has been, if anything, more of a Wall Street front than any  prior administration.  \\"Nobody's gone to jail.\\"  Worse, there have been no serious investigations.  The US Government is NOT representing the public interest.<br /><br />My focus with this review is to point to ten books that I have reviewed in summary form:<br />[[ASIN:0385529953 Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America]]<br />[[ASIN:B002CMLQVQ The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash]]<br />[[ASIN:0300119712 The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism]]<br />[[ASIN:0684862204 The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy]]<br />[[ASIN:1888363827 Profit Over People: Neoliberalism & Global Order]]<br />[[ASIN:B002HOQ9DE Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism]]<br />[[ASIN:0385495048 One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism, and the End of Economic Democracy]]<br />[[ASIN:0767911792 Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story]]<br />[[ASIN:0965082849 The Informant :A True Story.]]<br />[[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]]risis of American Capitalism]]  [[ASIN:0385495048 One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism, and the End of Economic Democracy]]  [[ASIN:0767911792 Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story]]  [[ASIN:0965082849 The Informant :A True Story.]]  [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]]

1439102724|2.0|I read SING YOU HOME in one sitting. I loved the story, but was disappointed at the portrayal of Zoe's work with Lucy. Talk about an unprofessional therapist. The scene in the cafeteria is would never, ever happen. A therapist would never tell a bunch of cafeteria workers that her client is suicidal--that's against HIPPA and any code of ethics or conduct known to man. Then later in the trial-- there's a question about medical records as it applies to HIPPA so that's a huge inconsistency. Zoe jumps to conclusions that Lucy is lesbian because she says, \\"not a boy\\" but never considers the possibility that it could be TONS of other things, like the girl was being molested for starters. She talks about countertransference earlier, which leads us to believe that Zoe is self aware, yet she doesn't realize the other possibilities.<br />Also, we are led to believe that Clive spends his time crusading against gays, yet he doesn't realize that his own step-daughter is seeing Zoe for music therapy or that her guidance counselor, who is out of the closet to some, is gay. What about after the trial starts? Additionally, Vanessa talks about Lucy's (step)father, but neither Vanessa nor Clive realize who each other is, even at the start of the trial. Zoe has read Lucy's file--her stepfather's name would have been in that file. Lucy's mother would have her current husband's last name, not Dubois Lucy's last name.<br />While I am against everything the character Clive stands for, I think his character was not well developed. He seemed like a cookie-cutter Fred Phelps wannabe. How does this show \\"both sides\\" of the story when the bad guys have no redeeming qualities. Even the murderer on death row had redeeming qualities in one of Picoult's other books.<br /><br />I liked the story, even though it was a bit predictable. I figured our Lucy was Clive's daughter (or rather step daughter) very early on. I loved the character's of Zoe and Vanessa and their relationship, even though it seemed a little too perfect. It wasn't Jodi's best work.<br /><br />The music left a lot to be desired. After finally listening to the CD I want those 35 minutes back. I kept hoping the songs would be better. I didn't like the vocalist's voice. I picture's Zoe having a grainier, more soulful voice. I'd have rather paid less for the book w/o the CD.erfect. It wasn't Jodi's best work.

B001HN694K|5.0|This is a wonderful film, a classic for all time and every age. All aspects, music, each scene, every role, with the possible exception of Anne Hathaway's (and I think that's Tim Burton's only failure here) is sublime. Its most remarkable aspect, however, is Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter, a performance that reaches new heights. His eyes, his facial expressions convey more in a flash, mere seconds really, than any actor has conveyed in hours and hours of performance -- hell, entire careers really -- especially the scene in which he resumes his hat-making at the behest of the evil queen and Alice arrives. From Alice's entrance to exit, Depp utters no more than 50-60 words -- the critical line has three -- but his stunning face reflects a lifetime, a history, a tour de force of emotions, volumes and volumes. In an instant. The pace is lightning. So fast. Maybe that's why Depp hasn't gotten the credit deserved. Hopefully, this DVD will provide the opportunity for closer, more thoughtful appreciation of a stunning performance that, personally, I don't expect to see equalled.

0446619078|5.0|Michael Connelly always writes with a purpose. And not only that, he does it well! He makes his work personal, and he makes sure it counts. I was somewhat disappointed with \\"The Concrete Blonde,\\" yet finished it, determined to find out if the next mystery for Harry Bosch, \\"The Last Coyote,\\" would be better. I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />We find Harry Bosch on suspension after attacking a supervisor he truly despises, we find his home a wreck, and we find him missing the woman he loves out of the picture. We also find him digging deeper for something that means something to him, and that's the murder of his mother. Like a lone wolf, or in this case, a coyote, Bosch goes on the prowl, and takes on the top dogs that could do him more harm than good. And whether he's suspended or not, whether his shrink recommends it or not, Harry Bosch is going to work! He knows what his mission is. Look out!<br /><br />This is just awesome, because in this case, either everybody counts or nobody counts. Michael Connelly puts Harry Bosch on his mission, and keeps the pages turning! It also helps knowing that a brilliant man like Connelly occupies his time reading James Lee Burke, as hinted within the pages here. That means that Connelly stands for something. And whether we admit it or not, we all have that place in our hearts that strives to see justice served! And with all that said, I'm eager to hear the tune of the \\"Trunk Music\\" played in the next day in the life of Harry Bosch!

B00406UK7S|4.0|This was a surprisingly entertaining flick. I wonder, though, why Romans are usually played by British actors. The Patricians always speak as though they were educated at Oxford and the Plebs sound like the Gecko in that annoying commercial. The perfect example of that being the BBC/HBO TV mini-series \\"Rome\\". Hey! If New Yawker Tony Curtis could pull off being General Crassus's Houseboy in \\"Spartacus\\", I guess having a London accent ain't all that bad. Fortunately, Olga Kurylenko was cast as the mute Pict guide/tracker/hunter Etain and didn't have to try to convince me that she was a lass who just happened to walk off a modeling runway in Moscow onto the Scottish Highlands.    Anyway, \\"Centurian\\" was a fun movie to watch just to spot all the similarities it had in it to other movies you've probably seen, e.g., \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", \\"The Naked Prey\\", \\"Gladiator\\", the aforementioned \\"Spartacus\\", to name a few. One reviewer likened it to old cowboy and indian movies.     I won't go into the plot of \\"Centurion\\", as others here have already done so. I simply want to say that this was an entertaining movie to watch, despite all the chopping and hacking off of body parts and buckets of CG blood. Watch the film and don't expect anything more than an action/adventure romp through a small part of Roman Britannia. 4 stars.

006201563X|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

0743297334|4.0|Quoting our book club secretary: \\"Hemingway captures the essence of the Lost Generation of American expatriates in Europe after World War I. Our book club decided that while we did not like the characters in the book, we could see that Hemingway shows their disillusionment, depression, immorality, dishonesty, carelessness, and angst. Jake Barnes, the most 'stable' of the characters, seems to be the voice of the author as he tries to make some sense of the confusion and alcohol-fueled madness of his friends. Although they are always celebrating, no one in the book seems particularly happy--perhaps mirroring Hemingway's own inner feelings of sadness and lack of self worth. We talked about a number of quotes from the book and saw this one as summing up its theme: 'You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that.' The discussion was lively and far-ranging.\\"

B004GHYCKW|1.0|I am reminded of the pycadelic song about the flower poeple that Tap sang in spinal tap.  That happy pappy hippy sound that makes one want to vomit.  Three bad records in a row from one of my favorite rockers.  To bad and so sad that there is no more rock in the world of Harvey just a sad sound that could be used in a spinal tap sequal...
0920668372|1.0|I can understand a lot of the positive comments about this book. This book is a real tear jerker if you are an adult, especially if you are awash in post-pregnancy hormones, missing your own deceased parent, or regretting that your baby is going to grow up and leave home one day. Buy it for *yourself* if you love it.  HOWEVER: As a Ph.D. psychologist, I have to warn that you can expect this book to be very anxiety-provoking for many if not most young children.  I am surprised that it was published/marketed for young kids.  Children simply don't think like adults, period. Children think very literally.  Most very young children also have no concept of death, aging, or the realistic passage of time.  Read it to little kids only if you want them to have nightmares that involve you dying and leaving them to fend for themselves in the world.
B001UV4XUG|1.0|I got the case, which seemed fine. I opened the case to find a very strange looking DVD. The front was labeled (500) Days of Summer, and I don't doubt that it was the right disk, but...    The back of the disk was completely warped. It was bumpy and strange looking, almost twisted, yet the disk wasn't out of shape. Needless to say, it didn't work.
B000O59AFW|5.0|I have I and III on Blu-Ray so I just needed to get II and I'm glad I did.  The action scenes are so much more crisp and \\"live\\" that I almost feel like I'm in the movie.  Blu-Ray is the best thing ever!
B003H6KRIE|3.0|Great movies, but not the highest-quality blu-ray. The film is fairly grainy, especially in low-light scenes. From a moderate distance it isn't too noticeable though.
B00447G2PM|4.0|It's a very good movie to showcase your 3D tv to your friends and to watch once,  maybe twice.  My personal opinion would be to wait until you can get it for $20-25 for the simple fact that you can only watch it so many times before it sits on the shelf,  waiting for the next time a friend stops by.  Some parts of the movie are a little rough on the eyes because there is a lot happening and it's real bright during some points in the movie.  With that being said,  I did enjoy it and it does look like you're under the water with the wildlife (some scenes more than others),  but I would wait until the price is right.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|This is another well made Lowepro product.  As to size, a can of soda fits easily inside with about an inch of room at the top (so you can compare your camcorder size). It is very well padded and somewhat stiff, should offer good protection.  No long strap however.  The shorter strap can be hooked around anything else you are carrying, I hook it around my purse handle.<br />My Canon 2000x camcorder fits neatly within.  This is a nice compact case, great for taking your camcorder out and about.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|i must disagree with you. the music has the standard simplicity (yet complex composure) that ALW always brings to the table. the melodies are very memorable and i find them floating through my mind without being aware they are even there...until i'm captivated by their beauty once again.  i contend that being famous and having to believe on some level that you are loving someone who may be divided in their affections for you must be hard, and hence the changes in Raoul. i find them not only plausible, but memorecent of how life, itself, can change us over time, both good and bad, not only from its experiences but from our perspectives as we go through each day. perhaps the Phantom has found his goodness from that innocent love from Christine and chose to make something positive of himself as a result?   the characters are well balanced and very human, relatable, with emotions that i hope we have all felt at least once in our lives to give us the maturity that \\"Love Never Dies\\" affords us to once again experience.   the songs \\"Look With Your Heart\\", \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\", and \\"Once Upon Another Time\\" intertwine to touch our hearts with what the Phantom and Christine shared in the catacombs not only of the opera house, but in their souls.   the plot is captivating and keeps you wondering how the next scene will play out. the twist at the end is heart-rendering.  this is one that i cannot wait to see!! the music already has me totally captivated. the lyrics are vivid and urges you to see this production for yourself if for no other reason than to see if your \\"mental eye\\"s' interpretation is the same as the actual actions played on stage.   from its lilting melodies to its grandest operatic compositions this work is more than enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, well constructed, and memorable. certainly not an expected remake of the music in the original, yet with hints of flavor you'll sweetly recognize, this stands on its own to pacify our curiosity of what happenedafter the original \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" but will, indeed, make you almost sad that now there are few, if any, more questions to be answered.   if you are a 'phan' of the first, this second is surely NOT to be missed!
B000E6UK32|5.0|This Blondie greatest hits collection, with one cd featuring 20 of their hits and most popular songs and a DVD with 16 music videos, is one of the best my best cd buys in a long time - the discs are constantly in my cd and dvd players.  I always liked Blondie as a group but never actually had bought an album of theirs before - probably afraid their \\"punk music\\" image might dominate their albums and be less appealing than their famous pop radio hits of the past, maybe I felt the campy edge of things like THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS would be too strong, but if this collection is any indication of the full Blondie discography I'm ready to join the Blondie fan club!!  The songs are great and span every path of American pop/rock from the girl group sound (a neat trick with only one girl!) to rap to hard rock to techno.<br /><br />Listening to this collection makes me realize what an underrated singer Deborah Harry is.  I'm thinking she may even be the best pop/rock female vocalist of the past 35 years. Her voice is terrific and extremely versatile.  And how amazing that songs recorded 20 years after some of the earliest tracks blend in seamlessly with the earlier works; certainly one would never guess the singer is now 20 years older.<br /><br />The Billboard smashes of course are all here.  HEART OF GLASS sounds as fresh and new today as it did 30 years ago. The band really rocks out in the sensational, underrated followup hit DREAMING.  Their 1999 number one British hit MARIA deserved a similar status in America but alas our pop/radio is much too ageist and sexist to have a 55-year-old female vocalist have a smash record even if it's a great song and great performance.  New songs to me that I loved include SUNDAY GIRL, HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE, and UNION CITY BLUE.<br /><br />Great to see these old music videos as well, nearly all of them made before the MTV era of expensive, complicated productions.<br /><br />This greatest hits compilation succesfully accomplishes what a greatest hits collection should do - feature the artist at their band and create new interest and new fans.  It certainly did it for me - I can't wait to get more BLONDIE music!tion should do - feature the artist at their band and create new interest and new fans.  It certainly did it for me - I can't wait to get more BLONDIE music!
143350393X|5.0|This bible is very good. My copy had no printing issues that I've read about. I have the forest/tan hard copy and a kindle version in which I read on my kindle and iPad. I prefer the hard copy for actual home study, but the iPad copy to bring to church is way more convenient as the hard copy is THICK!<br />This is my second study bible. I have a MacArthur study bible that is also good, but I think I find this one more middle of the road in doctrine (with maybe a slight more tilt to conservatism) and I really like the ESV translation. Easy to read and sophisticated, but not so everyday language that the true meaning of text gets muddied.<br />The free online ESV is a little difficult to navigate to at first, but once you get to the right login screen and you enter the code you get a really nice online version. It will actually read the text to you if you so desire and there are areas to take notes, highlight and bookmark text....a real value for the price.

0756404738|5.0|As the author so wonderfully stated in the interview posted above, Kvothe as we knew him in  his \\"Name of The Wind\\" personal narrative, was awfully young and naive-despite the great deeds he managed to accomplish whenever he wasn't being too stupid for his own good- and not very swashbuckling. That's the kind of thing that's hard to do when your always falling on your face But the slightly older Kvothe who lives within these pages is on the steps of manhood (and is a tad more coordinated)-and now it is time for him to buckle a little swash.     If you're worried about the Swashbuckling changing the atmosphere of the book don't be. Like its predecessor this novel is filled with all of the staples of classic fantasy- a tragic hero with a murdered family to avenge from a terrible, unknown and perhaps impossible to harm, enemy. Survival skills, learned after the deaths of his parents when he became a street boy-distrust, resourcefulness and how to fight with your life and more to keep what you needed or held dear. . A beautiful, mysterious girl ,a school were magic is taught- a mortal enemy, And last but not least a crazy but brilliant wizard who eventually deems the hero in making worthy and takes him under his wing to learn real magic, lands of magical creatures, learning sword craft...    But all these classic elements are twisted around somehow- turning them from the classic fantasy hero path into the life of an extraordinary man. Because he is extraordinary tales are told about him-his deeds, his faults, his intelligence and skill at nearly everything. His music. And though Kvothe, retreated from the world for years and replaced by Kote- an innkeeper in a sleepy little town who has no happiness, no laughter, no love, no hope and no desire except to die- is presented with an opportunity by the Chronicler himself (the great debunker of myths) to tell his own life story and set the record straight. It will take three days.     Today is number two. But even as Kvotheis lost in his story, safe in his inn where there are things no normal innkeeper who had or could afford (in fact, not many high ranking nobles could afford them) dangers gather outside-dangers Kvothe seems to know a great deal about. But isn't talking. Or more accurate, he is only talking enough for his life story to be in print. For aside from death, the tale of his life truthfully told is the only thing he wants.    I won't summarize-we've all waited too long to be hit by spoilers. So lets just say this part of the story consists of more of Kvothe's constant misadventures and strange tales, time at his wondrous school and ventures into new lands, new magic's and new dangers and vanishing and oh-so mysterious lady love. Not to mention the slowly unraveling mystery of the unlimited promise of his future- the words and deeds that will make him a legend and are hinted at whenever anyone brings up his name. To put it simply-we learn more about Kvothe's life and come closer to the reason or reasons for his current mood and apparent membership in the hero/legend/anti-hero/kingslayer protection program.     This book is truly excellent-every bit as good as the first (and longer, which I like. More to go around.)  The characters here are so real-so flawed and rude and childish when they should be wise, irrational and cruel when they should want to teach and pass on their knowledge-for it does literally  no good to hoard it like a miser. This world is so well developed, the landscape and different animals so real you can see them in your minds eye quite clearly. But the best thing about this trilogy is the amazing grasp that Rothfuss has on the nature of stories-the way they bend and circle and spiral out, turning into something you never expected. This is a man who has read his share of books. And I don't mean just read them-if you spend enough time around stories you start to learn how they grow and how most people will construct them. The tricks a writer will use to shock and amaze can become formulaic and predictable. That is not the case here. There is nothing ordinary or formulaic about this story's construction. It makes it nearly impossible to guess what happens next.     This book was well worth the hype, hope and waiting. But if you're new to this series do not start with this book! I don't know why you would but in case your wondering-don't. This is a trilogy and it is meant to be read in order.    Like many of Patrick Rothfuss' devotees I, as the release date for this book came closer and closer, went back to re-read \\"The Name of The Wind\\"- just to see if there was anything I forgot. There was a lot. But  if you didn't or couldn't re-read \\"The Name of The Wind\\" before \\"Wise Mans Fear\\" or if you just want a great, smart laugh, there is this really excellent little comic recapping, in the form of a quick refresher of the play \\"the name of the wind\\" before these players put on the inaugural performance of \\"wise mans fear.\\" It's truly hysterical and I hope it's published someday.  You can find it on Patrick Rothfuss' blog.     Five stars. I thought I couldn't wait for this second novel in the trilogy to come out. Now I think I'll have to take up heavy drinking or something to pass the horrible time in between now and the publication of the third book.

When I started watching \\"The Sound of Music\\" that was still VHS. Than when the movie came out DVD, I bought it too. And now Blu-ray version, ofcoz I got it too. The picture and sound was so much better than the DVD. And the price was so resonable. GOOD TO BUY!!!!

B003O86FMW|3.0|This second book was definitely not as good as the second one until near the end when things started getting quicker.  The first half of the book is a slow read, unlike the first book.  I actually started getting annoyed with the main characters cause they seemed kind of childish at times.  It did pick up near the end and now I am going to start the third, and last, book.  I really can't wait until the movies start getting made.  In a nutshell, this book is worth the read just to get to the last book.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|What's not to like... who doesn't have a facebook? You definitely want to watch THE MOVIE to see how Mark Zuckerberg, a harvard computer science student, turn one of his random ideas into a multi BILLION dollar company. You'll laugh and you will definitely be entertained, and hell if your like me, you'll finish the movie feeling motivated into becoming a billionaire.     Buying a blu ray copy was a MUST for me.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|The screenplay of \\"Morning Glory\\" is penned by Aline Brosh McKenna, better known for her works including \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"27 Dresses.\\" This time around the romantic comedy's heroine is Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams), an aspiring morning show producer of a national TV network, who has to deal with very difficult people.     The most difficult person happens to be Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), a curmudgeonly veteran journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner, who accepts his new job as a host of a TV show DayBreak just because of money. According to Adam (Patrick Wilson), another producer and love interest of Becky, Mike Pomeroy is the third worst person in the world and Adam is not obviously joking. To make matters worse, he simply doesn't like the show's longtime personality Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton), and he is not willing to hide it even before the camera.    Like Anne Hathaway's Andy in \\"Prada,\\" Rachel McAdams plays a feisty and overall likable heroine effortlessly, but some might find her a bit too feisty. Her character goes to extraordinary lengths to boost the show's sagging ratings, which is amusing to see, but with her underdeveloped back story, we are not allowed to know much about this charming heroine. The subplot about her romance with Adam is terribly underwritten.    Unlike such films as \\"Network,\\" \\"Morning Glory\\" does not offer satire of or insight into the TV industry, which is fine with me. Directed by Roger Michell (\\"Notting Hill\\"), \\"Morning Glory\\" is sweet and charming enough as a comedy, but as a romance it is disappointing.

This was without words enough to describe it the most fantastic and entertaining concert we have ever seen.  The finale had us on the edge of our seats.  It was truly an enchanting evening.  To see all the Val Jean's and the real Marius.  Must see for any play goer.
0307455874|1.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I am not a fan of President Obama's. That being said, I still gave the book a shot. Anyone who is even a casual follower of political campaigns has already heard Obama use most of what is in this book as a part of countless speeches and/or debates. I was hoping that he would provide more scholarly, evidence-based support for some of his political views in this book. He rehashes his views, points out some things that he only assumes to be evidence of why his views are correct (assuming causation with no evidence to establish it as fact), and throws in a few mildly interesting personal stories to keep the reader from falling asleep. Overall, it is a mile wide and an inch deep intellectually speaking. It provides very little new information about the man. It is filled to the brim with generalities, assumed causation, platitudes, and completely devoid of any sort of really gutsy/specific/realistic ideas for effective \\"change\\" in Washington DC. This book is fluff, with all do respect to my President.
1577314808|3.0|This book will probably not change anyone's life. It is a little self-righteous, kind of you'll-understand-when-you're-older style, but I liked it. It's an easy read and a great concept! It is well written and a state of being that deserves attention. If this book is calling to you, or you find your mind racing and worrying about everything except what is happening right now at this moment, then this book will bless your life!
0385341679|5.0|Before I say anything on the content, let me just say that I loved the plastic cover and the interwoven artwork between the see-through cover and hardcover of the book itself. They're so pretty.<br /><br />That said - I loved it. Utterly and totally loved it.<br /><br />I hated - HATED! - the DUN DUN DUN Soprano's-like suspenseful endings of the past books and didn't have any high expectations from the first page, but it sucked me right in. This book took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.<br /><br />Okay okay, so not all the mysteries were solved. We still don't know what race Barrons and his eight are. Christian's fate hangs in the balance. Dani's still out there, thinking Mac's out for her blood. In the Highlander books' canon, the fae elixir of immortality changes a mortal's attitude - but - Cruce himself doesn't even know exactly what he gave Mac, and the UK's elixir isn't the same as the fae elixir. The walls are down. Mac owes the Gray Lady a favor. The Seelies are left leaderless. For all we know, Mac's turning or already is an (or the only!) Seelie Princess left. Etcetera, list all of the other open-enders here, etcetera... but I just loved how KMM wove everything together.<br /><br />The hair-pulling frustration I felt at not knowing certain things in the first four books fall into place.  I am content.<br /><br />Best KMM book, so far, IMO.<br /><br />Definitely a recommended series. Worth every penny. And if you buy through Amazon, it's an absolute steal at fifteen dollars!
B004NFB4EO|5.0|Let's face it folks, in this day and age there is nothing original. Nothing in movies, television or music. It's all been done before. You know what ... it's something that we're just going to have to get used to.  I first heard this song and knew instantly that it sounded familiar but that's what I liked about it. Gaga is a talent whether or not people want to admit it. Maybe out of spite, maybe out of jealousy. One thing I know for sure is that this song gets in your head and gets you bopping about and that's what good music is supposed to do. It's not supposed to change the world we live in or feed the hungry ... it's just supposed to make you feel good for a few minutes.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|UNSTOPPABLE is adrenaline-driven escapism at its best.  Cliches?  Yes, but in an expected way.  We watch this movie to see the train run away.  The subplots are the necessry \\"evil\\", but Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are appropriately likeable so we care about their personal crises/cliches.<br />Director Tony Scott keeps the action moving and the camera/stunt crew are professional.<br />It's entertaining and worth a look!
B003TXKSWK|4.0|The little man on my right shoulder wants me to call this the best covers album I've ever heard; the little man on my left shoulder is telling me to contain my hyperbole. At the very least, this is one of the top releases of 2010. Inspired by the election of Barack Obama and upset about the wars our nation is engaged in, John Legend and The Roots got together to cover lesser-known socially-conscious songs from the '60s and 70s. I'm not the biggest John Legend fan; he never does a bad job, but I don't think is voice is as soulful as he does. However, The Roots reestablish themselves as the funkiest, most flexible band around, easily switching from funk to soul to gospel to R&B to pop to reggae. Without The Roots, this project would have flopped; they should get top billing. All this AND they rock it five nights a week as the house band for Jimmy Fallon. This is a fantastic album - the only downside is that eventually the listener becomes aware that these songs are, unfortunately, still relevant 40 years after they were written.    While most of these tracks hit, there are a few clunkers. My favorites include the funky Compared To What, Wake Up Everybody, Our Generation, Hang On In There, and I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free. It takes courage to cover Donny Hathaway, and the cover of Little Ghetto Boy doesn't quite measure up to the rest of the album. Also, Wholly Holy just proves that Legend shouldn't try to cover Marvin Gaye. Ever. I'm afraid to comment on the only original piece on the disc, the closer, Shine. This was written by Legend for the psuedo-documentary Waiting For Superman and I'm afraid this posting will quickly get off topic. The show-stopper on this disc is the superb take on Bill Wither's epic anti-war anthem, I Can't Write Left Handed. Starting softly and calmly, this song continually builds for 6 ½ minutes until guitarist Captain Kirk Douglas rips into a face-melting two minute solo that puts Legend in the corner. Then the band brings itdown before revving it back up for another killer guitar solo. The whole thing last 11 ½ minutes and I'm just drained at the end. This track alone is worth the price of the CD.
014241543X|2.0|I bought this book because of recommendations but found it to be a disappointment. The literary level is not high and the plot is predictable. I did not think it was a memorable story.
B0043RSE2M|4.0|My girlfriend and I picked out Despicable Me to test out our new 3D TV.  We didn't expect too much from the movie, but we were pleasely surprised. The 3D looked great, and the story was fun and made us laugh, even at 20+ years old.  It probably won't go down in history, but the film is certainly worth a watch.

0316044695|4.0|Marcus Luttrell and Navy SEAL Team 10 have been assigned on a mission, Operation Red WIngs, designed to kill or capture a high-ranking Taliban leader responsible for the deaths of several U.S. Troops. As their mission unfolds, the team of four SEALs finds themselves overlooking a small Afghan village staked out silently in nearby mountains to catch a glimpse of their target. The men have their sniper rifles focussed intently on the village patiently awaiting the arrival of the hunted terrorist when unexpectedly, three innocent sheep herders stumble upon the team's hideout.    Instantaneously the SEAL team detains the herders and discuss their crippling dilemma: Do they let the innocent Afghanis live, or do they kill them? If they let them live, they face the very real possibility that the herders will return to the town and inform the Taliban of the team's presence. If they kill them, they will be faced with criminal charges back in the United States, as well as living with the memory of killing innocent people who harbored no hostile intend towards Luttrell and his team.    After a great deal of arguing, SEAL Team 10 decides to release the herders. This becomes the crucial decision that defines operation Red Wings, and makes `The Lone Survivor' a spectacular read.    The tale seems outrageous, unlikely, and downright impossible in many instances, but it is a true story of how Luttrell lives out the ramifications of the decision to let the herders go free. (The story follows a lengthy summary of Luttrell's training as a SEAL which was intriguing and surprising to say the least) I felt like I was watching Black Hawk Down, Behind Enemy Lines, or some other gripping war movie - this inspiring true story will in the very least entertain you, and will most likely force you to reexamine your feelings on war, the news media, and current U.S. Rules of engagement.    The book is written by Luttrell with Patrick Robinson, and the SEAL's voice rings through like a good ol' Texas Boy - farm living, football loving, dog having, red meat eating, republican - the typical Texas stereotype. The voice is very refreshing to read in a way, it ignores any and every attempt to be politically correct, or even to empathize with those who think differently from Luttrell. What you see is what you get with this book. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this epic patriotic story that crescendo's until the very last chapter in pulse pounding intensity.    I'm going to put this guy on the 4th shelf out of 5.    [...]
B0034G4P7G|2.0|I did not like this movie.  It is about a bunch of college students who created a social network while in college.  The guy who actually created Facebook took the idea from other guys and made it better and made it his own.  The other guys sued him.  Because Facebook was worth a fortune, he pays 65 million to the guys to shut them up.  And of course, you know the rest.  Facebook is worth billions.  The guy in the movie who created Facebook was a little smart a..  I hope the real man is a much better person.  A lot of the movie is filmed in the deposition room (if that is what you call it), their dorm rooms, and partying with some wild girls.  You probably will never watch this movie more than once so I suggestg renting it before buying it.  I will never understand how this movie was nominated for best picture by the Oscar committee.
0756404738|5.0|It took me a second read through to really love this book. I enjoyed it on the first read, but not as much as I should've. I guess I was just excited and wanted to rush through the book, not noticing all the fine and intricate details of Pat's masterful skills.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the third book.
0670022411|2.0|I loved the scholarship.  In a genre that is generally devoid of intellect, the rich historical and literary reference were welcome.  They became annoying and intrusive, however, in the last 1/3 of the book.  I wonder if the general reader is going to appreciate Boethius.  As for the wine lore, I do not drink so all the learned references to wine and alcohol were a bit off-putting, and actually unnecessary to the story, which was entirely too long.  I thought it would never end.     As for the rest of it, I think it was a disaster.  If you remove the scholarship, you have a general outline of a fairly good story that needs development.  The story skips from continent to continent in a blink of an eye, rendering it choppy.  We follow the characters through England, France, the US and back to England, although we do not see the characters there--yet.  Further, the tone of the novel changes from deadly serious to comic between France and the US, which is filled with the standard dotty auntie witches, a crazy cat and a sentient house.  The house is great but intrusive.  It facilitates the plot but in a lazy sort of way. The comic nature of the US portion does not fit with the rest of the book.    The book is packed with vampires, witches, shosts, magic and daemons. Fortunately, there are no werewolves, elves, fairies, sprites, shapeshifters or other supernatural cratures, which is a blessing. She even adds time-travel to the mix, which is crowded.     As to the character development, there is very little.  There are many caricatures but no fully developed characters. Mathhew and Diana come close.  Matthew is a jerk.  Diana is a brilliant idiot.  We have all probably known very bright people who cannot apply that brilliance to their personal lives or who have little common sense.  Mathhew and Diana might cardboard replicas of the author and her friends. They certainly are cardboard, particularly Matthew.    In many respects, I liked the book.  In more other respects, I disliked it.  I did manage to finish it, which is saying a lot.  I nearly put it down several times.  This book is over-hyped and over-priced.  Get it from the library if you must read it.
0756404738|5.0|I've been waiting for this book for a Very Long Time, and part of me was concerned that it might not live up to the standard set by The Name of the Wind, or that it might be \\"The Two Towers\\" in the Kingkiller trilogy. (You know... long and boring, but a passable bridge between the first and last books.)    I am quite pleased to say my fears were unfounded. WILDLY unfounded. This is really, if anything, \\"The Godfather Part II\\" to The Name of the Wind's \\"The Godfather\\". It's hard to compare the two, because it's one cohesive story, but The Wise Man's Fear is perhaps better to read simply because we've already got the ball rolling with Kvothe's life story. We're now in the middle of it, and over the course of the book, you see him grow from an inexperienced (if confident) adolescent into a man, wiser in the ways of the world and with more than a few scars to show for it. Pat's writing is so genuine that you never find yourself rolling your eyes or thinking something is forced. There's a scene in this book that is probably the most subtle but realistic description of love between two people that I've ever read. And there are things - minor things, not like the death of his family or anything like that - that just break my damn heart to read them. I thought I was excited for this book to come out. It's nothing compared to how BADLY I want to read the conclusion now that I've reached the end of this one.
0307592839|4.0|The \\"Goon\\" in the title refers to time. The book, which is not identified as a novel or a collection, begins in the present, skips around through the past and ends up in the near future--and that near future world is so gracefully handled that I felt a bit of awe. This is character-based fiction. No apologies. But we get a glimpse of the deserts covered over with solar panels that even capture energy from the moon. Touch screens lead to a new marketing demographic--\\"pointers,\\" meaning infants too young to speak.  Parents try to protect their children, but end up giving in because it's just too hard to shut out the world, you know? And while everyone is connected, we're all still searching for a great \\"collective experience.\\" (Think Woodstock.) I loved the last two stories. If I'd read each story in reverse order from back to front, ending up in the present, it may well have been perfect, because these characters' back stories only become interesting once you know the final outcome. It was a long slog for me to come to a point of interest, more than a third of the way through the book, and it really didn't come together until the very end. I'm not sure why I persisted, but I'm glad I did.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I've had my Zoom H4n for a month now and have used it quite a lot.  I've recorded varied things like outdoor ambient noise, my kids singing at home, direct input guitar, tuba and euphonium, a euphonium quartet, and the band that I play in.(30 piece concert band) The H4n has performed really well so far. For the musical recordings, I used the 4ch mode with 2 external mics in XY, spaced omni and ORTF with a pair of cardioids so I could compare the internal mics to ones I know. While it's not a professional recording studio, the sound quality is exceptional for a field recorder of this price. The internal mics are quite good and have a low noise floor. The external mics I used are each worth nearly twice the price of the whole H4n, and do show a substantial improvement in sound quality over the internal mics, but this just shows how good a recorder it can be with external mics. Make sure you do the firmware update properly when you get it, it will give you the choice to unlink the external channels giving you separate level control over each one. I find it easy to use, and flexible for many different types of use. The Cubase 5LE software it comes with is entirely adequate, though I have used better, (but not free!) editing programs. The licencing requirements for the software may be confusing to some, make sure you watch the video on how to do it on Steinberg's website. I'm very pleased overall with this purchase!
0783228007|4.0|Despite having Clint Eastwood in the lead role, acting superbly, and despite the film's writer being the novelist Elmore Leonard, this movie has three flaws, at least in my eyes. Eastwood is a bounty hunter. The Mexicans in the area are being swindled out of their land by gringos who burned their land grants and insist that the land belongs to them. The Mexicans begin to fight back. A land owner with three gunmen and the help of locals want to go after the Mexican leader. They want to kill him and solve their problem by doing so. The land owner wants to hire Eastwood to lead him to the Mexican leader. He refuses. But when he goes to his ranch, he finds that the leader stole his horses, and agrees to take the land owner. Then he learns that the land owner is vicious. He threatens to kill Mexicans that he has captured if their leader does not give himself up. The leader's girl friend begs the leader to do so. He refuses. He thinks that it is better for him to live than that many Mexicans die. He also tells the girl that she should not plead with him; he is only interested in her for sex. Eastwood suggests to him that he surrender to the Marshall. He refuses. Then he changes his mind and agrees to go with Eastwood.<br /><br /> The film is good, but it is not as consistently exciting and with clever dialogue as the Eastwood Italian westerns. There were at least a half dozen chances for clever statements, as when Eastwood told the Marshall to leave the room and later when he hit him and the Marshall asked why did he do it. Second, it fails to explain why the Mexican leader - who stole horses, did not care for the lives of his people, and insulted his girl friend in the worst way - changed his mind and decided to do the right thing. Third, once the Mexican leader began going to town with Eastwood, he did nothing further in the film, he acted as a golem, which did not fit his character.
0765326353|5.0|Amazing. Read it. Sanderson has replaced Card as my favorite author. This book has everything from science fiction to politics to fantasy all shoved into a series that is bound to be epic. I highly recommend this for the fantasy enthusiast.

B004MMEIK0|2.0|at first i loved how well written this story was. strong plot and strong characters but then it shifted and started to fizzle.  it seemed as if the author had a deadline and stopped putting thought into the story. it became cheesy and the ending reminded me of a sit com.  quickly wrapped in a happy ending while the bad guy cries out &#34;you have not seen the last of me!&#34; and the canned laughter laughs along with the other main characters.  quite the dissapointment.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|It may not be entirely fair to review this since I have only heard passages of each song on the album, but of what I heard, this is an interesting mix of material but hardly vintage Mac material.  This record seems to be missing that punch that earlier Mac albums had.  There doesn't seem to be one track that I would consider a true rock song, but then I do believe that the talents here are way past their prime.  Stevie can still write and sing well, but her magical spells of her past successes like Rhiannon, Dreams, and Gypsy seem to be evading her now.  The one notable exception is the track Destiny Rules, a fond rememberance of those bygone classic Mac days.  But the saddest missing element here is Christine McVie, one whale of an underrated songwriter in her own right, every bit as good as Stevie was.  Few failed to see while Stevie was burning the charts with stuff like Dreams and Rhiannon, Christine had her own string of hits from Say You Love Me, to Don't Stop, to You Make Loving Fun.  I don't mean to put down Stevie though, after all it was her magical spiritual sense that gave the Mac much of its identity in those classic days, but Christine seemed to be the rock that formed much of the band's success throughout its rich  history.  So what we have here is an attempt by Lindsay and Stevie to take up the slack, and while they seemed to give it the ole school try (E for effort here), it sadly falls short, and the void left by Christine is felt throughout.  I do agree with an earlier review that described this as not really Fleetwood Mac, but Buckingham/Nicks.  I guess it could be nothing else since they were the main songwriters, but I'm a little disappointed here that they threw on a couple of old McVie songs just to round out the album.  And I'm also surprised that Mick and the band even considered going back to the studio without Christine.  After all, she had a longer history in the band than Stevie or Lindsay had, going back at least to Bare Trees to my knowledge.  In short, I would say unless you are a diehard Mac fan, you can skip this effort without missing too much.  I would say to Mick....Bring Christine back and do one true final (farewell???) Fleetwood Mac album!
0307595579|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife. The set itself looks very nice on our bookshelf. It has a clean and classic look to it. The first one we ordered was actually damaged at the top of the black sleeve and we exchanged it. The exchange was here in 2 days, and was in perfect condition. It was also packed a bit better this time around. I don't read many books so I don't know if they are any good, but the product itself is nice enough to merit 5 stars.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Now I am just using my moms account for buying this, but I have always been a fan since it was first played on Adult Swim. It has become one of the best animes that I can think of, (next to FLCL, (Fooly Cooly)). But this just my own idea of the show.
B004BUKS5M|2.0|I picked this album up after hearing her guest verses on several other songs. What really sold me was Monster with Kanye and Jay-Z. She absolutely killed that song and make the other two look like the amateurs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as great as Nicki is at putting together a verse or two on other peoples albums, she is equally as bad at putting together an album of her own. She just doesn't have the finesse and skill at this point to make the entire thing interesting from start to finish. I can give her credit for a track or two (Mostly tracks 1 & 2, Im the Greatest and Roman's Revenge) but outside of that, the entire thing comes up a bit short.<br /><br />I would pass for now, and if she ever makes a sophomore album she may have the chops to make it great from start to finish.

B00005Q3KC|4.0|I first heard the Corrs during a 1998 Guiness Fleadh show. Had to get some after. I found the Forgiven Not Fogotten album and really liked it. Then got the AMAZING VH1 Live in Dublin disc. Still wanted more. I went with this as it included the bigger hits from the debut, the huge hit \\"Breathless\\", and a handful of minor hits I hadn't heard yet. It also has good covers of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Dreams\\" and REM's \\"Everybody Hurts\\". Overall very happy with this collection. I could look at, I mean, listen to them all day.

B0041KKYD8|4.0|The 2010 remake of I Spit on Your Grave, is a better made, better acted movie than the original. Wheither or not the film as a whole is better than the original is up for debate, and I guess would depend upon your tastes.<br /><br />The remake is still a film you will find difficult to watch with other people, as the rape scene is just as brutal as in the original, albeit, thankfully, a bit shorter. It brutally gets the point across but does not over utilize the gratuitous nudity of the original film. The scene does what it is designed to do, to make you hate the five men enough that you want to see them dead.<br /><br />The story is pretty much the same, but the acting is much better than in the original, and the characters are much more believable and more developed, so to speak. There is however, the cliche of the rednecks in the woods terrorising the city girl, that is overused in horror movies.<br /><br />Sarah Butler plays her role as the victim very well, and when it comes to the revenge scenes, you are really wanting to see the antagonists get what they have coming. I liked the fact that she didn't have to take her clothes off in order to exact revenge, which is something that just never made sense to me in the original. I did think though, that the revenge scenes were rather unrealistic with the use of complicated traps, which makes you wonder what Jennifer's relationship is to MacGyver or Jigsaw from the Saw films. But I found myself happy with the outcome anyway, despite it being over-the-top.<br /><br />I would say if you are a fan of the original, or are a fan of revenge flicks in general, you'll appreciate this film. If you are not a fan of this type of film, just stay away. I never have understood those people that understand full-well what they are getting into going in, but go and watch anyway just so they can turn around and write a scathing review about the content. It goes without saying that this film is not for everyone.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray had excellent picture and sound, but I felt was lacking in the special features department. The feature commentary I found to be rather boring and uninformative. There is a generic \\"making of\\" featurette, a couple deleted scenes and some trailers. I would have liked to hear from the filmmakers about why they wanted to remake the 1978 original, what they thought of it, what they were trying to improve upon, etc. But, then again, I'm a big special features kind of guy. If they are no big deal to you and you are just looking to enjoy the movie, I think you'll be satisfied with this.felt was lacking in the special features department.

B0000252YK|5.0|Ozzy and Jake E. Lee team up for the last time for a classic heavy metal record. All quality songs and riffs and just that great Ozzy sound, before he went super comercial. You have prob heard most of these songs over the years and I like \\"Lightning Strikes and \\"Ultimate Sin.\\"  I used to have this cassette and remastered cd w/ liner notes is fantastic.  I think this is his follow up to Bark a the Moon.
0618871713|5.0|This graphic novel is amazing.    It is a memoir graphic novel, following Alison Bechdel's life before and after her father's suicide.  The novel is rife with literary allusions (the very first page alludes to a Greek myth of Icarus and Daedalus) and depth.    I'm not \\"a comic book person,\\" but this clearly shows the future of graphic novels as strong, eloquent, moving and brilliant.    Bechdel is famous for good reason.

I like this one better than their 80s stuff, but I am not a hardcore fan...yet.  The Gods made heavy metal and said that it was good - told us to play it louder than hell, promised that we would.  Cool artwork and poster on the 1997 remaster.
0671042858|4.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a story about a nine year old girl who becomes lost in the woods of Maine during a family hike. She wanders farther and farther from the trail in her search for civilization. Trisha is forced to endure the elements, hunger, tough terrain, and multitudes of insects. However, she is soon faced with a much darker problem. Throughout her journey she begins to have the feeling that something is watching her. The remains of several dead animals litter her path and trees that appear to have large claw marks through them enforces her certainty that there is something that is following her, waiting for the moment to strike.Her only retreat from the horrors of the woods is listening to Red Sox games on her walkman, featuring her favorite pitcher, Tom Gordon. Tom Gordon's ability to save the game at the last minute gives Trisha the courage to keep moving. Starvation and illness began to cause her to have hallucinations and her grasp on reality grows ever fainter. But is what is following her real, or only in her mind?<br /><br />What I most enjoyed about this book was the complexity of what would seem to be a simple story. You read about Trisha's struggles, but also about what her family is going through (they fear she has been kidnapped), and the emotional issues of her parents divorce. You know how close she comes to finding civilization before making a wrong turn. She is able to see the beauty in the hostile environment around her. She is able to realize how little you need to be content and at peace with the world.
B00004IC9G|4.0|Real deal heavy power metal with rock N noll muscles and machines kicking ass.  A little cheezy at times, it makes up for heavy riffs and old school pounding drumz.  This is their debut cd and I bought it just off of the recs. here.  These guys from the 80s and I missed them back in my Metal glory days.  This stuff is entertaining w/ cool artwork , but only about 35 mins. - \\"Louder Than Hell\\" from 1996 is even better.
B0010358CG|5.0|Very enjoyable: sci-fi action, cyborgs, very good character design, very good animation. Battle scenes are nicely choreographed and lively. Price was really good in Amazon. It did not exactly grasped Shirow's manga but nevertheless made his characters alive on the screen. The main characters relationship is touched on but not too deep, but that's true for almost any movie adaptation. All in all a good movie experience for fans of anime and manga in general and Shirow's work in particular.
B000000LZV|4.0|Wierd and jazzy, rocking and silly at times.  There are like 43 songs on this 1 cd, so lots of variety. It is not the angry American punk you have heard before from Black Flag or Circle Jerks (my favs). I never really dug theses guys when I was really into punk rock - always liked it harder and nastier. But, I can see why this cd is a influential classic in the punk genre and there is nother bands to compare to.
1401923127|4.0|This book was required reading when I was working with a life coach ... not sure I would have read it otherwise. The message is sound and I had no problem buying into it. My belief has always been that the mind/brain is a computer and what goes in is what come out. If you believe it - it will happen. Text book style as it lacks story telling, however the message is sound. Definately worth reading.
B00005QEO2|4.0|I do like this compilation because it includes a good mix of the hits, and good songs that wern't not hits.  I bought this CD with the intent to get most of the hits, but I guess I did not read the product details closely enough.  The problem with this compilation is it does not include Aerosmith's only number one hit \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\".  I know they didn't write this song; it was written by the very popular, and extremely talented songwriter Diane Warren.  However, if this compilation is an Anthology, it should include that song.  I was very disappointed to discover that this song was not included on this compilation.  This compilation does cover a lot of good songs however, that you will not find on most greatest hits packages.

1400079144|4.0|This book is very unique. It is part adventure/mystery, part advertising brochure, part textbook, and part horror.<br />I found to be absolutely riveting which is usually a very good thing. But the villian is so spooky that I felt somewhat uncomfortable.<br />The information on the Freemasons is quite complimentary, that is why I give the book credit for being part advertisement. It also reads like an advertisement for Washington DC. Sorry folks but the so called \\"Patriot Act\\" makes me uninterested in viewing the nations capital.<br />There is considerable history and philosophy and such here. The book could easily be used for college purposes.<br />This was not an easy book to write I'm sure. It is clear that a great deal of research and thinking went into it. A really skillful editor could have perhaps made it flow a bit smoother I would think. I would doubt that Dan Brown allows much editing to his writing. He doesn't have to.<br />Say what you will about Dan Brown, his sales prove he is easily one of the worlds most interesting writers. I have read all of his books and I'm pretty sure that I will always be able to say that.

B000X1T7MS|5.0|What a truthful and insightful read. This book should be a required read by all Americans especially school aged children who are taught PC trash in every public school. Books like this may actually delay the destruction of our country by a few decades. Keep writing them!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This was a great book and I look forward to reading the next ones. Thank goodness that P.C. Cast, and Kristin Cast seem to be the type of authors that are able to write long, yet still entirely captivating, books.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I can't decide whether this is supposed to be a knowing pastiche of late 60s/early 70s hard rock (Andrew Stockdale even sneaks in the lyric \\"purple hazes in the sky\\" in the first track) or simply the noodlings of an unashamedly retro band who have their heads well and truly wedged in that era. Does it even matter?<br /><br />I'm not sure it does matter, really - within about 10 seconds of this album starting up, I always have a huge smile on my face. So let's start with some positives. It's a fun album, for heaven's sake. This band play with such obvious gusto that it's hard not to get swept right along with them. Personally I love the sound of rock bands with one guitarist, so it's great to hear that fat bass sound pounding along with the drums here. The production is perfect for this kind of riff-based music. And last but not least, Andrew Stockdale's authentic rock yowl has an undeniable range that brings to mind Robert Plant on more than one occasion.<br /><br />On the not so positive side, there's obviously nothing new here - the sound, songwriting, lyrics, performance, everything, is all completely mired in past. Wolfmother, here on their debut album at least, sound like they've never heard anything released after 1974. Also, a major gripe for me is the throwaway nature of the songs, most of which sound like they were written in about half an hour and then recorded. The result of this is a nagging feeling of shallowness.<br /><br />But hey - I'm a total sucker for anything that smacks of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who, Free, etc, which is surely why I've fallen for the charms of Wolfmother. This is simply a fun rock album not to be taken too seriously.
076790382X|5.0|Yet another very funny book from Bill Bryson - I now have about 8 of his books (wish he had mine lol) and enjoy them very much.
068987474X|4.0|If your single and you picked up this book give yourself a pat on the back. I read this book over 5 years ago when I was single, and now have bought it as gifts for many single friends. Ladies the truth hurts, but the faster you know he is not that into you the faster you can heal and move on.
B004DMNT2W|4.0|This is a high quality and well made case, which is only good for the smaller generation of digital camcorders. I have a small one and it works well with this bag, except I wish I had a little more room for cables, the charger, and my remote.    Despite that, it's great to slip into your backpack, briefcase or purse.
B00006FDCD|1.0|it's as scary as it looks....Very intense.And the clown is just horrifying.I wouldn't let no kids watch this.it scared me.
0307592839|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Egan.  I had tried (and failed) to read Look at Me a few times so I was a little dubious when this book was chosen as my latest book club pick.   The book centers around two characters Bennie Salazar, an aging record executive and Sasha, his assistant with a troubling past as well as a host of characters that cross their paths over the years.    Though a narrative, this is really a novel of short stories.  We are given glimpses into each characters life, we learn their secrets, their connection to Bennie or Sasha and at the end of the chapter we leave them to live their lives.  Like time, we must keep moving forward.    I'm not going to go into much more detail because I think this novel deserves to be discovered.  Any description I offer would only diminish the overall effect of read.  But I will say the most surprising chapter was the one told in powerpoint.  I thought it wouldn't really add to the story, more of a gimmick,  but I was wrong.  I actually think this was my favorite chapter and one of the more memorable characters.  For a somewhat sparse chapter it was extremely emotional and beautifully written.    At times sad, it is overall a beautiful and clever book.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|I was not familiar with Anna Marie Jopek and I can no longer recall how I came to hear this music, but I have to say over the past few years it has been one of my favorite records. Most of the music I listen to is much, much more hard edged, and dissonant. My favorite Pat Metheny was the collaboration with Ornette Coleman. But there is something about this collaboration--the beautiful tunes and exceptional (as always) guitar combine with Ms Jopek stunning voice to create a masterpiece.
0061726826|5.0|I LOVED Lauren Oliver's debut novel, Before I Fall so I had very high expectations for her second novel Delirium and I was not disappointed.  This was another stunning and compelling novel from an incredibly talented author.    Lena is just 90 days away from her 18th birthday when she does the unthinkable...she falls in love.  Amor Deliria Nervosa (love) is a disease that is being eradicated from society.  Upon her 18th birthday, Lena will undergo a procedure to cure her and frankly, she can't wait.  A life without love-the disease that makes you irrational-is exactly what she wants.  Until she meets Alex.  As her world/beliefs are turned upside down, the reader is taken on an emotional journey that is utterly heartbreaking.  The ending left me stunned.  As soon as I finished, I emailed a friend who had read it because I just had to talk about it.  I can honestly say this will be one of my favorite books for 2011.    While there will be comparisons to another bestselling dystopian novel which released last Fall, Matched by Ally Condie, Delirium stands alone as a fantastic addition to the YA dsytopian romance genre.    As an author, Lauren Oliver is brilliant.  I cannot wait to see what she comes up with next.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I've had this flash for a few days now, and have been very impressed. I'm currently using it on a D7000. The good thing about this flash is that it recognizes if you're using a DX or an FX camera, and it adjusts the zoom accordingly. Using some rechargeable Eneloop batteries, this flash will recycle fast enough to keep pace with the D7000's burst rate, and you'll feel like a paparazzo. It has a built in bounce card, wide angle diffuser, and it tilts a few degrees below level. This is great for close-up/product photography type shots. It also rotates the full 360 degrees, which I know not all flashes do. But my favorite feature is using this flash off camera in Remote mode. It's as easy as flipping a switch. If you have a D7000, or other pro-ish Nikons, you can use the built-in flash to trigger this flash wirelessly for more creative lighting.     Nikon also throws in some extras. The carrying case is pretty nice. Diffuser is a nice freebie. Note that putting this on locks the zoom to a specified amount. When you snap it on, a hard switch is depressed somewhere. This is how it knows the diffuser is attached. You can get around this by not snapping the diffuser on fully, then the flash will zoom like normal. I haven't tested out the hard color filters yet, so I can't comment on them. The one item that seems a little cheap is the included stand. It has plastic threads. This might be a psychological thing for me, but I would feel much more comfortable with metal threads. If you want, you can always pick up the old stand from the SB-600.    One last thing some people complain about is that this flash is not powerful enough. Power is relative, but I know that this flash can feel pretty heavy when mounted on a body. I would not even consider the SB-900 for this reason.    All in all, a very solid product from Nikon. You won't be disappointed.
1599218011|5.0|I enjoyed the book and plan to include many more green smoothies in my eating plan. I love the way she writes and continue to enjoy the recipes!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This set of DVDs has got to be one of the greatest box-sets ever put together. It contains all four of the critically acclaimed Alien films, from the heart-stoppingly frightening first film, to the final fourth film, this series is a must have for any science-fiction lover or fan of the series in general.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Excellent read.  I agree with other reviews on how Jack had such an extensive vocab yet spoke so babyish at times but I think the author did that on purpose to remind us that this story is coming from a five yr old boy.  Would highly reommend this book to others.  Wish it had lending capabilities for my other Kindle friends to share with.
0060558121|5.0|This was probably one of the best pieces of writing that I've ever had the pleasure of stuffing into my head. I loved it while reading it, and I still think about it from time to time now. I'd agree that I even learned a thing or two.<br /><br />Yeah the theme between new and old is kind of cliche, but the story line, the character development, the plot twists, and the ending are all something new.<br /><br />Give it a shot, you won't be sorry.
B000063V8U|5.0|The 6th season continues the adventure, mystery and excitement that make Star Trek NG what it is: a thoughtful exploration of space and its inhabitants. The Enterprise crew applies human values and morale but also shows human shortcomings familiar to us all. Therefore this futuristic series still pushes familiar buttons in the viewer and often takes us to places where we wonder about ourselves as well as what may be \\"out there\\". Star Trek NG follows a stable course through the seasons while incorporating new issues, discoveries and ideas all the time. Well done!
0307476154|5.0|I find myself looking at the clock at 2am and thinking, \\"I have to be to work at 8am! I need to go to bed! Just one more chapter...\\"  Wonderfully written, thoroughly enjoyable.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|I don't know - there's something about Tony Scott films that interest me.  I can't place my finger on it.  I knew before watching \\"The Taking of Pelham 123\\" that I shouldn't like it, and I knew afterword that I probably still shouldn't have enjoyed it.  The same is somewhat true here.  The story is elevated because of the cast - Denzel Washington, as always, turns in a workmanlike performance.  Chris Pine doesn't exactly stretch his acting legs, but he does fine as the new guy.  It's never bad to have Rosario Dawson in your film.  Plus, Kevin Corrigan's in this one.  The story is pretty simple here, and there won't be a lot of surprises.  It's probably worth 90 minutes of your time, though.  The Blu-Ray picture quality was excellent.  I won't comment on the sound quality since I am installing some new flooring and currently have the surround sound in storage - that said, I can only assume that would enhance the viewing.  Overall, the movie has its flaws, but it's a fairly enjoyable ride.
0937381888|5.0|I enjoyed this book. As a \\"returning brewer\\" after about 20 years, this book revealed so much that I had forgotten or didn't know. How to Brew really provides all that you need to start brewing, or refine your craft. I definitely needed to learn from step \\"A\\" and the author provided this in an informative and direct way.     If you are about to begin brewing or are already in the freshman stages of brewing I would highly recommend this book. In fact I would recommend this book BEFOR you get any brewing equipment This will detail the gear you'll need and the basics to get you up and brewing... and of course enjoying your own home brew.     Not recommended for advanced brewers. But for the intermediate or novice this is a great survey of the brewing process including yeast and their cycle, malt (barley), hops, water, you name it. And the author provides pretty explicit information, it's not panzy gibberish. He gets into the science that drives the art.    Highly recommended for the beginner, novice and intermediate home brewer!
0061450162|5.0|I enjoyed reading smoke and mirrors. Neil Gaimen has a unique voice and style. The collection of short stories were varied and intriguing. I'd recommend it.
B004FD398S|1.0|This movie is a perfect example of over pricing in 3d! I can't wait until Feb 2012 when the movie can be released away from panasonic products at its deserved 20-30 dollar price. I have seen this movie twice in 3d, once on the imax. I would never pay over 100 dollars to see it again at home. I will wait till this movie is re-released before I spend a bunch of money on this pocahontas meets ferngully flick. I purchased 2 pair of shutter glasses and monsters vs aliens for just 30 dollars more than this one movie. Why anyone would buy this movie now is beyond me! My advice buy the 5-6 other 3d bluray movies you want and wait on this one!
B003K5IRA2|4.0|That is definitely saying something with the new Dr. Who. Up until season four, the new series only had sparadic shows that were of interest. Those three other seasons were mainly concerned with special effects and destruction. Even the Doctor was changed to accomidate all those nasty shows.     Season 4 is the first to show a glimmer of what Dr. Who really was and what he could have been again. Sometimes, advancements only make worse story lines instead of better shows. Season 4 is the only one I would even say go ahead and spend some money on. Stay away from the expensive stuff though or borrow a copy from someone.  Don't go in blind. Even I have watched season 4 twice, because they were good and watchable shows to watch over and over again. This is the only season of the new Dr. Who I can say that about.
B004HGBUXE|3.0|As a longtime Lucinda Williams fan, I simply expected better than this from her new album.  The opening track, \\"Buttercup,\\" starts out with a raucous barroom wail that contrasts ironically with its title and theme, and I had high hopes.  But then the whole album descends into hypnotic repetition that passes beneath my consciousness without leaving any noticeable impression.  By the end, it was like listening to nothing at all.<br /><br />To me, the tracks \\"Soldier's Song\\" and \\"Blessed,\\" which lie back to back on the disc, exemplify the whole problem.  Both tracks rely on cyclical linguistic devices to roll forward like a wheel, rather than inventiveness and sophisticated music.  They say the same thing, over and over, with slightly different wording.  And since both songs have more or less the same rhythm, putting them together was just trance-inducing.<br /><br />Though this album has highlights, like Elvis Costello's guest turn on \\"Kiss Like Your Kiss,\\" on the whole, it has little going for it but a subconscious drone that bores when it should excite.  Though Lucinda Williams devotees will find plenty to like, newbie listeners will burn or download one or two tracks for repeat listening, and bury the rest of the album on a back shelf without further thought.
B000005S2I|5.0|back in high school I had Wu-Tang Forever on cassette (was po') while my foreign exchange roommate had the imported CD, was sooo jealous! I've looked in a used shops/mom & pop shops for a cheap copy of the import but most stores did not even carry it. Amazon did, and now I have almost completed my collection of every debut wu-tang album being an imported version with bonus tracks.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This album will surprise few Loreena McKennitt fans, as it essentially applies her lush New Age orchestrations to traditional Celtic songs and poetry.  This feels like a working holiday for McKennitt, who usually writes her own songs, and I mean that in a good way.  The low-pressure vibe of a musical dynamo playing just because she loves it makes this album good for fans of folk, Celtic, and ambient music.    I'd pretend my favorite track was \\"The Star of County Down,\\" but that's always been special to me, and McKennitt does it well by not overloading it.  Her famously intricate scores could easily bog classic songs like this down in treacle.  But McKennitt handles all tracks with a light hand.  Her fingerprints are most visible, not surprisingly, on the instrumental \\"Brian Boru's March,\\" yet even that remains crisp and uncluttered.    At no point does McKennitt do anything on this album to break out or redefine herself as an artist.  Yet she also does justice to well-loved songs in ways that will engage both her New Age core audience, and fans of tradition.  I would recommend this album to listeners just discovering McKennitt or Celtic music for the first time, because its elegant simplicity perfectly exemplifies both her and her form.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I downloaded this album a while ago but never listened to it until I saw her perform for Prince and her Cold War music video. Once I sat down and listened to the album I was very drawn into the world she created within her album. The instrumentation was lush and her voice is dynamic enough to make every song interesting. Neon Valley Street is my favorite song thus far
B0017SWPXY|1.0|This story was quite cliché, the plot was incredibly predictable (even if you take the metaphor approach), and the characters seemed pretty thin to me.  I was quite disappointed because I'd been wanting to read this book for a long time.  Being such a dog lover I thought it would be a great fit.  I just didn't see it.    Plus there's the whole \\"Kindle version being more expensive than the paperback\\" issue.  $9.99 for Kindle, $5 for paperback.  Ridiculous.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Great movie, I know this because I enjoyed it despite naturally despising all the characters that appeared in it. Besides Sean Parker (who likes to party) every other character is someone who would turn up their nose at me in real life.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|As always, Doctor Who is an excellent show and these specials cause no harm to the legacy of the great Doctor. I had seen these episodes before but on DVD. The Blu Ray makes it so much more enjoyable to watch. Can't wait for season 6 to start!
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|LOVE this movie!  Cute and funny.  Really enjoyed the animation as well. My grandson liked it so much that I purchased another one for his birthday.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|This movie is a fun off the wall action flick with, over the top violence and lots of nudity. Danny Trejo, who usually plays the bad guy in supporting roles gets the star treatment in this film and does a pretty good job. This movie is not to be taken too seriously, just good cheap fun.  Although, their is a political message here about immigration. Their are also an excellent line up of hollywood hotties such Jessica Alba(who does a nice nude scene), Lindsay Lohan(who is basically playing a character close to her real life self, she does nude scene also,it is her in the church office, but a body double in the pool scene)and Michelle Rodriguez playing her usually tough self. You also have hollywood heavyweights Robert De Niro(perhaps too good for this movie), Steven Seagel and Don Johnson along for support. Good fun.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing.  The music is so relaxing and exciting at the same time.  I have had countless hours of enjoyment as I've traveled in my car listening to this CD.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B002ZG980U|4.0|This movie had a very good concept, a deep mind bending suspense/action/triller. But it does not confuse you. Good performances and an excellent plot. Although I seen this concept before in an much older movie \\"Dreamscape\\" with Dennis Quaid I think that was back in the 80's, it is done better in this film.
B0044VTC0A|5.0|Arnold  schwarnegger was a great player in this movie along with jamie leigh curtis his acting wife in the movie and tom arnold wow lots of action, comedey and humor and excitment.  One of my favorite movies of all time.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|How many times can I fall in love with The Decemberists as if for the first time? Colin's voice is like no other, and it doesn't hurt that the lyrics and music nourish the head as well as the heart.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is my favorite Nicholas Sparks book by far!  Not only does it tell a great love story, but it's very suspensful with a twist at the end that made me really think!  My boyfriend isn't a big reader, and a typical guy who doesn't want to hear about love stories, but this was so good, I actually told him about it after I was finished.  It was a quick easy read, and it kept me up way too late reading many nights in a row!  Fabulous story!
B004DMNT2W|5.0|I have 4 digital cameras and 3 camcorders, each with a unique type case. But of all of them, this is the most different. In that it is a VERY small case for a camcorder, but my latest camcorder is the Sanyo VPC-GH4 Full HD 1080 Camcorder with 10X Dual Range Zoom . And for this very tiny HD camcorder, this case is PERFECT. It will hold my camcorder, 2 memory cards and 4 (yes 4) extra batteries. And just one single zipper down the middle, straight up & down, not a zipper you have to unzip \\"around\\" the camcorder or camera. It makes it IDEAL for quick grabs of my camcorder for that sudden shot you want to catch on the fly. On my motorcycle I can pull over and quickly access my camcorder.<br />  The 3 different ways to carry or store it are nice as well since again, I mount it to my motorcycle handlebars for super quick access. It doesn't have external pockets and zippered compartments to hold extra stuff. But that works FOR it in this case as it keeps the exterior size VERY tiny with all the interior space put to best use. When I first saw this I thought \\"darn\\", it sure is simple....Then I discovered (with use) that this was the very beauty of it. Especially when I tried it on my bikes handlebars. Not for everyone perhaps, but this perfectly fills that missing spot I never even knew I had with all my other camera cases.
0385339585|5.0|I am a huge fan of Grisham's writings.  This book kept me intrigued from beginning to end!  I read it in two days flat it was so good!
0060574216|5.0|i'm enjoying this jewel of everyday literature!!!  for sure I will use many of the writer's advices in my marriadge.    it's also very fun reading, and as I'm not native english speaker, it helps improve my knowledge.    I strongly recommend this book!
B003L77GG0|5.0|Season 10 is absolutely amazing.The episodes are funnier and more interesting than previous seasons.Clark Kent is the true form of a reliable and honest person and a hero.Smallville is the best interpretation of Superman on television.It does not only focus on Superman,It also focuses on the disguise of Kal-El who is Clark Kent.Can't wait to buy this DVD!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I love this cd :) these siblings are amazing! I love all their songs most I hadn't heard but I really liked it. I got my cd about 5-7 days after I ordered it and it was in fantastic condition. It was used and hadn't even looked like it had been opened.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This movie is actually very entertaining. I thought it would just be ok when I decided to watch it but right away it had me laughing. I was very impressed.
B003ODL004|5.0|This is a great soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this cd are all of them.
B00005JNQS|5.0|My one year old runs up and stands against the tv to dance any time they have a musical number on this cartoon. The music is so lively and fun, not to mention, Robyn Williams is hilarious. A joy to watch, especially for parents wary of having to sit through a cartoon
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This set of pieces from the movie is a delight.  Dario Marianelli writes in a style that suites the period well. There is a bit of real Purcell, and some music that pays tribute to other composers including Phillip Glass. The pieces are not hard to play, if you can play Sarabande by Handel you can play these. There is a 2 against 3 theme that reoccurs through the group which may cause you to slow down and count it carefully.  Read ahead for key signatures since they can and do change within one piece, in Enjoy.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Purchased 2 of these mics for about $20 a piece. the quality seems fantastic so far. I am using these for a recording audio for various video projects. I was looking at 'professional' LAVS that run somewhere around $200 or more in CANADA. Ridiculous ... I think. Anyway. I'm very happy so far.   For some reason these Audio Technica LAVS retail for no less than $60 a piece in Canada whereas in the states they are only $20 a piece. I don't understand this discrepancy. Seems completely asinine.
B001BKG9RQ|4.0|For those of you expecting a release full of Pink Floyd music, look elsewhere.   This release features half of the music from Gilmour's solo release \\"On An Island\\".   Of note to dedicated Pink Floyd fans - this is probably the last release featuring the now-deceased Richard Wright that you'll ever hear.   There are certainly some classic Floyd tracks on this release - but the majority of the first CD is solo material.  Of note on the second CD is a never-heard before release of \\"Fat Old Sun\\" which was interesting.   But even the solo material is enjoyable on this release - wanting me to listen to the original solo material all the more.   There are even a few tracks featuring Gilmour on the Saxophone for those of you that enjoy that type of sound.    All in all, a must have for the Floyd fans and a good showing by Gilmour for his solo material.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read in awhile. I could not put the book now.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I bought this for myself. I am a huge Disney fan and me and my husband went to Disney World for our Honeymoon back in November! I've since been collecting the DVD's and trinket items. I finally got to sit down and watch it when I got sick and was stuck in bed for a couple of days! The visuals are beautiful, the audio was amazing, and the extras are so interesting! Totally worth it!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This has been one of my favourite movies since I first saw it. The score is beautiful and stirring (I have a thing for film scores though). The cast is fantastic. The acting is brilliant. It isn't one of those movies that just drags on and on, but it really pulls you in and you truly feel for Nash.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie can be watched many times, and every time you watch it you will find new things you did not notice before. The ending of the movie is pretty much up to your own interpretation. You actually have to concentrate on the movie, otherwise you're wasting your time, you will not \\"get it.\\"  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I wonder if Nolan got some of his ideas from the Seth books (by Jane Roberts). Seth talked about building cities in the dream world back in the late 1960's and early 1970's.
B004E547D8|3.0|There were great reviews on this movie and that's why I purchased it.  After viewing the movie I was disappointed. In my opinion I'd rent it before I purchased it.
B004222UC8|5.0|Even though Tony Iommi was the only original Sabbath member left, this was still a strong slbum. Although I was never really  a huge Tony Martin fan, I always thought this was his best singing for Mr. Iommi. I thought the Ray Gillen version on vocals was head and shoulders above the TM version. Maybe if it had been used it would have sold better. An underrated Iommi album which now gets he treatment it deserves!
0061433047|5.0|[[ASIN:0061433047 I Shall Wear Midnight]]<br /><br />An enjoyable tale from the master of Fantasy - staring Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men.  I absolutely love the Discworld series and Pratchett's sense of humour and wonderful story telling.  If you have not read any stories about the Wee Free Men - do yourself a big favour and get the set[[ASIN:0060012382 The Wee Free Men (Discworld)]][[ASIN:0060586621 A Hat Full of Sky: The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men]][[ASIN:0060890339 Wintersmith (Discworld)]]<br /><br />There is nothing better than a bunch of tiny (a few inches high, men in kilts, who want nothing more than to party and fight all the time. And think that they are all ready dead and in heaven.  They are always up to mischief - stealing ships (sheep) from the paddock but you really want them on your side in a fight.
1439102724|3.0|I haven't finished the book yet. Jodi Picoult is a favorite of mine. My complaint is this...why is the Kindle version more than the hardcover version. I could have had the book sent to me for free for cheaper than it cost to send it to my Kindle. I love my Kindle but I hope Amazon doesn't start overcharging for popular titles. I have \\"sold\\" many Kindles by word of mouth. I am a hairdresser and talk to men and women all day. Most are readers and thinking of purchasing some form of e-reader. The thing that makes the Kindle stand out over the Nook is the availability of affordable and sometimes free books. Will update my review after I finish the book. The 3 stars are because I couldnt leave it blank.
B000FC10MU|4.0|This book was my first of Neils and I was immediately hooked. The book captured and held my imagination all the way to the end, but, and there is a but here, I was less than impressed with the ending. I was happily reading, feeling there would be some great big purpose behind the narrative, yet found there really wasn't.<br />Perhaps that should be seen as a parallel to the novels purpose in the end. God's don't go out in with a bang in America, they go out with a whimper, and so did this book.<br /><br />nonetheless, I did enjoy it up until I realized there was no payoff for me.
B0039PPW60|5.0|I just received the mixer today and had it up and running in a matter of minutes. Very EZ to connect & operate right out of the box. Quality design and a must have for the beginner or pro.
B000N3T0DM|4.0|Like all Almodovar's movies this one is great. The bonus with this one is definitely Penelope Cruz who is smoking hot and gives an amazing performance. I'd highly recommend Talk to Her also.

0670022411|5.0|I happened upon a review of this book in one of my magazines and decided to pick it up for a casual read for whenever the urge hit.  After seeing the 750ish pages, I must admit that I almost put it back on the shelf.  I am so glad I didn't.  I ended up getting lost in the story and finished it in a weekend.  I can't wait for the next one.  It was so beautifully written.  What a pleasant surprise.

B0034G4OUO|4.0|Saw the movie when it came out. Had to buy it for my \\"The Rock\\" collection of movies. I just love me some \\"The Rock\\". He's back with a vengeance!!! That gun and those muscles was a complete turn on. He didn't have to say many words for me. Just him getting revenge and the action held my attention. Billy Bob Thornton was good as the cop. It was definitely a twist with how he was involved from the beginning. Very good action movie!!
B002VWNID6|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I don't know why \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" so often gets a cold shoulder from critics.  Kevin Costner does not really attempt an English accent, and the movie dares to be grittier than the somewhat sanitized famous Errol Flynn starrer \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\\"  Yet, this movie, also starring Morgan Freeman, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth MasterAntonio, remains a modern classic.<br /><br />A sharp screenplay highlights a unique telling of the English legend.  Mr. Costner's Robin of Locksley is a soldier in the Crusades under the leadership of Richard the Lionheart.  Upon arriving home in England, he discovers a ghoulish, heartbreaking murder and together with his traveling companion Azeem(a brilliant Morgan Freeman) he determines to avenge his father's death.  A nasty and cold yet darkly humorous Alan Rickman is the Sheriff of Nottingham and is priceless in the role.  Mary Elizabeth MasterAntonio is perfect as Maid Marian.<br /><br />Also featuring Christian Slater, Sean Connery, and Nick Brimble as an expertly realized John Little ('Little John') \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" remains greatly entertaining.
B0041KKYBA|2.0|The quality of this film's perspective can be determined by reading an abundance of reviews on IMDb, amazon.com and everywhere else that prove none of its viewers actually understand the subprime fiasco.    The real joke is, the heads of these firms were more ignorant of what happened than anyone else involved. The people interviewed knew the LEAST about what actually happened! Most of the people interviewed approved their firms' getting into this mess because they were convinced to, either by clients seeking alpha, or by traders who were convinced they could make as much as the hedge funds. It's the money business, and that's what they do -- financial speculation.     Furthermore, these instruments never existed before in the history of the world. Never. If these filmmakers actually believe that any one person knew the complex web of relationships involved, they are sadly mistaken. Those of us in the business heard intelligent arguments on both sides, daily, before the crash even happened. No one knew what would happen. Everyone had an idea, and all those ideas were different. Btw, all of those differing ideas were published by every firms' research departments. Even the Fed published warnings and analyses. I guess the filmmakers didn't read these (or maybe they just didn't understand them?).     The emails that are supposedly \\"exposed\\" hardly prove complicity in anything but speculation, which is what one does in the financial markets -- financial speculation.     We all know that there are ruthless \\"characters\\" on Wall St. as in every profession (even more in Entertainment!). The joke is, the biggest fraud turned out to be Spitzer, on whom the filmmakers rely for commentary! So, come to this film for a profile of said characters, but do not expect to find it a source of great illumination on the situation, and for heaven's sake, do not believe for a minute that you are being told the whole story!

I like live CDs, but I know many don't.  Amazing sound, lyrics, and just overall great vibe.  I went to their website and what did I see?  As of this year no more albums, tours, etc.  Bummer.  I must have the rest of their CDs.    Can't recommend this enough.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|LCD Soundsystem and their label DFA blew up quite nicely in 2005. Their self-titled debut managed to inject the energy of rock music with dance music's funk grooves and disco beats in a way that could please both the indie kids and the electronic purveyors. \\"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\\" is a stroke of brilliance -- much better than what Daft Punk themselves have been doing recently. \\"Tribulations\\" has a peppery beat that makes the schadenfreude lyrics pleasant. The rock and electronic elements are generally well-balanced, though if they lean one way or another, it's usually towards the rock side (\\"Movement\\"), though on the post-sex aubade \\"Never as Tired As When I'm Waking Up,\\" you don't mind. \\"On Repeat\\" is almost a reprise of \\"Daft Punk...\\" until it goes crazy towards the end. \\"Disco Infiltrator\\" is deliriously funky -- a definite highpoint of the album. \\"Great Release\\" closes the first disc on a slow-build stadium anthem. On the second disc, \\"Losing My Edge\\" is a cri de coeur from an aging hipster -- strictly tongue-in-cheek, while \\"Beat Connection\\" is much more straightforward about its intentions. \\"Tired\\" is as close to pure rock as you'll find anywhere on this album, while the two version of \\"Yeah\\" sound like a jam band fiddling with electronics. \\"Yr City's a Sucker\\" closes out the second disc with some angular guitar stabs and a chorus that'll hit the heart of everyone who's ever lived someplace they don't like. Which, I guess, would be pretty much everyone.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I originally wanted to watch this because well it's Spartacus!! But to my disappointment, after watching 8 episodes, the violent and gore and gratuitous sex did not change. Blood is gore is going to be expected in a gladiator movie, so that I am not surprised at. The \\"300 like\\" graphics actually make the series pretty cool.<br />I find the raunchy sex scenes to be unnecessary, even though it is trying to depict how the Roman's were during that time. Over and over and over again they show these scenes for a long time, in many different ways, sometimes in the background, and it seems as if the writers took EVERY opportunity to show full nudity, both male and female. It is like watching \\"soft porn\\" with fighting scenes in every episode. Some audiences may like it; how it doesn't hold back from what they believed happened back then and how extreme it is. But for some other audiences like myself, think it's way too much. Most of these reviews are good because in today's entertainment age, people are looking for something like this, something different, something racy. But the storyline is weak and the gratuitous sex could sometimes make following the story distracting.

(Although their Cyborg is VERY lame!)  Come on now.  Let us see the Justice League of America for real!  Let us see Clark and Lois married for a while!    The show is more popular now than ever I'm sure.  Warner Brothers and DC comics, please keep this show running longer.  Say another 10 years or so???  LOL
030745455X|5.0|This is volume two of a trilogy and it exceeds its predecessor in suspense and in relevance of the title to the contents it encompasses. It applies literally to Lisbeth Salander and the fire is the Molotove cocktail she uses on her father. It does not kill him so she can play further in her imagination with repeated applications of fire to him. The suspense occurs with the dropping of Lisbeth from the followed character in the writing but she is a suspect in three murders and the search for her and the reasons therefore are the subject of interest, the major character during this hiatus is Mikael Blomkvist who was the major character in \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\".During all this time interest is retained in Salander'a whereabouts, we left her as she introduced herself to two of the murdered people and the book is written as though she must have been there when they were murdered, therefore she committed the murders. She finally contacts Mikael and claims not to have done the murders.<br />The announcement soothes our feelings but we knew she did not do it anyhow; after all, she is the main character of the trilogy. or is supposed to be. Now the action speeds up again and on page 394 0f my volume we find out the significance of the prologue. The charges against Salander start to slip and the police officials begin to think there is substance to Blomkvist's theory of Salander's innocence. There are a plethora of characters brought in, some are journalists, some police, some private security, some criminals but all have a part to play to determine the final outcome. It is troublesome keeping the names and occupations straight but not nearly so bothersome as Larsson telling us every street or highway one of the characters is on or turns onto, does he think I am going to buy a map of Southern Sweden and follow all these turns? Even worse, the translator, who. I think, does a good job ruins his effort by tacking on -gatan or -agatan to the name of the street, I assume this is Swedish for street, road, avenue, parkway, etc., and is totally unnecessary, what does it do for the story? But it does distract me, it is used so much. Still I found the book to be more interesting than the Dragon Tattoo one and I highly recommend it.this is Swedish for street, road, avenue, parkway, etc., and is totally unnecessary, what does it do for the story?

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I have read every single book in the series, and I have to say that this series is much better than the books.    What really makes this series great is the characters. They are all likable in their own way and each have their own unique relationships with the others. I also thought that the actors and actresses were all great, I don't understand where all the criticism is coming from.     Another thing that puts this ahead of the books for me is the portrayal of Richard. In my opinion, he is much better and far more likable in this series. In the books, he basically ends up becoming all knowing, unbeatable and seems to have instant mastery of everything he attempts. He basically ended up as more of an ideology than a character. In this series, he is simply a good natured (some times too much for his own good), caring person who has his own flaws. In other words, he is human. And he often relies on his allies for help instead of just being able to do everything on his own.    I also think they did a great job with Cara. At the start of the season I didn't like her at all, but I loved her by the end. I thought the way she slowly (and sometimes) subtly became a good guy and a caring person was really well done and never felt forced. And she still retains her Mord Sith edge through out the series.    The only minor negatives are that some times they use plot devices and you'll be wondering why Zedd didn't simply use magic to do something that he was able to do in another episode. However, this is almost unavoidable in a show of this type. And it doesn't take away from this being a fun series with great characters, environments and music. And speaking of the music, it was great. Right up there with Lord of the Rings, IMO.
B00005JMYI|3.0|This is a super funny movie. Will Ferrell always delivers : ) Anchorman is the kind of stupid funny throughout the whole movie that just causes you to involuntarily giggle. The plotline is so oddball and funny that you can't help but be entertained. The plotline is interesting. I like to watch any movie with Will Ferrell in it. He doesn't really ever let me down. Like this movie! Good entertainment for a day of movie watching!
B000001AFY|5.0|Hopefully this will be the next Diana Ross album to be reissued with bonus tracks.  It is another great album with the big hit \\"Love Hangover\\".  Her next 2 albums did not do as well but then she had a string of hit albums for many years.  Pick up a copy on record if you can find a sealed one.  There are some on Amazon and Ebay from time to time.  Who knows when the CD will be reissued.
B004HGBUVG|2.0|I used to love Lucinda's music.  I have 7 of her previous CDs and was hoping for a return to her doing new music which did not drone on and on, as does this CD.  She sounds as if she's on heroin and barely awake on this album.  I don't need to and won't listen to this style of music.  It used to be she would do a 'downer' song and then pick up the tempo here and there.  There is not enough upbeat music on this CD to keep me happy.  I have too much good music in my collection to subject myself to Lucinda's bummer of a life.  There is a point in life where it seems that hot party-girls turn into old women with lots of miles on their odometers.  I think that's the point that Lucinda has reached, and it ain't pretty.  Unless you want to be dragged down by this CD, I suggest you pass on it.
0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris has to be one of the greatest writers who ever lived. I say this because while other best-selling writers teach you compelling lessons (David McCullough), encourage your inner conspirator (Dan Brown), show you new and scary worlds (Michael Crichton), or take you off into fantasy (J.K. Rowling), Sedaris writes about the mundane and somehow makes it fascinating. Each of the many stories in his books are like literary candy: short, sweet, and easily digestible. That is not to say that he is entirely frivolous, though the books are far from serious, as at each turn Sedaris is able to make quick incisive quips about the absurd and awkward world he tries in vain to live in.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Sedaris's work, he sort of writes about the way life happens to him. The man on the plane who can't stop crying to the point of it being annoying. Being invited on vacation with the town's child molester. Chronicling his life in time spent not smoking. I started following Dave with Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, back in high school and with the exception of Naked have been impressed by what I read. My inner high school self wants to say that Corduroy is still my favourite, but my 20-something self believes When You Are Engulfed in Flames, is his masterpiece.<br /><br />Read it.<br /><br />[...]
0440236304|5.0|Got this for my husband and he liked it so much we got the rest by this author. Good guy books and WWII in Europe.
0307346609|4.0|Loved the depth and detail the author captured, along with the realistic reactions.  I suggest reading many stories in one sitting and not dwelling too long between picking up the book, again. Some of the references could be forgotten and require catch up from previous stories as they all have tie-ins, so to speak.  The only issue I had was that there weren't enough female perspectives.  Very limited in that area, and there is so much that could have been done with women's stories.<br /><br />I am not a fan of zombies, but picked up this book at the request of my husband.  I was very surprised and found that the stories stayed with me when I went to bed at night and when I wasn't reading the book.  Was a fantastic book group book and created a lot of dialog and discussion.  Thought provoking, very much worth the read!!
B0006J28L4|3.0|I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and I think Denzel Washington performed excellently.      However, I am afraid that many young people will take this movie as an accurate portrayal of Malcolm X, his life, and what he believed in. It is not.    I am afraid that many will come away from this movie with the idea that Malcolm was a militant pro-black racist of sorts.  Although he may have began his journey through life with many of those ideas, his quest and life experiences \\"tuned\\" his views dramatically. The end result was a much wiser and humble yet strong individual, who believed in good people of all \\"races\\". I believe he was very good at heart, and his life was a journey that taught him many things.  Those who want a better picture of this man should see the 1972 documentary \\"Malcolm X: His Own Story as it Really Happened\\".  THAT is the best movie I have seen of him to date!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Good teenish movie that is for all the age groups. Funny scenes, some serious ones, and Zach has a couple of solid moments.  Give it a chance, it will make you smile in a genuine way.  And what would be wrong with that?
B0041KKYDI|5.0|One fateful day in the canyons of Utah a lone climber fell into the worst predicament he could have imagined.  In April of 2003 Aron Ralston found out what he was made of, literally and figuratively.  While Aron was trekking the rocky terrain of \\"Blue John Canyon\\" his luck ran out and fell due to a loose boulder which crushed and trapped his arm against the rock wall.  His story is one of hope, triumph, terror and sheer determination.  The perfect setting for an intensely satisfying movie experience.  Thankfully, director Danny Boyle delivered this in spades.<br /><br />\\"127 Hours\\" is a full feature film about this tragic but conquering incident.  Aron Ralston, an avid climber and hiker, played by the talented James Franco, made the near fatal mistake of not telling anyone where he was going.  Ralston sets out to his \\"home away from home\\" and meets a couple of less experienced hikers looking for some adventure.  He takes them to a beautiful spot where they enjoy a brief swim, though this section is not factual to the real experience.  Afterward, Ralston continues his trek and ends up, as the real Aron Ralston named his book, stuck \\"between a rock and a hard place\\".  What follows is his incredible journey to free himself, rappel a 65 foot rock wall and hike over 8 miles to finally be rescued in one of the most emotional endings in a film to date.<br /><br />There were a lot of challenges in developing a feature length film based on Ralston's amazing story.  Many wondered how director Danny Boyle would keep the audience engaged since the setting is a single place with a single character.  Not to mention the fact that we all know how the story ends up.  Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor and Best Picture it's obvious they overcame these challenges.  For one thing, the pacing is perfect as was the accompanying music.  Boyle seamlessly transitioned slow dismal scenes with those of  courage and optimism.  This worked largely due to the variety of music used in the film.  From the outstanding original score from A.R. Rahmin to the uplifting \\"Lovely Day\\" by Bill Withers and the surreal finale from Sigur R&oacute;s.  To me it seemed like the music was an auditory way of showing his inner thoughts during the whole experience, the soundtrack was a character all it's own.<br /><br />\\"127 Hours\\" is a powerful movie and story.  One in which could not have been so successful had it not been for the astounding direction and cinematography.  Boyle's team brought the experience of trekking the Utah canyons to life with fluid camera work.  A closeup shot of Franco's hand sliding against the rock wall while navigating through the canyon is just one of many examples.  Personally, I thought this film should have been not only nominated for Best Cinematography in the Academy Awards but also won.  Boyle is a master of his craft and this film further propels him to the top of the list of best directors working today.<br /><br />I won't get into the \\"meat\\" of the amputation scene, but I will say that it was one of the most intense things I've witnessed in film.  That is saying a lot considering the types of movies I watch and review here.  Disturbingly accurate this scene was filmed in one take using multiple camera's and only one prosthetic arm.  Yet another testimony to Franco's superb acting.  Following the amputation scene we see more outstanding direction and cinematography as Ralston makes the final journey to his rescue.  The best part about this final sequence is that we know what happens but while watching we are at the edge of our seat.  We put aside what we already know and just go along for the ride.  The direction causes us to be unsure if he will make it or not.  That is the brilliance of \\"127 Hours\\" and Boyle's production team.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film as it is one of the best stories and film of at least the last few years.  Boyle said it best and I'll end this review with his quote:<br /><br />\\"This isa film about how precious life is. And it's only precious because of other people. It's not precious in itself, which is what we sometimes think - we think the will to survive is an individualistic thing. ... But it's actually connected to other people. And that's what the life essence is really about - it's always about other people, even in the loneliest places.\\" - Danny Boyle<br /><br />[...]ious because of other people.

0756405890|5.0|Was an excellent book, with many surprises and wonders, I would say it is the best modern fiction written yet. Most of the complaints about this book take a jab at the character Kvothe. Most complain that he is a prideful red head Fabio. However they should actually read the book. The plot covers a young man who has legends and myths written or told about him. Thus, he is giving the true story of what occurred. First, he is diminishing the lies and showing his audience that he is no wizard. Second it is a fantasy, so there is reason for an abnormal young man who has the ability to excel at everything he tries. Third Kvothe is not perfect he does fail ad different moments in the story.   With all of that typed, I must say I have been waiting on the edge of my seat waiting for the second book to come out. Name of the Wind left me just wanting more. I was excited about the beauty of the story and at the same time I was so mad that it was over. This book is well worth the time.
0446195529|4.0|I've been a fan of the Camel Club since the first book, and was excited to see a new addition.    This one is more Stone/Carr based than the others, but the Club does play an important part.  Of all the books, this one has the most plot twists, and will keep you guessing until the end.  (Although the final twist made very little sense, and seemed to be tacked on for dramatic purposes.)    One other reason I didn't give it a five, was the offhand way in which a love interest from the previous book was cast aside in a single short paragraph.  I mean, if you're going to spend an entire book setting up a relationship, have a bit more consideration for your readers when you decide not to continue it.    But overall, I found the book enjoyable.  The character of Carr is the driving force behind the story, and some new faces give it a fresh feel.    Listened to it on audio book and the reading was excellent.
0670022411|5.0|Finally a book, paranormal, that I really enjoyed. I feel that this book was a breath of fresh air.  The storyline made for some mystery and involved things that required a little bit of knowledge to follow.  So many of the paranormal books now have such a teen themed storyline, it was nice to have one that appeals to adults. The romance was nice in the fact that for once the two were in love enough to not let anyone stand in their way, and not have any battles about their feelings for more than 1 chapter.  I also like the fact that the romance didn't dominate the storyline.  Also, yes, it left a sort of cliff hanger at the end, but to me wrapped up the first part of the story very nicely making room for the next book.  To the people that find this book boring, maybe sticking to the teen themed books, for you, would  be a good idea.

It may have been re-mastered in 1080p, but it loks awful.  I have seen this movie on Netflix thru my Roku & the dvd is no better.

1936594366|5.0|Herman Hesse has an undeniable talent to narrate the life of a young man who searches for the enlightenment in a very simple yet deeply symbolic and poetic matter. Not only has he done this but also expressed the common sentiment of buddhism and zen philosophy that emphasizes on intuition and experience rather than theories and abstract analysis. Herman Hesse also beautifully colors the mystical-like experience of the protagonist that almost awakens my imagination. However, after becoming sober from this ecstatic reading, I can only perceive this literature with some nostalgia and light-hearted fondness.

0060775858|5.0|As a children's book author and mom I admire the writings of Margaret Wise Brown for years. Margaret created one of the most beloved children's book that has held a special place in our hearts. I remember reading this countless times to my girls when they were younger. I think it's a timeless story and helps young children feel more comfort before bedtime. I know with my youngest daughter she had fears of the dark and bed time was anxiety provoking for her. We had to read Goodnight moon each night. Both my girls loved looking at all the little details in the pictures and finding and saying goodnight to all characters and objects in the book. They especially enjoyed the goodnight nobody page! What a clever ending to a creative bedtime story. It's a must have for any young child!
B001FA0NOM|4.0|I was interested in finding out the basics of game theory to determine if I wanted to learn more about it and this book was perfect for that purpose.  They use concrete, down-to-earth examples to illustrate the basics of game theory and how they can be applied in real life.  I immediately found myself examining everyday situations from a game theoretical perspective and thinking about how I \\"signal\\" to others.  Very engrossing read and definitely worth the time.      Bonus - the \\"Trips to the Gym\\" (opportunities to think about and apply topics discussed in each chapter) and case studies were great exercises to help me check my understanding of each principle, which was tremendously helpful.
1852691247|5.0|Eric Carle wrote and illustrated a wonderful story of a little caterpillar that munches through leaves, apples, hot dogs, cakes and more. With each bite the caterpillar grows, then spinning a cocoon and finally emerging into a beautiful, colorful butterfly. I remember the laughter and giggles when reading this delightful story to my girls. They loved the bright colors and learned about healthy foods vs. not so healthy. They also learned that if you eat too much you may feel a little sick. I particularly liked how it taught children that eating a health leaf made the caterpillar feel better again. My girls learned about the days of the week and how a caterpillar goes from a tiny little egg into a beautiful bright butterfly. The highlight for the girls were sticking their fingers through the fun holes in the board book with each passing day. This book is a definite must have for any little one!

I just wish I can follow up with my kids activities, studies, music and sports lessons like Amy Chua but its exhaustive and I have to choose my battles as a parent given the time I have to juggle work,kids activities and other things.  I have Chinese friends who raises their kids similar to  Amy Chua's way. They have strict rules and high expectations and the kids excel in academics and music, very minimal TV time (1 hour/week).  I thought they were kidding me when they told me what they expect from their kids e.g. A grades, music, learn how to read and write Chinese, and maintain the GT standing (gifted and talented) or Advanced Classes and practice.   This book just helped understand more of the way Chinese parents discipline their kids to make sure the kids meet their expectations.  Amy's book answers the question, why most Chinese kids excel in academics and music. Interesting read!
0307341577|4.0|A vivid, powerful story about believable characters. If I could give the book 4.5 stars, I would, with the half taken off only because one piece of the ending felt undeveloped and abrupt. Gillian Flynn is a fantastic writer, and I can't wait to see what she does next.
0061876755|2.0|Bought this book in London because I saw the billboards all over the place.  Looked interesting.  It wasn't.  Very far fetched and unbelievable on pretty much every turn.  Our lead character I not only DIDN'T root for, but wish he would fail so the book would be over.  Not a horrid author though (thus the 2 stars), just a really stupid book.

B001PPGAIA|2.0|It took a little longer to get in the mail than I thought it would, but the movie was entertaining .  I can't say I would recommend it though.
0865479186|5.0|Apologies for the spoiler (never quite sure what constitutes a spoiler in non-fiction) but this book is best explained by one of the many hilarious/head-against-brick-wall insights found within.<br /><br />- you'll always find the science reporting in newspapers (and other mass medias) dummed down, however notice that the financial, sports and literature sections are not thusly treated -<br /><br />Bad Science is pretty much about what it says its about. In perhaps a similar vein to \\"The Republician War on Science\\" Goldacre reviews many a popular misconception, with a particular focus on health (the author having a medical background and all) and slams the glimmicky bussiness of alternative with hard science.<br /><br />Goldacre puts a slightly audacious, (but yet to be disproven) theory that much of the misconceptualisation of science comes from humanity majors working in the reporting industry and failing to, or actively neglecting to get the science right.<br /><br />Clearly, hard science won't give you as many headlines, or hold the interest of the public for long, however Goldacre outlines exactly what will, and has already gone wrong with bad science reporting.<br /><br />Sadly its hard to imagine this book making any difference where it counts. Maybe just maybe, someone might pick it up and learn a thing or to. Most likely this book will be read by those already mostly aligned with science, but its still a better world with this book in it than without.
0553584537|1.0|The beginning was very promising. A sniper kills a man threatening his wife and child, now the officer himself is in jeopardy. The wife is pursued by memories of childhood abuse and her son is desperately sick. The book goes downhill from there. If you like soap operas, the hard-to-believe twists and turns will rival one. The characters are impossible to like and the story is, as another reviewer mentioned and I find the word appropriate, yuck. I wanted to like this book but simply couldn't. Writing is not easy and I appreciate the effort and the pedigree of the author but I can't recommend this book.

0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss' \\"Name of the Wind\\" is the best new fantasy novel I have read in some time.  The character Kvothe is very interesting and the story/plot is excellent as well.      The story really pulls you in and you feel like you are right along with Kvothe as he starts his adventures.  I found myself trying to think up ways to help Kvothe throughout the novel, even when I wasn't reading it...and weirdly enough Rothfuss seems to know what the readers are thinking, and he seems to incorporate your ideas as you read along. This novel is very immersive that way.    This book combines excellent writing to go along with adventure, fantasy, a little romance, and some mystery thrown in the mix.  I would recommend this novel to anyone!
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|**This review contains elements of the film that would be considered spoilers to those who havn't seen it!**    I remember seeing this film in a small theater in Los Angeles when I was about 10 years old. Admittedly, a lot of the material was inappropriate for me at this age, and I was not able to truly appreciate all of the wonderful elements of this film. However, even at that young age, I was still able to appreciate the smart dialog, character development, and gratuitous violence. As I got older, matured, and became a student of film and fan of Quentin Tarantino, I re-watched this film multiple times. I bought the special edition DVD and ultimately the Blu-ray version when it was released. Not only have I grown to love the more subtle elements of the script, characters, and cinematography.     The performances by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette easily carry the film, and although I am not a sucker for love stories, I could not help but root for characters of Clarence and Alabama. Subsequent appearances by Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, while small, are breathtaking pieces of filmmaking. There are many other cameo-like appearances (like Brad Pitt) that enhance the movie without seeming cheap. Quentin Tarantino has carved out a unique niche over the course of his career, and his ability to develop characters and utilize dialog to grab the viewer by the seat of his pants and not let go is displayed with perfection in this film. Even hardcore movie critics and enthusiasts need to watch this film a couple times to pick up on all the great little nuances throughout.    Tony Scott, famous for Crimson Tide, Top Gun, Domino, and Man on Fire, does an excellent job of capturing the characters and distilling breathtaking performances out of the actors. In traditional Tarantino fashion, the movie contains an epic Mexican Standoff toward the end. This movie is not at all predictable, and I still pop it in every once in a while to watch it. The extras contained on the Blu-ray are essentially the same as those on the special edition DVD and include commentaries by cast and crew that are definitely worth listening to once you have seen the movie. The alternate ending is also spectacular and is more true-to-fashion for Tarantino.    In conclusion, this movie is absolutely great. Fans of Quentin Taranino must see this film. Watch it for a first, second, and third time, and then watch it with commentary. It is really difficult to go into too much detail about the actual content of the film, because there is something to be said for seeing it for the first time. I dont write many reviews, and give almost no 5 star endorsements, but I feel that it is necessary for True Romance, as it is definitely one of the top 10 movies I have ever seen, and I consider myself a tough crowd and well-rounded film critic.
0765326353|5.0|I am a short time fan of Brandon Sanderson.  I recently read the Mistborn novels and Warbreaker...I really enjoyed those novels.  I preordered The Way of Kings and was enthralled for a week or more.  This book is excellent if you like Sanderson and Epic fantasy check, it out...you won't be dissappointed!  There are lots of hidden little easter eggs scattered throughout so take your time.      Can't wait for Volume 2!
B002ZG994U|4.0|Here's a really truncated Movies in Review for 2010: First came THE LOSERS, then came the real thing. \\"If you have a problem, if no one else can help...and if you can find them, maybe you can hire... the A-Team.\\" This is a perfectly suitable, updated big screen adaptation of the television adventure show. No, these aren't the actors that I grew up watching, and Dirk Benedict was one of my childhood heroes, having played \\"Face\\" and \\"Starbuck\\" - and George Peppard and Mr. T were hugely iconic. But this new cast doesn't embarrass itself, even if it doesn't quite supplant the original actors. I pity the fool who tries to replace Mr. T.<br /><br />Ixnay on the Vietnam War-ay; this quartet of elite Army Rangers is firmly entrenched in contemporary times, and you can guess what sexy war in which they made their hay. The movie opens in Mexico as it unveils the A-Team's origin (and how B.A. got his fear of flying). After glossing over this Alpha unit's following eighty successful missions over the span of eight years, the movie arrives at the meat of the plot. It involves the heist of U.S. currency plates and a calculated frame job which lands the team behind bars. It turns out, you really can't trust private contractors. Or the CIA. No, really.<br /><br />Except that men of action can sit on their hands for only so long, doing bupkis. Six months in stir is more than long enough for Colonel Hannibal Smith to hatch and implement a jailbreak. He springs his cohorts (quite easily), and off they go, seeking bloody retribution, the mastermind, the mad dog pilot, the pretty, pretty con man... and the pacifist. Because after six months of incarceration, Corporal Bosco \\"B.A.\\" Baracus has grown out his mohawk and embraced non-violence. And that's not the only swerve.<br /><br />Liam Neeson as Col. Hannibal Smith is an interesting choice, and while he doesn't dethrone George Peppard's original interpretation, he lends plenty of gravitas. It's hard to front on a good actor like Neeson. Meanwhile, Lt. \\"Faceman\\" Peck, confirmed bachelor and carouser supreme, harbors serious hankerings for the very fine Lieutenant Sosa, an old flame who keeps walking in and out of his life. And since she's played by Jessica Biel, you can understand his hang-up. This romantic thread provides the film's one stab at narrative depth, and it still plays sorta frivolous. But it's undeniable that Biel and Bradley Cooper set up sparks.<br /><br />When is overkill a good thing? When it's the A-Team in a motion picture, is when. Fans of the television show will flock to this. Casual viewers may wonder what the fuss is about. But let's not lie to ourselves now, we didn't come to watch this film to sip tea and behave all artsy fartzy. It's not Jane Austen's THE A-TEAM. We expect rough and rugged humor and the swagger and these four boisterous personalities interacting with each other. And we expect the audacious cartoon violence as only the A-Team can deliver it. And we get what we expect. It doesn't get loopier than when \\"Mad Dog\\" Murdoch ends up flying a friggin' tank! And, for the nostalgics, there's even a fleeting cameo of Dirk Benedict, the original Faceman. So, no, you won't stumble over any rich plot development. Instead, you have to push that \\"Suspension of Disbelief\\" button. This button is located right next to the switch labeled \\"Now Inject Introspective Scene In Film\\" (this switch doesn't work).<br /><br />For the trivia-heads: Real life MMA fighter Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson, who plays B.A. Baracus, lost some street cred when he got his bu++ beat in his very next octagon match following this film.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features: The option to watch the film in either the Theatrical Release (01:58:40 minutes) or the Extended Version (02:13:26 minutes); Audio Commentary by director Joe Carnahan (but only on the theatrical version); an A-TEAM theme mash-up montage (00:01:35); and the theatrical trailer.Meanwhile, Lt. \\"Faceman\\" Peck, confirmed bachelor and carouser supreme, harbors serious hankerings for the very fine Lieutenant Sosa, an old flame who keeps walking in and out of his life.

0765322889|4.0|Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson is the beginning of the 10 book Epic series \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\".  The first thing I would say about this novel is that you need to be patient.  Give it about 150 pages before you give it up...  the ending and the series are definately worth it! There is so much detail here it feels somewhat overwhelming at first, but again push through!  If you are a fan of Epic military fantasy this is right up your alley.  Give it a Try!

0786955570|5.0|I think there is an argument that can be made for buying this game makes a better introduction to D&D than the D&D Red Box Starter Set and it is a better bang for your buck.  I know that seems unlikely, but hear me out.  The D&D Red Box Starter Set is focused mostly on developing an abbreviated character, and once you have worked through the module there is no use for the module ever again.  It is one shot and then it is over.  Not only that, but the next step is to purchase Heroes of the Fallen Lands, which will tell you to take your abbreviated character and rework it from scratch.  To be quite frank, Heroes of the Fallen Lands does a very good job walking you through the process of creating a complete character from scratch, much better than the original 4e Players Handbook.  It makes me regret getting the D&D Red Box Starter Set.  The D&D Red Box Starter Set had my kids and I spending so much time penciling in figures on a character sheet, it really hampered our ability to play.<br /><br />Castle Ravenloft comes with 5 already configured characters.  Now I admit the board game does use an abbreviated form of the d20 core mechanics for 4e D&D, but that actually seemed to be a great introduction into how the mechanics work for my children.  In addition to that, this game can be easily played over and over again.  The game comes with 13 adventures and the website had 5 more I could print up.  And each adventure feels like a whole new game each time it is played, because of the way the game is designed.  On a side note, I love, love, love the interlocking dungeon tiles.  I wish D&D had published all of their dungeon tiles in this interlocking style.

0061122416|5.0|I saw this on the shelf of my local book store when I was in the checkout line pruchasing another book. The Alchemist caught my eye, so I bought it too. I have to say this is my new favorite book and after reading this, I plan on buying the rest of Paulo Coelho's books.     It is actually very simple story line, but I thought it was delightful and deep. It describes the situations the boy, Santiago (main charachter) finds himself in, and reading this made me feel intellectual. I will not go into detail about what is written in the book, but it was such a spiritual, down to earth, deep book. Very well written. It made me think of the way things are, they way everything happens and if things are just a coincidence or if they are planned out for you by a higher power.     This book made me feel like no book has done before. It sent a message, and made me think hard about the situations in life. The good and the bad, and how everything could be tied together as your destiny. Follow your dreams and listen to your heart, is the main lesson I got from the book.
0374158460|5.0|This is a complex book set in the modern day with modern characters and modern issues. Adultery, cheating, lying, fraud, illegal drugs, political wheeling and dealing, conservation, and even a tire slashing scene are all part of the story. Reading this book reminds me of reading classical literature during my college years at college, only better as I can relate more to these characters of modern times than I did the ancient literature settings. However, the author definitely has a point to his book and something to say about the modern human-as all good literature should. I would read then turn back two chapters to re-read a scene over again in relation to the new chapter of information I was in the mist of reading. The characters I loved at the beginning became the characters I loved to hate in the middle and then the characters I pitied by the end. While the characters I hated at the beginning became the characters I understood by the end. Such complex characters which show the true nature of the human condition, selfish, ever changing, and growing personalities. Some of the characters even remind of my my own family members and their actions. Way better better than the main stream reading by authors who write merely to \\"entertain\\" the reader this author writes to teach his readers. Definitely a book worth reading.

0756404738|4.0|WARNING: The review below contains spoilers.    The first book of the Kingkiller Chronicles took the fantasy world by storm, and now the long-awaited sequel has finally arrived in the whopping thousand-page Wise Man's Fear; fans will not be disappointed in this fantastic follow-up to The Name of the Wind.    Readers are returned first to Kote at the Waystone Inn with his friend and apprentice, Bast.  A new day begins, after the stories and surprising events of the one before.  Chronicler sits ready to record the story, while Kote has already been up many hours, preparing fresh cider and newly baked bread.  And so Kote continues the story of his life, the story of Kvothe the arcanist.  The sixteen year-old continues his studies at the University, struggling to get by.  He has spent his recently acquired monies on a new lute and now has little to show for it, but the instrument is an investment.  Now raised to the next level of arcanist, Re'lar, his tuition is considerably higher, and his must borrow money to pay for it.  Fortunately, he has his incredible talent as a musician and singer, and is able to make some money this way through a clever scheme at the inns.  Then there is the Fishery, where all manner of arcana are made.  Kvothe has spent previous terms learning and inventing simple items such as sympathy lamps that bring in a decent amount of money, but this term he is challenged to create something truly unique; it will take him many months, but the result will fetch a high price.  Kvothe is also finally granted access to the priceless Archives once more, and after learning how to travel its complex, labyrinthine halls, corridors and stacks; begins his incessant research on the unknown Chandrian, for they are the ones who murdered his family and friends.  Meanwhile, Kvothe's relationship with Deanna continues to go nowhere fast, as he does all he can to make her happy and feel special . . . everything that is except confess his love for her.  He even breaks into the rooms of his mortal enemy to steal back Deanna's ring and proceeds to get himself into a whole mess of trouble.    At the end of the term, Kvothe seems to have everything in order, but has a couple of options: he can continue with his studies the following the semester, and risk having the gossip of his involvement jeopardize his studies; or he can leave town and try something different for a while.  Fortunately at that moment, there is a rich noble from Vintas looking to woo a certain lady and needs one skilled with words.  So begins the second half of the book, as Kvothe is soon on his way and finds himself involved in the noble courts, as a different world is revealed to the reader of manners and ways and courtly intrigue.  Kvothe is also employed into a gang to stop a band of bandits terrorizing the tax collectors.  In this gang he befriends a unique man and seeks to learn his ways and culture.  The question is whether he can understand and learn this man's language, as well as stop these bandits once and for all.  Meanwhile, in the back of his mind, Kvothe wonders and hopes if the rich noble who has employed him may wish to take him on permanently as his patron.    In this thrilling and worthy sequel, Rothfuss does an excellent job of balancing the familiar of The Name of the Wind with plenty of new and fascinating material, furthering the complexity and interest of the world, its people, and its varied cultures and ways.  While the heavy tome could've stood to loose a few pages in editing, readers will no doubt be delighted with its length and depth.  To many - as with this reviewer - this book will exceed their expectations and prove to be an even better episode in the Kingkiller Chronicles than the previous one. Patrick Rothfuss has proven in Wise Man's Fear that he can deliver the goods, and while he may need to take his time to get the writing done, the result is an epic giant in the world of fantasy that will be remembered for a long time.

She is one of my favorite mystery writers and I always enjoy her books.  And Then There Were None is a wonderful psychological thriller that captured my attention from the first page.  The way the characters interact with each other is fascinating and how each one begins to suspect all the others is also very interesting.  What happens to these people and how they try to make sense of what is going on around them is wonderful.  The mood of the book is creepy from the first page and I always find that the book keeps you guessing until the end about how things are carried out the way they are.<br /><br />I believe Agatha Christie paved the way for other mystery writers and began a mystery writing industry that created an environment of gripping and intense storylines and unique studies of human behavior, perverse justice, and social interactions.  I could reread her books over and over again and find new and different ways that she makes her books unique and exciting for readers
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I own Nicole Conn's other movies as well and with Elena Undone, Conn has finally hit the jackpot.  Many lesbian films truly lack in quality and I have a stack of films waiting to be given away or trashed.  Elena Undone is one of my favorites and is in my special stack.  I've viewed the film many times since it arrived in the mail.  The story is about two women, one lesbian and one straight, who meet and they fall in love.  The main theme is about \\"soulmate\\" or \\"twin spirit\\" love.  For Elena and Peyton, they fall in love.  Of course, as with many lesbian films, one character learns more about themselves and gains or liberates the unknown or other part of their identity of their sexual orientation.  Elena learns about herself and decides it is better to live her life in truth and struggles to leave her heterosexual marriage to live in her truth.  Peyton falls in love with Elena and she fights with trust issues being skeptical of Elena's love.  She knows Elena is going through this process of finding herself and Peyton questions Elena's love.  I won't divulge the ending as you all need to get this film and enjoy it.  The chemistry between the characters Peyton and Elena (played by Traci Dinwiddie and Necar Zadegan) is plausible as both actors performed well and brought the characters to life.  Bravo!  I get caught up every time I view the film, and for me that is good as I usually pick apart the bad editing, acting, and dialogue.  I did see one or two editing mistakes but nothing that takes from the film.  There are a few bad lines, but again I was impressed by the majority of dialogue and actually enjoyed the humor between Peyton and her friend Wave's conversations.  The sarcasm and teasing was great and brought plausibility to the relationship.  Overall, what I would say to Nicole Conn if I had the honor is \\"Bravo!  You did it this time!\\"  Standing ovation for this one for sure!
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|Eight years ago, the closet thing [[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron]], Disney's 1982 Pioneering Special Effects venture gone horribly wrong (or right, depending on how you watch it), ever got to a sequel was the 2003 game [[ASIN:B00007JZB3 Tron 2.0]] and for all intents and purposes, it was probably a venture everybody except TRON fans were scratching their heads over. Six years later (I think), Disney releases a teaser demo of the future that would eventually become TRON: Legacy; TRON fans are ecstatic, general audiences (half of which are young enough to wonder \\"what or who the heck is Tron?\\") are wondering why Disney is even attempting to resurrect a non-franchise that barely gave them the desired revenue return they wanted well over two decades ago. Trepidation and excitement fills the air when the PR-machine for Legacy kicks into high gear in the early months of 2010 and before you know it, the month of December is here and everyone's geared up and ready to see the sequel.    I'm intrigued, my sister's intrigued, my parents don't want to see it (they didn't like the original). I'm monitoring the movie's progress with semi-interest and when the reviews start pouring in, I read both sides of the argument with careful consideration, but figured, given the utter volume that were all saying the same thing (\\"worth it only to see in IMAX/3D/For the special effects, weak story/performances\\") I figured that many people couldn't lie and everyone defending it to the death were seeing things through rose colored glasses. That and my mother told me the original was bad so there was no hope for this at all.    \\"man,\\" I thought. \\"I wanna see this movie, but everyone says its bad.\\" So were the so-called \\"Negative Reviews\\" right about TRON: Legacy? In a nutshell, yeah, they were. Does that mean the movie wasn't enjoyable, though? No, not really.    ---- Our story begins with the disembodied voice of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) narrating to his son, Sam, the tale of \\"The Grid\\". The digitalfrontier within our computers/servers that he's seemingly always dreamed of going to (despite being \\"accidentally\\" digitalized into it in the original film) and eventually got in. Father and Son fanboy over characters Tron and CLU [2.0] and the tale ends with a mystery that Flynn simply describes as a \\"Wonderful Miracle\\". Before he leaves for work, he promises to take Sam with him to the Grid one day. But, as [mis]fortune would have it, that day never comes. Kevin has mysteriously vanished into the ether, leaving his son a practical orphan (his mother died in a car crash in 1985), guardianed by his father's parents. After a moving pictures sequence that wraps parts of the backstory of pre-Legacy up in a nice little package, we flash-forward 27 years into the future. Sam has become the atypical \\"rebel without a clause\\", causing a ruckus in his father's fortune 500 company (ENCOM) every now and again for the hell of it, via leaking new-software onto the internet for the public (because it was meant to be FREE and sharable originally) and BASE-jumping off the EMCOM tower.     He goes to jail, gets bailed out and is confronted by Alan Bradley, a mere figure head in the company since Kevin's disappearance, who tells him he got a page from his father's disconnected server at FLYNN'S [Arcade]. Sam is initially uninterested at first, playing the IDGAF-card, but ends up visiting the old arcade anyway. Next you know he's sucked into the Grid (via half-hearted digitalization sequence), but it's not how his father described it. His Doppelganger, ClU [2.0] has enslaved the system under the belief that he has brought true perfection and order to their world. When Sam escapes, he discovers Kevin has been hiding away in the outlands with a unique program named Quorra, contemplating how to bring CLU [2.0] down once and for all. Only, if they do things Kevin's way, it would mean staying within the Grid and letting the portal to the real world close for good. Naturally, thickheaded Sam decides to take the direct approach and well...things don't turn out so good for our heroes. ----    Despite having low expectations in regards to the quality of the film's structure (story wise), I was really disappointed by the execution of it all. I've never seen so much NOTHING happen within the span of two hours. Absolutely nothing significant happens in the movie. At least in the original Tron, there was an objective: \\"Recover Flynn's stolen idea(s) from the ENCOM system before Dillinger could erase his misdeeds from existence in the real world. Stop the MCP and Sark from taking complete control of the ENCOM mainframe in the computer world.\\"     With Legacy, its \\"Get into the Grid, Find Dad, Get out of the Grid\\". That's it. It's subplots concerning the unexplained ISO's and the back-story behind everything that's shown/mentioned in flashbacks (Mrs. Flynn's death, Flynn's sudden erratic/obsessive behavior over his work, the rise and fall of the Grid, the brainwashing of Tron, Alan's suddenly unwavering faith in Flynn*, the rise of CLU [2.0]'s dictatorship, and the creation/demise of the ISO's) are practically a unshot film themselves and provide little or no substance. Legacy is in such a rush to get to the Grid, to the Disc Arena, the Light Cycle races and anything that resembles a fight or a massive special effects scene, that the movie begins to feel like it just wants to be done and over with itself. There's no patience, just rushing. Like the first film, Legacy feels too content to gloss over the things that will make you give a damn about your central character (Sam Flynn, portrayed by Garrett Hedlund) and his quest.    With that said, the special effects in the movie, like the original, are the biggest focus of the production's attention. From the updated (and practical) light-suits, the manner in which characters are derezzed (aka \\"killed\\"), to vehicles and THE GRID itself (which is a personal server belonging to Flynn, located in the bowls of his arcade), it's everything TRON couldn't be because of the limitations of the time. Long story short, it's a lovely light show without the ecstasy, acid and alcohol. If I have any complaint it's that the universe feels less like a computer generated world (it's too dark so the only thing your really looking at are the illuminated lines that make up the illusion of physical mass) and more like the world of [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]] without the multitude of colors and big screens with Asians selling coca cola.     Jeff Bridge's youthful appearance in the movie is ugly. It's a old, bloated face pressed smooth of it's wrinkles. It doesn't resemble Jeff Bridges' in the late 1980s in any shape or form. At least not in the way it should. The eyes are devoid of emotion, the mouth moves out of sync with his words the skin looks so much like plastic it's not even funny. Those using pitiful argument that he's supposed to look like that because he's a computer program simply need to remember the opening sequence of the film to find themselves debunked. [[ASIN:B000HCO83Q X-Men: The Last Stand]] and [[ASIN:B001FB55I0 Terminator Salvation]] (2009)'s attempt at a youthful Patrick Stewart, Ian McKelen and Arnold Schwarzenegger are better entries than this. Even better, all one has to do is remember [[ASIN:B001U0HBPQ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]] (2008) to see what a de-aged or aged facade looks like done right. Legacy's visual effects team really dropped the ball in that area.    There are plenty homages to the first film, but like any sequel without a true road of it's own to carve, it copies so much of it's processor that it really doesn't bring anything new to the table beyond the updated special effects and Daft Punk (no hoaky electric keyboard music from [[ASIN:B00005V8J7 Wendy Carlos]] here). Because of this and the title card that simply says \\"TRON\\" and not \\"TRON: Legacy\\" the majority have come to consider Legacy a \\"soft reboot\\" of the original film.     Me? I justcall that plain lazy writing and a common problem that occurs in almost every sequel (whatever the medium) that's ever been made. The sequel bait, Cillian Murphy's cameo, Quorra and the \\"Miracle of the ISO\\" plot, practically screams that the writer's had written themselves into a corner with a idea that never made much sense to begin with. It's most likely something that will either be poorly explained (and widely accepted) or ignored completely (and pointed out constantly) if Disney gets that coveted greenlight for a Tron 3.    The thing that interested me most in Tron (1982) was Flynn's uncanny ability to manipulate the digital world around him with just a touch and bring dead vehicles back to life or re-energize dying programs. Yes, it could be explained away by simply stating \\"Well, he's the USER. He can do anything because he technically has complete control over the system he's in\\", but I would've loved to have seen this sequel expand more on the \\"how\\" of it, rather than just exploiting it again and expecting the audience go along with it. That and other things I can't pinpoint without a another viewing of the film.    The characters are more or less present to get you from point A to point B. The same could be said of the performances from the actors, with the exception of maybe Olivia Wilde and Bruce Boxleitner. Sam Flynn, by definition, is a character that could've been interesting in the hands of a more capable actor (maybe). As it stands, Sam is no more interesting than \\"Anon\\" from [[ASIN:B0030MQPQ8 TRON: Evolution]]. He speaks, he rebels and spits in the face of authority, sure, but it's all hollow. There's no personality or spark of life strong enough to motivate me to care for the Son of Flynn. Garrett Hedlund's linear and doldrum performance leaves me wishing I had a better protagonist (or actor) to root for.     Jeff Bridges is utterly wasted in both his performance as Kevin Flynn and his facsimile, CLU [2.0]. Kevin sits (or walks around) looking morose, spouting pseudo-spiritual nonsense that doesn't sound terribly spiritual or deep. Other times he plays up the \\"Dude, I'm from the 80s!\\" persona a little too much. CLU [2.0] struts about, throwing out orders and smiling sinisterly at every little thing, playing computer-Hitler, but whatever potential he had as a villain is utterly squandered by the writers. But, then, I suppose that's no different from Sark via TRON, who spends most of his time glaring at screens, smacking his henchmen to the ground and getting railed on by the MCP. Neither villain amounts to anything, especially not in the final acts of either film. (But at lest Sark got a headshot death.)    And while we're at it, Rinzler (a brained-washed Tron, who is believed to be dead by Flynn and most of the Grid), CLU [2.0]'s right hand man is completely unimpressive. I really expected something with the way people were going on about how \\"awesome\\" this character was, but in the end the most Rinzler does is cock his head, mock Darth Vader and strike a pose with his twin Identity Discs like he's in a photoshoot. It's a literal insult to even compare his character/actor to Darth Maul or Ray Park. Tron/Rinzler's body/stunt double, Anis Cheurfa, his movements are so stiff, so utterly lame, that I had to look away from the screen whenever he appeared. It's embarrassing to even think this is supposed to be Tron's villainous alter ego (especially since the body double they chose seems to be of average height verses Boxleitner's 6'2. You can see that much when he stands next to Olivia Wilde who is 5'7'). And their resolution for the character's redemption, their method of having Tron remember who he is again near the final gambit of the movie is just awful. So, yeah, people who say \\"Tron really isn't in this movie\\" aren't wrong. He spends most of his time under the lame guise of Rinzler, which is disappointing.    Michael Sheen's Castor/Zuse is another disappointing character entry and one I thought I would like, too. He's supposed to be a two-faced character who'll play both sides to get what he wants, but without prior introduction, it just looks like he sold Sam Flynn out to CLU [2.0] without a second thought. The offhanded comment that he \\"once believed in users\\" as a way to validate his scheming ways really doesn't count for anything. The character is made worse when they decide to let Sheen act the fool during a fight scene that has no emotional pay-off until Quorra literally looses an arm.    And while we're on her, out of everybody, Olivia Wilde stands out as the shining performer in this film (but that's not saying much). Quorra's a little like Yori (Cindy's Morgan's character and Tron's lover in the first film), only, instead of a engineer, you get a \\"Marcile ISO\\" who's primed for battle. She's a little naive and childlike in her comprehension of most things that aren't a dangerous situation. She's a undeniably cute character. Unfortunately, she is criminally underused in a lot of ways, not unlike Yori. Her chemistry with Hedlund works to great effect more or less because she does most of the emoting. Wilde is the one element of Legacy I expected to dislike the most, but I'm glad I was wrong.     Finally, Bruce Boxleitner's performance as Alan Bradley is rather more or less a non-comment. He's not horrible in any way, he's just there. The most I can say is that I simply enjoyed his presence/performance and the strange way he almost resembles his 32-year-old self near the end of the movie when the adventure is done and over with.    The main attraction for this film is undoubtedly DAFT PUNK's first motion picture score. I don't think I would've given this film a second glance if I hadn't heard they were scoring for it. In retrospect, they were the biggest part of the film's promotion and part of why the movie isn't a complete loss (aside from the ending of the film itself). Their cameo's in the movie are rather comical. They play MP3 programs who switch up the music everytime something happens. The score is quite unlike their albums (Discovery, Homework, Human After All), but there's enough of their sound and the typical orchestral elements --- that seem to hearken back to Don Davis at times --- that you'll be won over immediately. Themes like \\"Derezzed\\", \\"C.L.U.\\", \\"Adagio for TRON\\" and \\"The Game Has Changed\\" truly shine among what could be a soundtrack without a single bad single on it.     Overall, if there is anything I can give Legacy any credit for, it's making me give Tron (1982) a second chance, watching it and enjoying it despite the numerous flaws that usually have me going at a movie with a chainsaw or German cooking knife. Other than that, it doesn't live up to it's processor on any level, regardless of whether or not it was actually trying to. It fails simply because there were too many hands in the pot that was providing it's storyline. It introduces ideas and plots that never come to any sort of realization, the characters/actors are props for special effects.     You know there's a problem when the villain's big master plan is to escape into the real world and try to take over the world, [[ASIN:B000FA57HG Pinky and the Brain]] style, with a army of programs and big ship that probably wouldn't even fit the screen. As if, man. [A 3 out of 5]    *Yes, I know Alan, Lora and Flynn all become BFFs at the end of Tron, but their relationship never struck me as the kind that would inspire the kind of unshakable faith that Alan displays in Legacy. And if it did, this is something should've gotten a little screentime, otherwise, I'm forever rolling my eyes at this despite my affinity for strong friendships.

B00127RAJY|4.0|This video series is good for a day when you want a 20 minute workout.  I do not think it will create huge results because it is so short, but it is a nice video to have on hand for days when you do not want to do a longer workout.
0738702994|5.0|I love the imagery on this deck. Very soft and beautiful. My only complaint would be that I didn't receive the yellow tarot bag as pictured with my set. I don't know if they don't include it anymore or if it's an error in packaging. I also read another review on here that said the bag was missing but other than that... everything was perfect and the book that comes with the set is fantastic with a lot of information including reverse meanings.
B003FB0268|5.0|A must read! This book changed my view on life; can make even the most bitter person appreciate life! Do not go through life without reading this book, for I promise you it will not be nearly as fulfilling without it...  I don't care who you are, or what your views on the Holocaust are, read this book. Inspirational, Insightful, Touching and Breath-taking.
1416550550|5.0|The Forgotten Garden is a wonderful read...my entire Book Club loves it!  Part mystery, part Dickens, the novel unfolds in Australia and then moves to England, using back-and-forth timelines from 1800's to 1970's to the present day.  The two main characters, Eliza Makepeace & Rose Mountrachet, breathe life early on, grabbing your interest, as you try to discover the long-ago mystery of how one, small four-year-old ended up unaccompanied on a passenger ship bound for Australia.  Don't miss this very good read!!

B002ZG99NG|5.0|Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and his pals are career criminals.  On a bank job, they briefly take a hostage (Rebecca Hall) and soon after, she and Doug begin a romance.  He'd like to start a new life with her, but he can't change his ways and his next job is to rob Fenway Park.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  The characters are compelling and sympathetic and the script is fast-paced and intensely exciting.  Affleck co-wrote and directed this tale of Charlestown, Boston, an area famous for its high percentage of deadly criminals.  He captures the toughness and desperation of its inhabitants and the viewer  feels a connection to the place and the people.  Affleck is very good in his part and Jeremy Renner, who plays Doug's loyal but vicious buddy, was rightly nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  The wonderful Chris Cooper has a small part as Doug's convict father.<br /><br />The movie is full of brutal gunplay, car crashes, and bad language and still manages to portray Doug's sensitive side and have him emerge as a kind of hero.  Its edge-of-your-seat action kept me engaged even though I don't usually like this kind of movie.  Recommended.
B002ZG976U|5.0|In order to appreciate the movie you have to appreciate both the artists as well as the cinematography of theatre like performances. The visuals were outstanding, the acting was what I expected (not great but not terrible), and the music was sensational! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Christina and Cher as well as anyone who enjoy musicals in general. The movie was cute and a perfect start to Christina's acting career. Plus you cannot not appreciate the hotness of the cast!
B001EN71CW|4.0|Firefly is undeniably a brilliant series, and despite being cancelled after just one year, it remains one of my favorite TV shows of all time. This Blu-Ray package is the most complete collection of the series yet. The episodes are formatted in their original widescreen to play on modern TVs, and the menus look very slick in HD.    My only small complaint is that there was no indicator of what episodes or features were present on what disk of the multi-disk set. This makes tracking down specific features a bit of a pain, but it's a small issue.    If you want to own the best and most complete Firefly collection, this is the one. I also recommend purchasing Serenity on Blu-Ray of course.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The reviews this movie has been getting is just one more reason why I don't pay any attention to them.  I thought this movie was absolutely fabulous!  I have been to the theater three times already to see it, and as soon as I'm done writing this review, will be purchasing my own copy.  I always knew Christina Aguilera had a great voice, but being slightly older than her (lol) I never really bought any of her music.   After seeing this movie, I became a huge fan.  Her voice is without a doubt, one of the greatest of all time.  Maybe Celine Dion, or Streisand can compare, but certainly not Gaga, Beyonce, Perry or any of the current reigning queens of pop. Its amazing that huge voice of hers comes out of such a little person!  The costumes were awesome, the love story was adorable and I think Christina did just fine for her acting debut.  She certainly was not as bad as the critics made her out to be.  Kristin Bell was perfectly believable as the nasty Nicki and as for Cher, what can I say?  Cher is Cher - a one and only.   She looked GREAT and if I could get away with wearing the eye makeup she wore in that movie, I absolutely would! Stanley Tucci's character was hilarious and Eric Dane certainly lived up to his reputation as eye candy!  I highly, highly recommend going to see this movie if you can.  If not, buy your own copy - its certainly as good as  Chicago, if not better in my opinion.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Very pleased with my purchase of this complete set of the last season. Recommended for viewers who like a REAL STORY with action.
B002ZG9774|4.0|I liked this as much as I thought I would. I really liked the dance numbers, Cher is great, Stan Tucci is greater, and my speakers and sub adore the soundtrack. The only thing that took away from the experience was CA's plastic surgery-for me, pretty distracting. Her voice is a bit over the top for me, but she uses it to her advantage and it works in the film well. Other than that, great little film and will recommend to those who love a sexy dance number or two....
B003Q6D282|3.0|I loved this movie, but I really didn't appreciate the case for my copy coming basically shattered.  I expected better than this, especially from Amazon.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is without a doubt one of the best television shows that was ever created. The dialogue is well-written, combining a flair for the dramatic with charm and humor. The characters are well-developed and expertly portrayed by the actors. It is a tragedy that the show was cancelled due to mis-management and poor decisions made by Fox.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|first off all the actors in this movie do a top notch job and another thing i love about this movie is its not all CGI most of what you see is real. i dont see how you could hate on this movie its just to good to say anything bad about the acting in this movie seemed about as real as you could get and for a while i thought this movie couldnt hold anything but i decided to buy it and got what i paid for. this is one of the easiest 5 star reviews i have ever done since i have bought DVDs off amazon. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!
B001NHZ2KW|5.0|This is even better than the original theatrical release, which I saw at the Hollywood Cinerama Theatre. The video and sound have both been remastered and there are great special features. You can isolate different parts of the band in various songs, and there's great interviews and other cool stuff. I love this movie--it's classic Who. Unfortunately, I don't have a video/audio equipment that does this DVD set justice. Patience, Iago...    If you're a Who fan or simply love rock videos, this is an essential addition to your collection.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|For any of the Dr. Quinn series lovers, this is a must buy.  Good quality production and good series.  About the only drawback to the DVD is after each program, you must return to the main menu for the next show.
1597801585|5.0|Great story. Very engrossing. Bacigalupi creates a rich world in which the characters riff off each other resulting in a cresendo ending.<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns in the story. Not predictable at all.

B004EPYZOY|5.0|If you have any morals, this movie is not for you. Thankfully, I do not. Drive Angry is sure to offend some(the ones who shouldn't see it in the first place), for others, it will be an extremely satisfying affair. Packed full of F bombs, shot off limbs, and naked trailer trash, Drive Angry goes full throttle for all of its 104 minutes. As a huge Nicolas Cage fan(minus The Wicker Man and 8MM), he doesn't disappoint, but he wasn't the scene stealer. This honor would go to William Fichtner(the Accountant) for his hilarious portrayal of Satan's bounty hunter(in a way). Amber Heard also quite impresses as a strong female co-star who can hold her own in a fight.      While the plot is not incredibly complex(man escapes hell to rescue his granddaughter from a cult that plans to sacrifice her), it is enjoyable. Packed full of all the guilty pleasures and soon to be classic one liners, Drive Angry will not disappoint the sinner inside you.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. I got introduced to this game one \\"guys night\\" with my friends. We were sitting around with food and drink trying to learn this game (which didn't take long to explain and only a couple of turns to figure out the basics) having a great time. We figured out some strategies the 2nd time through and then got kind of cut-throat about it. I went home feeling like I hadn't had enough of the game, so I bought myself the starter, the 5-6 player expansion, the cities and knights expansion, and the barbarians expansion. My wife and I had her brother and his friend over, and they got hooked as well. Her brother went out and bought the game and introduced it to his fiance and several of their friends. We had my wife's sister and her boyfriend over and they both got hooked on it and bought each other the game for that following Christmas (which was only a couple months after we introduced them). They even bought the seafarers expansion and enjoyed it. The only time I've not enjoyed playing the game was when I played it with my parents and sister. My mother did not pay attention to the rules when we read through, constantly asked if she was allowed to do such and such, and then ended up beating the pants off of the rest of us 10points to 7, 6 and 5. Despite all that, everyone who's played this has either become addicted and gone out and bought their own, or has come back over on multiple occasions to play again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michaels is great at whipping your butt into shape if you need it. This is a fast-paced workout to kickstart getting into shape. The fact that I can be completely done with warm-up stretches, workout and cool-down stretching in a little over a half hour is a huge draw. (The actual workout part is about 23 minutes) I was very out of shape and had not exercised in ages. This workout was extremely challenging for me at first. (I could barely walk the first two days, but I felt wonderful!) 30DS did not get old or boring to me and I have been using it 5-7 days a week for two months now. I love levels 1 and 3 the most and do them together most days or do levels 1 and 2 to mix it up sometimes. I can't believe I can do two back-to-back levels when I think back on how hard the first days were. I have muscles where I used to be all flab and have dropped a nice bit of weight (with nutrition tracking as well - that is important) I have ordered more of her highly-rated DVDs  to mix it up and possibly try the 30-day Slimdown program.

B002BI6SMI|1.0|I always try to give a film a pass for bad lines in the first few mins. but when Liam's buddies say \\"remember that time in...\\" I thought Uh-oh that's strike whatever and how much longer will I have to watch this to see if there is at least one good character or something in the movie.

B003EYVXTQ|3.0|How \\"Winter's Bone\\" slipped into the Best Picture category is the very reason the category was widened. Remember last year how \\"The Blind Side\\" was nominated for Best Picture? The funny thing is that we watched \\"Winter's Bone\\" before it was nominated (several months before, in fact). When I watched the film I was not familiar with the novel. My experience with novel-to-film adaptations is that the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Always.<br /><br />That being said, I felt the pacing of \\"Winter's Bone\\" is what really killed it for me. Bordering on boring. You know that this girl is taking care of her family and that her father has disappeared. The premise is compelling, but its execution by the director is aimless. If Martin Scorsese had directed, then this film would have been classic.<br /><br />The ending is anti-climactic, but offers the most memorable scene in the entire film. It's a strange paradox. You see, if you want to see a well made film about white trash and hillbillies then you must be familiar with \\"Deliverance\\" (1972). It is a classic. The pacing is spot on, the tension is great, the performances by all actors is superb, and it still shocks 40 years later. Did I mention that \\"Deliverance\\" was also nominated for Best Picture? Yep. \\"Winter's Bone\\" is forgettable, and that's its greatest sin.<br /><br />I also agree that the then 19 year old Jennifer Lawrence's performance was good for a beginner, but not Oscar-caliber. Just look at what Natalie Portman did for \\"Black Swan\\", plus all the years Portman spent honing her acting chops. Was Portman nominated for \\"The Professional\\" (1994)? Nope. Was she good? Yep.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Winter's Bone\\" was not the worst film of 2010, but neither was it one of the best. It just kind of sat there, and in the end, it was not emotionally compelling cinema. I did not care about the main character's plight because I did not care about the main character, and that is the writer/director's fault. I will not be re-watching \\"Winter's Bone\\" any time soon, nor will I be recommending that anyone watch this. Instead, I will always suggest \\"Deliverance\\" in place of \\"Winter's Bone\\" for your consideration.e soon, nor will I be recommending that anyone watch this.

B00005N6KG|3.0|Over the past few years, I've bought at least half a dozen -- possibly far more -- of these Sony headphones for my iPod and iPod Shuffle. As is generally agreed, they're wonderfully cheap, and I happen to find over-the-head models like this a lot more comfortable than earbuds. BUT -- as so many Amazon commenters attest -- these damned phones are very flimsy and have a frustratingly short life; sometimes within weeks, certainly within months, one side will begin to get staticky, or it will simply go silent.<br /><br />I've come up with a possible fix. It's not foolproof, but it's actually made a big difference for me, and I recommend it; I've had the same pair of headphones now for close to a year, and they still work fine. (NOTE: For all I know, other commentators may have suggested the following remedy as well. However, I'm not about to read through the hundreds of comments to find out!)<br /><br />The model MDR-W08 phones I'm looking at right now have a curved grey plastic inset at each earpiece; they're maybe an inch and a half or two inches long and look a bit like huge fingernail clippings. (This would all be much simpler, needless to say, if I were showing you personally or doing so on video.) Each of these insets has a tiny hole in it, and if you unbend a paper clip (preferably large-size) and stick the end of the wire into the hole, you should be able to pry off the inset. It snaps off; it isn't glued on.<br /><br />Underneath -- in the crevice that the plastic inset covered up -- you'll find the wire nestled. This wire has a little knot in it to prevent its being completely pulled free of the (unseen) little speaker to which its end is attached, in the event that you yank too hard on the iPod end of the wire; in short, the knot anchors the wire inside the crevice. But you'll notice that it isn't located in the best place for this; there's still a little wiggle room, so that, if you accidentally yank on the wire, you're likely to wrench its attachment to the speaker and perhaps even separate it. Unfortunately, with normal use, that wire is going to become detached.<br /><br />I'd recommend removing each of the plastic covers (using the paper clip) and then, using tweezers (ideally tweezers with a long, thin nose), loosening the wire in each crevice by pulling it gently up through the hole (leaving the other end attached firmly to the earpiece) and then carefully loosening the knot and sliding the knot maybe 1/4 inch or 1/2 inch higher on the wire -- i.e., further away from the earpiece -- and then pressing the wire back inside the crevice and snapping the curved plastic cover back in place over it. By adjusting the position of the little knot in this way, you'll prevent the wire's getting detached from the headphone the next time you accidentally yank it.<br /><br />I hope that's reasonably clear and logical. All it takes is a bit of skill with some tweezers so that you can carefully maneuver the knot a bit higher on the wire. That should increase the lifespan of your headphones.ven separate it.

B003OFHMKO|5.0|Some people wonder why there's a wall between artists and the public. Most of the public is appreciative. Some are outright abusive and chippy, complaining Esperanza isn't doing this or that or sounds like somebody else they heard once. Instead of chipping away at what an artist is doing as if the complainer is some privileged royalty who must be \\"entertained\\" or else whoooop: bad reveiw, the advice to complainers is go out and make your own art. Esperanza did.    Love her hilarious album cover on the Chamber Music Society. It has numerous cultural references over the heads of most detractors.
0446615641|3.0|My first Oliver Stone read, \\"Stone Cold\\" is a well written mystery, tying in a vast array of characters and sub plots.    I enjoyed it immensely but when I was three quarters of the way through the novel, it just became somewhat convoluted and too long.    However, Balducci has a wonderful writing style and I would definitely read more of his books in the future.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Not much to add about this; Blade Runner will stand as one of the best SciFi movies of all time and the Blu Ray 2 Disc Edition is as good as it gets. You get just about everything you want on this edition; I even bought the poster and had it framed!     As a note; why doesn't Amazon separate the reviews of all the various editions of Blade Runner. Some here relate to other releases and might make you think this edition was missing something.
0316077054|3.0|Ever since Stephanie Meyer's horrible Twilight series came out, love triangle have been the new black. Seriously? Very few people can pull them off. I thought Beautiful Creatures and its sequels would break that cycle, but then John effin' Breed pops in. And Olivia 'Liv.' Both of them suck, not because of personality, but because of existence. I'll probably come back to this book when the next book comes out. Until then, life's too short.

I was able to get 90% of what I needed right here on Amazon and they were all very reasonably priced.  If you dont feel comfortable with the book there are also YouTube videos.  But the recipes in this book are simple and easy to follow, you can create any custom bento box that you want.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out making Bento box lunches as it is simple and easy to follow along with great pictures!  Great product!

I bought the CD from Amazon and it skipped/made unusual noises as the CD played (I tried four different CD players - obviously not a player problem).  I returned that copy and Amazon sent me a new one.  That did the same thing and would not even play in my car CD player - IT'S NOT A REAL CD, but rather is some fake.  I retured that copy and am out shippling costs.  Bah!<br /><br />Very disappointed with Amazon for selling such a thing.

B0033H7VI6|4.0|The knife is solid.  It has thick, full tang construction that should withstand some serious abuse and is bigger than one might expect. Also, it was sharper right out of the box than I expected. The grip is pretty comfortable and allows for mulitple holding patterns, but I am curious how well it will take a beating over time.  The sheath is not configurable for left-handed users and is a bit bulky for compact carry; but like the knife, it is pretty well made.  Search SCHF9 on YouTube for a demo.
B0021L8V0W|1.0|This is a review for the Disc itself, not the movie. I hate when Movie Companies, in this case Sony, make you watch ads on things that you have paid for. I have an LG 530 blu ray player and no matter what I do, as when I insert the disc it goes through the 10+ movie previews, about 7 mins of wasting my time. I cannot get to the Salt movie menu until I have watch all the previews. My only option is to skip and wait each preview, you cannot press skip several times, you have to wait until the player has uploaded the next preview, which is really annoying. I have not checked any other blu ray or DVD version of this movie, so I do not know if they are all the same but this version sucks. I am definitively not keeping it.

0312117337|4.0|Many people are frightened by traditional tarot decks that have the Death card, Devil and Tower cards as well can be disturbing for some. This fully illustrated deck takes the traditional tarot and re-envisions it as a spiritual and psychological journey. It is great for insights and meditation in these areas. The images are a mix of colorful yet mostly simple straightforward images, kind of mix of New Age and Eastern/Asian. Card titles are also simple and straightforward. It is just enough to get the intuition and insight going. There are no reversed positions for the cards. The included book offers several potential card layouts with a description best uses each layout and includes more layouts than the usual 1 card, 3 card and Celtic Cross layouts in most booklets.<br /><br />I have read comments on various decks and many concern whether or not accurate readings are being received. Each person should choose a deck that speaks to them, what works for one person may not work for another. This deck, while based on the traditional tarot departs from it and does not lend itself to indicating specific events or the timeline of events, etc. but is great if you are interested in the spiritual and psychological aspects of circumstances/events and may offer guidance to help you see what you and others bring to a situation on psychological and spiritual level.<br /><br />I prefer fully illustrated decks that are colorful yet simple and straightforward. I find too many images can be more confusing than helpful. If you like the same I can say this deck is one of my favorites along with [[ASIN:1401900984 Oracle Tarot Cards (Large Card Decks)]] and [[ASIN:1401918662 The Psychic Tarot Oracle Cards: a 65-Card Deck, plus booklet!]]. If you don't prefer other than fully illustrated, I recommend the ever popular [[ASIN:1572815108 Thoth Tarot Deck]] with it's beautiful art deco illustrations or the [[ASIN:156718457X The Sacred Circle Tarot: A Celtic Pagan Journey]] if you prefer illustrations that are more romantic.strations that are more romantic.

092389165X|3.0|I found this book at a thrift store and thought I would like to read about Hiroshima since my son will be going to that area in April for a 2 year mission.    It's just a small book so quite an easy read.    The author, John Hersey, traveled to Japan right after the bomb touched down and recorded 6 survivors accounts on what happened to them and around them.    Hair loss, open wounds, nausea were the least of the problems many faced.  Nearly 100,000 Japanese died from the bomb that the Americans dropped on them in 1945.    It was interesting to me to pay attention to my thoughts and feelings about American doing such a tragic thing to another country.  It really broke my heart.    Hiroshima is not a fast paced book and jumps from survivor to survivor, but a great read if you are interested in the aftermath of an atomic bomb.

B000T9QF8S|4.0|This set of Beethoven was recorded in the early 1970s.  Solti's approach is decidedly 'big band' and was very eagerly awaited. Solti had already done a Mahler and Schumann series, most Wagner and Strauss operas, lots of Verdi, Elgar and Bartok, but had only recorded the Beethoven 9th Symphony with \\"his\\" Chicago orchestra (more on that below).<br /><br />Other sets I became familiar with are Karajan's several and similar Berlin versions, Szell and Cleveland, Steinberg with Pittsburgh, and Bohm with Vienna.  Solti would later record a digital set of the Beethoven symphonies with Chicago.  That set is not as satisfying or unique as this one.  I am also familiar with the much more recent Norrington and Zinman sets.<br /><br />The currently dominant \\"authentic\\" movement was nascent at the time, and the Del Mar scores (used in such sets as David Zinman's on Arte Nova) wouldn't appear for about 20 years.  In the 70's the overall perception of Beethoven was \\"strident\\".  It was felt that his symphonies were as much passionately argued credos as music.  His symphonies had meaning and listeners expected his music to have force and mass as an integral part of the overall Beethoven Romantic (as opposed to Classical) experience - brass and strings equally pounding out Beethoven's message of \\"rightness\\".  I think today's \\"authentic\\" performances underscore the Classical characteristics more.<br /><br />Solti's approach to Beethoven *is* forceful and full, and it does not sound like anyone else's.  The unique quality comes from tight control over large forces, accentuated rhythms, and some unexpected tempi.  These performances are aided by excellent sound and the virtuoso playing of the Chicago Symphony  when they and Solti seemed to rule the American classical music scene.<br /><br />The most successful performances are the 9th, 7th, and 2nd:<br /><br />The 9th, recorded a few years before the rest of the set, is probably the strongest of this set. The scherzo is very exciting but not overly fast. In the finale the orchestra and chorus project a real feeling of spontaneous joy, while Solti makes you hear fireworks and a sense of profound well-being.  Solti did not come close to this effect in his later digital version. This is my favorite 9th of all.<br /><br />The 7th is the other totally successful performance in this set. Aided by the recording engineers, he strikes just the right balance between trumpets and horns, and strings in the opening movement.  Somehow, the brass seem to provide a patina to the string sound.  It sounds like Beethoven to me.  In the second movement, Solti holds a steady tempo and lets the music speak for itself, and it is very involving.  The finale has you whirling as if you were in a joyous country dance.  This is my favorite 7th of all.<br /><br />In the 2nd, Solti takes a decidedly romantic approach, which works especially well in the slow movement.  Solti's approach makes one realize how Beethoven was already striking out on his own symphonically by only his 2nd attempt.<br /><br />Several performances are partially very successful: the 3rd, and 5th.<br /><br />My only complaint about the Eroica is the first movement is spacious, not an Allegro con brio at all.  Otherwise it is very successful - the Funeral March has a great sense of loss, but does not overdo it (as Karajan does), the scherzo is notable for its palpable hunting atmosphere, and the finale is powerful in the same way as the opening of the 7th.<br /><br />Solti's 5th is very good, but not the revelation it should have been, such as Kleiber's recording a few years later. Solti's does not quite catch fire, but comes close.<br /><br />The other symphonies are \\"OK\\". The 6th in particular lacks the sense of contrast that it should have compared to the rest of the symphonies.  It is not a bad performance.  The same goes for the 1st, 4th, and 8th; they hold their own, but don't stand out either.<br /><br />Another strength of this set is the inclusionof William Mann's \\"interview\\" with Solti.  They discuss the 9 symphonies' varying characteristics and Solti's approach to them.  This was included with the vinyl box set (but not the original CD release) and it is enjoyable to hear Solti when he was at the top of his career discussing conducting Beethoven.  In light of the recent \\"authentic\\" reappraisals of Beethoven's music, Solti's discussion is somewhat out of date and only partly enlightening.  But it is enjoyable.<br /><br />Solti later re-recorded the Beethoven and Mahler symphonies, and he was not as successful in those re-recordings as he was in his earlier ones.  Solti was described by John Culshaw, his Decca producer and friend, as being open to suggestions.  I think a lot was made of Solti's fierce approach to music in the 50s and 60s, and by the 70s he began to search for more a thoughtful approach - during that transition he was sometimes successful and sometimes not. I think his Schubert, Wagner, Strauss, Bartok, and Bach performances of the late 80s and early 90s are more uniformly successful in that more thoughtful style he evolved.<br /><br />This is a unique and enjoyable set of Beethoven symphonies conducted by one of the most famous conductors of the 20th century at the height of his fame.

0439023491|5.0|I read the first book (The Hunger Games), and literally couldn't wait to get Catching Fire. But when i did, I almost fell asleep reading! The intro chapters were boring...Peeta this, capitol that and stopped reading it for awhile. With the help of a Red Bull and too much free time, I power read the rest of it, and am I glad I did! The Last half of the book (Part III on) Was ASTOUNDING, classic hunger games gore and cleverness, and after I finished the book that night, I WANTED MORE...<br /><br />Overall, the fans of the hunger games series will love this book, but be warned, you need to start at book ONE.

0743297334|1.0|I really didn't like this book, and find it hard to see why anyone else would. Sometimes the prose was so simple and repetitive that I felt  I was reading a Dick and Jane episode. It was unnerving to come across so many descriptions of something as \\"nice\\" or \\"swell,\\" as if this said anything but that the speaker liked something. I had to force myself to finish it, but I was determined to do so, in case Papa Hemingway could have justified this book later in the text.<br /><br />The characters: people who couldn't keep their hands off booze. Everywhere they went it was opening another bottle, pouring another drink, many times until they were so drunk the world seemed to be spinning around or they just got plain obnoxious. And Lady Ashley? She must have had a nice body, because her character was simply sluttish. Everyone seemed to be smitten by her, whereas she would cavort with anything in pants.<br /><br />I'm revisiting Hemingway and Fitzgerald, two noted authors of the first half of the twentieth century. I didn't care for Fitzgerald's obsession with the rich of the Roaring 20s, but at least he could write sentences that flowed. Compared with Ernest's endeavor in this tale, Fitz was a master stylist.<br /><br />This book of Hemingway's should have lots of appeal to alcoholics, just as so many of Raymond Carver's tales. Pouring drinks, making toasts, opening a bottle, ordering a drink, filling up the glass again, getting \\"tight\\" over and over and over, and then speaking nonsense for the rest of the scenes, then congratulating themselves afterward for the \\"swell\\" times they had.<br /><br />What was the point of all this? I have to feel those who rave about the work are just awed by Hemingway's reputation and his Nobel Prize. If this was the work of an unknown, they'd be here trashing it mercilessly.<br /><br />Boredom, tedium, despair, with only their drunken spells to relieve the emptiness of their lives. I find it hard to believe this book was even published, for either the prose style or the content.

0385341679|5.0|What a ride! I count myself fortunate to be a \\"late adopter\\" of Karen Marie Moning's FEVER series, because that meant I was able to devour its five books in rapid succession, almost as if they were one single long novel. It's been an intense experience, the kind I always want to find in urban fantasy and so often don't. This series has everything: a mystery; a twisty plot that isn't confusing to read even when you don't yet understand everything that's happening; a dynamic heroine who changes as the story progresses; a complex, fascinating world; great sex (yeah, I said it) that always serves plot or character rather than the other way around; a touch of humor...     I've also seen Moning's writing develop over the course of the series. Her descriptive prose has grown more lush and her plotting more complex. I'm pretty sure she's had much of Shadowfever's plot planned all along, but this hefty (608 pages) final installment has enough plot twists for another four books! When I was about halfway through it, I told a friend it was \\"a big brick o' plot,\\" and I meant it in a very good way. Much like [[ASIN:B003Y3F4KG Brix Bar, Medium Dark Chocolate, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)]] is a big brick o' chocolate.    \\"Now I'd lost everything,\\" Mac told us at the end of Dreamfever, but because Moning is EVIL, she didn't tell us who had just died (though it's not hard to guess). At the beginning of Shadowfever, we learn who bit the dust, and what Mac decides to do afterward. She starts thinking maybe she wants the Sinsar Dubh for her own purposes. Now she just has to decide what she's willing to do to get it. She's always had an unusual connection to the tome, too, and she begins to wonder about the nature of that connection -- especially when she finds evidence that she may be the reincarnation of the Unseelie King's concubine, or maybe of someone even more frightening.    There's so little I can say about the plot without leaking major spoilers. I'll just say that there are aton of twists and that the tension level is somewhere in the stratosphere. Rarely have I felt so much temptation to flip ahead in a book and make sure this or that disaster didn't happen; yet the story is so enthralling that I resisted that temptation due to sheer desire to let it unfold as written.    There's one plot element that I was quite sure would transpire, and I was worried that it would feel like a cop-out when it did. Instead, Moning weaves this into a major subplot with a tragic history, and makes it feel like an organic part of the story rather than a cheat.    Mac's world is a male-dominated one in many ways, and Mac has often needed to be rescued. It's gratifying that her input ends up being crucial to the solutions of two of the biggest problems in the book: in one case her willpower is needed, in another case it's her ability to think outside the box.    Now that the series is finished, I can heartily recommend it with two caveats: you have to be willing to read about morally ambiguous characters -- the \\"heroes\\" are often as ruthless and conniving as the \\"villains\\" here, and Moning has stated on her blog that it's intentional -- and you have to be OK with a lot of sex. As I said above, it's always relevant to plot or character, but there is a lot of it, and progressively more as you get further in the series. If you are accepting of those two elements, FEVER is an addictive, spellbinding, unforgettable series that takes you on one heck of a trip and then comes to a satisfying end with Shadowfever. Moning has stated that there may be future books in this universe, but these five books are a self-contained and resolved storyline.
0385533829|4.0|The novel is a good read and a good example of a plot driven story line that other writers would do well to emulate.<br /><br />Professor Langdon is a little one dimensional but the plot keeps twisting and the ideas expressed were sufficiently interesting to keep me pinned to the page. In fact I couldn't put the book down - and read it in two days.<br /><br />Dan Brown's work is also a good example of how to exploit a unique niche that no one else has tapped. Combine that with a series of novels utilizing the same Protagonist and you have a winning combination.<br /><br />The drama provides the emotional hook and the exploration of symbols combined with \\"The Puzzle Effect\\" give Dan Brown's books an endearing quality that will continue to win fans for years to come.<br /><br />One can also readily see that a story like this could not possible be the product of only inspiration. The plot line was surly worked out from the end backwards to have all the pieces align so neatly; a principle that I thoroughly endorse.<br /><br />Over all, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is very satisfying on several levels and I highly recommend it. Not only is it a \\"good read\\" but a work worth studying by any aspiring novelist.<br /><br />The principles of good storytelling are the same irrespective of genre.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|Spoilers  - to those who have seen the film / read the book...<br /><br />We all complete. What makes us human?  These clones could face and accept their death and their creators couldn't and had to create clones to delay the inevitable, making clones more \\"human\\" then their creators. A question of why they didn't run away often comes up. Well it was a life they knew from the inside they never looked at it from the outside perspective as cruel as their predicament was they learned to accept it from early on and never question it.  But even if they questioned the system, there is nothing they could do to change it.  Should Kathy have started a revolution? I don't think the movie is about what she should have done.  One of the oldest themes is that we should make the world a better place. Another is that we should be grateful for what we have. I think both are right. They don't contradict, but complement each other. This movie is probably more about acceptance, then the need to question and improve the system.<br /><br />Questioning the system may not provide answers. In her world she is doomed, but even if she ran away and hid, or started a revolt, there is still a greater system that she cannot overcome (we are all mortal, and her masters complete as well). There is always a system.<br /><br />The tragedy isn't in not realizing it, but in the futile struggle to overcome it. Which is what the regular people in that world do and in the process loose their compassion and humanity. The teacher who is honest with them is probably the only decent human being and she is kicked out. Its Kathy's ability to come to face with her limitations and accepting them that makes her human. Ruth, who is selfish all her life becomes a better human being in doing the right thing. Tommy is at peace before they pull the plug. Kathy understands that her predicament is tough, but she learns not to give in to despair and enjoy what she had and what she has left. Maybe another point of this movie is not that finding love makes life more valuable (worthy of extension), but that it makes it more beautiful while it lasts.love makes life more valuable (worthy of extension), but that it makes it more beautiful while it lasts.
B000002HEP|3.0|After listening to Sleep and Sunn0))), I would have to describe this style as almost heavy stoner-sludge drone rock.  It's clear that these guys have both chops and 'tude in spades.  And I can hear elements of Hendrix/Black Sabbath/Cream and even some Grand Funk Railroad (from \\"Grand Funk Live\\":  the track \\"Inside Looking Out\\" comes to mind).<br /><br />I could imagine an entranced, slack-jawed audience alternating between sheer awe at this music's heaviness, and headbanging to a lot of these tracks.  It sounds as though these songs were jammed out live and then recorded - as the sound and mix doesn't change much from track to track.  My only complaint is that the songwriting could be little better - although there are a number of cool riffs here, I find them a bit overplayed.  It's almost as though the band was intentionally placing themselves squarely between punk and sludge metal.<br /><br />The impression that I get is that this is music that must truly be experienced live in order to be fully appreciated.
B0030MM68O|4.0|The Hurt Locker is what I consider a step in a different direction compared to most war flicks.  First of all it's nice to see a movie set in a desert environment instead of the jungle lands of Vietnam (a war that's been well documented by this point).  That in itself is a nice refreshing change, and I believe we will continue to see more desert-themed war films in the future thanks to both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of the last several years.      No doubt in my mind the reason a (supposed) realistic storyline pertaining to the war in Iraq was created in the first place resulting in the Hurt Locker being released is because of all the Americans and British who sit here day in and day out wondering exactly what's going on over there.  I find out through reading some reviews here on amazon that the film isn't really that realistic though which is unfortunate.    What's most appealing about the Hurt Locker is the way it continuously keeps the audience guessing exactly when the explosions and gun bursts from the sneaky Iraqi enemies will occur.  They almost never happen during the times you THINK they will, and that alone is quite surprising.  The one exception is the man who had bombs wrapped around his chest and waist.  Yeah, you just knew he didn't have a lot of time left.    As far as the acting goes, well truth be told I've seen better.  It mainly sticks to a few select soldiers who are not necessarily buddies, but they gradually win over each others respect by frequently putting themselves in harms way and setting a mood filled with tension and fear.  They always look out for each other and live dangerously, that's for sure.  Respect is certainly earned as a result.    Overall, yeah, perhaps it could have been shortered by about 30-45 minutes, but I honestly wasn't bored at all.  A great film.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I am extremely happy with this purchase. It overclocks rather nicely and is a very nice compliment to the Asus Crosshair IV Formula Mobo I recently purchased. The only problem I had was getting an answer on which memory would best suit this motherboard. I am eventually going with the G.Skill Flare 7-8-7-24 2000 MHz memory but it was out of stock. I bought 4gb of Crucial Ballistic Tracer 7-7-7-21 for the meantime. Let's hope it gets here soon, because I am using borrowed memory right now.  Thanks Amazon...
142311339X|5.0|Leo, Piper, and Jason are on an innocent field trip to the Grand Canyon with the Wilderness School, an academy for misbehaved and delinquent children.  But when a student turns monster, evil storm spirits attack, and their teacher turns out to be a satyr, a little field trip turns into something neither of them will forget.    The three demigods are whisked off to Camp Half-Blood, where they learn they are related to a Greek god.  As if that weren't odd enough, they keep hearing things about prophecies and curses. Piper, Leo, and Jason soon find out that the world is in great danger, and it's up to them to save it. Evil Gaea, who has been sleeping for millenniums, has started to rise.  With her she has brought horrible monsters that have been lying in the Pit of Taratus for thousands of years. Together with the help of souls raised from the Underworld, they will overthrow the gods and take over the world.   To make matters more complicated, Jason has no memory of his past and who he is, and the strange tattoos on his arm only make things more mysterious. As if that weren't bad enough, Piper has been having horrifying nightmares about her father's disappearance, and an evil source is threatening her into betraying her friends. To add to it all, the great hero Percy Jackson has disappeared, and Hera, wife of Zeus and goddess of marriage, has also gone missing.   Armed with a rusty, mechanical fire-breathing dragon, the three demigods must go on a quest that will test their courage, their friendship, and themselves.    Rick Riordan perfectly combines greek mythology with the 21 century to create a relatable but magical world. Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down. And if you liked Percy Jackson and the Olympians, you'll be sure to love this series just as much, if not more!     So what are you waiting for? Start reading! Follow both new and old demigods as they once again save the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0740797719|4.0|This book is very comprehensive regarding the use and application of light and color.  It's broken into categories of interest that discuss and provide examples of the subject material.  I plan to use the book in furthering my artistic skills.  It was a very good purchase for my purposes.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Best production of Jane Eyre - true to the book as Bronte intended.   Lead cast well chosen and performance beautifully done. Highly recommend fans to watch this production of her book.
0061726826|4.0|Great story of love and lost. Love does not conquer all in this story. The ending was sad for me but it is what it is. I did truly enjoy the book. I was intense at times and I loved that aspect! I do want to find out what will happen to Lena, her mom and Grace though. I look forward to reading more books by Lauren Oliver.
1597801585|4.0|A lot of other reviewers are saying that the story is lacking and that the characters were not memorable. I did not think this was the case at all. Both the characters and the central story line were very well crafted and grew on me as I continued reading the novel. The characters are also relatively unique compared to others in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. They do not fit the typical good guy, bad guy personas and in many cases the reader will find him/herself becoming fond of characters that are morally ambiguous. In that same sense, don't count on the typical \\"good guy defeats the bad guy\\" plot. Wonderful and terrible things happen to certain characters regardless of their position on the \\"morality scale\\" or whatever term you want to use.     One issue I had with the story is that there was a lot of world building and introductory character development in the first 280 pages of the book (my copy of the book is about 360 pages long) and then the climax and end comes way too fast. The next thing you know, the story is over. Past the 280 mark, I kept thinking, \\"hmmm, kind of strange that there is only a few chapters left.\\" The last few chapters seemed very rushed, in many cases each one only being a few pages long. Its almost like the author was hurrying to finish it up as fast as he could past page 280 for whatever reason. In my opinion, it would have worked better if the book was longer. Those last 80 pages could have been 500. I feel this can only be reconciled by making a sequel. Perhaps the first novel just serves as an introduction? As of March 02, 2011, it doesn't seem like there is anything in the works for a follow up story.    One thing that might bother some readers is the sexual and violent content. I typically don't mind having it in there, especially if its needed to build the plot. In fact, sometimes I enjoy it because some of the biggest human emotions emerge from those two categories. However, halfway through the novel, the intense sexual themes beginto feel unnecessary. I still feel ambiguous about this though; perhaps I will change my mind as I think on it a bit longer.    The world that the author created is quite imaginative and interesting, but can be overwhelming at times. I feel this way about many futuristic stories. Its hard for me to get into a futuristic novel if its at all unbelievable. I have a hard time going back and reading these types of stories especially if they are outdated, because typically the authors vision is not quite where things are ending up. Now that we have a better understanding of the world, many of these sci-fi ideas become obsolete over time. I'm not saying that the world is unbelievable, I'm just saying that the author takes on a lot, and the reader may feel some of that pressure. It also may be a problem later down the road. Right now, the novel is only a few years old, but perhaps in twenty when we have a better understanding of the world, many ideas from the story may become obsolete.    I rated this book four stars, but understand that I like to take full advantage of the star system. If a book is simply okay, I will give that book a 2 or 3 star rating. The book is definitely worth reading, especially if you like sci-fi/fantasy but are sometime bothered by the cliche characters, wizards and warlocks, and the predictable happy outcomes. This story is more true to human nature, and the plot is entirely unpredictable. Also, keep in mind that I am a negative person. I am quick to point out the weak points, without giving enough praise on the strong points.    Hopefully you found this review to be helpful.
0439023491|4.0|I thought Hunger Games was great but the 2nd book was so much better. In Hunger Games, Kat and Peeta barely survived but they did. They thought they were safe for the rest of their lives and would never have to participate in another game. WRONG! Kat and Peeta upset the Capitol with their little stunt in the 1st game and are made to pay by having to particpate in another game of life and death. They both have to prove to the Capitol and the audience who are watching the televised games that they love each other. Kat didn't realize her true feelings for Peeta until he was almost shocked to death. That's when she knew her true feelings for him. Catching Fire is my favorite book in the trilogy. LOVED IT!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever listened to. Other than a couple songs and the song he does with Pink, I felt like this was a masterpiece of an album. I think a lot of people who have put down Eminem in the past should listen to this album and see what happens when he lets his true talent shine through. I haven't listened to much of his earlier work aside from his bigger hits, but I felt like this was an amazing album. Anyone the least bit interested should pick this up, as I think even casual fans will fall in love with Recovery. Being someone who loves mostly classic rock and heavy metal, I have to say that I'm surprised how much I've grown to like Eminem's music. And I'm not gonna lie, having Ozzy on one of his songs along with Aerosmith on another from his past albums is awesome!
0439023521|4.0|I LOVED this book! It was so intense. I was completely hooked after finishing the first chapter. I love Kat! She is such a strong character in so many ways and is always fighting for her life and the people that she loves.  I absolutely fell for Peeta. I think he may be the most selfless person ever.  He completely and wholeheartedly is willing to give up his life to save the life of a girl who may or may not even like him...This book is full of action and suspense. I can't wait to see how this trilogy will be portrayed on screen.
B000IYV1ME|4.0|If you're expecting a rip-roaring action movie, this isn't it.  When you see the trailer, you may think the movie is full of action.  At the end, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie flows well enough without the action.  There are several sub-plots/stories operating all at once, and of course intertwine.  Clooney is a spy, Damon is an investment broker dealing with oil sales, big oil companies are trying to create bigger profits, and the CIA bureaucrats are not completely honest with Clooney and his operations, etc.    Its definitely a political suspense movie.  The story is relevant today with the price of oil, and the political dealings that are behind close doors, yet have global effects.      Pros: Good acting (Clooney got the Oscar for supporting actor), good directing, and provides good discussion on politics, oil, and middle east.    Cons: Slow in some parts, you may have to watch it a few times to fully grasp the interwining storylines (not terrible, just a heads up), and the ending might disappoint some (I liked it because it wasn't what I expected and was more believable than most Hollywood endings)    *Suggestion* If you want to see a more action-packed film with a similar storyline, than watch \\"THE KINGDOM\\" (Jaime Foxx and Jennifer Garner)
B000FC1HBY|1.0|I bought this book (kindle ed.) three days ago for $5.  It looked good, reviews were good.  My husband was going on a trip and could read it on his phone.  It was an eminently reasonable price for a 9 yr old paperback equivalent.    I read it in three days.  It was pretty good.  Good enough that I went straight back to Amazon upon finishing it to get the next one only to find that the publisher had upped the price by $4.  I know the price of oil is rising at the moment, but I didn't realize how drastically it would affect the cost of ebooks.  Wow, who knew they could cost so much more today than they did over the weekend?    I liked the book, but not enough to be ripped off by the publisher so blatantly.  I'll be checking out the rest from the library, if I read them at all.  In fact any ebook from Random House is on notice from now on as far as I am concerned.    Did the publishing world not see what happened to the music industry?  Ripping off customers is a recipe for black market to develop.  Shame on them.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|At first, it looked as if this CPU cooler would be too big for my tower case.  However, it did fit and just barely!  I was able to close the side panel without it hitting or scraping whatsoever.  Also, with the supplied 120mm cooling fan installed, it does clear the 4 memory sticks and P/S by a few mm's, so I really don't have to worry about that.  I do have extra room, right under the P/S, for the additional 120mm fan (which I also purchased with this cooler, but did not install due to not having an extra 4-pin port on the mobo to power fan) for the other side of the fins for even more airflow.  My tower is a Maxcube Vortex 36xx Series and I am running an ASUS M4A785TD-V EVO mobo with an AMD Phenom II X4 with 8GB (4x2GB) of memory.  There wasn't a need for me to remove the board from the case to complete the install.  I do have another 120mm mounted on the side panel, which happens to be one of the Logisys Computer illuminated fans with a lot of wires and such, and in addition, it has another led \\"light ring\\" atop the fan assembly- just so you can gauge the amount of room I still have left. I hope this might help someone who is curious about fitament issues.  Thanks a lot.
1594202842|3.0|Amy Chua must have a really good publicist.  This book's story is strewn all over the media, including The NY Times, TIME and Newsweek, she's appeared on various talk shows and interviewed by NPR.    I thought her book would examine the question, Are Chinese better parents?  And maybe give some hints about what it takes to be a good parent.  However, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is really just a story of a mom raising her two girls (and 2 dogs, who get a surprising amount of coverage).  Sure, it outlines some cultural differences between how Chinese and Western families typically raise children, but everyone has a unique parenting style that is a combination of their history, experience and environment.  Not everyone spends 250 pages explaining, comparing, dissecting and defending theirs.    I've often wondered -and pondered on my blog, Unperfectmoms.com- what it takes to be a good parent, and was eager to hear Amy Chua's perspective.  Here's what she says kids should NOT be allowed to do:  * attend a sleepover  * have a playdate  * be in a school play  * complain about not being in a school play  * watch TV or play computer games  * choose their own extracurricular activities  * get any grade less than an A  * not be the No. 1 student in every subject except gym and drama    Clearly, \\"be the No. # 1 student\\" is not a goal many parents can strive for, by definition, so her advice is a little far-fetched.  Then, after spending most of the book outlining and arguing for \\"Chinese parenting methods\\", Ms. Chua concludes the \\"tough\\" approach only worked for one of her daughters and may not have been the best way after all.  Readers are left with her uncertainty.    So are Chinese moms really better?  I'm not sure, and reading this book -while interesting- didn't help me decide.  I talk more about this topic at Unperfectmoms.com.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having only discovered Firefly relatively recently, I was more than disappointed to learn that it didn't continue.  Fox should so bring this back, or relinquish the owning rights to a brilliant concept. If Star Trek could do it..  This show didn't just have the potential to be better than Star Trek, it WAS better than Star Trek.
B004BSWC8A|5.0|I'VE SEEN BOTH VERSIONS OF THE FILM (STANDARD AND 1080)  AND I HAVE TO TELL YA, THERE IS A BIG DIFFERECNE IN PICTURE QAULITY. THE MOVIE ITSELF IS VERY GOOD BUT LIKE SOME MOVIES WHERE THEY HAVE LOTS OF SCENIC VIEW, THE BLU-RAY VERSION IS DEFINATELY WORTH PURCHASING.   HIGHLY RECOMMEMNED.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The follow-up movie of 'Firefly' didn't quite have what the tv show had, but still was great!  This story could have been the star trek/wars of our era, and instead Fox decided to cut an amazing concept..  Bring it back Fox!
B002ZG974M|2.0|I like babies just as much as the next person, but I just didn't enjoy this movie much. There was no narration, minimal on-screen talking. Just babies. Babies from here, babies from there, just being babies. Which is fine and dandy by me, I probably would have enjoyed it had it been a 30 minute show on TV, but an 80 minute movie was too much for me. I got bored halfway through and would have rather turned it off. I left it on, hoping something interesting may happen.. it never does. I guess maybe I was expecting too much from a movie about babies. [[ASIN:B000127IG6 Baby Human: Geniuses in Diapers]] is very interesting, though. It gets into the inner-workings of babies, and you learn lots of interesting things about them. But, if all you're looking for is a bunch of \\"cute\\" babies to mindlessly stare at for nearly and hour and a half, this may be just what you're looking for. Not my cup of tea, however. I would not recommend this.
B004LGPBYY|5.0|Like an earlier reviewer said...I did not know what to expect. But I have been totally and pleasantly surprised. This is a great,pure rock n roll album!!! Pure rock n roll seems to be a dying form of music since the late 80's...now we're stuck with drivel/sludge/muck/garbage like Lady GaGa, Justin Bieber, Black Eyed Peas etc. etc. Everything is now techno-pop, dance-pop, rap, or hip hop crap! What happened to good ole rock n roll?!?!?! Thankfully, if you take the time to look you can find it!! Beady Eye fits the bill !!!!! Great man great stuff!! I love every track!! Can't wait to see 'em live...rock on man! ROCK N ROLL LIVES!!! Thanks Liam, Andy, Gem, and Chris. Leather Beatle Boot
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Great show, great season. I'd like it better if there were more than a few episodes per disc, since I watched it from beginning to end and changing discs was a bit of a pain, but the humor in the episodes were well worth the effort. It shipped rather quickly and there was nothing wrong with the discs or case. Just perfect. I would highly recommend.
B002XMGGK6|1.0|Law Abiding Citizen is the kind of movie that falls apart when thinking about its shaky logic for too long.  And by shaky logic, I mean the kind that requires you to be clinically dead to successfully suspend disbelief.  Harsh as that assessment may be, it's deserved for a plot that insults the audience's intelligence constantly as the plot unravels.    At least the movie kicks off with a bang.  One night, Mechanical engineer Clyde Shelton's (Gerald Butler) peaceful dinner with his wife and grade school daughter gets interrupted by two thugs breaking into the house.  Darby, the deadlier of the intruding duo, stabs Clyde and his wife, leaves them for dead, and kidnaps their daughter.  Darby's partner merely witnesses the grisly exchange in abject horror, and also flees.    Clyde survived the ordeal, but not his wife and daughter.  Months later, Clyde and his attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) prepared a surefire criminal case against Darby, but during the actual trial, the prooceedings take a startling 180.  Darby only gets a few years, while his accomplice gets a death sentence.  After the trial concluded, Clyde learned that Darby paid Rice under the table to tip the scales towards his favor.  Disgusted by the betrayal, Clyde crafts a revenge plot to get back at the justice system that failed him.  After ten years of planning - right when Darby's parter faces execution by lethal injection, and when Rice has a daughter of his own - Clyde makes the first vengeful move.    What follows is a mish mash of unfortunate events for anyone and everyone involved in Darby's crime and Clyde's case.  The cliff notes version: Clyde sets up a gruesome but justifiable death for Darby, gets arrested for the killing, and sparks off a string of murders against various members of the justice department while he's behind bars...somehow.  And that's where the problems begin; for the lawyers and the movie itself.    The further along the master plan progresses, the less sense it makes.  Evenwith a decade of spare time for Clyde to arrange his numerous assassinations, too many unknown factors can ruin any potential gambit he's planning.  Like, for one, if Clyde was not transferred to a specific penitentiary for his crime, his plan would have failed from the start.  Clyde's setups also depended on other irrational decisions, like judges pandering to a detained prisoner's megalomaniacal wishes (he'd be thrown in the hole or beaten by guards anywhere else), or not sending enough guards to watch Clyde 24/7 when things really going south for them.  And the grand reveal that explains how Clyde pulled them all off (including a halfway believable \\"second man\\" theory among the possibilities)?  Pure wallbanger. Not even Fox's Prison Break felt this preposterous.        Even if the plan was logically sound, that hardly excuses Clyde's unsympathetic decisions along the way.  It's hard not to root for him when he shreds Darby to pieces with a buzz saw, but recording the murder and sending the DVD to Rice's living room - how Clyde pulled this off is another unsolved mystery - in order to scare Rice's wife and daughter, who did nothing to antagonize him?  Clyde justifies this act to show Rice how helpless he felt when Darby terrorized his family, but how anyone can root for him after that stunt, god knows.  And this is before Clyde goes after attorneys and judges barely involved (or not involved) with the case, or offing a prisoner for simply being in the way, or spiking the drugs injected into Darby's partner to make him die very painfully during the lethal injection.  At one point, you begin to wonder why nobody informed Clyde that he's become more sadistic than Darby.    But most disturbing of all is the ridiculous Aesop the filmmakers are selling with Law Abiding Citizen (i.e., the justice system needs to take responsibility for their actions).  To make Clyde look like he's in the moral high ground, despite his endless hypocrisy, the writers made virtually every member of the justice department amoral, unfeeling a-holes.  Only innocent, uncorrupted Cindy breaks the mold of corrupt straw men, but oops!  She dies too, courtesy of a car bomb set up by Clyde.  And this accomplishes what, exactly?  This is the only way Rice will learn not to side with murderers.  Yes, that's right.  Clyde wants to teach a lesson to the attorney that he loathes the most by making everyone else around him expendable.  \\"Jigsaw\\" would be so proud.     I'm all for debating the justice system's flaws, but it needs to be done in a reasonable way.  Like, for one, showing the entangling rules and regulations that would enable the less dignified actions of the justice department thrive.  It also helps to show a wide spectrum of laudable and seedy lawyers alike, or even show how some attorneys are stuck defending monsters like Darby because they have to, whether they like it or not. Do you know what show does this, in spite of occasional unrealism?  Law and Order.    Strip out Law Abiding Citizen's hackneyed morality play, and only a risible vigilante film remains.  If that's what you want, more power to you.  But for the people championing this tripe as a much needed \\"take that!\\" to the justice system, I have two words for you: John Grisham.  Unlike the hacks who wrote this movie, Grisham actually has a law degree.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This monitor extension arm came with multiple mounting options, making it simple to set up for my application.  The instructions were clear and complete.  Best of all, it easily supports my 23\\" LCD Monitor, and has given valuable desktop real estate back to me.  I strongly recommend this monitor arm for users who need an easy to adjust monitor arm with a fairly long reach.<br /><br />18 Month Update - I still love this arm.  I reposition my monitor often.  The movement of the arm is still smooth, and once set in a position, it holds it.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Fantastic dvd  the BEE GEES were and are still a part of the greatest groups list. The seller was quick and no returns needed.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|I love Angelina Jolie but this movie was terrible.  The plot is confusing and generic.  This was like the Angelina Jolie version of The Bourne Idenity or whatever those movies are with Matt Damon.  They all bite the big one.  Most of the movie is just Angelina Jolie being chased by evil FBI guys, and so on and so on.  Alot of shooting and car crashes tailor made for brainded action movie fans who like to just zone out in front of a tv screen.  I wish they would just stop making movies like this.  Angelina Jolie should stick to intelligent dramas, she's better than this and all of the other Tomb Raider crap she got involved in.  I could'nt even sit through the whole movie, didn't care what happened because you just don't care about the character.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|Of the new music that I've bought this past year, this album sticks out as a true original.  There is a lot of power and emotion in the lyrics and in the way each song is executed.  You get a real feel for the members of the group and the group's dynamic.  Although \\"home\\" is an instant hit, there are many other equally strong songs on the album.  I'm really looking forward to the somewhat rare opportunity to see these guys at Electric Forest 2011! It should be a great festival...
0440178002|5.0|Read this book. I like Bernard Cornwell and Conn Iggulden books just so you know my taste. This book is written in the same style that pulls you into the story just like you are there. Read it and you won't be disappointed.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This series was entirely too short lived. One of the best series I have had the enjoyment of watching, and my only regret is that there are so few to watch.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|I'll start off by saying I never saw the original. I've heard how it's a grindhouse/cult classic, but I never had a chance to see it so I went into I Spit on your Grave (2010) without any background to compare it to. I'd imagine die-hard fans of the original might be disappointed in the same way remakes of almost ANY Movie would be disappointed (regardless of how good it was). Throw in the fact it's basically a Starz Direct-to-Video movie (VERY short run on no more than a dozen theaters) with a 1.5Mil budget, making very little of that back.<br /><br />I was expecting to be disappointed, but hoping for the best.<br /><br />I must say, the movie was disturbing at times, it was disgusting at times, but I loved it! I think many will find issue with what goes on in the movie, and I completely see why, but you have to remember it's a movie. I'm very against all of that, but in the same way I can watch JAWS explode, zombies attack people or people deal with Jigsaw's deadly traps in other movies, you just have to remember it's a movie. With the themes being more \\"real\\" in this one, it's not for everyone (and if that doesn't get you, the violence will!)<br /><br />For horror lovers, this is a very good movie. It's not watered down to be a PG-13 movie, it's a hard \\"R\\" at least. Despite the themes (trying to avoid any spoilers here, for those who don't know the story), it's not a depressing movie. It's a good revenge-movie in the style of Kill Bill, and some of the payback will have you disgusted while cheering the main character on. To some, that may sound like the worst movie ever, and for those I recommend against it. For everyone else, check it out.<br /><br />It's high on (graphic) violence and nudity, so it's definitely one for adults only.<br /><br />For the Blu-Ray itself, video is VERY nice (I believe it was filmed with the RED camera), same for audio. It's not a direct-to-video 'junk' release, they actually put some time and effort into making it look and sound good.<br /><br />The extras are a commentary and about 30 minutes of cast/crew interviews. I'll admit I skipped over most of these as a lot of the cast seemed completely clueless about what they were making (\\"I told my sister about the script and she said thats a remake of \\"I spit on your grave!\\" - I never saw the movie, but I knew I had to do it then!\\")bout 30 minutes of cast/crew interviews. I'll admit I skipped over most of these as a lot of the cast seemed completely clueless about what they were making (\\"I told my sister about the script and she said thats a remake of \\"I spit on your grave!\\" - I never saw the movie, but I knew I had to do it then!\\")
0439023513|3.0|This is probably the longest I have waited between finishing a book and reviewing it because I needed some time for all my feelings to clarify and I also needed time for my intense disappointment with the ending to dissipate.  Now, I am aware, the fact that this book caused me \\"intense disappointment\\" is a tribute to how effective the first two books of the trilogy are.  And they are great.  However, this book and subsequent conclusion felt rushed and unsure and did not affect me as it should have.    Spoilers ahead!    This book focuses on the war between the Rebels and the Capitol and actually, as inhumane as the Capitol is, Katniss is not sure who the real enemy is.  Once again, she is on her own.  The main problem in this book for me was Katniss never acted, she just reacted to extreme situations around her.  The character I had come to grow and love did not make a stand at all or make decisions for herself, including the final choice between Gale/Peeta and the future it leads her to, which is once again, something that just happens to her.  Also, there are too many times in this book where she is paralyzed by horrible events and I'm talking literally - several times when someone dies she escapes to a bath, a closet, or a hospital and just melts into a comatose state.  This is our heroin here!!  She is a total train wreck of emotion through the whole book that by the time the last and most horrible death occurs it just didn't hit me as hard as it should have.    This brings me to my biggest disappointment - Katniss ends up with Peeta.  Why?  Because after it's all said and done, Peeta shows up in her backyard and just stays.  Once again, Katniss accepting whatever is thrown into her lap.  Peeta is so damaged by this point, the sweet and wonderful boy with the bread is all but completely lost and this future of theirs made me so sad.  As for Gale, he ends up with some important job in District 2 never to be heard of again.  Ugh. My disappointment in that ending still stings which is why I am trying to forget the last book.  I'm just Team Gale all the way.  And after what happens to Peeta in this book, his most charming traits are zapped away.    I have to say that these books are characterized to me by one huge event happening in each one that is so emotional for me I feel like I almost cannot continue reading.  The first book's event was the death of Rue, the second book's event was when Katniss and Peeta are chosen for the Quarter Quell (I immediately put the book down and thought \\"I CANNOT go through that again!), and it did happen in this third book with the re-introduction of Peeta as Katniss Enemy #1.  So this book did pack some emotional punch but not as much as it could have.    Another huge injustice?  The gloss over of Finnick's death! My lovable and noble Finnick Odair just dies and I barely batted an eyelash.  At first I thought \\"well what more could she have done?\\" until I recalled the tears that streamed down my face over Rue's death in Book 1.  There is more that could have been done for Finnick and especially Prim.  I am sorry that I am done with this story (I will miss these characters) but I'm equally sorry it had to end this way.

B004C387RY|2.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />Percy is dyslexic with ADHD.  His mother raised him alone.  He doesn't know who his biological father is.  Odd things have happened to him but he never questioned them.  At age eleven a minotaur attacks Percy and his mother causing the mother to disappear.  Percy ends up at Camp Half Blood where he discovers that he is a godling (child of a Greek god father and a human mother).  The other kids there are also godlings.  Each child has talents and skills relating to their Greek god parent.  As godlings age they have stronger vibes which draws monsters to attack them.<br /><br />Someone has stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt.  Percy is selected to go on a quest to get it and return it to Zeus to avoid a war among the gods.  Grover and Annabeth accompany Percy.  They are given some magic objects to help them, for example a hat that makes one invisible, and a pen that turns into a magic sword.  As they travel to get the bolt, monsters attack them on a regular basis.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />This book is extremely similar to the Harry Potter stories - just change wizards to godlings.  I loved the Harry Potter books, but when I read this book I was bored.  But I could see reading it to a child under the age of eleven.  The main character Percy is a little slow and doesn't figure things out very quickly.  So I could see a child guess things before Percy does and feel good about it.  But I haven't read it to a child, so I'm not sure about this.<br /><br />It reminded me of children's computer games where the character is on a quest.  To solve the problem the character must travel to different locations and do tasks to get trinkets.  When they get all the right trinkets the problem is solved and they get the main prize.  But it was missing the character development, depth, and creativity that Harry Potter had.  It was mostly kids on a journey and when fighting a monster they'd yell at each other \\"run.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the journey Percy gets clues in the form of riddles.  The oracle tells him where to go, and then tells him he won't succeed with part of it but doesn't explain.  Later another fantasy creature tells Percy something that helps but also creates some unknown.  These sources are supposed to be helping Percy, but they give him riddles to be solved.  What kind of help is that?  Why don't they just tell him what they know?  But that is me.  To a young child it's probably fine.  I do not recommend it for teens and young adults.  But it's better than nothing, so if interested they might try the first book from the library and see how they feel.<br /><br />Yes, there were riddles in the Harry Potter books, but they didn't bother me the way the riddles here did.  Riddles can be fine.  I'm not against riddles.  I think it had something to do with other things in the story not working for me.<br /><br />It's told in first person by Percy which did not appeal to me.  He sounded like a typical contemporary eleven-year old using slang such as \\"that sucks\\" and \\"wwwwwhatever.\\"  I didn't care for the narrator, but that was personal preference.  I kept wondering what his accent was.  He said bit, ind, and ixactly (instead of but, and, and exactly - the generic TV speak which I'm used to).<br /><br />DATA:<br />Unabridged audiobook length: 10 hours.  Narrator: Jesse Bernstein.

B002ZG981E|5.0|It's amazing to see how many reviews were two stars or lower. I think to myself, they probably thought the movie \\"A Serious Man\\" was good. I will not talk badly of those who don't understand the complexity of the movie either. Inception will be one of the best movies of all time and I was very angry that it did not one the oscar over \\"The Kings Speech\\". Although I enjoyed that movie very much, it was heart warming. I guess people who don't like Inception dont want to think too hard and probably do not relate since they do not dream.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|I really didn't think I would like this book based on the negative reviews (and I haven't seen the movie) but I have to say that I definitely did.  What I enjoyed most about it was the author's journey from despair to elation and everything in between.<br /><br />You are probably familiar with the story by now, since it was one of Oprah's book club recommendations a few years back and is now a major movie starring Julia Roberts but if don't know the story it follows author Elizabeth Gilbert's (Liz) journey from Italy (Eat), India (Pray) and Indonesia (Love) to find herself after a nasty and emotionally soul wrenching divorce and even more heart destroying relationship afterwards.<br /><br />Having been through a divorce myself (although thankfully one that didn't have me crying on the bathroom floor like the author) I know the emotional battering it can take on your self esteem and worth.  I came out of my marriage believing I was fat (I wasn't), ugly (nope) and that I would never become a writer (wrong again) because that was what I was told for the duration of our short marriage.<br /><br />So it is of no surprise to me that after her experience that the author craved meaning and to find herself again.<br /><br />It seems a bit of an extreme to travel all around the world and even stay at an Ashram in India to do so (although by her descriptions of her meditation experiences - I totally want to go now) but thankfully she did and we get to travel on the journey with her via this book.<br /><br />It's a great read and a real pleasure to experience her life in these three corners of the world and the people she encounters.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for some light but enjoyable bedtime reading.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I had heard that this series was comparable to the Band of Brothers. It is not even close. The battle scenes shot at night are very difficult to follow. Most of the battle scenes shot during the day resemble a mob running blindly into gun fire. Watching this made me think that the Marines of WWII were the most poorly trained soldiers on the planet who could be psychologically broken en masse and were guilty of absolutely brutal mob behavior. This was basically a Hollywood Vietnam War interpretation of the WWII Pacific theater of WWII. It was a completely inaccurate portrayal of some of the finest soldiers in the world and not entertaining at all. There was little character development, weak story telling and continuous foul language. This series is an absolute waste of time and money. I am currently trying to figure out how to get rid of it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Honestly, this book was...er, how do I put this...well...AMAZINGLY AWESOME. I recieved it a few years back (2009) for Christmas and L O V E D it. I don't know where the bad reviews come from but who cares? I only have time to read the good reviews.     The plot is pretty good too. It's about a young adult (18-19) named Thomas who awakes in some sort of lift with no memory whatsoever. Except for his first name. The &#34;Gladers&#34; as they were called expected Thomas to show up. But the next day a girl shows up. No girl has ever showed up in The Glade.     What will happen next? Read this heart stopping, intense, suspensful novel and...well, find out!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is one of the best ever to have come from Fox (and that's saying something) It is an absolute must see for Joss Whedon fans and for anyone who likes to watch science fiction or fantasy or action or comedy... it has something for everyone. Unfortunately there is only one season (and a follow on film Serenity) so join the Facebook page and BRING BACK FIREFLY! BRING BACK FIREFLY PLEASE!
B002ZG976U|4.0|This movie in my opinion was not to be a grammy award winning show. However, it is was so comforting while i uncomfortably sat through the old fashioned seats at an outdated theatre. Here's my point, I was not expecting an oscar performance as Christina Aguilera is a new comer to the big screen.I was looking to just relax and see a good film, Hark! Here it is. I ordered my nachos, had a seat and the performances from all the characters were predictable but there is something very interesting about the storyline. This movie may be predictable to many fans but it was so fun to watch. All I can tell you is that don't look for oscar winners in this film however, open your mind to serious vocals from Christina and Cher. That's what makes Burlesque so fun to watch. I loved the performances and vocal power. To make a long story short, it's worth a look if you love singing in a movie but not quite a musical.There is a beautiful balance in this movie. I plan to own a copy!
0439023521|4.0|The book \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins is thrilling because the plot twists and turns and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  This novel is violent.  For example the whole idea of the story is that the main character has to fight to the death in the hunger games and kill other children.  There is little food and they have to hunt to stay alive.    It is also touching.  For example the main character takes the place of her sister when she is picked to compete in the games.  There is also romance between the characters throughout the book.  Another reason why this book is thrilling is because there is a lot of strategy involved in the games.  The contestants have to impress the crowd and get sponsors all to help them win.    I think that anyone who likes a good thriller would like this book.  If you like to read and read a lot then this book will be a fast and great read.  This is a great book and I think that any one from kids to adults will love it.
0670022411|5.0|Not since Anne Rice's stories of witches in New Orleans have I been as engrossed, entertained, charmed and educated by a fantasy story! This is a work above and beyond most current fantasy and I can't recommend it highly enough. I also cannot wait for the next installment! I hope you're writing away as I write this, Deborah!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|As a father of a young girl I end up watching my fair share of movies about princesses. This movie is by far the best I have seen. The story is such a refreshing departure from the princess who passively waits for her price to come solve all her problems. This girl makes her own dreams come true! Thoroughly entertaining!
141694737X|5.0|My 22 month old daughter loves this book...her favorite. Three year old daughter will gladly sit through it too and loves to beat her sister to opening the flaps. It's clever, simple, and fun. Great gift book.
B00466HM28|2.0|I have both the LPK25 and the MPD8... so of course I was excited when this came out, because I just bought the previous two items, and now I could return them and buy the MPK instead...     I thought it would be the same, especially the pads. I was wrong. The MPK I received had the most horrible response on the pads, extremely insensitive unlike the MPD8. This is the same mistake they made with the rest of the MPK series! (25,49,61) Just read those reviews and you can get another idea as well.     In addition, the pads would click, and were more stiff to that of the MPD8. Do yourself a favor and buy the LPK25 and the MPD8 seperately, instead of this unit.
B004B8RXQQ|5.0|This is the best modern rendition of Doyle's work I have seen to date. The casting is wonderful, the story lines are intriguing, and I personally feel that the writers have stayed true to Doyle within a modern setting. The only character I question at this point is Moriarty. I have always thought of him as being a bit older than Holmes and not quite so... odd, but I'm sure the writers have their reasons and perhaps I will feel differently with a new season.
B000R8YC18|4.0|Robert De Niro and more star in Martin Scorsese's 1976 drama.  A Vietman Vet takes a job as a New York cabbie and turns   homicidal. This is a terrific film that's definitely one of De   Niro and Scorsese's best. This 2-disc set has good picture   and sound plus neat extras. Get this.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Just got my kindle. This is actually the second book I got. I must say a much better read than the first book I downloaded. I was a bit skeptical about this book, but seeing it was fairly cheap I got it.     It's great psychological murder/crime mystery. If you like NCIS-esque stories...I would recommend this book. It's about a woman whose husband who happens to be a son of superior court judge was killed by a police sniper. From that point on everything went south for the cop for he was being investigated for murder. As for the woman (Catherine) her life was already a mess since she was a child for she was a victim of child abuse to put it mildly. The villain won't disappoint you with his dark and twisted ways about him.    The book kept my attention with it's twists and turns. Even at the end it still made me wonder and ask \\"wait..did she? or nah...she couldn't have\\". I was fairly entertained. It will make you ask just how far a woman will actually go to save her loved ones. Or how a family would go through lengths to protect their secrets. This would make for a good TV series. :)    I would certainly check out other Lisa Gardner's works.
B002ZG99TA|2.0|has anyone else had trouble with the dvd, ordered from amazon?  mine will not play the middle bonus feature about putting the story/script together.  all the other bonus features play fine.  so it can't be a problem with my dvd player.  this is the bad thing about ordering through amazon.  if i had just bought it at best buy i could actually talk to someone about it and find out if others have had this same problem.  is it a problem with just this one dvd - which seems unlikely - or were there others made, which just won't play the middle feature?  the commentary plays, the feature about the train plays and the sneak previews play - so how can it be that the one feature won't play.  there are no prints or marks of any kind on the back. i played it the day i received it and it hasn't been touched except on the outer edge - the playing area itself is completely untouched and unmarred.  i've never had a dvd do this before?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele, a voice that captured me from the first time I heard it.  I was so impressed, and I don't impress easily, by Adele that I pre-ordered her latest album 21 unheard but based on her previous songs.  \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" grabbed me because of its gritty blues style coupled with a voice that took me back in time. The driving beat makes you move while listening to this song and at the same time lifts you up.  This was the cover song for 21 but, I am totally stuck on \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" and I seriously believe that this could have been the cover song without a doubt.  I don't know how you may listen to music but, I listen to the whole album and while I'm listening I choose my favorite tracks. I file away the numbers in my mind for referencing and for future listening selections. I also create a playlist of these songs and just let them play over and over again. While I am writing this review I am only listening to one tract, \\"Set Fire to the Rain.\\" I have heard this tune repetitiously for an extended period of time and I can tell you that I am so in love with Adele's voice and this song!  Her delivery is impeccable on this song and not only on this song but, the rest of the album is a complete delight. And one thing I want you to know about me, I just don't buy an album from any singer unless they are good. And this girl is so good!  Gavin
0756404738|5.0|I'm having trouble deciding on a good title for this review, because all the appropriate words seem overused and hyperbolic.  How often do the covers of books tell us that they are breathtaking, riveting, mesmerizing, enthralling?  How often are they, in unexaggerated sincerity, more than \\"an enjoyable read\\"?  This novel, though... it held me like a metal bolt, like hypnosis, like a spell.  Those things figuratively.  I caught myself quite literally holding my breath a few times.    I worried that giving the book four years might have made it too indulgent of a new author's inspired fancy (given the whirlwind success of the original book, yes, sorry for the pun).  I also worried that the time pressure building over those four years might result in a sequel less clever, less polished, less perfect.  If you are struggling with similar apprehension, it should be dispelled within the first few chapters.  I think I liked it even better than The Name of the Wind.    Like the first novel, The Wise Man's Fear scintillates with witty, delicious turns of phrase.  The characters continue to be interesting, complicated, and humanly flawed.  There are stories within stories and outside of stories.  As in the previous novel, we are forced to hold the discordance of two contradictory truths in our minds: the person Kvothe was, and the person Kote has become.    I should mention as an aside that I disagree with people calling this book a cliffhanger.  Don't wait to read it on account of that claim, because it's not.  In a cliffhanger, there's tawdy tricks to claw at your attention, like a favorite character doomed to execution or the protagonist trapped alone in a coffin.  The Wise Man's Fear is nothing like that.  It's unresolved, as a story two-thirds told should be, but it ends quietly, darkly, with one tantalizing sentence of hope.
1582701709|5.0|I just love this book it has helped my soooo much in my life. I was a divorced middle aged janitor at a grade school when I began reading it and now my life has done a complete 360!!!  I have a girlfriend! Me a girlfriend!! It was really surprising to learn that the secret was nothing more than positive thinking...OOPS maybe I should'nt have given that away :( but still you should give this a read.
B004M54NWU|1.0|After watching this movie (or at least to the point where I could bear to watch), I have relieved my girlfriend from her movie picking responsibilities.    It wasn't that entertaining unless you are into constant sex scenes, but if you are looking for that, you are better suited in other genres of film.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Love this product, was a little leery of buying it after reading some of the lower starred reviews but I think it is well worth the cost. I gave it 5 stars for durability because everything else is 5 stars, but have only owned it 2 weeks. Will come back and change if it breaks. Have to use add on to use with mumble, easy to find and set up.
6302822696|3.0|For beginners, this is a GREAT movie, no question about that.  This movie is both historically accurate and very action-packed.  This is not a movie you will get bored with quickly.  You DO NOT want to have small children around when watching this movie, because you cannot afford to be interrupted often.  This is one of those movies where you put the kids down to bed early, unplug the cell/home phone, and grab a soda and popcorn.  You will see what I mean when you get into the movie.  Now, the reason I rate this move as THREE stars is because of the quality of the video.  I ended up purchasing the VHS, and was informed that it was a NEW vhs tape, never viewed before.  The problem was immediately noticeable within the first 30 mins of viewing this movie.  The movie cracked and popped about 8-10 times throughout the movie.  It was as if this video was an old, used one rented from the video store from years ago.  When a vhs video cracks and pops like this one did, it makes me wonder how this video was stored.  I highly recommend this movie, but do not recommend purchasing from the vendor that I purchased from.  I will end up keeping the vhs anyway, as I know I won't watch it too often, but from time-to-time I think it is okay.  The popping and cracking wasn't so severe that I dislike the video or won't watch it again, it was just annoying at times.  However, the pluses outweigh the minuses.
0525951652|5.0|I love to read for entertainment.  I never expect great and I rarely care if the book is exciting on every page.  What I love about Fall of Giants is that it slowly told me a story, allowed me to love the characters and taught me a bit of history.  All of my favorite reasons for reading a book. The people out there who feel that this book was not what they expected...I would say...Stop expecting and learn to read for the pure pleasure of it.  Thank God for great authors.
0439023521|5.0|All I have to say is wow! I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. I enjoyed all the characters, the plot was exciting, and it was written well.
B004INNRFK|3.0|Why ruin a generally stellar group of performances with the overindulgent pablum of Michael Bolton, the wanna-be-ness of the Canadian tenors or the diabetic coma inducing saccharin of Jackie Evancho?
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Very happy with this product, since my family uses it everyday.  Works very well and much needed since our hdtv headphone jack doesn't produce much volume the FiiO E5 fits the bill.  It's also helpfull that it has a rechargeable battery.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|I wouldn't say this movie is for everyone. Certainly more for people of a sophisticated taste in movies. Notwithstanding, the movie resonated with me on a personal level, as I too endured a period of disillusionment from school and was sidetracked to the point of dropping out. Eventually I got the right frame of mind with the guidance of one of my favorite teachers and the rest was history.
0670022411|3.0|It's no surprise that \\"Discovery\\" has shot to the top of the bestseller lists. It revolves around one of the hottest subjects in pop culture right now, vampires, but with the added bonus of witches thrown in to up the ante. It's almost as if Stephanie Myers and Anne Rice joined forces to make a super supernatural bestseller. If only this was as engaging as either of those two ladies books. It's not that's it's boring per se, it just takes awhile for any real action to happen, and most of the first half of the book is relegated to detailed passages of our young scholar heroine, Diana as she discovers a manuscript that has been bound with magic, as well as near exhaustive accounts of her day to day activities. It seems said manuscript contains secrets to the origins of many otherworldly creatures including vampires and daemons, and possibly how to destroy them, which makes it the must have book of the supernatural set. Soon our reluctant Samantha is being followed by a dashing scholarly vamp,or Ed Cullen the Oxford years, and before you can say bewitched, they're falling in love, and everyone else wants to kill them. The bummer of the book is that the plot follows the same prolonged foreplay of our two lovers with Matthew the vampire saying they don't need to rush anything, and the end of the book merely coming off as a near six hundred page set up for the next, with no conclusive climax, except wait for the next book to see what happens.
1439102724|4.0|I read this book in nearly one sitting, and personally I feel it's her best in quite some time.  I appreciated the well developed characters and the overall message of acceptance.  Even though this wasn't a particularly suspenseful story I found myself wanting to read on and on to find out what would happen next. My only complaint is a minor one involving the ending but to elaborate here would be to spoil it for those who haven't read it.  Highly recommended!
1456506862|3.0|This book was very hard to get into. I picked this one up because I am a big fan of Great Gatsby. This is yet another reason that one should look at more than just looking for an author to select a book.     The book starts out telling the story about poor Anthony Patch. His parents died when he was young and he was raised by his millionaire grandfather. He had every advantage growing up going to the best schools and had money available to him at all times.     Anthony spent most of his time with his two best friends, Maury and Richard, discussing philosophy. He had never felt true love until Richard introduced Anthony to his cousin, Gloria. The love story in the beginning is entertaining to follow with Gloria's resistance and Anthony's persistence, but after they were married, the book got painful to read.     I had a hard time to continue reading after constantly hearing Anthony's 'woe is me' attitude and Gloria's fickle behavior. The reason I gave the book three stars was the beautiful descriptions and imagery present. Wouldn't waste my time reading it again.
B0036V4DGC|4.0|This is Alan's 2nd live DVD that I know of. For all the fans out there the only place you can get it is thru Alan Parsons official web site. DVD is called \\"live in Madrid\\" 2005. Strange that this DVD is recorded in Madrid also. You Tube has some great live video of Alan Parson's Project from 1990 at the \\"World Liberty Concert\\" The DVD I haven't been able to find yet.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It is oneof the most thought-provoking, profoundly disturbing books that I have ever read.  The thing that is most frightening about it, however, is that it seems like a plausible way for society to be in a hundred years or so.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT OUT TO MY FRIENDS TO WATCH IT. CHRISTIAN BALE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE JOHN CONNOR.
0810979772|5.0|In a time of too much TV, video games, and sports, it is hard to get kids to read these days. Well after seeing the movie \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\", my daughter told me she wanted to read the book. I ordered the entire 5 book series for her. She read them all!!! I just love seeing her curled up in the chair next to the fireplace with a book, instead of whining that she's bored. She loved the whole series, and even read a few of them more than once! And her younger sister will hopefully get the same use out of them. This is a good series that teaches some lessons and gives kids some insight into their own world. I definitely feel we got our money's worth!!!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I still get chills when I think about the richly detailed ending to this masterful tale, one that weaves enough chills and thrills into the mix that I was spellbound for days.  In fact, this is one of the better achievements in the year that was 2006, a year that was so rich with film and yet seems so underappreciated (yes, Martin Scorsese finally won his Oscar, but `The Departed' represents some of the more middlebrow, overrated fare the year had to offer).<br /><br />`The Illusionist' is beyond intoxicating.<br /><br />The film tells the story of undying love.  Set in Vienna, the story centers on renowned illusionist Eisenheim.  Growing up poor and essentially banned from seeing the love of his youth, Duchess Sophie, Eisenheim is reunited with his love 15 years later.  By this time she is betrothed to another, a violent tempered Crown Prince with ideas of ruining a nation.  Devising a plan to be together, all seems dangerous yet doable until Sophie turns up dead.<br /><br />Enter Chief Inspector Uhl.<br /><br />Thank goodness for casting directors with their thinking caps on.  Edward Norton is superb as Eisenheim, a man completely withdrawn into his own world yet confidently assertive into the lives of those around him.  He is commanding and unforgettable.  Rufus Sewell (he needs more films like this) is impressively oppressive and spine chillingly creepy and Jessica Biel defines damsel in distress with her soft lips and limber body language that beg to be embraced.  But, for me, this film is all about Paul Giamatti.  For a man who can fall, very easily, into caricature, his performance as Uhl is so astute and technically dominating that I found myself caught up in his every scene.<br /><br />I just loved watching him and Norton interact; like to masters prodding one another along with a slight arrogance that should complete control of the situation at hand.<br /><br />The film is elegantly shot, much like a piece of art, the scenes just melt off the screen and imprint themselves into the minds of the viewer.  It suffered due to being released in the same year as Christopher Nolan's equally outstanding `The Prestige', but one should not forget `The Illusionist'.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|I thought this was an absolutely riveting movie and all the actors were superb, particularly John Hawkes.  I didn't have much hope for the Oscars because the competition was so fierce this year but the clip they showed should have been when we first meet Teardrop and he grabs Ree by the face.      But here's my beef:  I first saw the DVD by renting through Redbox.  I loved the movie so much I bought it from Amazon and set it up with two friends to watch.  When the movie was over, I realized there were many, many scenes that had been cut so I rented it again from Redbox and it was the same shortened version I had purchased.  After doing some research, I discovered the original DVD released was 140 minutes and the current one is only 100 minutes. That's a helluva lot of good scenes cut but I can't seem to find the original DVD anywhere.  If anyone could help me with this or has one they would like to sell, I would be most appreciative.
B004132HZS|5.0|My sister recommended this and I watched it with my 30 year old daughter. We both loved it! It was true enough to the persona of Sherlock to satisfy a die-hard Sherlock fan, but modern and edgy enough to engage the next generation. Highly recommend.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|But guess what? I was wrong again...this seems to happen a lot with me.  Anyway, on to the movie review...I probably would have never watched this film if it hadn't been for the persuading by my 8 year old daughter.  So I reluctantly watched it and fell in love!  I never thought I was a musical fan, but I now relaize that there is absolutely no basis for me to be labeled as such, as I now admittedly, realize that I like quite a few...there's really only a couple I can think of that I dislike.  Mamma Mia! is not one of them.  I LOVE IT!  Some of the singing is not the greatest, but it is still a fantastic movie, and anything with Meryl Streep and Colin Firth in it can call me a fan, pretty much.  It's definitely a chick flick, so I don't imagine many straight male counterparts will be lining up to see this one.  It's fun, funny, romantic, heartwarming, and the music is fantastic!  I highly recommend this one and can't wait to see the stage performance someday.  5 stars!
B000MQC9H4|3.0|The film, as a whole, works marginally well; enough to validate seeing it and enjoying it but not enough to really constitute adoring it.  As far as romantic comedies go, `The Holiday' gets it half right.<br /><br />The half they get right is the one starring Cameron Diaz and Jude Law.<br /><br />The film tells paralleled stories of two woman exchanging homes for a much needed break from reality.  Iris is currently devastated that her ex-boyfriend Jasper is now engaged to a co-worker.  Amanda is disgusted with her cheating boyfriend and overwhelmed by her job.  The two, in an act of desperation, exchange lives (homes, cars...the whole shebang) and attempt to unwind and refocus.  Of course, where there are desperate women there are kind hearted men who are tailor-made for helping them `refocus', and so insert Jude Law and...um...Jack Black?  Law plays Graham, Iris's brother, who infiltrates Amanda's alone time and makes himself a staple in her `healing'.  Jack Black plays Miles, a music composer who ignites a spark in Iris.<br /><br />The script and pacing of the film only half work.<br /><br />I will say that what I did enjoy about the film and that balance of `two stories' was that it was able to bounce around so that we didn't lose complete interest in the couples in question, which it would have been very easy to do.  Sadly though, the film is overly long and the couples themselves, at least Winslet and Black, are miscast.  Diaz and Law are quite good, especially Law who kind of OWNS this movie.  I love Kate Winslet with all my almighty heart and consider her an acting goddess and the single best working actress today, but romantic comedies are not her thing.  She just comes off dull and uninteresting, especially in the films first half.  She does pick up her pace a bit towards the end, but by then we have lost interest and moved on to Diaz, who is totally in her element and shines brightly here.  Black tries, and he works better than expected, but you can tell that he is in over his head.<br /><br />Nancy Meyers has a certain way about making her movies.  She understands certain aspects of the love game, but she also doesn't know how to edit herself.  I remember a similar problem (although not as unevenly toned) in `Something's Gotta Give', a film that hit a lot of great marks and then allowed itself to wear out its own welcome.  That is a problem I have with `The Holiday'.  It is too loosely constructed.  Some tighter pacing and some much needed edits could have consolidated this film and made it move quicker and hit harder.  Instead, it tends to drag on in places and loses some of its charm along the way.<br /><br />The film as a whole is ok, but I wanted more than that.Nancy Meyers has a certain way about making her movies.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I found the series very interesting because my Dad was a Marine who served at both Peleliu and Okinawa.  Dad earned a SPOT Bronze Star with \\"V\\" Device (for valor) at Peleliu's Hill One and was field promoted for taking out an enemy 75mm fieldpiece, singlehandedly; with his bazooka, and he earned a Silver Star six weeks before he was KIA on the last day of the Okinawa campaign.    I always knew that Peleliu was a bloody battle, but there was little information at the time at the Marine Heritage Museum at Quantico (a must-see place) or the former museum in DC. For the first time in my experience, the series depicted how bloody it was by devoting three of the disks to it.  Peleliu had the highest attrition rate of any battle for the Marines in the Pacific Theater; it was also a battle that some thought not necessary, especially Admiral Halsey.  But Halsey was over-ruled by MacArthur and his cabal.    What was supposed to be a three-day cakewalk turned into an over 2-1/2 month bloodbath.  There were 6,542 Marine casualties in all out of about 10,000 who were sent there -- a 65 percent attrition rate.  After three days of Naval bombardment and the Navy's announcement that they had run out of targets, they sent in the Marines to be slaughtered by an entrenched, devious enemy.  The enemy opened fire from well-concealed and protected positions that the Naval bombardment did not even scratch.    I also was very impressed with the depiction of Lt. Andrew A. (Ack Ack) Haldane, the beloved leader of K/3/5's mortarmen.  My Dad was with HQ/1/5's Assault Platoon, which employed special weps and generally kicked a whole lot of ass - as did all the Marines of the time.    The depiction of \\"Sledgehammer\\", Eugene Sledge, was pretty spot-on from what is widely known about him.    Anyway, if anyone wants to see more about the Pacific Theater's history, I would highly recommend buying the series.  Plus, Amazon's price beats HBO's price by a mile.
0061537969|5.0|I had to stop myself several times during this book to remind myself a dog really hadn't written it...at least I don't think so. Maybe it was Enzo's fascination with watching videos of car racing...my two have never expressed an interest in the sport....

B000003S0B|2.0|After the successful 'In the court of the Crimson King', which was ground-breaking, members of the original band were abandoning ship. Guitar player Robert Fripp was basically left with lyricist Peter Sinfield, but was able to convince most of the band to stay to help him complete a second album.    With that in mind, Fripp had to kind of keep things going along nicely, so, a lot of the material is quite reminiscent of the material on the debut, actually very similar indeed. Well, the first half of the album kind of reminds the listener of the first side of the first album. The second side is a mish-mash of new sounds.     There is a folky ballad called 'Peace' that is broken up and spread throughout the album, which doesn't add much. 'Pictures of a city' and 'In the wake of Poseidon' are both flat when compared with the songs they mirror from the debut (21st century... and Epitaph). The only really good song is 'Catfood', an eccentric up-tempo song that is fun and kind of predicts the type of music the band would make later on in their careers. This could also be said of 'The Devil's Triangle', a very dissonant sounding song full of eerie noises, but it's not very good. They would do much better later with 'Lark's Tongues in Aspic', 'Fracture' and 'The Mincer' with this type of thing. 'Cadence and Cascade' is a lot like 'Talk to the wind', but at least Gordon Haskell gives a fresh feeling, as does a slightly different arrangement.     Overall, this album is not King Crimson at their best. They can do much better, but at least it is enjoyable if you like progressive music, albeit rather an average 'prog' record. Rating **

B000J3OTSM|4.0|I will say that there is nothing new in `Step Up', like at all.  The film is a product of its environment and it really is the `same ol same' when it comes to teen romance dramas.  There is the whole shtick (boy meets girl, they are SOOO different and yet they click, they learn, they fight, they get back together) and the premise to the film seems borrowed heavily from elsewhere.  What sets `Step Up' apart and allows the audience to enjoy it with reckless abandon is the sheer charisma of the films stars and the way they feed off one another flawlessly.  Yes, the `Step Up' series is far from perfect (the second installment is decent enough, but the retched 3rd act is an abomination) but this first installment is a lot of fun.  For what it presents, it's kind of perfect.  Channing Tatum is on top of his game, although I will say that after initially seeing this film I really expected his career to be, um, different.  Jenna Dewan is good here, overshadowed by Tatum (and where has she gone?) but good nonetheless.  With great dancing to boot, the film is just a lot of fun, as guilty as the fun may make you feel.
1594202842|5.0|My review will not be the most useful review, and I'm not going to summarize it because that's already available. I loved this book. I finished it in two days, and I want to find the author and give her a big hug. She's already lived my life, and she has shared her lessons learned with those of us who are hard-wired to be intense parents. Any parent of a Suzuki music student will find HUGE value in this memoir. Frankly, I think her lessons can be translated to any activity in which a child competes. Furthermore, I think any adult in Suzuki pedagogy or general Music Education student should read this, to get an idea of the parents of their future students. It's always good to understand more about your students and the potential background from whence they come.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|i loved the THE DARK KNIGHT film very much when it came out... my question at this point is - will they bring Frank Miller's THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS to the big screen in 2012? i realize that the next movie (and final batman/nolan film?) will be called 'the dark knight rises' - but jeez Warner Brothers, ya gotta bring Miller's comic graphic novel to the big screen! i've heard bane and catwoman will be villains, and that's not so much a bad thing at this point so long as the story and script is tight and works well, what they should do is update Frank's material and give it a raw, current, gritty and bad-ass feel to it...   i mean, if this next/last batman flick is going out with a bang, balls-to-the-wall type ending - DC/Warner Brothers, i'm talkin' to you: DO THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS!!!
B001E45XT4|5.0|These headsets are just what I was looking for. The closed-ear setting is very useful when family or friends around you can be quite loud. Compared to my 2.1 speakers, this headset allows me to hear where my enemies are. I've even been accused of hacking when I can hear enemies walking/running behind a wall. The microphone works very well. My voice is very clear to other games. The microphone does take some time to get it just right. I had to change the settings both in and out of the games. In terms of sound quality they are very good for a GAMING headset. As the name says, these are meant for gaming, not for music. You can still listen to your music and it sound pretty good, but no where near more expensive speakers or headphones.    There are only 2 cons I can really say. When you first wear it, it is really tight on your head. After about an hour my head started to hurt. This goes away after you keep using it and it \\"stretches\\" out. The 2nd con, which isn't really one, is that the plastic it comes in is extremely hard. I cut myself on the plastic and scratched my headset trying to remove it.    All-in-all, if you are looking for a gaming headset that can give you the edge in online games, this is the one for you.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|`Brick' is one of those films that has aged very well with me.  I remember when I first say it and I really liked it a lot.  Over time I had forgotten just how much I liked this until I happened to catch it a while back and became instantly absorbed in it once again.  With dialog as fresh and sharp as the words expressed in `Juno', yet more residual thanks to the noir'ish themes, `Brick' just `gets it'.<br /><br />I love the feel of `Brick'.  This is a film that knows what it wants to be.  It indulges in and totally embraces the thickly detailed atmosphere that makes it stand alone, apart from comparables.  The film never feels amateurish or `silly'.  Instead, it balances the absurd details of the surroundings by elevating the core themes, keeping each character believable as apposed to a cleverly inserted caricature.<br /><br />Rian Johnson is just, well, awesome.<br /><br />Taking place mainly on school grounds, `Brick' tells the story of Brendan, a curious teen who gets a message from his girlfriend claiming to need help.  Taking that message and running with it, Brendan finds himself deep in high-school crime, and when his girlfriend shows up dead, things get even stickier for Brendan as he meets and evaluates a variety of teens dwelling in the school's underbelly.  Drugs and murder fester as Brendan steps closer to the truth, eluded by a mysterious girl named Laura and a drug kingpin known as The Pin.<br /><br />Thank you Joseph Gordon-Levitt for being the acting god that you are.  I can't wait for the whole world to embrace you as `the next best thing' and for you to completely make the cinematic world your breeding grounds.  Seriously, is there anything this kid can't do?  As Brendan, Gordon-Levitt adds so much weight to the films premise, aiding Brendan with a subtle edge that makes him believable and relatable.  Megan Good and Mike O'Leary are also great; but it is Nora Zehetner, as rich girl Laura, who stays with me the longest.  She was just outstanding, layering her characters mysteriousness with richly conceived moments that spark our interest.<br /><br />Thanks to a poetic script and a sharp directorial eye, `Brick' is the new age noir that understands how to pay homage without feeling like a cheaply disguised copycat.  No, this is not the best noir ever (as some presumptuous teens have tried to claim) but it is one of the smartest takes on the genre in years.  The noir is a hard genre to master, but `Brick' just oozes with enough charm and originality to take the cake here.<br /><br />Fascinating is a word that best describes this film.usness with richly conceived moments that spark our interest.

B000031EGV|5.0|I was really young when this movie first came out, but my parents let me watch anyway and it was a little frightening but I couldn't stop watching.  However, going back and watching it now, it's definitely still an amazingly captivating movie.  The graphics aren't always the best, but it's from the '90s, what can you expect?

B00475AYJQ|3.0|Has fun scenes, but does not have much progress in overall plot or Kvothe's character.  Some spoilers follow.    I loved Name of the Wind, but Wise Man's Fear wasn't anything like as wonder-filled or charming or gripping.  It wasn't exactly bad; I enjoyed turning the pages, and some of the scenes were good.  But unlike Name of the Wind, Wise Man's Fear doesn't give me that feeling of unfolding huge discovery that I love in epic fantasy.    Kvothe ends this book with a few more skills and a few more clues than where he began.  But honestly, despite picking up sex and swordsmanship his personality doesn't really deepen, and we hardly learn anything more about the Chandrian or the King he's fated to kill or the secret history of the word - a few names is all.    It feels like you could read the first book and skip this book and go to the third book, whenever it's written, and it just wouldn't take long to fill you in on what you needed to know.  I wanted a book that would show me a real change in Kvothe's attitude to life, or bring in new people that he cared for as more than lovable but ultimately leavable friends, or take me to a new level of understanding what happened long ago that led to the Chandrian.  I got some pleasant action scenes and some cute sex scenes but I didn't get any of that more meaningful stuff, and that makes me sad.    I had a good time with a lot of the scenes in this book, so if you were going to buy it anyway, don't worry, you'll probably at least enjoy it.  But don't be surprised if you, like me, feel a little disappointed by comparison with the book that came before.
B001PKHS68|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies and I've seen the older, unrestored version many times. The new restored version is brighter so you can see more, without losing the classic movie feel. The screen is also wider to include more of the shot than previous DVD's. The VHS version includes the whole wide screen as originally filmed, but if you are going to go digital than this version is the way to go!  I was worried it would ruin one of my favorite films as some restorations can look like someone took watercolor or oil paint to the film and just made it brighter.  This shows the film in the vibrant colors the South of France was meant to be seen in and no doubt how Hitchcock hoped to portray the film.  Get it!  You won't be sorry.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|If the movie's plot was a block of cheese, it would be Swiss. Exciting escape sequences, otherwise a frustrating experience as a junior bureaucrat repeatedly endangers people with his idealism and outrage, and a chauffeur with pretensions of being a novelist performs remarkable stunts.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Well, I have to say I could barely get through this book. I was not going to write a review,  I just could not find anything good to say about it, so I chose to say nothing at all. However, this book got so much pre-publication advertisement, and has gotten so many good reviews, I just felt the need to say something.<br />I am wondering if this book is mainly for people who don't normally read urban fantasy, fantasy or paranormal romance, and the publishers thought they would capture the fantasy reader audience along with the others? I don't read much paranormal romance, so maybe this is more paranormal romance and that is why I don't get it?<br />The characters are flat, they fall in love for whatever reason, because they see each other? There is no chemistry, there is no depth, I just did not feel anything for any of the characters.<br />I did think the story had possibilities so I ordered it. There was so much publicity about how great the book was, the next big trilogy to hit the shelves, great urban fantasy....great fantasy...anyway, this book was so boring and so over written. I am not sure how to explain what I mean by over written, I guess she was trying too hard. The world building was flat, again the characters so flat, the story boring.<br />I feel bad trashing it like this but I guess I got kind of mad. I read so many good authors, and so many good books that don't get this kind of support from the publishers. Why this book? not sure....Don't waste your time if you like good fantasy or urban fantasy.
0756405890|5.0|With the release of the sequel, I decided to go back and reread the Name of the Wind to refresh my memory, and it's just as good as I remembered if not better. My only real complaints about this book, are that it's a little slow and that there really isn't a beginning middle and end. This book is very obviously the intro to a much larger/grandiose story. That being said, this is one of my favorite books ever. It's so good, that at one point I read instead of slept for a night. Rothfuss takes some very common story telling and fantasy trappings, and breathes new life into them. Specifically two of the most used settings ever, the narrator telling the story to the reader, and the story beginning with everyone the child main character knows being killed while off doing something else (probably THE most used cliche in fantasy stories). While the author didn't do too much to the one cliche, his family's death and the aftermath is done with an amazing amount of emotional depth, it can't help but touch your heartstrings. Now for the story telling cliche, Rothfuss does turn on it's head in very original ways by switching to the present along with many other small additions.     Regarding world building, the magic is very well done, making it so realistic/believable that it almost resembles a science. The monetary system is also done very well, making all the transactions understandable while not copying any real world system. The religion and mythology is very interesting and unique, I really enjoyed it. The politics landscape and history weren't delved into too deeply this go around, but the basics were done well. Overall, the world building was done extremely well.     The best thing about this books has got to be the characters, they all have a very definite weight where you want to learn more about them, they aren't just placeholders for the story. I can't wait to see what the next book has in store for all of them.
030746363X|2.0|I got the book based on the near 5 star reviews and the fact that it has appeared on the best seller list in my area.  It has some uses some scientific studies as a background, but is basically the findings of the author, a handful of his aquaintences and a few others who have played around with different techniques soley to develop muscle and look good.  If that is your goal, then the book might be for you.    What it is lacking is a diet or excersize program that a person can sustain oriented to healthy diet and aerobic conditioning that lead to a person's overall well-being for the long run.  It is slightly more than some of the fads diets and excersize programs out there.  My anecdotal experience from folks I know is that crash programs such as these work only for the short term, and most people fall back into their previous lifestyle, weight, and fitness level.  It has only a little information on diet, exersize, and the many afflictions of heart disease and other health and mental conditions that are commmon in our western society.    The bottom line that most health advocates put forth is for a lifestyle change of a balanced diet low in fat and calories, aerobic exersize, flexibility, and some strength training.  But everyone seems to be looking for a quick fix.    I actually tried the \\"slow-carb\\" diet, switching from a diet of mostly whole grains, vegetables and small amounts of meat, eggs and dairy products.  I did loose a little weight after a week, but started to feel poorly and generally lethargic.

Sure, it wasn't as tight as \\"Pillars Of The Earth,\\" but, as always, he did his homework before writing this one, and it was obvious.

0756404738|5.0|As excellent as the first book in the series was it was hard not to fear that Rothfuss had peaked with the first installment, as so many authors do.  The opposite is true, rather than peaking it's clear that he was just warming up with \\"The Name of the Wind\\".  When a narrative is this perfect it reads more like verse than prose, and \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" reflects the best of both the legacies of classic and modern fantasy.  Evoking the timeless quality found in Literature at it's finest, not just killer genre fiction, and as a long time reader of fantasy I've been blown away by the surge of young talent in recent years.  Rothfuss is one of those at the head of the pack, and like Kvothe, sounding notes of raw originality.

B001QIP5A0|2.0|We were disappointed because we thought \\"Deep\\" meant DEEP -- as in the abyssal plain, trenches, etc... the portions of the ocean that get no light but yet are teeming with life.  This video, while beautiful, was not at all what we were looking for.
0785134352|3.0|Definitely better than Wanted IMO.  It has an interesting plot, but nothing really memorable.  Again none of the characters are likable - just like Wanted.  I thought the changes in the film adaptation were for the better.  The good part about all this is that it's short enough to not waste a whole lot of time on.  Just long enough for a good read.  Actually, Dave is the opposite of Wesley.  Instead of inheriting power from his father and become a vicious supervillian, Dave wants to be a superhero with no power or money.  Both of the characters are \\"loser\\" want to make me think what Millar went through as a kid must be similar.  Anyway, if you are into violence and vulgar language, then it's an interesting read.  In other words, if you enjoyed Millar's Wanted, you would enjoy this one.
0984536132|5.0|To understand Adolf Hitler you must read this book it shows a great deal about Hitler's hatred for mankind while it deals more about Politics it does have a good amount of racism and hate, it will show you how easily the world can be destroyed in a blink of an eye if Nazis ever return to power. I have always been fascinated by Hitler and his Legendary Salute, His uniform and the way he speaks, a very charismatic speaker he cannot be compared, he is one of a kind. His faith in German Engineering. He owned a 1935 Mercedes Benz and kept it till the end of 1945. He was not like today's leaders who would sell their soul for the dollar in a blink of an eye, would lie to gain power and hide their true agenda. Hitler was a different kind of politician he genuinely wanted to help Germany and its German People and make no mistake he did it in his time and he did it amazingly, until he went to far and plunged Germany into an inferno. He made it clear of his hatred for Jews and his plan for them. He made it clear what his intentions were before he came to power. He did not hide this and for this you must admire the guy to a certain extent.     Sadly because of the fact that he preached racism and hatred for mankind. He can only be remembered as an Evil man. A sad turn of events, there is nothing pretty about this man. He is a man with a heart of stone. Such is the way people used to think back then and still do today. This is nothing more than the hatred of man. Hitler was just brave enough to write a book about it and actually practice what he preached. But make no mistake, Stalin was a lot worst than Hitler. But not as popular.

I have a Canon T2i and will be using the camera and bag to take shots of my kids at sporting events.  This bag will be wonderful to take to the ballfield this Spring.  I can't say how durable the bag is, but it seems as though it will hold up.   As many others have said, I also love the fact that there is not a \\"steal me\\" label on the bag broadcasting I have expensive camera equipment in the bag.

B001NEK2GE|3.0|So i bought this to hopefully improve my WoW PVP. The idea was to dedicate my thumb to movement and leave my fingers free to access actions. It was great it theory but not so much in actuality.     This G13 is a clever device that could really improve your game *IF* you can adjust to the joystick. I myself could NOT. Its too close to the finger rest position and the upright position feels awkward. The stick feel terrible to the thumb. Its small, hard and edgy which relates to a sore thumb. Sore from poor stick placement and the tiny, uncomfortable hard plastic stick. The joystick is also a button, and a horrible one at that. VERY hard to push and maintain any desired direction of the stick.     Now for the good. The keyboard is setup decently and does offer a couple more buttons to the left of your movement keys than a standard kybd. Its pretty comfortable and the angle was well thought out. The button stroke feels a bit more solid than a cheap kybd but is average in feel. The software is straight forward and easy to understand. I had multiple binds up and running in minutes. It also allows for **executable macroing**, which could be quite powerful in games that dont allow it (like WoW). You can achieve multiple moves, in your order, from one keystroke. OP    I wanted to like the G13, I really did. But the ergonomics of it are a deal breaker for me. I have fairly big hands and the joystick just doesn't feel like something Id ever get used too. I'll have a look at the Belkin/Razer next I think.    Hope I was able to answer some questions that people may be looking for.
1931559317|5.0|I saw this Atlas at my local astronomy club's presentation. It's great for beginners and intermediate-level deep-sky observers. I still find it difficult to handle large atlases like Sky Atlas 2000.0 or Uranometria, so this is ideal, and plots enough objects for me. It has pretty detailed charts of the Virgo region. Of course, with a 16\\" or 18\\" telescope, you will definitely exceed the limiting magnitude of the Atlas, but I think this should be good for a 8\\" / 12\\" owner or an intermediate / beginner level observer.

1594202842|4.0|Originally, I bought this book to find out what kind of secrets or advice a \\"Tiger Mom\\" would share with other moms on how to successfully raise your child as a virtuoso and an academic achiever. It's ironic that I wanted to read about Amy Chua's techniques because I grew up with a strict Korean mother who hoped I would become a concert pianist. I wanted to learn how to raise your child with these kinds of obsessive tactics while teaching them that you are doing all of these crazy things because you love them. But I ended up identifying the most with the youngest daughter, Lulu, and I had to to take breaks from reading the book because I was being reminded of the kind of suffocation an Asian mother calls \\"love.\\" I tried to understand how a mother who works as a Yale law school professor has the time to obsess and manipulate her daughters into constantly practicing piano or violin for a Carnegie Hall concert, and the only explanation I could come up with is that Chua is just crazy. The funny part is that she is so proud of her insanity. Her daughters seem very patient and well-adjusted considering everything their mother has put them through, so they must know that their mother loves them. If they can continue to understand this, they will be alright and probably very successful. I enjoyed reading this book because it's an honest, humorous account of how a crazy \\"Tiger Mom\\" raises her daughters.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|my son loves this movie, im not sure why, but he does so the price was awesome and the quality was great!!!
B002C6A6FY|2.0|Okay, first off, I love Bogey, He is one of my favorite actors. And I wasn't born until 1987 so yeah I have awesome taste in film. I even watch ones with subtitles. In fact I don't bother watching movies unless they are in Black and White or have subtitles.     So my reason for giving it two stars? Obviously there is nothing wrong with the actual movie. But this says it is a two disc Special edition. If it is so special, then why didn't mine come with a cool gray fedora or a flask of bourbon? How am I suppose to watch this wonderful \\"Special\\" edition without bourbon? It's typical hollywood fat cats creating all kinds of \\"special\\" \\"alternative\\" \\"directors'\\" \\"extended\\" editions just so they can sell more copies of the movie. I mean seriously what the heck is wrong with them? Do they not realize that many people rebel against that by downloading through bit-torrents? Next time a production company tries and makes a \\"Special\\" edition of a movie with bogey and they don't include a flask or colt revolver, they are simply wasting their and especially the fans' time.

B004HGBUVG|5.0|For me - this album is more to MY liking.     One of the things I  love about Lucinda is her hypnotic melodies along with lyrics that FORCE you to think outside the box.    LIke \\"Born to be Loved\\" as in\\" World without Tears\\" saying something so simple yet from a perspective of what we are NOT - rather what we ARE or should be.  Her unique perspective and focus on issues we are ALL feeling so often and yet don't quite know how to express. Then she does it for you.    I have always thought this is one of the traits that has made Lucinda so special. And, in my case I bought the cd, so I LOVED the packaging. Sending me her thoughts and messages before I even heard a single song.    THANKS Lucinda. You ROCK - or in much of these songs. You hypnotize.    Oh, and as always. Excellent musicians.
1935251740|1.0|I was extremely disappointed.  Much of the underlying science was interesting, but there was no pathway of reasoning toward the conclusions drawn. Biocenstrism, as explained, is simply unwarranted by the information provided. It was nothing more than a leap of faith that, even if true, would have left the reader as the sole conscious being in the universe. The personal stories were completely off topic, failing even to be supportive or integrated into the emerging story. As a theory, it explains nothing while claiming to explain everything.  I prefer the pitfalls of the central science.  They at least give us something to work on.
B004LGPBZI|3.0|The interesting thing about Beady Eye is that none of the members ever probably saw themselves as lead songwriters for a widely known band. The group consists of backing musicians and a lead singer who would occasionally try their hand at coming up with a song. When Noel left Oasis, the foundation of the band was gone. There is no denying that. There is a reason they didn't keep the Oasis name when Noel left; it was HIS band.    I had no expectations from this band at all. While Gem, Andy, and Liam had all proved to be able to pop out a good song every once in a while (Songbird, Hung in a Bad Place, Turn Up the Sun), they had never written anything quite like Noel did. I couldn't imagine an entire album of just their songs. Actually, my vision of said album was \\"Ain't Got Nothin'\\" twelve times. It was a humorous vision....and one I'm glad to say doesn't exist in \\"Different Gear, Still Speeding\\"    This album is really Liam, Gem, and Andy's first time proving themselves as performers AND songwriters, and I must say, they did much better than I thought they would. No, there's nothing here that's going to blow your mind, and yes, it sounds just like you'd expect (Beatles influenced, Stones Influenced, and dare I say, Noel Gallagher influenced.) But its not bad. This is a fun rock album with some standout tracks (The Roller, Wigwam.) Some songs are better than others for sure, but its a decent ride all the way through.    I must say, the best songs on this album are the ones that aren't trying to rock so hard. \\"For anyone\\" is a perfect little pop song, and finally a Liam song that can be put up with the ranks of \\"Songbird.\\" It's extremely melodic, which is something this band should take note of. Noel's Oasis songs were often loud and in your face, just like many songs on this album, but they could also be played acoustically and remain just as strong. There's nothing wrong with classic rock swagger, but what really makes a song is the songwriting itself. With a littlework and dedication, I could see Beady Eye reaching that level in the future.    This album turned out much better than I think anyone thought it was going to be. That being said, it is not a perfect album. I would recommend buying it, just don't expect it to be the next (Whats the story) Morning Glory? And why should you, this is not Oasis. This is a band finding its sea legs still. Luckily, even though they might still be wobbling a bit on deck, none of them have fallen overboard. Good job guys, good job.

B00003CX5P|4.0|I feel that I should get one thing out of the way before this review really gets underway. I never saw this film in theaters. I never rented it when it initially came out on VHS and DVD. I saw this film AFTER I saw Episodes II and III. In fact, I didn't see Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace until late in 2010. So, my experience with the film will undoubtedly be different from most who read this review.    I love Star Wars. Well, the films anyway. I tried reading the Expanded Universe novels and comic books, only to have them slowly and deliberately annihilate everything I enjoyed about that characters and Galaxy I had come to adore. But, back on topic, I love the original trilogy of films. I grew up with them and I continue to enjoy them (the original theatrical versions) to this day. So, I was more than excited to see this film, but for some reason, I just never got around to seeing it until just recently. And I enjoyed it immensely.    If you're reading this, and you despise this movie, if the very thought of it makes your blood boil, I can understand. I'll never tell you that I can't, in some way, get where you're coming from. The Phantom Menace is very flawed, one could argue fundamentally so. I'm more than willing to admit that. But, I still enjoy it. I won't defend it (though there are a few arguments I could refute) and I won't call you out, but I did genuinely enjoy this entry into the Star Wars saga.    First, lets' look at the failings of the film. First is the writing. While I personally enjoyed the story of The Phantom Menace, the writing is, well, rather shoddy. Hell, the dialogue is downright MST3K worthy at times and the way in which the plot is told can be quite head-scratching at times. I really think the plot should have been presented in more straightforward fashion, but instead Lucas attempted what I think was supposed to be non-linear storytelling and wound up muddling things up a bit. Certain things, such as the Trade Federation's reason(s) for joining Palpatine remain unexplained (which is really a sticking point since EVERYONE else's motivations are explained). This isn't helped by scenes (chiefly the Pod Race) that go on for WAY too long. Some careful scene trimming would have been nice, George.    Next, and I really hate to jump so late onto a bandwagon point, is Jar Jar. I have never been so annoyed with a character in a film. I can understand why Lucas put him in, but dear god. A character that inept, that oafish, that utterly boorishly stupid deserves all the problems they step into. I'm sorry, but I really hate Jar Jar Binks.    Finally, we have the children. Oi. Normally, acting doesn't mean as much to me as it does to others, but in this case i have to make an exception. Why is Anakin, sorry, \\"Annie\\" so young? Why are there 17 hyperbullilion children in this film? And does every one of their actors have to be as godawful as they are? Good lord, these are the worst child actors I've ever scene. I swear, I'll be hearing \\"Annie's\\" cries of 'Yippie!' in my nightmares 'til doomsday.    Now, most folks would think, after those bullet points, that I would hate this film. Not so. I like the Phantom Menace despite it's flaws. I normally don't enjoy films for the \\"experience\\", I'm usually at the core working the plot/direction/writing/characters bits, but there are a few movies out and about that have provided me with an excellent experience that I get totally absorbed into, and The Phantom Menace is one such film. The music, the CG-organic effects, the characters, the music everything just weave together to give me that Star Wars feel and I get totally sucked in. It's far, FAR from perfect, and it's not as good the original three entries, but Episode One is a worthwhile and fun entry into the mythic Star Wars saga.

B00383UJ2U|5.0|I have never owned a CD before in my entire life where I LOVE every song. I stumbled upon Hurts last year and have been obsessed with them ever since. Their CD \\"Happiness\\" does not dissapoint. Theo and Adam are amazing for their young age (mid 20s) and each of their songs evoke such passion through the lyrics, music and voice.     I love being able to belt out (off tune of course) every song on the album!    I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is into the electro/synth pop made popular in the 80s :)
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This has to be the worst book I have ever read.  The characters were dull, her job is boring, he seemed to have no personality whatsoever. You keep waiting for something to actually happen in this book, nothing ever happens. It took me two weeks to muddle through this book, I kept putting it down so I could do something else more exciting, like laundry!  Do not waste one minute of your time reading this book. It would not be worth the price, even if it were free.
B001RT89TC|5.0|Michael was definitely running on all cylinders when this session was recorded. The MSG project was in turmoil, but the change in members, brought new life into MSG for this era of MSG. Graham Bonnet, such a dynamic vocalist brought a new edge to Michael's music. The changing from Paul Raymond & Cozy Powell (RIP), also proved to be a fresh change, adding Ted Mckenna (drums) & Tommy Eyre (keyboards)...    The styling here is like a more raw Lovedrive, with a ballsy blues feel/groove to it...    Not a bad song on the album. Dancer is kind of pop sounding tune, but fits in none the less...    Classic Schenker @ it's finest. I wish he'd come back to his roots again & put out some gutsy music like this...    Other recommendations are:    Scorpions Lovedrive  UFO Walk On Water  MSG Written In The Sand
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I was disappointed to learn that these ear phones only had two speakers in them. Turns out that the head phones reproduce surround sound by mimicking the Doppler shift of sound waves around your ears.     Think about it. You only have two ears. How is it that your brain know what direction the sound is coming from? It learns as your grow up. Sound wave the pass over the exterior of your ear change as they pass over the ridges of your exterior ear. Your brain interprets where the sound came from based on the shift in the sound wave. These head phones reproduce that effect in the outputted sound.     I tried a surround test with them and moved a sound source around the room. The headphones reproduced the surround experience with one exception. The rear sound never feel like it goes directly behind you. It well feel off-center to the right or left.    A problem I found with them is that the sound can be staticy at times, which I believe comes from external interference or low batteries. Bottom line is that I really like them for when I need to be quite, but I wouldn't want to use them in place of my home theater system. The padding on the phones is quite comfortable, but gets a little sweaty over long periods of wear; that probably happens with all head phones though.
0670022411|5.0|ADOW deserves every praise given to it. Ive read so many books revolving around humans loving vampires and vice versa, and this is definitely one of the best, rivaling Anne Rice. Its rich with history, and it goes beyond the typical 'girl falls in love with vampire, vampire struggles with forgotten humanity over girl, tries not to kill girl, girl becomes vampire.' The characters are quirky and likable and go beyond being simple placeholders for the reader. This has absolutely nothing in common with twilight, in that twilight is poorly written, devoid of plot, sensory detail, and character development and sets feminism back about 20 years. This book is its antithesis, its intelligent, complex, and definitely worth the read. You will not regret it.

I chuckled and laughed, until I got to the \\"butt\\" jokes. Of course, for some people, that is the selling point. I would say, from a Christian point of view, which I am, it's too far down the Simpson's road, save the sex jokes. (No sex jokes in Whimp Kid, as far as I could see. Also, no jokes about God or religion, which the Simpsons has). Good humor but also crude humor for boys.

I think there could have been a little more meat in this. We never even see an actual battle between Metroman and Megamind. Basically, the story jumps all the way up to a point where Metroman is already tired of the \\"hero\\" life.     The graphics are great and there are enough funny lines to keep it going.

B004PHE9L0|1.0|I like steampunk. I like Weird West. I like comic book adaptations. I like movies that bust out of the usual genre cliches.<br /><br />But it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for \\"Jonah Hex\\" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of \\"Wild Wild West\\" and \\"Van Helsing,\\" with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.<br /><br />Jonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.<br /><br />Then the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building \\"the weapon\\" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).<br /><br />I wish I could give a better summary of the plot in \\"Jonah Hex,\\" but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Basically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden (\\"Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead\\"), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for \\"the weapon,\\" it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?<br /><br />I'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.<br /><br />\\"Jonah Hex\\" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000.\\" Give it a pass.ingshot.

B004PHE98S|5.0|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming edge. A brilliant movie.They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.

While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").     Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.     \\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming edge. A brilliant movie.
0385341679|4.0|Well,,, first I read the reviews, focusing on the bad ones so I could know what readers thought was lacking in the book.  I was as enthralled with the saga as most readers, although I must say I've always found Mac to be an irritating character, particularly in the first book, but that I supposed is the sign of a well written fiction, it should evoke different emotions.  Anyway, after reading the negative reviews, I lowered my expectations of the novel.  There was no way I wasn't going to read it after having investing so much time and money in the other books, but I figured even if I didn't enjoy it, at least it would end -- however Ms. Moning wanted it to end.  I agree with some of the comments, Mac does a lot of talking to self -- too much really -- about half of her self-reflections could have been left out without taking away from the impact.  Still, I'm impatient and often feel that way about books.  But I don't understand what some of the reviewers said about \\"not get answers\\" and being left with more unanswered questions.  The questions that were most compelling in the saga were answered.  We know what Barrons is (essentially anyway), we find out who/what Mac is, we find out who killed Alina and we find out who the Unseelie King is and the concubine -- so not sure what is missing for these readers.  Anyway to me the beginning \\"was\\" a little annoying.  The story took a while to grab me.  I had to gloss over most of Part I, but around Part II or so, it grabs you just like the other books and the rollercoaster ride continues to its ultimate climax -- a satisfying ending.  If you've read the other books, you simply must give this one a chance. One other thing I will say is that it really is very sexually graphic, so if that truly offends, then perhaps it is not the book for you.
B0015XHP3Q|1.0|I am really disappointed with this Blu Ray DVD that I got, The BLU RAY DVD says it is Rambo 3 but actual the movie on the DVD is Rambo - First Blood Part 2.
B0001I55OC|3.0|The movie itself is okay, but it suffers from lack of Medieval violence. When I watched it in Decemeber of 2010 I was like, wasn't the 100 year war very violent with great warfare. And yet the movie felt empty. I love epic movies but this movie was like an ice cream sundae. Except it has no cherry on top!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I don't know where to begin with this review.     How do you describe a book so well written that when you read it, you can hardly comprehend the scope of it? I didn't READ this book, I absorbed it. The words flowed into my mind and I lost track of time. My reverie was only broken when I finally finished the book. I considered Rothfuss' first book to be the best I had ever read, but this eclipsed it by far. The plot is perfectly paced, and the character development is simply incredible. And this is only his second published work; I dream of the day when I am able to read his magnum opus.    I'm sorry if I seem dramatic, or overly succinct; it's unintentional. The fact of the matter is, I lack the literacy and skill to aptly describe and review this book. If I could give this book more than five stars, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I've never so fully enjoyed reading a book before. It's like I discovered the wonder and magic of books all over again. You owe it to yourself to read Rothfuss' amazing work.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|The new Robin Hood is a new Epic that shouldn't be missed. The battles are well done and even the little comedy in the film is pretty funny. The only bad things is that the dialogue sometimes is hard to understand, and it does in the middle become a little like a soap opera. Still you have got to see this prequel to how Robin Hood became a outlaw.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of the best shows I have ever seen. It's smart, funny, touching, smartly funny in a touching way, and touchingly funny with a smart fashion sense. It's everything a show should be. To swipe a line from Blade Runner (hopefully to sell it later for fantastic profit), the light that burns twice as bright burns for half as long, and Firefly burned so very, very brightly. Sadly, that means Firefly's life was far too short. There's a reason fans are so passionate about this show. Get this skinny little box set and find out why.     Plus, watching this show will instantly make you a big damn hero. I'm not kidding. A big... damn... hero.
B00006DEF9|4.0|The movie singin'the rain is a very good movie. It's funny and you shouldn't miss it. And that's coming from someone who hates Musicals. So on a rainy day, go watch it or get it off of Netflix.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Don't let any of the negative reviews about the Theatrical release fool you - this is an excellent Star Trek film. I would not have said that about the original release, and I certainly remember being disappointed when it first came out (if you want this film on Blue Ray, DO NOT purchase the current release of the theatrical version...). I highly recommend the Director's Cut for its improved editing and special effects, as well as the Special Features disc which explains how the film was improved and re-edited by Robert Wise.     When it first came out, there was an artificial deadline imposed upon its release because it had been promised to theaters. However, it took so long to complete the special effects that they were literally spliced into reels already destined to be delivered to movie theaters - so Robert Wise NEVER got to see the completed film before its release! Not only that, it was NEVER tested in front of an audience before its release, a process which led to great improvements in Star Trek II WOK (Spock's coffin on the genesis planet was added after the test screening, as well as Spock reciting the prologue \\"Space, the final frontier...\\").     20 years later, Wise was allowed to go back, cut down the length of the VGER flyover (which was way too long in the original), and add special effects - including external shots of the VGER vehicle, which was NEVER seen in the Theatrical version! Also, a very important scene that clearly shows Spock's motivation for returning to Star Fleet, as well as VGER's need to find \\"the creator\\" has been spliced in.    This film belongs in the top 3 of TOS films. Here's my list:    ST II Wrath of Khan  ST TMP, ST VI - a close tie for 2nd  ST III, ST IV - really all one film  ST V - not worth owning - the only film between TOS and TNG that I don't own.    I highly recommend this film to Star Trek fans. Here's hoping the Director's Cut is remastered when the Blue Ray edition is released!
0061726826|4.0|I had to skim a lot through this one to get to the meat of the story.  I felt there was just too much unnecessary exposition.  Some may enjoy exposition but I can't stand when a character says a line and then there is a page of information before the other character responds.  I enjoyed the story regardless but a lot of that could have been cut out or reduced.
0763630497|3.0|Rosen, Michael J. 2009. The Cuckoo's Haiku and Other Birding Poems. Somerville: Candlewick. ISBN:  978-07636-3049-2.<br /><br /> Research on children's poetry preferences shows that haikus are one of the least favorite forms of poetry and that children prefer humorous poetry or poetry written about familiar situations (Vardell 75).  With that research in mind, it is understandable that a book of haikus about birds may not interest young children.  This collection of poems, marketed on Amazon as a book for children ages 4-8, did not break the mold that research found. The book is divided by the four seasons, and each haiku is devoted to one bird. In addition to the poem, there is side information about the bird. The side information is in a beautiful scroll type, which is difficult for young children, many of which do not know how to read or write cursive, to decipher. Struggling readers will not invest the time to read the small scroll. So, while the script adds to the whimsical pictures, it does not help students who are curious about the birds. While the pictures in the book are beautiful, vivid watercolors of unique birds and their surroundings, they lack appeal for young children.<br /> March brings the beginning of spring for those in Texas (April for the rest of the country), and for many, it's the first chance in a long time to get outside and feel the warmth of the sun. The haiku entitled \\"Eastern Bluebird\\" reminds the reader that the birds are spring's first song.<br /> \\"On a staff of wires<br /> Blue notes inked from April skies<br /> Truly, spring's first song\\" (Rosen  3).<br /> When spring brings those beautiful crisp afternoons, these poems make for a great break from the classroom. After reading this haiku, the students can take a break outside, enjoying spring's first song, writing about the birds and sounds they hear. Seeing and hearing the birds can spark interest in writing about them, and although most kids do not enjoy haikus, maybe the same beautiful birds that inspired the author will inspire them as well.<br />I reviewed this book for my poetry class at Texas Woman's University.<br />[...]he author will inspire them as well.   I reviewed this book for my poetry class at Texas Woman's University.  [...]
B000089RV6|5.0|By anyones standard a remarkable album- imagine that songs are still being played from this album at sporting events 30 years after it was released- can you think of any other album from any other band where that would be true? And three decades after it was made it does not sound dated at all- it is as fresh and raw as it was in the late summer of 1980. I liked it back then and I love it now- I certainly believe it will most likely go down in history as the greatest rock album ever made by a band the likes of we will never see again. The best ever by the greatest ever- enough said.
0767827791|1.0|Who would want to see Picnic in any other format than WIDESCREEN!!!This movie has not been available in a widescreen edition from Amazon for a LONG TIME......so when I saw they were now selling it I ordered it right away, just assuming it was widescreen. JUST A REMINDER TO CHK FURTHER  DOWN THE PAGE AND READ ALL THE INFO!Hopefully they will accept the return and I'll go on waiting for it to be sold again in the widescreen format.
0374158460|5.0|I thought this novel was something very close to genius -- although it didn't fully deliver.  Franzen went deep, deep into the dark places of the soul in writing this, that's clear. What he came out with was not darkness though, it was light.  There's an aliveness to every one of his characters that is not artificial.  I keep reading that his characters are not believable, which really surprises me.   The characters aren't put together in the conventional way that characters are put together -- the focus is much more internal, the logic of their psychology feels very personal to Franzen and not based on the pop-psychology conventions of motivation standard in most fiction -- but I found that exciting. I also found the way they were put together much truer to life as I have lived it than most of the fiction I have read.      This book is about fame and criticism.  It's also about elitism and elitists' constant fear of the mob mentality they experience or sense emanating from the surrounding masses, the plastic-mindedness of humanity when faced with a threatening situation or perspective (or even a flattering one).  This book feels at once deeply personal, but also defensive -- Franzen definitely was aware it would be judged as a possible great book for all ages.  It's a big book. The title Freedom doesn't really do it justice. It's a bland, big title that means so much it almost means nothing.  The word has so many conflicting connotations it's almost a dead letter. Like the title of the book itself, the book is big and takes on so many themes it can be easy for a reader to be lost -- especially if they think they are reading a different kind of book than they are reading.  But the book is powerfully ambitious and really stretches its arms into the honest-to-God unknown of fiction writing.  This book really strives for genius.  Franzen might not have written the great American novel here, but this book does not mark the ceiling of Franzen's talents -- it's feels likea stepping stone to me.  This book really pushes outward toward greatness.  And it's worth reading to see a great American writer develop more fully.  There's powerful, powerful stuff in this book, but some of it is written as if from one insider to another.  The characters are elitist, the writer is elitist -- guess what, most people are elitist. Almost everybody thinks they are better than everybody else, although we all have different justifications.  That's human nature -- at least the aspect of human nature this book is focused on, which can be a little off-putting.  The book is about competition, integrity, and mass appeal in art and life.   As I said, there's a defensiveness here on Franzen's part and I think that may rub off on many readers.  The nature of celebrity is such that we want to be there on the coat tails of the famous as they go up (and be proud of ourselves for predicting and supporting that person's fame), and when they go down later, we want to spit in their face and watch them die, sanctimoniously enumerating their sin.  We feel proud of our ability to articulate those sins, and we feel we are acting as protectors of the natural order for making sure they are punished for what they stole on their way up.  The book is about this (Richard), and also, I think interestingly, that's what a lot of these reviews are about too.
B004M4VSYW|5.0|This movie is so emotionally and physically intense. It really makes you stop and think, Would I have the courage to do what he did? Would I be emotionally strong enough to survive? Words really can't describe how this movie made me feel. James Franco did an amazing job portraying such an amazing person and his performance truly deserved the Academy Award nomination he received.
1608191664|4.0|Reading the book was a gift. The book to me adequetely explained how the system works - capitalism, socialism, Marxist etc, all in context in to each other.<br /><br />I have read the author's previous book ( Bad Samitians ) and was highly impressed by his academic reference and quotes to its sources. This book removes most of the academic dense, but still ensures gripping content with the necessary proof of validity.<br /><br />There is much skew when an inexperience eye meets the Western world, the book takes chapter by chapter on how it works in the inside. Entertaining and Insightful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|First want to comment on some of the negative remarks I've read here.  Some have said Jillian yells and is too tough, but that is not my perception at all. She is providing an intense workout in a short amount of time and gives lots of encouragement to keep going...not to give in.  I been to basic training and know what being yelled at is like...Jillian is definitely not anything like a drill instructor in this video.  I guess if you want someone to tell you sweetly that it's ok to give up and sit on the couch and cool down to a glass of iced tea, this is not the workout for you.<br /><br />If you are hurting yourself doing any of the exercises, your form is probably to blame.  Jumping jacks should be pretty easy to do for most people (even 400 lbs), but you can modify them by stepping out one foot at a time.  The side lunges can be a bit tricky not to engage the knee so be conscientious to use the targeted muscle groups.  Slow down if your having trouble and just practice your form for the first few sessions without adding the weights.  If you can't complete any particular exercise, like the pushups, just do some jumping jacks or jump rope until that exercise if finished.  Most the exercises are pretty basic and most people should be able to master them.<br /><br />I've just started using this workout and it is tough.  Even though I started going to the gym, I still get an overall better workout with the 30 day shred.  My muscles were screaming at me after my first session.  I have about 40 lbs to lose and feel confident that using this program in my routine will help me meet that goal quickly.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Not PnP but almost. I choose to use Audacity (1.3) instead of the included software since I've been using Audacity to create MP3 ring tones and music snippets. No need to load special drivers as Windows 7 will recognize the turntable as an input sound devise. Win7 will think it's a microphone and Realtek HD audio drivers could care less. If you follow the directions in the manual to set the driver options, you can play your records through the PC system speakers. In my case, a simple 5.1 system but the sound is Great! You can even change the device icon from the default microphone. The point is that you don't need additional drivers or software to play a record. You simply mount a record and press start. You only need software if you want to record/store music from a record. For the price, you get a good quality turntable with USB output. The only fault I found was that the RCA output connections (wires) were fixed and not removable. It would nice to be able to remove the wires, if not used, like the USB connection. Oh yeah, did I mention you can also use this turntable with an amplifier--It has RCA plugs and a phono/line switch. Works perfectly, Great sound, Various connection options AND a Great price. What more could you ask for?
B0014EU5XI|5.0|Been listening to ZZ Top way back even before I got of HighSchool many yr's ago & still loving this band. I had bought the one best of ZZ Top album but lost it over the years. Now just found out this double album best of is out & couldn't be anymore happier with it. I wish they would have put some other tracks from more of their other albums on this but hey can't go wrong with ZZ.
B0029O0BKO|4.0|In all the reviews of this movie no one mentions Rick Zumwalt, the Champ and villain in the movie. He was great! Stallone like Rick's abilities he tried to get his own agent to sign him. No luck there, and a stupid decision. Rick is gone now, he spent many years helping people with problems at the same time he was acting. I was lucky enough to become his friend and miss what more he would have done.
B0026QBKQE|5.0|I could never understand why the actors in this movie did not hit the big time. Virginia Madson is pretty enough to satisfy the most shallow movie buff, but her acting was excellent. \\"Moles\\" (Van Dolen) showed a subtle but wide character range as his character grew. The computer (Cort) was excellent in representing the learning curve and speech patterns of an adolescent AI. They have all been insultingly underutilized in an industry that prefers to mass-produce all too many lemons and reruns.  I don't know any of the actors listed in this Amazon offering, but the original movie and its cast were just that ... original, vastly under-rated, delightful and amusing. Don't scorn the graphics. They may seem primitive today, but they are totally appropriate to this movie, and in context quite lovely. The music is energetic, well chosen and performed, and supports the plot.   It is hard to believe how far technology has come since then, but a remake of this particular movie would be a lost cause. The time of innocence depicted here is gone, the chemistry of the acting and support staff could not be duplicated. This is a gem.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|This movie is every bit as good as everyone says.   James Franco is a remarkable actor, especially when you look at the range of parts he has played.  And his personality on television comes across very enjoyable.    BUT    Amazon's description of what is on the regular DVD is wrong.    The following 'extras' are only on the BluRay disc:    Search & Rescue: Actual events that aided the search and rescue of Aron Ralston  127 Hours: An Extraordinary View - A unique collaboration between the director and actor  Disc 2: Digital Copy    I hope Amazon will correct this error.    I purchased a copy, and the above 'extras' were NOT on the regular DVD.
0060557818|2.0|Dating myself here, Adam West played Batman in the famous '60's TV series.  It was played for laughs, with lots of guest stars and cartoon balloons whenever the (very fake) fighting took place:  Boffo!  Pow!  Whap! Kerplow!  You get the idea.  The villains in this book are just the same.  They're eternal, like most of Gaiman's characters in this book and in American Gods, so they have lots of neat powers.  Here we are \\"treated\\" to regular demonstrations of their sadism, which are repetitive and boring.  Most of the other characters are as shallow as those in any period comic book.  And be forewarned:  just as in American Gods, things are not always as they seem, with characters switching from good to bad.  One wonders if the author has some hangup with  organized religion, since evil abounds in the supposedly godly.    Careful readers of this and American Gods will also note that Gaiman indulges himself by writing about some pretty dark fantasies.  The violence, although pervasive, is thankfully not explicit, and visitors to London might enjoy the frequent references to London Above.  But I've sworn off Gaiman.  I wouldn't risk another book in which a saintly character turned out to be Lucifer, or Machiavelli, or King George the Moron.
B004MMEIK0|5.0|Yes, Roman does need some other expletive besides \\"God's blood!\\" Aside from that minor distraction, I enjoyed this story from beginning to end.    I picked it up as a free kindle download looking for some brain candy while waiting for S. J. Day to crank out another Eve story, but now I'm looking forward to more works in the series.    It contained enough suspense to keep me up late to read \\"just a little more\\" wondering what might be on the next page, and enough dry & dark humor to make it one of the more generally entertaining vampire stories I've come across.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|For those of you Americans still wondering \\"Who is Take That?\\", this album is a great place to start.  It's not the techno glitz of their latest reunion CD with Robbie, but it's a marvelous pop album.  There is not one bad song.  Even the B sides that are not offered like \\"We All Fall Down\\" and \\"Trouble with Me\\" are genius.  Bravo lads!
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time was an excellent book.  Aspies & others across the autism spectrum should be thrilled that Mark Haddon wrote a book from an unusual perspective.  This book helps people have empathy for others who think differently and their dedicated parents as well.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is easily my favorite contemporary movie.  Spoiler alert: some of these reviews have a lot of detail that will impact your viewing.  It's better to go in cold and be shocked like the rest of us were.  Spend some time thinking about the movie and watch it a couple of times before reading the excellent interpretations others have here.<br /><br />This movie is extraordinary.  Don't worry about how the movie began or whether it was always intended to be like this.  Just enjoy it.  The pacing, characters, dialog, scenery, music and plot are all excellent.  When this movie came out, I wasn't yet a fan of David Lynch.  I remember seeing trailers for the movie and not being interested.  I picked up a copy of the movie years after it debuted and I was blown away.<br /><br />This is not a movie you will watch once and forget about.  There are no scenes that feel out of place or could be excluded.  I watched this again with a friend of mine and we had a long discussion after it was over.  A few months later she texts me in the middle of the night with more thoughts about the movie.  It's one of those movies.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 has the feel of a post-apocalyptic film, as certain scenes draw visual comparisons to the harrowing film The Road with Viggo Mortensen. I am very biased since I grew up reading Harry Potter and I feel I have an allegiance to the material that cannot be broken by any means, which basically implies that this review may not be helpful to people who are non-fans. I am a lover of film and noticed this installment's shortcomings; it had a few. There were some editing mistakes I caught onto in a variety of scenes and certain obscurities in the script. However, these were only mild shortcomings, because the film delivered in almost every other respect. For one thing, director David Yates has developed and has almost mastered his craft as a filmmaker. I remember looking back to his debut film Order of the Phoenix, and observing his shaky work. I really enjoyed that HP film, but I felt as though Yates was failing to take the risks necessary to make an epic fantasy film. His choice of camera angles and shots were too self-contained and his lack of establishing shots and scenes was very apparent. In Half-Blood Prince, it was obvious Yates was beginning to realize the artistic appeal of the series, becoming more focused on delivering an emotionally dense and visually rich summer blockbuster rather than just another daft and forgettable special-effects extravaganza. HBP was a huge step in the right direction, even though I felt that the film's major shortcoming was in its inability to render palpable performances from the younger cast. This was probably due to Yates's orders from producers to go in a more \\"romcom\\" direction to compete with the uncomparable and lesser Twilight. It was obvious Yates's strong suit was in directing dramatic scenes, not tender, romantic ones.  Regardless, the film delivered and payed respect to the overall spririt of Rowling's work.     However, now, in Deathly Hallows, Yates delivers in more ways than one.For one thing, he creates a film that does not feel like any of its predecessors: it is dark, gritty, and intense. The characters are no longer in the safe haven that is Hogwarts, they are on the run and keeping out of sight from the evil Lord Voldemort and his loyal minions. In the process, they have to find objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul and destroy them; but they have no one to guide them and only the late Dumbledore's hunch to direct their journey. Many critics and audiences alike complained that the film began very well (showcasing an intense action sequence where an army of Death Eaters chase after Harry and his friends in flight), but then began to drag toward the second act. I completely disagree. If you call allowing a movie time for some breathing room, dragging, then our society really has lost its ability to engage in meaningful entertainment. The second act of the film, though slow-paced, showcases not only the acting talents of the main trio, but also demonstrates how strong their friendship is. No other Harry Potter film has had sufficient time to explore these relationships and character dynamics. Yates even allows room for sexual tension to build up between Harry and Hermione, which adds a unique layer to this movie, and gives audiences a lot to speculate about.     Technically, like Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Part 1 delivers. I am surprised it did not at least get nominated for Best Cinematography. Eduardo Serra's ability to measure the camerawork so that it is shaky enough when it needs to be yet subtle when it is essential, is unparalleled; and Yates's decision to work with Serra makes me respect him even more, because it is obvious Yates is an experimental filmmaker, and he will work with a crew that will help present a vision that is true to the source material. Each of his HP adaptations have had a uniformity in their own right, and each one seems so different. Even technically, there are major differences between Ootp,HBP, and DH Part 1. Just observe the color palettes, the cinematography, the art direction, and the framing. DH is so great because Yates has realized that Rowling's story is about young adults who understand the pangs and experiences of any of us muggles. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are not caricatures of real people; they represent real people, exhibiting emotions that are universal. As a result, the visual style of DH Part 1 is very gritty and immersive, allowing us--the audience--to observe the magical, relevant, and relatable themes occuring on the screen, presented in a way in that the magical world of Harry Potter seems not so different from our own.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I'm a huge fan of David Lynch's movies.  I find that every one I watch has something to offer.  I have seen people refer to this TV series from the 90's and I was curious whether it was worth watching.  I had questions about why would he do only one TV series?  If it was so great, why did it only have two seasons?  I watch a lot of older movies but almost never TV this old.  I don't like a lot of the current TV so would I really enjoy TV from 20 years ago?<br /><br />To answer the above, it was excellent and well worth a purchase.  This reminds me of how I felt about [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]].  I watched it years after the series had ended and was shocked by how good it was.  With Firefly, I felt that the series was consistently excellent.  It was pruned way before its prime.  Twin Peaks had an amazing first season but some points in the second season were a bit of a let down to me.  From what I've read online, it appears that Lynch and company had less of a role in the second season but came back towards the end.<br /><br />I started watching it on a weekend and I couldn't stop.  I fell in love with the characters and the story.  I can see why people still talk about this series 20 years after the making.  This series didn't feel dated at all because you are fully immersed in the world of Twin Peaks.  I still prefer Lynch's movies but don't discount this because it is a TV series.<br /><br />Even though I loved this series and couldn't put it down, I'm struggling to make it through the movie, [[ASIN:B000056BP1 Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me]].  I watched part of it and stopped it which I rarely do in a movie.  It doesn't have the same appeal or feel that the series had.  I may finish the movie at some point, but it was definitely second rate compared to the series.
B004L3AQLU|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie but it did not live up to expectation.  The main characters are so superficial it became painful to sit through the entire movie.  We turned it off after 30 minutes. . . .  Which is really unfortunate as we usually enjoy movies with Miss Hathaway.   This is a definite miss.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an amazing series.  I found the first episode and in some respects the movie [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity (Widescreen Edition)]] to the be slightly less entertaining than the rest.  Otherwise, this was a consistently great series.  I can't even begin to pick a favorite episode.  It is my favorite scifi show.  It's one of the few scifi shows that I have fallen in love with.  I loved the plot and general feel to the series but what sold me were the characters.  You could easily fall in love with this series without being a fan of scifi.<br /><br />About the title of this review...  I have heard lots of people say how great this series was, but I didn't feel like watching it.  A scifi drama?  A soap opera in space?  Really?  I have watched maybe a dozen Star Trek episodes and I think Star Wars is okay.  I liked Farscape and Lexxx was fun.  I wouldn't go out of my way to watch any of those but if it was on I would watch it.  I was putting Firefly into the same category so I didn't feel like watching it.  A friend on the other side of the country kept telling me how I should watch this series and it wasn't like other scifi/fantasy that I have seen in the past.  I didn't give in because I was busy.  In an effort to get me to watch the series, he bought it for me.  Imagine my surprise when this DVD shows up at my place and even more so when I find out just how right he was.  Don't be stubborn like me and make your friends find a way to get you to watch it.  Go watch this series!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|When something has Joss Whedon, Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, I have to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough.  The plot, characters and music were all hilarious.

0061997811|5.0|This book is great. It has a lot of new information, and it's well-written and funny. Also the layout is great.   The only thing I didn't like, was that it doulc have had some more stuff in it. For example the Graveyard scene in Goblet of Fire. It would have been interesting to know, how they did that.

B0043CJ8AY|5.0|If you consider yourself a fan of Maroon 5, then you should definitely get this album. I saw them in concert back in October '10 and they performed a few of the songs and it was incredible! They're back in full force on 'Hands All Over'. Adam said in an interview that 'It Won't Be Soon Before Long' wasn't a very fun album and it's true, I didn't enjoy it much. In my opinion, it was very forgettable. 'Hands All Over' is entirely listenable, enjoyable, full of dance-worthy, 'feel-good' tracks. My favorites are:<br /><br />Give A Little More<br />Never Gonna Leave This Bed<br />I Can't Lie<br />Hands All Over<br />How<br />Get Back In My Life<br />Just A Feeling<br />Runaway<br /><br />Of course, 'Songs About Jane' is their best album, it's a classic in my book and if you loved that one...you'll definitely like this album. If 'It Won't Be Soon Before Long' is your favorite Maroon 5 album, I'm not quite sure this effort will impress you as much. Just my two cents, guys. Enjoy!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon never fails. Probably the best thing to come out during the writer's strike of 2008. Just buy it, Nathan, Neil, and Felica are brilliant and will make you laugh and tug at your heartstrings.

One of the best new comedies of last season. This DVD has everything you want that you don't usually get on other DVDs. There are tons of extras; commentaries, gag reel, name it, it's on there. A must-have for every TV junkies collection.
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse-5 is a semibiographical fiction satire about a bewildered war veteran named Billy Pilgrim.  Throughout the novel he struggles to find meaning in his life and in the senseless and cruel war that he lived through. Through this novel Vonnegut found a way to describe his horrible experiences in WWII, but does so in a pleasant and humorous way and I give him a lot of credit for that.       After reading chapter one I have to admit I didn't have high hopes for this book. In it Vonnegut talks about his preparation and the difficulty he had writing this book mixed in with some biographical information. Most of chapter 1 seemed very random and sounded like the ramblings of an old drunken man, but the book definitely improved as I read on. Many of the seemingly random details revealed in chapter 1 were, to my surprise, worked into the storyline in subsequent chapters.     There is also a sci-fi element in this book: Billy Pilgrim \\"has become unstuck in time\\" and time travels. The story jumps back and forth through time with him, it is not told linearly. Although moments of his life before and after the war are not told in order, his war experiences are basically in order, so it's not confusing. The aliens who abduct him cause the time travel Billy experienced. These aliens, the Tralfamadorians, have interesting philosophies on the nature of time and death. They believe \\"All moments, past, present, and future, always existed, and always will exist.\\"    The narrator says, \\"so it goes\\" after each death, which is obviously some kind of statement about death, but it gets annoying after a while since a lot of people die in this novel. It is almost as if he kills people off in the book just so he can say \\"so it goes.\\"    The parts of the book that are loosely based on Vonnegut's life are about his WWII experiences, told as a third-person narrative using Billy. In the novel Billy is drafted and goes to fight in the Battle of the Bulge and is quickly separated from hisunit behind enemy lines.  Lost, confused, and close to freezing to death he is saved by a delusional soldier named Weary. Weary refers to himself and the other two soldiers he is with as the three musketeers. He romanticizes war and views himself a hero who is on a mission from God to win the war. When I read about this character I am reminded of our media that glorifies war, constantly praises the troops, and acts as if war is the only option to deal with our \\"evil\\" enemies. They never tell you the perspectives of our enemies, show you pictures of the dead civilians, or reveal the brutality of war and the destruction it leaves in its wake. Vonnegut may not have been referring to the media in this chapter, but that's the wonderful thing about books: you can take themes from them and apply them to observations made in your own life.     Billy witnesses the brutality and senselessness of war first hand. As a prisoner of war he is always starving and cold. On a crowded train to a POW camp Billy is forced to sleep standing up \\"self-crucified\\" in the corner of the freight car.  Vonnegut discusses the hypocrisy of soldiers committing needless, evil atrocities, while at the same time being proud of themselves for fighting evil. One of the hardest things Vonnegut has had to live with was the unnecessary bombing of the beautiful city of Dresden, by the Americans, that killed 130,000 people, mainly civilians. He was in Dresden as a POW and lived through the bombing and tells of his experience using Billy.      Other parts in this book deal with Billy's postwar life. By all accounts he is living the American dream: he has a successful career, money, a wife and kids, material possessions, yet he is unhappy. He struggles to find meaning in life and seems like a confused and empty person.      While I don't think this book is quite 5 star material, it is still an entertaining, fast read. It is not an overly challenging book that I would recommend for teenagers as well as adults.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Aaron's Sorkin's screenplay, based on the 2009 non-fiction book 'The Accidental Billionaires', attempts to turn Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, into the 'Citizen Kane' of the computer generation. Like 'Kane', it's the chronicle of the rise of a boy genius to the heights of power, who is a dogged by a character flaw. The question in both films is whether each of the protagonists truly has an 'Achilles heel' that tarnishes their legacy or is it some sort of unconscious jealousy on the part of the films' scenarists who seek to drag these boy wonders down from their high perch in order to take them down a peg or two in the public eye?<br /><br />As an only occasional user of Facebook, I hold no implicit disdain for the social networking site that Mark Zuckerberg created. I've noticed that some internet posters hate Facebook so much that they refuse to be objective about the film. If they were honest, they would recognize that the material the film is based on, is difficult to make into a compelling film. 'The Social Network' IS dry material and veteran director David Fincher has managed to turn this story into something that moves along at a fairly brisk pace. I also wonder why some posters find the subject matter, not to be worthy enough to be made into a feature length film. Certainly the way in which Zuckerberg rises to the top as the world's youngest billionaire, to my mind, is a compelling enough subject to merit the attention of the average film goer.<br /><br />Sorkin's technique is to tell Zuckerberg's story as a double flashback: the two alternating depositions in which a bored looking Zuckerberg must give testimony at. First is the Winklevoss brothers' lawsuit, fellow students at Harvard who claimed Zuckerberg ripped off their original idea for a Facebook-like platform. The other lawsuit is instituted at the behest of Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former friend, who provided some small start-up capital in the early days of their business venture together.<br /><br />While I was overjoyed that Jesse Eisenberg finally got to play a role where he wasn't a geeky good guy, as 'The Social Network' moves along, his performance as Mark Zuckerberg becomes a bit one-note. It's really not Eisenberg's fault since the script calls for him to play Zuckerberg as both the manic overachiever and sullen bad boy who basically remains the same throughout the narrative (the real Zuckerberg doesn't see himself worthy as a dramatic character--he's quoted as saying, in substance, that he spent most of his time writing computer code during those heady days). A bit more interesting is Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) who gets to emote a lot more, especially after he discovers that his best friend and partner has ripped him off royally! (Garfield's Eduardo also collects a few laughs when he attempts to deal with a girlfriend who will not change her mind about dumping him).<br /><br />What 'The Social Network' really comes down to is our verdict on Zuckerberg's moral character. And in my opinion, that verdict must be a mixed one. Certainly, the Winklevoss part of the lawsuit seemed to me to be without merit. In the end, we find out they prevailed to the tune of $65 million but did Zuckerberg really copy any of their ideas? They may have had the same concept but web pages are all in the details--and it was Zuckerberg who came up with all the unique ideas. As for Saverin, Zuckerberg probably would not have become successful if he took the cautious advice of his business partner. By seeking out the wild and unpredictable Napster founder Sean Parker (who Saverin couldn't stomach at all), Zuckerberg found a partner who truly had the connections to make things happen. Nonetheless, the way in which Zuckerberg and his new business associates 'tricked' Saverin, was reprehensible. Saverin counted Zuckerberg as a friend and Zuckerberg took advantage of this fact because he knew Saverin would never read the fineprint of the contract he was signing. Zuckerberg was right about one thing: Saverin, as a successful Harvard business student, should have read the fine print and hired an attorney to go over the contract he was about to sign.<br /><br />In Citizen Kane, Orson Welles offers up the image of 'Rosebud', a childhood keepsake which symbolized the loss of love for the film's protagonist. Here, in 'The Social Network', Sorkin serves up Zuckerberg's 'Rosebud' as something much more mundane: a college sweetheart who rejected him. The audience gets to have their 'Rosebud' moment when Zuckerberg tries to send a Facebook friend request to his lost love. In an earlier scene in a restaurant, Zuckerberg can't bring himself to apologize for his crude blogging when he was a student at Harvard, and ends up begging his ex to join him in a private tete-a-tete where presumably he'll try to rationalize his behavior once again. It's a long stretch to suggest that Zuckerberg's occasional sour disposition is all due to his rejection by an ex-girlfriend. The implication is that this is the one thing Zuckerberg can't have--and it consumes him (just as Kane/Hearst pines for the lack of love in his childhood).<br /><br />'The Social Network' is no masterpiece as some have maintained here on the internet. It's really a workmanlike story chronicling the machinations of a driven overachiever who becomes insanely successful in our new computer age. Mark Zuckerberg's story is certainly worth watching at least once. If I do see this film again, I'll be sure to concentrate on the technical aspects since I'm quite satisfied that I've already absorbed most of the major plot points and internal/external arcs of the principal characters.Zuckerberg was right about one thing: Saverin, as a successful Harvard business student, should have read the fine print and hired an attorney to go over the contract he was about to sign.

0670022411|1.0|I am halfway through this book and NOTHING of consequence has actually happened to develop any kind of compelling plot. If you've read the synopses on this web-page, and any of the other reviews that readers have posted, I will skip the details and just get to the point:    Ms. Harkness is torn between writing a modern-day bodice-ripper/romance novel and a lifestyle column out of Better Homes and Gardens or Martha Stewart Living. Her endless and pointless descriptions of furnishings, meals eaten (or not), heirloom wines drunk (or not), riding boots that fit like a glove without benefit of personal contact with the boot maker - Lord, I could go on and on! They not only tax the reader's patience but they drag the almost non-existent plot into realms of the ridiculous. These characters are just so boring and boilerplate I thought that I was reading \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction with the names of the protagonists changed to avoid copyright infringement! So what if the author is able to write about the history of scientific thought and can quote Latin, Italian, and Occitan (old French spoken in the district of Clermont-Ferrand, an area that I have actually spent considerable time visiting). Anyone with access to Google could do likewise. There is so little of a story here that I am amazed that her publisher allowed this to go to press (and just think of the hundreds and hundreds of pages resulting from poor, wasted trees!).     The big question here is (if you care, which I doubt): Are vampires, demons (sorry - I will not use the affected spelling Ms. Harkness imposes on her readers), witches, and humans four separate species, or are they all one? Duh? I ASK YOU - WHO CARES??? I for one am sick to death of people writing about vampires and making them as human (read, loveable) as possible. If you're going to do so, then at least do something inventive or clever with them. Ms. Harkness is reduced to describing her vampire protagonist as looking \\"like a prince,\\" dressed in the latest Italian sportswear, and wallowing in every worn-out cliche in the English language. As for Diana Bishop, the so-called teller of the tale, one is supposed to believe that an intelligent woman who has been able to earn a Ph.D. from Yale, has a teaching fellowship at Oxford, and is a rather good athlete to boot, is incapable of understanding her own inherent magical abilities or learning to dress like an adult. Please, give me a break!    If you're going to write a book called \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" then please, WRITE ABOUT WITCHES! Not vampires! We already are inundated with the genre!     Do yourself a favor and, as they used to say in those great early talkies, \\"give it the air!\\" Read \\"Angelology\\" if you want a gripping novel about the supernatural that is not only well-written but doesn't insult your intelligence as well.
030745455X|1.0|The second book is even worse than the first one.  I thought the first book was okay, but predictable and seriously overrated, with shallow, unbelievable characterizations.  The second book is a ridiculous, slow-moving, clich&eacute;-ridden pile of dung.  If you weren't that impressed with the first one and you value your reading time, I would not bother with the second one at all unless you are trying to punish yourself for some grievous wrongdoing.  This book isn't just bad, it's putrid.<br /><br />One apparently intoxicated British reviewer described Larsson's writing as \\"galloping prose.\\"  Galloping prose, huh?  Within 20 pages of the end of the book and the supposed d&eacute;nouement of the thoroughly ludicrous \\"plot,\\" here is a sample of Larsson's thrilling writing (from the British edition):  \\"When he got to the car there was no map in the glove compartment.  He bought one in a petrol station, and a torch, and a bottle of mineral water, and a take-away coffee, and he put the paper cup in the holder on the dashboard.\\"  Are you on the edge of your seat yet?  Add to that endless descriptions of the now invincible genius Salander sitting (on her Ikea furniture) and thinking while she smokes cigarettes after eating something called Billy's Pan Pizza, more descriptions of Blomkvist eating sandwiches, and Salander calling everyone a pig and a bastard, plus a cast of other thoroughly forgettable goodies and baddies having the same conversations about the same topics, and you are in the for the bore fest of a lifetime.  If bad writing and boredom are your things, go for it.
006112429X|4.0|\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" explores a disturbing question:  Who -- if anyone -- is to blame for a child gone wrong?  Is it the fault of poor parenting?  A bad environment?  Or are some children just born bad?  In this fascinating and harrowing book, Lionel Shriver takes us inside the home of the Plaskett-Khatchadourian family, an upper-middle-class couple whose son, Kevin, seems to have been spawned from some especially malignant demon.<br /><br />As the book opens, Eva Khatchadourian, Kevin's mother, is visiting Kevin in a juvie jail where he has been sentenced for killing seven classmates, a teacher who believed in him, and a school cafeteria worker.  Except for the cafeteria worker, who is collateral damage, Kevin has planned this rampage with ruthless skill and cunning.  He made sure to do the deed before his sixteenth birthday, because he knows if he is tried and found guilty he will be sent to a juvenile facility instead of an adult prison.<br /><br />In a series of letters written to her estranged husband Franklin, Eva takes us back to their early relationship when they were a happy although seemingly mis-matched couple.  He's a Republican America-Right-Or-Wrong, she's a Democrat The-World-Is-My-Home.  She has a great job as the founder and head of a company that publishes books on how to see the world on a shoestring budget.  But he wants a family.  Grudgingly, she agrees.  But when she finds she is actually pregnant, she literally almost faints with disgust.  This pretty much sets the tone for her ensuing relationship with the son she never wanted.<br /><br />To give Eva her due, though, Kevin is a child who would try the soul of a saint.  From the moment he is spat out of Eva's womb, he hates the world and everything in it.  He refuses his mother's milk.  He doesn't want her to hold him.  He goes through a whole series of nannies and nurses who can't deal with his endless tantrums and acting out.  He hates other children.  He hates everybody.  He never connects emotionally with anyone.  His father, overly compensating for what he sees as Eva's rejection, enables his son's behavior, never holding him responsible for anything he does.  Kevin responds by treating his father with total contempt.  He thinks Franklin is a tool.  In fact, everyone is a tool to Kevin, just there to be used and cast aside.  The one person he may have a modicum of respect for is his mother, for even while he hates her as he hates everyone else, at least she's not willfully blind to what he is.  But in an act of transcendental lunacy, against her husband's wishes, and probably to compensate for spewing such a monster into the world and wanting to show she can get it right, Eva gives birth to a second child.  Knowing how Kevin treats everyone he comes into contact with, the reader has to wonder what in the world was Eva thinking about, bringing an innocent baby into the house to be another target of Kevin's spite and malevolence.  It's not as if she's as clueless as Franklin; Eva has for years been able to see Kevin as he is.<br /><br />But not quite.  Even Eva isn't prepared for Kevin's rampage at the school, nor the events immediately preceding it which are even more shocking than the mass killing itself.  Eva doesn't know who to blame.  How much responsibility is hers, for never having wanted or loved Kevin?  How much is Franklin's, for enabling Kevin?  And finally, how much responsibility is Kevin's?  Is this a child who would have gone wrong no matter how good an upbringing he had?  Possibly.  Because although parents can teach their child right from wrong, they can't force a child to grow a conscience if he doesn't have one, and Kevin doesn't have a conscience or any sense of remorse for his actions.  In fact, one wonders if Kevin has a soul.<br /><br />In a book that is going to disturb a lot of readers, Shriver explores and gives a new twist to the ancient themes of nature vs. nurture, unwanted and unwelcome parenthood, and the innocence -- or lack of it -- of childhood.  This is not an easy book to read, in the sense that some of it is so disturbing that we just wish it would go away, and yet it's almost impossible to put down.  The reader lurches from one crisis to the next thinking nothing worse can be around the corner or down the line, only to find that there is infinitely worse ahead.  We see three people caught up in a deadly game where nobody can come out the winner.  And Kevin, for all his soulless bravado, ultimately has to look inside himself and recoil at the gaping emptiness confronting him.  If this kid had been been able to decide for himself whether or not to be born, this reader is pretty certain he would probably have chosen not.<br /><br />Judy Lindhis is not an easy book to read, in the sense that some of it is so disturbing that we just wish it would go away, and yet it's almost impossible to put down.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|this is one of the best reads i have had in awhile. as someone who has struggled with eating issues for many years, i felt portia's depiction of annorexia and bulemia was spot on. having always admired derossi as an actress, i was pleasantly surprised at her writing skills. bravo to her as a writer and more importantly as a beautiful survivor who has found her own truth. i hope to see many more books by her in the future.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I always say a singer is only as good as they are live and John Mayer is pretty awesome live.  He does a rendition of Free Fallin (Tom Petty) and it is amazing.  Also the song Keep Me Where the Light Is is a favorite off this album.<br />Worth the money if you are a John Mayer fan.
0307595579|5.0|I received this trilogy as a gift. I had heard a lot about it but had yet to pick it up myself. I don't need to go into too much detail as it has been extensively reviewed. Sometimes I question anything that has a large amount of hype. With this trilogy, the hype is well founded. I loved it. This is a great set and the price is right so if you have been thinking about hitting up this trilogy, go for it! You even get a bonus book with it.
B00436GNVC|2.0|I only like one song on this album.  Well, Well, Well.<br />It was such a disappointment because her first album was quite fantastic.<br />I wouldn't spend the money on the full album, maybe an Mp3 or two.  Or on sale.
B000B589JI|5.0|I've had it for about a month. So far it has held a full tank without leaking one little bit. It holds enough for a six hour hand warmer, and my peanut lighter. No real cons. The fuel tends to drip out, which can make refilling my hand warmer take a few extra minutes, but I guess the minute or two extra is worth not spilling lighter fluid all over. A great way to keep some extra fuel for my hand warmer when I'm going to be out a little longer than expected.

And her albums kind of went down hill.  Mind you there are good songs on this album but some feel forced, like she needed to put out an album lets see what we can slam out.  Gypsy is a good song with a light spirit on this album.

They're small and easy to fit in her mouth but I don't have to be scared that she'll swallow it because it is secured around her wrist with velcro. They are very soft, and the bright colors are fun to look at too. It's amazing to watch her use one hand to pull the other hand closer to her mouth in order to suck on the little ladybug's head. So cute!<br />And since they're fabric I can throw them in the wash every few days when they get really slobbery and gross.<br />I might even buy extras in case we lose the one's she's got. They are better than most of the other toys we have!
0670022411|2.0|The Montagues and the Capulets.  The Jets and the Sharks.  The witches and the vampires?  Yes, it's Romeo and Juliet all over again in Deborah Harkness's lukewarm debut.<br /><br />Harkness has invented a world with four types of humanoid \\"creatures.\\"  As the main character states, \\"Witches aren't the only creatures sharing the world with humans, however.  There are also daemons--creative, artistic creatures who walk a tightrope between madness and genius.  `Rock stars and serial killers' was how my aunt described these strange, perplexing beings.  And there are vampires, ancient and beautiful, who feed on blood and will charm you utterly if they don't kill you first.\\"  These more exotic creatures live amongst us, and mostly they just skate through life trying not to attract attention.  In fact, other than painfully repetitious admonitions to not attract their attention, the humans really aren't a part of this tale at all.<br /><br />Witches, it seems, have a natural affinity for the humanities, whereas vampires are drawn to math and science.  Our two protagonists are true to their natures.  Our Juliet stand-in is Dr. Diana Bishop, scion of one of the most powerful and respected witch families.  She's a tenured Yale professor, a historian of science and alchemy, spending a year at Oxford.  She is also a witch who has made a nearly life-long practice of stifling her magic, although she cheats on very rare occasions when convenience trumps long habit.<br /><br />It is a witnessed act of illicit magic that provides the required meet-cute for our star-crossed lovers.  Our Romeo is Dr. Matthew Clairmont: tall, dark, handsome, vampire, scientist.  (Not to mix my literary metaphors, but he is a veritable Mr. Darcy of a vampire, and when the film is made I insist that Colin Firth is cast.)  Matthew, along with a host of other creatures, has his eyes glued to Diana Bishop because she has managed to do what no one has done for hundreds of years.  Without realizing the significance, she has called up a most powerfully enchanted and widely desired manuscript, which she just as blithely returns to the library's stacks.  Now there's all kinds of interest in both the manuscript and Diana, and there is danger in the air--though that may be due to the constant proximity of this vampire.<br /><br />One thing Harkness does get right in the first half of the novel is an intriguing mood of fear and eroticism.  I found it compelling, and it kept me turning the pages.  And turning the pages.  And turning the pages.  After a while, this book began to seem interminable.  At one point near the end, Matthew says to Diana, \\"At first I was sure this was about the manuscript.  Then I supposed it was all about you.  Now I'll be damned if I can figure what it's about.\\"<br /><br />Um, Matthew, let me help you out.  It's about race relations and a plea for tolerance.  It's about alternate lifestyles and marriage equality and a plea for acceptance.  These are issues about which I care deeply, yet I still found Harkness's message unsubtle and banal.  Her use of language is quotidian at best.  Her romance fizzles somewhere along the way.  Once our lovers get together they're far less interesting.  I find her magical landscape to be utterly lacking in... magic.<br /><br />Still, the novel was plodding it way towards a three-star review.  I'm a generous rater, and there were aspects of the story that interested me, such as the dynamics of Matthew's vampire family.  As the stakes of the novel grew and headed towards an inevitable confrontation, I found myself wondering how Harkness could possibly wrap things up in the remaining pages.  It never occurred to me that she wouldn't.<br /><br />That's right, folks.  I dragged my little eyes through 600 pointlessly drawn out pages only to discover that this book has absolutely no resolution!  It ends on a cliff-hanger!  I struggled through this mess to get to an end that never came.  And THAT is unforgivable.  God knows how many volumes Ms. Harkness has planned, but I doubt I'll give her any more of my precious reading time.'ll give her any more of my precious reading time.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|The set is great! It shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. The colors are vibrant and they look great hanging from hooks in my kitchen. They are hefty (weighted in the handle) and feel very sturdy. There's nothing about them to indicate that they'll suffer from repeated machine washing, but I don't intend to test that.  They are gentle on my pots and pans and show no signs of warping from heat, although I haven't had them all that long.  Some warning about the elevate feature: It works, keeping the business end of the utensil off the countertops, which is a huge plus for food safety. However, they will still drip sauce/grease onto your counter, so laying a paper towel over your working surface is a good idea. Also, if you have a utensil covered in a very thick sauce, it may be heavy enough to counterweight the handle and flop onto the counter. You'll need to shake off a good portion of the sauce before setting the utensil down.  Update: Four years later, I'm still using these daily. There's some obvious wear and tear, but nothing that's brought them past the point of usability. I brought a few items from the set on a camping trip, and the elevate feature was pretty useful when trying to cook over a campfire with no food safe surface to lay my tools on. A rock was good enough.

1597801585|2.0|I was very excited to read this book and had heard wonderful things about it.  It was a creative book but hard to get through.  I listened to this on audio book which probably didn't help any; the audio book was very deliberately read making the story move even slower.  I ended up stopping listening to this book about 2/3rds of the way through; it was just too tedious.<br /><br />The story goes between four main characters.  The first is a genetic scientist, a calorie man, named Anderson who is scouring the city to find its mysterious Seed Bank; he is masquerading as a plant owner.  The second is Tan Hock Seng an aging Chinese Yellow Card who is trying to make a life for himself and gain back his former glory.  The third is a wind up girl named Emiko who has been forced to work in a brothel after being sold to it by her Japanese master.  The fourth is Jaidee, an officer of the Environmental Ministry and a revolutionist, who is determined to take back Thailand from the foreigners.  In this depressing version of Thailand, a land where calories are the greatest commodity, these four characters will eventually influence not only each other but the fate of the whole country.<br /><br />First I will say there are some good things about this book.  The ideas present in the book are fabulous.  The idea of calories being more important than anything after viruses have wiped out most vegetation is unique and compelling.  The story is told with wonderful description; such that, as a reader, you can almost feel the heat and smell the smells of the city.  Those were the things that kept me reading this book as long as I did.<br /><br />Now for the rest of the things.  The characters (if you can even say they have enough humanity to call them characters) are very dry, they apparently don't have many feelings and kind of just stumble through the story.  There are no good characters in this book, they are despicable for different reasons.  I did not enjoy a single one of them.  Emiko was my favorite, but the passivity she showed at letting herself being constantly raped and tortured was a real turn off.  Which I should mention there are multiple scenes where Emiko is explicitly raped and humiliated; again not my favorite thing to read about.<br /><br />The pace is horribly slow.  For example let's say Anderson is going to walk from point A to point B, can he do that?  No, he must go on a 30 minute (remember I was listening to this) dissertation on his history, the history of other things possibly irrelevant to the story, etc etc.  Then finally many mind-boggling minutes later, when you have finally forgotten what the heck was even going on, he will make it to his destination.<br /><br />I also have a quibble about the writing style; it is very dry.  At times this came across more as a biography of the characters than a story.  It was tough to stay engaged with either the story or the characters.  I am aware that all of these little random events were probably leading up to something fantastic or mind-boggling...unfortunately I ceased to care about any of it.  This audio book seriously put me to sleep while I was driving, it was becoming a hazard to my health (and other drivers) so I had to stop listening to it.<br /><br />Something written in this type of analytical style would have made an intriguing short story, but as a full-length book it was just too tedious to get through.<br /><br />Overall I did not enjoy this.  The characters were depressing, the pace excruciating, and the world demoralizing.  I may read future short stories by Bacigalupi since I find his ideas intriguing, but I will not be picking up any more full-length books by him.the passivity she showed at letting herself being constantly raped and tortured was a real turn off.

0553382152|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I would recommend that anyone of any faith read it. Her words were true you could just feel it and I found myself wanting to be a better person with each page that I read. My dad passed away a couple of years ago and I was recommended the book \\"The Message\\" and it was fantastic. A few of my friends have had one of their parents' pass away and I always sent them \\"The Message.\\" However, with reading \\"Embraced By The Light\\" I have found the new book I will be sending to those who have lost a loved one.  This book was inspiring, comforting, and really gave me peace.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Hahaha... I don't think there is much more I can add to the title of my review. As a movie that was made because of the uproar of fans, Joss Whedon did an amazing job pulling together all the elements of the tv show, trying to tie up some of the loose ends, and making a great run of it. Granted, by watching the series first, you're a little more drawn in by it, but even on it's own, it's an amazing movie. If you want something a little more intellectually stimulating than Star Wars, this is the film for you!
0670022411|2.0|Dr. Diana Bishop, descendant of the famous Bridget Bishop of Salem, Massachusetts, turned her back on her natural powers after her parents were killed when she was a child. Instead, she relied on her brain power, went to Oxford and Yale, and became a well-known researcher in the field of history of science. Now she's back at Oxford, spending the year studying old alchemical texts archived at the Bodleian Library. But when she calls the book known as Ashmole 782 from the stacks, she can feel its power and she can see hidden writing moving on its pages. It frightens her a bit and she notices that soon after returning it to the stacks, she's attracted the attention of many creatures -- vampires, daemons, and other witches -- who are suddenly hanging around the Bodleian. One vampire in particular, Matthew Clairmont, an attractive professor of biochemistry and neuroscience, just won't leave her alone. What is so special about Ashmole 782 and why are all these creatures hoping she'll call it back?<br /><br />After reading the blurbs about A Discovery of Witches, this was a book I was eagerly waiting for. I love academic settings (especially Oxford), old libraries, and the blend of history and science. And I did enjoy much of A Discovery of Witches for this reason. Diana Bishop is an urban fantasy heroine that I can relate to. She spends her time in libraries instead of tattoo parlors; she prepares lectures and writes letters of recommendation instead of training with weapons and kicking peoples' butts. I understood her goals and interests and the way that her focus on academic pursuits makes her slightly awkward and absent-minded elsewhere. I was also much intrigued by Matthew Clairmont's genetic research into the evolution of witches, vampires, and daemons and how this related to Diana's research in alchemy.<br /><br />Thus, A Discovery of Witches had a lot of potential for me, but there were three problems that sapped my enjoyment:<br /><br />The first is that the book is simply way too long. With nearly 600 pages to work with, Deborah Harkness should have been able to get these interesting ideas farther off the ground. I was frustrated that, by the end, it had become clear that A Discovery of Witches is the first novel in a series. In this first installment, Harkness carefully develops the characters and sets up the romance. There is a lot of sitting in the library, hanging around various houses, talking, drinking tea, and eating. The story covers only about a month of time and I think I witnessed nearly everything Diana ate and drank during that month.<br /><br />Secondly -- and this is a common problem for me in urban fantasies -- I couldn't appreciate the romance which dominated the plot. Vampires are just not sexy to me and I had a hard time believing that an overprotective, angry, admittedly murderous vampire would be attractive to an independently-minded academic. Not to mention that his body is cold and his heart beats only rarely. He spends a lot of time growling, bossing her around, speaking roughly, giving everyone dark looks, and displaying mate-guarding behaviors -- steering her around by her elbow and with his hand at the small of her back, hovering over her, blocking her path, pushing her up against barriers, \\"scooping\\" her up, tossing her on horses, grabbing her by the chin and twisting her neck, telling her she'll catch cold if she sits on the ground (a guy who sequences DNA thinks that sitting on the ground will make her sick?). He even binds her with an oath without her permission. I find this kind of behavior in a courting male insufferable. This is a common problem for me, and one of the reasons I don't read much vampire lit, but I wasn't expecting to encounter this issue in such magnitude in a book about a famous researcher from Oxford and Yale. I know she's scared of what's going on in her life, but where is this woman's self-respect? In some ways, A Discovery of Witches felt like Twilight for middle-aged academics. The most unbelievable part of the entire romance, though is that [removed spoiler -- please visit my website.]<br /><br />Thirdly, there are a lot of minor plot issues that just don't fit into a well-developed fantasy, especially once we leave the academic atmosphere of Oxford and the book starts to feel like Harry Potter. Magic in this world seems arbitrary. We're told that each power has a genetic marker, which is cool, but its practice is not sufficiently explained. It's the snap-your-fingers-to-clean-the-dishes, close-your-eyes-and-concentrate-to-fly type. Sparks fly from Diana's fingers, she cries rivers of tears, witchfire bursts from her outstretched arm. She is suddenly accumulating a host of new skills that make her the most powerful witch alive, but she doesn't respond with the awe we'd expect. When she finds out that she can time-travel, she practically shrugs it off (and the physics of time-travel don't even try to make sense).<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the first part of A Discovery of Witches -- the relatable heroine, the university setting, the focus on the history of science. But once the romance got going and we left Oxford, A Discovery of Witches lost its charm. I'm still curious about the blend of genetics, evolution, and alchemy, but the long sick romance dominated this intriguing mystery and the plot could not hold up against it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I haven't watched this show in a long time, but I just ordered the blu-ray discs, and I can't wait for them to show up! I remember this show fondly, watching them with a friend of mine who introduced me to them while I was in the military. I'd race back to the barracks every day so we could pop in the next disc and watch another few episodes before crashing for the day. \\"Firefly\\" occupies a special nitch that I don't think any other show has ever truly been able to achieve. Not only is it a combination of science fiction meets western (think Star Wars meets The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly), it's the perfect combination of humor, drama, and action - not too much of any of them, just a great mix of all three. I would rate this a 7 out of 5 if it'd let me!
B0044XV3R8|1.0|I would give the original 5 stars, but the extra stuff is boring and many of the the deleted scenes are stupid. They only made this so they could get more money, not to entertain the viewers.
091581112X|5.0|Words could only begin to describe how insightful this book is. This book has helped remind me why it is important to have a connection with your higher self. The following is some of the helpful information contained in this book regarding the higher self (I am directly listing the written information that I found very healing in this book):<br /><br />1) The \\"Connecting with the Universal Mind\\" (chapter 3 pgs. 28-36) contains information that explains why the Universal Mind creates what you think about. I really appreciate some of the helpful and transformational information included in this chapter such as:<br />1)You can have everything you want that serves your higher good.<br />2)The more expansive your thoughts, the more expansive the reality your create.<br />3)Your imagination transcends this dimension and connects with the Universal Mind where anything is possible.<br />4) It was extremely healing to me when I saw the following on page 34: Don't accept your current circumstances as the best you'll ever have. Don't believe people when they tell you something is impossible to create. When you know how to create with energy and light anything is possible.<br />5)Believe in your success, Picture yourself having what you want.<br /><br />I am very lucky in my life, and I have an abundance of blessings to be appreciative of. However, I must admit that I also really enjoyed the \\"Allowing Your Higher Good\\" section of this book (chapter 10, pages 98-104). I know that this may sound unconventional, but it was as if my higher self guided me to really be aware of what is written in this chapter. The following are some very powerful statements that resonated with my spirit:<br />1)No matter what happens, tell yourself the universe is perfect, and everything that happens is perfect. If something you were hoping for doesn't happen, know that something even better will.<br />2)Allow people to be any way they want to be.<br />3)You can allow things into your life more easily when you let any form work.<br />4)Learn to recieve all the good things your higher self has to give you.<br />5)The following written statement in this chapter really opened my eyes very much (it is on page 99)People who have abundance, loving relationships, and happiness are not more deserving or better than you. They simply allow more good things into their life.<br /><br />  A very strong and persuasive case is made in this powerful book as to why it is important to work on connecting with and being your higher self on page 72 of the \\"Moving into Higher Consciousness\\" chapter: Your clairvoyant abilities will increase as you become your higher self.<br /><br />  There is so much more helpful and transformational details contained in \\"Spiritual Growth: Being Your Higher Self\\". I have only presented an exciting preview sampler. I felt guided to share how I feel about this book because recent events in my life encouraged me to be aware of being in touch with my higher self. In addition, being aware of your higher self is essential if you have ever had to be self-reliant. A great companion guide to this wonderful book would be \\"Ask Your Guides\\" by Sonia Choquette. Like Sanaya Roman, Sonia Choquette has also helped me to be aware of my higher self (she even has a chapter on your higher self in her \\"Ask Your Guides\\" book). Overall, in summary I am appreciative to Sanaya Roman for publishing this very beautiful and unique book. I intend to reference this book for many years to come because of the very magical and mind expanding writing of this book.

B003L45JLW|5.0|A long overdue Recording and in BluRay! The 5.1 mix here is stellar. Listen to it on a great surround sound system. I'm still getting used to this new material. I'm partial to music/ concerts recorded in full blown surround sound. Tom Petty discs speak for themselves. This band is tight.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|The product arrived quicker than expected in great shape-fine quality! Would order from this company again when the time comes. Great price/great quality. DNC.
B000J103WA|4.0|One of the greatest powergroups from the 60's, 70's. Eric Clapton vocals & guitars, Jack Bruce lead singer & Bass; Ginger Baker, legendary drummer. Let's face it; Bruce & Ginger are looking pretty old. They still sound very good; but not great. I'm not a big fan of Clapton's singing. Takes you back 40 years. No new material, so don't expect a follow up. I guess they just wanted to see if they could still do it, and pad their retirement funds.  (not that Claspton neede it). For many years, these guys weren't exactly friends. The distance caused a lot of animosity, and little or no communication. A better BluRay disc is Clapton & Winwood: Live from Madison Square Garden: Great performance from two ol' buddies from Blind Faith.
B004MMEIK0|3.0|I got this one free and did enjoy reading it.  I found that the first half (more or less) was extremely funny and I caught myself laughing out loud a few times.  The second half was not so good, or so humorous (in fact, it was rather trite).  There was some information presented over and over again to the point where it became tedious, as others have said in their reviews.  I personally thought that the expression \\"God's blood\\" was very good for a vampire and also considering that it was common in the 15th century when Roman was alive - but surely he must have had a slightly more extensive vocabulary?  I agree with the other reviewer that if it wasn't for the explicit sex scenes, this would probably have a target audience of teens, not adults.  All in all, it was worth what I paid for it, and I DID enjoy it, but I won't be looking for further books in this series or from this author.<br /><br />Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good.  I found a few formatting errors here & there throughout the book, but none were major or interfered with reading.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|You think you know the Beatles music? Well, you haven't heard anything until you hear it in 5.1 on a real surround system. You might not even recognise some of this. The sound is unlike anything else. Sir George Martin spent the better part of 2 years creating this. I was literally shocked when I heard this. I listened to it 4 times in 7.1 because I couldn't believe it. Listen to A Day in the Life; Reborn! The Beatles were always known for great stereo mixing. The 5.1 mix just takes it to a new level. Is it the sound quality, the material, the surround mix? It's actually all of the above! If you must own a really great surround system & one disc to play on it: this is it! Look no further! There are other great surround sound recordings, but not by a group like this. Check out the Flaming Lips Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots & The Soft Buletin in 5.1; also Alan Parsons On Air in DTS.
0375842209|5.0|Although this book is classified as a \\"Young Adult Fiction\\" I was interested in reading it because of the rave reviews it got.  I'm glad I did.  It is the story of Liesel, a young German girl whose book-stealing and story-telling talents help sustain her family, friends, and the Jewish man they are hiding.  It's told by \\"Death\\" who is trying to make sense of the horrors of World War II.  This well written heart breaker blew me away.  Add this to your \\"must read\\" list no matter your age.  You won't be sorry.
B004GHYCKW|4.0|\\"Let England Shake\\" is PJ Harvey's public-music follow-up to the private trauma of \\"White Chalk.\\" If WC was about a vaguely Victorian, weirdly gothic woman tapping out tales of woe in her parlor, LES is a music hall celebration from the same make-believe era. Antique instrumentation, a monomaniacal focus on the horrors of old-fashioned war (no nuclear devastation here; soldiers get shot and killed one by one), and a sentimental fixation on \\"England\\" (rather than the United Kingdom, or even Britain) combine to create an anachronistic and carnivalesque atmosphere. Sit back and enjoy the jolly good stage show!    After many listenings, my reaction to LES is that I like it more than I perhaps feel I should. I admire Harvey's chameleonlike transformations, but there is no question that in forsaking rock for synthetic period music, PJ is abandoning what she does best. Yes, WC was good, and LES is good, but albums like \\"Rid of Me\\" and \\"Stories\\" were spectacular. PJ Harvey is the greatest female rocker ever. She is not the greatest autoharp balladeer ever, although she is surprisingly good at it. Harvey's vocals on LES also represent a compromise. She's always had \\"special effects\\" vocals available on demand -- a wild falsetto or guttural growl -- but on WC and now LES, the special effects vocals have become the entire show. I miss her powerful, attractive singing in her normal range. The highly mannered warbling she offers (mostly) on LES is just not as pleasant to the ear, and it also tends to pull her off pitch more frequently.    But despite what I perceive as its weaknesses, LES charms. \\"The Words That Maketh Murder\\" is just insidiously catchy. \\"The Colour of the Earth\\" is quite moving, and \\"The Glorious Land' and \\"Bitter Branches\\" come close to a successful hybridization of the old, rocking PJ with the new music hall Harvey. The songs collectively give the impression of possessing interesting, unexpected depths, making for rewarding repeat listening. \\"Let England Shake\\" is one odd album, but for me it's become a necessary one.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|This is a brilliant new album from PJ Harvey!  The twelve songs are all about war in general and The Great War in particular, the war that devastated Europe and was supposed to be The War To End All Wars.  We know how that turned out.  Several of the songs are about the bloody 1915 battle of Gallipoli, based on the book \\"Voices of Gallipoli.\\"  The songs are sparse but rich, with powerful lyrics describing the horrors of war from the perspective of the young soldiers who are slaughtered in them.  LET ENGLAND SHAKE was recorded in a beautiful old church in Dorset, pictured in the booklet and inlay.  The sound is resonant, and features Harvey, Jon Parish, Mick Harvey, and Jean-Marc Butty.  Harvey learned to play the autoharp for these songs, and it is heard on four tracks.<br /><br />Lest one think that the album is utterly bleak, many of these dark songs are quite catchy and toe-tapping.  Some are more compelling than others, but the combined effect, the album as a whole, is greater than any individual part.  The tone is relatively light and restrained given the subject matter.  Harvey sings in her upper register.  To me it sounds like it could be a recent Mekons album, particularly [[ASIN:B00003XAA6 Journey to the End of the Night]] from 2000 (see my review).  Given that the Mekons are among my favorite artists, I mean that as the highest praise.<br /><br />Though Harvey clearly situates LET ENGLAND SHAKE in the context of British history and culture, and it will certainly speak to a British listener in a way that others might not totally understand, the theme is obviously universal, and unfortunately timeless as well.  One song (\\"Written On the Forehead\\") could easily be about the contemporary invasion and occupation of Iraq, though it could be about the Ottoman lands of 1915.<br /><br />Others have analyzed the album's place in the trajectory of PJ Harvey's music.  I want to stress that in its own right this is a powerful piece of art that should be heard whether you are a fan of her previous music or not.  Definitely one of the best of the year early on.ious music or not.  Definitely one of the best of the year early on.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|A whole lot of nothing happens in this film. Slower than a snail oozing across the grass its just as exciting to watch. It wasn't scary. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't anything but a waste of time.
1597801585|5.0|The reviewer who wrote that Hock Seng was a refugee from China got it wrong. Hock Seng is a Chinese refugee from Malaya. It's interesting that the author uses the old term Malaya instead of Malaysia as the country is known today. I'm from Malaysia, and the prognosis of my country in this book is rather painful but in all honesty, all too possible, which is partly why I couldn't put the book down.     A pretty dark, depressing, distressing book and complex story containing tiny glimmers of hope ... but a great SF novel!!!
B004L3AQLU|5.0|As a healthcare provider, who has been bombarded by different drug company reps and saw first-hand the Viagra explosion and sales tactics; I found this movie and Anne Hathaway and Jake G.'s portrayal of these characters exceedingly realistic.  Additionally, I applaud the producers and actors for the honest demonstration of what it is like to be young and harnessed with a chronic and disabling illness/disease, which is rarely seen in cinema.  In part, because     1. Bloody gore for some reason has sadly become a staple in cinematography - likely because it \\"sells.\\"               And,    2. It is difficult to visualize physical and mental wounds without theater make-up, and the script and actor must reach deep within their soul, in order to demonstrate the internal pain and suffering that results from a true-life disability.
014241543X|5.0|Though If I Stay has gotten a tremendous amount of hype, I have never felt very inclined to pick it up. However, I recently got a push from a few online friends and they pressured me into giving the book a shot. I am now forever grateful to them. If they hadn't made me read this book when I did, who knows how long I would've went without it.<br /><br />I don't usually read contemporary books, though I do enjoy them. Though one could argue that If I Stay does have some paranormal element, I disagree. When you get down to it, it is the story of a girl recalling her life, and deciding whether it is worth it to keep living. I loved the story, I couldn't put the book down once I started reading.<br /><br />Gayle Forman has a poignant, touching writing style. The story merges so naturally and without haste between the present and past that you barely feel like the flashbacks are cutting in. I am eagerly anticipating Forman's future releases, along with her books that are already out, as I know they will be incredible.<br /><br />One thing I really loved about If I Stay was the characters. All of them are so natural, so real. While reading, I felt like they were my family, as well as Mia's. Each one of their personalities shined. They were all unique, charming, and utterly brilliant.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did by putting off reading this book any longer. It is definitely one of my favorite contemporary books, perhaps even one of my all-time favorites. Find a copy as soon as you can and read it immediately.<br /><br />Story: 5/5<br />Characters: 5/5<br />Originality: 4/5<br />Writing: 5/5<br />Ending: 4/5<br /><br />Total: 5/5
B000002H38|5.0|What do I have to say about this album? NOthing. Only that I wish she had repeated it in differing shades again and again.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|Eight score and ten years ago (alright, drop the eight score), Josh Groban came out with his first album Josh Groban (convenient title, huh?). From that day forward, he has attained fame and notoriety for his beautiful voice, which has given him a substantial fan base, that call themselves Grobanites..<br />With those things being said, I would like to share some of my thoughts on this album, and also include a rebuttal to all those who call themselves `fans' of his. To clarify something; when I say `rebuttal', I am not saying that those who make themselves fans of his are to like everything that he contrives; no, not at all. What I am saying is that his album should be considered honestly instead of thrown out as, \\"This album is trash! What was Josh thinking?\\" If you are reasonable and consider that statement ridiculous, please note that there are several reviews like that. However, not much of a reason is given why it is trash, except that it is not like his other pop opera albums (which David Foster produced). To all who call themselves `fans' and who have made such reviews, I would like to say to you that I find that your reviews should be honestly reconsidered. I also would like to suggest that you drop the term `fan' as it is short for fanatic.<br /><br />I will say for myself that I found this album to be, for the most part, a gentle fresh breeze. I felt that Josh's music had peaked to a somewhat stagnant offering with Awake, with the exception of \\"You Are Loved\\" and \\"February Song\\".  In the past albums there was a fairly heavy reliance on synthesizers, but in this album it is almost completely orchestrated with traditional instruments. \\"Love Only Knows\\" is the exception, with an arrangement that mixed synthesizer with traditional instrumentation for a nice quality touch. In his last album, Awake, his singing sounded rather distant. In this album, his singing is more passionate and soulful and sounds like it is coming more from his heart. While in all of his past albums he did not play a significant role in the musical composition or lyric writing.. However, in this album his contributions are significant, writing the lyrics for six of thirteen songs, and contributing to the musical composition in eleven of thirteen songs. Of course, this is a significant improvement. The lyrics in this album, like his past albums, communicate a much deeper meaning than the majority of vague, sexual oriented trash played on the radio. On the other hand, regarding this album, some of his songs seem to either lack polish or luster. The songs \\"Higher Window\\" and \\"L'ora Dell'addio\\" (a Latin song), fit in the lackluster category while \\"Voce Existed Me Mime\\" fits more in the lacking polish category because it sounds at peak periods  in the music like the musicians became a little too enthused and tried to outperform each other or Josh.<br /><br />No doubt there are more critiques that could be pointed out, especially if you have a vendetta against this album.  I personally have enjoyed it and am glad that Josh has taken a different direction compared to his previous albums (excluding Noel). Does it have a folksy edge? To a certain and varying degree, yes, but I don't think that that is a negative. It is something different, and I think that that is a good thing. I think it is also a smart move to get out of the competitive pop-opera genre and create his own musical niche. One of the things I don't understand regarding the album is why so many of his fans are angry, except that the album is a partial departure from the style of music that they were used to. This album has given us an opportunity to get a more up close and personal look at Josh Groban, as a person and artist. The real question is whether you like Josh Groban, realizing that his music will reflect him as a person. If you are an admirer of his music, shouldn't you want to learn more about him through his music, to hear him express himself as an artist? Once again, I am not sayingthat his works should be hailed as perfect; no flipping way! Reasonably criticize his work; just recognize that you will be seeing more of Josh Groban in this album.<br />Whether you are new to Josh Groban's music, or have followed his music from a past album up to present, I suggest that you first take it out of your local library, if that is a possibility, so you can decide if you like it before you spend money for this album.<br /><br />With that, this review comes to an end.<br /><br />-Jake Smithersuld be hailed as perfect; no flipping way!

B000FC2PKG|5.0|I thought this book was well written and a good escape in a book.  I kept trying to guess what was going on, but never quite could get it, until it was revealed.  It was great!
B0016BPWNM|4.0|Great purchase.  Big fan of Jim Henson productions since he pioneered puppetry during it's golden era as well as special effects.
B00192IV0O|5.0|This CD has some of the Black Eyed Peas most popular songs including \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" and \\"I Gotta Feeling.\\"The  lyrics on the songs make you want to dance. Unlike other artists, the Black Eyed Peas are great performers at concerts.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Sound quality:  I'm not an audio freak or anything so as long as I hear something, it's good.  I can't say anything about highs or lows but I hear everything I need to in games and music sounds fine with them.<br /><br />Microphone:  I've only used the microphone once but it seemed to work well.  It can be extended a bit but I wouldn't trust doing so extensively.<br />Comfort:  At first, they weren't the most comfortable things.  The extenders are quite useful to fit many size heads.  After a few weeks of use, they became quite comfortable.  Just wear them in for a little bit and they'll feel fine.<br /><br />Miscellaneous: The foam is a magnet for hair and makes me feel like I'm shedding way too much of it.  The connectors are close together which may be a problem.  It fit fine in my sound card (Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium).<br /><br />Pros: Great headset for a very great price.  Cord feels secure and the volume control looks sturdy.  Filters out external noise to keep you immersed in the game.<br /><br />Cons: The cord length is only 6 feet long, so unless your computer is close to you or on the left side of the desk, you may have trouble with it.  Filters out external noise so it makes it a bit harder to hear if someone calls for you.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|\\"Food Inc.\\"- released in 2008 - is a excellent report on the American Food Industry, how it evolved from small farms to big mass production slaughter houses and genetically engineered feed and animals.  Everything is bigger, faster, cheaper, and causing unintended consequences.  Because of all the salt, fat and sugar in the fast food industry, America's children are in a Type 2 Diabetes epidemic.  Diabetes is hitting children and younger ages.  The food system is skewed toward obesity.  The treatment of animals in big corporate farms is disgusting.  I applaud Robert Kenner's docuentary that exposes the detrimental effects on our population, environment and health.  I never realized how corn is used in so many products and that cows are herbivores by nature.  We feed them and other animals corn to make them fatter faster.  Genetically developed chickens are top heavy and rased in squalid crowded conditions.  This film will definitely affect the way I eat.  And of course there are people in power with special interests that feel no gain in protecting the average American against e-coli and bad food production.  Food is getting more and more expensive, due to drought, floods, higher oil prices to transport and overpopulation.  There may be no motivation to end this industry rife with monopolies and lax interpretation of laws.  Scary stuff, but strangely fascinating to watch what is really going on.
0553582038|3.0|This is more a review of the whole \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. Started with a bang. Loved \\"A Game of Thrones\\" when I read it as a preview of the upcoming HBO series. Liked \\"A Clash of Kings\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords.\\" And, I was looking forward to \\"A Feast for Crows.\\" First, I can imagine how readers waiting for the next volume of the series felt; the ending of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" was akin to being put into suspended animation for the past five years. But, that's not my real problem. During \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" I just got bored. It's sometimes like a medieval fantasy \\"Perils of Pauline\\" for the major characters; and a lot of clutter with the many new minor characters in each succeeding book. Still looking forward to the HBO series (love watching Sean Bean act); but, if it ever comes out, I might take a pass on Martin's next book.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Eastwood's and I can honestly say that this is amongst my favorites. It is certainly much more satisfying than \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" at least in my book and definitely above \\"Bloodwork\\". It's not \\"Unforgiven\\" or \\"Dirty Harry\\". All of those to varying degrees were escapist fodder. Escaping into the old west or the streets of San Francisco can be pleasurable. \\"Gran Torino\\" has moments that harkens back to William Money or Harry Callahan but only moments. Those are probably the moments seen in the previews. This movie surprised me with its combination of drama and humor and compassion in dealing with sensitive subjects like aging, death, racism, religion and a re-evaluation of a person's values; to come to peace with inner demons that have tormented someone and finding peace within one's self. The characters flawed enough so that there is no preachy message here or anything and doesn't pretend to be some sensitive film about any of it's subject, but instead deals with them rather harshly actually.<br />There is plenty of humor to be found herein as Walt Kowalski, Polish-American veteran of the Korean War, retired auto plant worker and now a widower faces the change of having to deal with things changing in his life. Kowalski never misses a chance to get in a racial slur and even as his son drives away after the wife's funeral, Kowalski noticing the make of the son's vehicle mutters,\\" Why can't you buy American?\\" and inside the vehicle the son Mitch's comments are about the predictability of dad's racist outlook on things. And speaking of racism there is a heavy dose of this elsewhere as well.<br />Walt's neighbors are Hmong people whose son is harassed by a group of thugs wanting to initiate him into their gang so as to protect him from a rival Mexican gang. Thao Vang Lor is assigned the task of stealing Kowalski's prize possession from his days at the Ford plant, a mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino. Thao botches his assignment and the gang show up to give Thao a second chance. When he refuses that gang becomes violent and Kowalski is awakened by the shouts and the sounds of yard ornaments being knocked over and broken. Walt armed with his shotgun isn't afraid of the gang or their \\"f\\" word vocabulary. The gang backs off and retreats and Walt becomes an unwilling hero to the Hmong's whether he likes it or not. Only Thao and his sister, Su speak any English so Walt is unable to communicate to the other relatives that he just wanted to left alone. After being smothered with flowers and trays of Hmong delicacies, Thao's mother, Vu forces Thao to confess to Walt about his attempted car theft. Su, translating for Vu explains that Thao must atone for his deed by working for Walt. Walt reluctantly becomes sort of father figure to Thao even getting him a job in construction and loaning him tools, but Thao's cousin from the street gang and friends have other ideas and brutally beat Thao one day while heading home from work. Su also is rescued from some black thugs by Walt and expresses her gratitude by making Walt a regular dinner guest. Meanwhile, Walt goes after one of the gang the beat up Thao and leaves him beaten and bruised with a warning to leave Thao alone. The gang retaliates, opening fire on the front of the Vang Lor's house with automatic weapons, and beating and raping Su.<br />The end has Walt finally coming to terms with his racism and other demons. Thao assumes that Walt will go after the gang for what they did to Su and that he will be along for the ride. Walt forbids this and locks him in the basement. The end is a fatal shoot out with Walt as the victim and the gang is placed under arrest.<br />The gist of this is that Walt has never told anyone that he was dying of tuberculosis. He is seen visiting a clinic and coughing up blood on several occasions. He dies for a cause and settles his demons regarding the things he did in the war which have haunted him all of his life and are the underlying reason for his bitterness. He resents being a hero for things he didn't want to do in the first place. This may seem a bit contrived but it flows well and ties up all of the loose ends nice and neatly and even gives you some things to think about as well.<br />This isn't the greatest movie that Eastwood has ever done. But it may serve as the final chapter in all of those \\"aged\\" character movies that he's been putting out since \\"Unforgiven. The aging gunfighter(Unforgiven), aging thief (Absolute Power), aging news reporter (True Crime), aging secret service agent (In The Line of Fire) and so forth.

0375713751|4.0|\\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" is just plain fun to read but it also hit very close to home for me, also a working mother with a demanding job in the financial sector. Allison Pearon is just so honest about how working mothers feel. I haven't read anyone else express those feelings in quite such an insightful way. Kate Reddy, a 30-something high-powered career woman with two young children and a supportive husband (he's wonderful but he's still, you know....a man!) is just SO REAL. She struggles to juggle work in a male-dominated industry and her children and husband but is also so Type-A that she can't let go and ask for help. I love that she's flawed and a role model all at the same time. I enjoyed the book from start to finish and almost wished the book was longer. Perfect beach reading!
4770031246|5.0|I love this book, it arrived fast and well packaged, the recipes look incredibly delicious and easy,I can't wait to try them!!
B004IDYDFI|5.0|This movie is soo funny and laid back. I recommend this movie to people that have a great sense of humor and love jay and silent bob.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|All I can say is that Angelina Jolie is great in this film.  This movie is action packed from beginning to end. It kept me interested through the whole movie.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved reading The Hunger Games! The story is so exciting and interesting that I couldn't help but read it at every opportunity. I sped through the book and I cannot wait to get my hands on book two, Catching Fire.<br /><br />Katniss, the heroine, is a strong, independent character. Her world revolves around survival, and luckily that skill is a necessity to her when she finds herself as a contender in The Hunger Games. The society in the story holds annual Hunger Games and representatives from every district are expected to fight to the death in these \\"games.\\" The last contestant standing is the victor, but the competition is fierce, and a diverse skill set is needed to survive.<br /><br />I've heard The Hunger Games series compared with the Twilight saga and Harry Potter series. I agree with the comparison to action-packed, fantastical, young adult fiction. However, The Hunger Games lacked all the negative aspects I found when reading the others. There's no room for a whining inner dialogue here. No part of the book felt long, or drawn out. With every turn of the page the plot unfolded and became more engrossing.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE, IT WAS FUNNY, AND IT HAD SUSPENSE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BORING AND NOT FUNNY, BUT IT WAS THE TOTAL OPPOSITE.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me interested from beginning to end. I watched it 2 times back to back when I got it in the mail. Denzel did a great job.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I give this DVD two thumbs up.  The acting by Claire Dane was top notch.  A must see for anyone coping with autism.  It arrived in a timely way in great condition.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|I THOUGHT THIS DOCUMENTARY WAS GOING TO BE MORE INTERESTING AND LIVELY. I FELL ASLEEP ON IT THE 1ST TIME I WATCHED IT.
B00280LYIC|3.0|I don't want to compare it to HP, but it is obvious that is what this book was hoping to be.  Overall the book was okay.  It is rather straight forward.  It doesn't have a lot of mystery to it.  If you've finished highschool mythology, then this book doesn't present a lot to mystify you.  It wasn't badly written, just kind of plain.  I'm going to try the second one and see if it gets any better.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Okay first off, those who are being over critical about the movie need to relax. This movie was solely made for the fans and not the critics. Any action fan who have watched these action stars from the 80's on up will understand that a cast of this caliber, collaboration between the past and present, is something we all wanted to see in our lifetime, and now we have it. It's just an overall fun movie; to see all your favorite action stars, idols, however you want to look at them, get together and have a good time. With that said, a lot of technical aspects of the movie could of been better but it doesn't ruin the whole idea of the movie. If you want to watch something that makes sense in every aspect of your daily life; if the special effects aren't perfect enough, if the acting is unreal, then go and sit yourself in front of your living room window and look outside, because thats real.
0452286751|5.0|In 1943 Ayn Rand published, The Fountainhead.  Her novel encompasses the principles of Objectivist philosophy, while winding a captivating narrative of two rival architects, namely Howard Roark and Peter Keating.  The story is set primarily in New York City in the 1920s through 40s, creating a playing field bound for excitement.   The plot itself is marked by myriad bombshells both figurative and literal, while the characters suffer turbulence, professionally and personally.  Lives are threatened, purpose is lost and rediscovered, and confidence and pretenses are shattered with dreams.    The characters come to life from the pages.  In fact, it is as if the plot is written only as means to realize these characters.  The relationships in the novel are complex.  Friendships are made three dimensional and ulterior motives are perpetually revealed.  The competitive nature of business, press, politics and industry force the characters to make choices that expose their true identities.  Beneath the superficies of the story, Rand expresses her objectivist ideals.  The novel sets out to prove the absolute nature of facts, exemplifying man's inability to change the inevitability of certain events.  She glorifies selfishness.  The concepts of feeding ego, and reaching personal goals at any costs reoccur throughout the text.  Roark himself embodies the objectivist ideas of self governing and pulverizing conventional standards for the betterment of self.                  As a literary work, The Fountainhead is rich with stylistic qualities.  Rand uses all the literary devices to her advantage.  Buildings, statues, places and even characters are all symbols of greater things.  Rand exemplifies the greatest use of a character foil.  Keating's personal qualities so contrast to Roark's they become outstanding.  Metaphors are present throughout the text.  She uses motifs and descriptive language to force upon the reader the points of her writing.  The Fountainhead is not a book to miss.  Its powerful message invokes thought.  The characters reveal crucial insight into human nature.  Stylistically, Rand is virtuoso.  The Fountainhead encompasses the true meaning of an expertly written novel.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Only the clever will moan at this apparent `hideous apparition': They will find Sex and the City 2 so gruesome, so vomit inducing, that they will feel even more depressed for the state of women than men could ever hoped for? Well, they are not seeing it right (daft women).<br /><br />The majority of your sisters can easily enjoy something so smelly and sugar coated at the same time; like cream mixed with putrid; that forces their brains to heave with terror until the end, like an angry toilet, waiting to die. They will never understand that this colossal piece of nonsense paralysis all mental powers and turns all our sisters and daughters into prancing mannequins; who's only ground of existence is to enrich The Man. Women, yes you, apparently love this pseudo girl power masterpiece.<br /><br />Women are floating orbs, obsessed with men, shopping, diet, handbags, men and all things empty and fleeting; this is not my idea, but the Hollywood version of who you are. Like a fetishistic spell excreted out of Oprah's bum, this Hollywood pap is a bone tossed to females and the females mistake it for their fellow sister! They even wheeled on Liza Minnelli for god's sake; I thought she was dead! And the gay clich&eacute;s found in here are the most absurd, uncaring and thoughtless misuse of gay people since man first put finger to pen. The depiction of both men and women are horrid, like a turd I think. Yes the cast are women, but look like old men dressed up as women, which is confusing, and I don't think you can get a metaphorical orgasm from shopping, no matter how clever the marketing, I reckon women are smarter than this (I don't really). Ok, someone can argue that it's rare for Hollywood to have a movie with women in the starring role and its only a bit of harmless fun. Well I say to them, Hollywood needs you more than you need Hollywood. Spend your dollar somewhere else or just download this hollow orb. Thank the Goddess for internet piracy!
0451197968|5.0|I've read this book about a dozen times and I have to tell you, I intend to read it again.  It is fast paced and well written and has been lost to most of society because it is hidden the shadow of a horrible movie that was supposedly based on the book.  Please read this book if you are reading this, you will be oh so glad that you did.

B000093FLA|5.0|Best Brad Pitt movie ever.  Best Jason Statham movie ever.  So, what are you waiting for, go watch this movie!      It is funny, it is dark and funny and it is just plain cool.  The cinematography was outstanding, the plot is thick and complex and absorbing and wonderful.  The ending is grad A Guy Richie fantastic!  Like I said go watch it if you haven't already.  I think I am going to go watch it again right now just thinking about it, what a great flick.
030746363X|3.0|This book contains so much information; it's hard to decide what to do, all of it (extreme) or only some of it.  I found it is definitely written in \\"Guy speak.\\"  I decided to try an easier way to attempt to lose weight.  If that doesn't work, I will look at this book again.
159562015X|2.0|DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK USED!!!!!  The book has a code in the back that allows you to take the online assessment test.  The book is worthless unless you take this online assessment.  You are able to purchase online access codes for the test, but it is cheaper to buy a whole NEW book through Amazon.  I'm unhappy with the whole idea of a book that requires an online assessment in order to use in the first place.  I feel that it is just a marketing tool designed to suck more money out of the consumer.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is one of the best products that I have ever used. I can't live without it. I have gone through three of them over a period of 3-4 years.How handy and easy they are to clean with. I will order them everytime I need one and probable give them them for gifts also.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Not a Masterpiece like Showgirls, but GREAT Nonetheless!<br /><br />This is an AWESOME movie, plain and simple. I am not going into details about the plot because everyone should know it by now, but if you're looking for a good, entertaining movie with great music, dancing, chemistry, and awesome performances that compliment the musical genre - then this is the movie to watch.<br /><br />Christina's amazing voice and nice acting ability balance this movie perfectly. Cher & Stanley Tucci as the comedic duo are head on with their lines, comedic talent, and outstanding presence. It's a bit strange to see Cher acting in a movie when she is 64 and looks 31 in the film, but it is great to see her back in a film and on top of her game. Christina can act. I didn't dread any of the moments when she had screen time (I can't say that for everyone who is a singer turned actress). However, I just wish there was MORE dancing. I felt like an extra ten minutes of more dancing, of another musical sequence would have been a welcome.<br /><br />Get the DVD/Blu Ray combo. It is an excellent deal at a great price.
