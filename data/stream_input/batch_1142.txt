B004TTMYQG|5.0|My current calendar after trying (and buying) several others. Very robust and worth the 5 bucks. Get it while it's free!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app is better than the stock calendar by far. I love that you can see start and end times in the widget. Being able to select a few days up to two weeks at a time is amazing. Also the one touch adding is nice. Who would have thought that someone could beat google at making a calendar for their own platform.
B00024YVJU|5.0|If you love Pink Floyd, or seventies Progressive Rock. you will want this album!<br /><br />Go to YouTube and play \\"Incarnation of the Logos\\" and \\"Atlantis' Agony At June 5th 8498, 13 P M Gregorian Earthtime\\"<br /><br />I promise you, you will want to buy this CD.<br /><br />And afterwards, I suggest that you get Eloy's album's \\"Power and the Passion\\" and \\"Inside\\" next.<br /><br />They have about 25 albums, but, I suggest you start by collecting their work from the seventies, first.<br /><br />Also, YouTube \\"Astral Entrance/Master of Sensation\\" from their 1979 album \\"Silent Cries and Mighty Echoes\\".  You will be spending more money of Progressive Rock than you ever thought possible.<br /><br />Eloy is Germany's most respected Progressive Rock group, and I'm sure that ELP, Yes, and even Rush, is blown away by Eloy!

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Wow.  Had I known how good this little gem was, I would have dropped the Lincoln back when I got my Android.  Clean, smooth, seamless.  Amazing the features and power of this application.  I love the fact that it picked up my Google calendars automatically.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this has to be one of the best, if not the best, productivity application Amazon has offered via its FAOTD.  Even if you missed the FAOTD, grab this one - You won't be disappointed!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great, unique perspective on success.  I do worry though that it might make crazy parents even crazier raising their kids.
0547258305|4.0|The book was definitely intriguing but did have it's slow moments. I also wished the story would have continued at the end instead of cutting off the story. Made me wonder if there would be additional books created with the same characters...guess I'll have to look.       Worth the read!!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Only got this today but so far it is great. Finally a calendar that has functionality and versitility. The calendar on the Droid X is limited and poor at best. This one is a pleasure. Thanks
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Nice features but widgets needs to show multi line event description in text just like the stock android widget does. instead, the event description is cut off. Cant use until this is addressed since this reduces  usability of the widgets.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I wasn't a big fan of this album when it first debuted. Actually, I'm still not. After Riot Act I was expecting something interesting like that. I'm one of the few fans that enjoyed that album and found it to be one of their best. This album feels like PJ gave in to their fans who kept pleading for \\"more rock\\". The result is boring and repetitive for the most part. Granted yes, their are some good songs here, the tension that I love about Pearl Jam is completely absent on this album. I feel they are at their best when they build songs through a slow burn. Here they don't, the band just blazes through the songs. Zero experimentation. When there are attempts at it, it's at the expense of the rhythm and melody. I also am not crazy about Vedder's voice here. It really shuns the replay value, and after awhile the songs song trite and played out. Luckily the next album, Backspacer was an improvement, although Pearl Jam need to get back to pushing the envelope experimentally. Stop rehashing familiar territory.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I think I've tried all the free calendars and found them pretty unsatisfying. (Though I stuck with Jorte). Business calendar is pretty and super functional.  Innovative month display that lets you see a lot and once and lets you easily grab a Few days to see more closely at once.  The add event feature is the only 3rd party add system that doesn't suck.  It not only doesn't suck, it's awesome. You can see, on the side, where your new event fits in with existing events.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|this calendar is like the android calendar on steroids while it doesn't do you much more it does everything better.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app has a great interface! Unlike the standard Android Calendar, this app mimics the online calendar interface available on gmail by overlaying a date's agenda on top of a month view. In my opinion this feature is better than the OEM Calendar method of leading a user away from the month view after clicking a date. I also appreciate the lack of a lengthy procedure to sync the calendar to my gmail account. The one ups don't stop there, although easy, but tedious, the OEM Calendar required a user to go back and forth into the apps Setting to turn manage viewable calendars. With this app the same task is completed by allowing event calendars to be toggled on/off with buttons labeled with abbreviated calendar names located at the bottom of the month and week calendar views. I can see how these toggles could clutter up on small screened devices, so its definitely a user preference. The week view is very intuitive, and allows the amount of viewable days to be managed with a slide bar. In addition, the at-a-glance view of events makes locating and managing events faster than the OEM Calendar. The widget feature could use some refacing, though. Allow its great that events can be created from directly from the widget without having to enter the app, the buttons are fuzzy and lack high definition. But this could just be a user preference, since the buttons are still functional. Overall, by offering a better interface this app is better than the OEM Calendar.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season DVD has everything a TV collection ought to have, with only a few clich&eacute; DVD  flaws holding it back.<br /><br />The Show: The AMC adaptation of Robert Kirkman's [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead]] comic hosts an accurate portrayal of the original series without being strictly faithful.  It follows Rick Grimes, a small town deputy sheriff who comes out of a coma and wanders into the Zombie Apocalypse.  Rick must find his wife and son while coming to terms with the end of the world as he knows it. The story asks the questions that a standard film lacks the time to address: What if these characters had to survive in this horrific situation forever? How would they survive? Where would they live? How would they get food? What would become of their humanity?  \\"The Walking Dead\\" is an excellent job portrayal of the human mind under extreme stress.  The prolonged storytelling forces the viewer to form stronger attachments to the characters than one would normally develop for your standard zombie lunch special.<br /><br />\\"The Walking Dead\\" also looks fantastic.  It's filmed as if it was a theatrical motion picture, so it looks awesome, and the writing is superb, too.  The result is a terrifying, heartbreaking, and thrilling experience. Watch out for the last episode on the disc. No spoilers here, but it's a MAJOR departure from the comic series, and it might throw some die-hard fans off.<br /><br />The DVD: The disc and its menus are fairly standard.  An animated title screen shows off your options, with a second disk for Special Features.  All pretty standard, with English and Spanish subtitles. It's really nothing out of the ordinary, so that annoying little DVD standard is here too: advertisements.  In addition to the regular previews and ads preceding the menu, the second disc has an obnoxious surprise.  When I selected the \\"Special Features\\" menu, I had to click through a \\"New Season Coming This Fall\\" advert screen before moving on to the bonus content. Thanks.  I'm already watching the show. I have the DVD. I don't think I need to see an advertisement for the show I'm watching RIGHT NOW.  I can't wait to see this ad again in a few years, when it's outdated, and nonsensical.<br /><br />Special Features: This collection has ten featurettes: one for each episode, a general \\"making of\\", make up behind the scenes, sneak peek with the comic author, and a convention panel. The TV trailer and six \\"Extra Footage\\" segments, which showcase the creative influences on the show, actor interviews, and so on, are also included.  Although it seems like much of this was previously aired on AMC, it's still a great collection of content for the hungry zombie fan, with enough peeks at the production process to satisfy your inner film nerd.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great DVD - completely worth owning for any fan of the series - but I had to deduct one star out of five for the sake of that stupid, stupid in-menu advertisement.content.

B003JTHXN6|5.0|I personally loved this book! It provided great insight on what it takes for a company to succeed in this every changing business environment by building a great company culture & brand.  Some of the things they do at Zappos are definitly non traditional, but they have been sucessful in building a compnay that focuses on their customers, inspires their employees and is profiting with out focusing on making a profit like so many companies do. I feel this book is great for young professionals with aspiratons to become a leader or start their own buisness as we can relate to a lot of Tony's stories and experiences.

B004TTMYQG|2.0|The app is ok, it has some nice features but nothing overly spectacular. Unfortunately, although it is 'working' on the Xoom, it is still not optomized for it. Also, has anyone else noticed that until today there were only 4 reviews for this and a suspiciously high number that show up today are 5 stars and basically say the same thing?
B000Y9Q59W|2.0|First of all, this is one of my favorite movies, the role Michael Douglas was born to play... Gekko!. That said, let me express my opinion on the Blu ray edition. It is very poor, you might as well buy the DVD because they look exactly the same. Do not expect HD from this edition, maybe in later ones, as they usually do, they'll do the job right. Still, if you are such a fanatic of the movie that you MUST have the Blu ray edition, go ahead, but don't expect justice to it. I gave it 2 stars instead of just one, because of the little extras (O. Stone commentaries on the making), that's all.
B001BWQWKS|5.0|It's that I have the Lincoln Center Debussy collection, you see, which has been a favorite of mine since the day it came. The Quator Ebene selection of Debussy is probaly better than the one I'm used to, and so it follows that the interpretations found here of the other two composers are going to be top-notch. Seriously though, I play it a lot. It is some nice quiet background type music that can also contnue to thrill when given one's complete attention. It is also among those found in the \\"Absolute Sound Guide to Audiophile Demo Discs;\\" where I found it, and this article can be downloaded as part of the AV Guide.com \\"Guide to Cables, Power Products, Acessories, and Music.

Understanding Poverty describes the attack that economists are making to understand it on many different fronts.\\"--George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics, 2001<br /><br />Gloom and doom have long been the default view of global poverty. Poverty, Ignorance, and Ill Health constitute the impediment triad, of which poverty plays, as much as ignorance a double role of cause and result. Poverty, by definition, is the lack of basic human needs, such as clean and fresh water, nutrition, clothing and shelter. [[ASIN:0691148198 Portfolios of the Poor: How the World's Poor Live on $2 a Day]]. Such is aggravated by lack of education, and health care, due to the absence of the social system, and effective government that facilitates their availability and affordability. To help these nations to give their people a chance for a run-in on the ladder of economic prosperity, an economic development plan should be devised to achieve better control over their economic future and existence.<br /><br />Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty, is outside of my professional expertise. This is my first encounter with the human side of economic research. I am not an economist, but I studied basic and project economics that contributed to make my engineering career helpful. Applying a value added approach of project feasibility and pay out analysis helps through in a limited micro fixes, offering some  measures for  economic improvement. On the other side, global economies are far more complex, calling for the need of master plans, based on detailed studies and procedures to be worked out. [[ASIN:1405183438 The Contemporary Global Economy: A History since 1980 (Blackwell History of the Contemporary World)]]. At the core of economic development schemes, there needs to be a deep understanding of the causes of poverty, and most effective method to abate and alleviate them.<br /><br />The concept that aid puts an end to third world poverty, has proven to be far from reality, in many instances. Charles Kenny, a distinguished economist, skillfully debunks the myth that development aid is doomed to failure and a waste of money. After plenty of aid pessimism, here is a relentlessly cheerful polemic, [[ASIN:0465020151 Getting Better: Why Global Development Is Succeeding--And How We Can Improve the World Even More]]. Based on years of research, and many cases, from Kenya to India, and Chile to Indonesia, the authors identify totally new behavior modes of poor people, relative to their needs, and the way financial aid provision affects their lives. Book co-author Duflo's major role in the field has been to use research to show which programs are the most effective in combating poverty. According to MIT, the research work utilizes field experiments, set at random, to identify highly effective programs that can alleviate poverty, ranging from low-cost medical care to application of innovative education programs.<br /><br />Although there is no silver bullet for poverty, celebrated economist Jeffrey Sachs devised a specified recipe in nine steps to eliminate extreme poverty.  [[ASIN:0143036580 The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time]]. According to Sachs, with the right policies and key interventions, extreme poverty -- defined as living on less than $1 a day -- can be eradicated within 20 years. India and China serve as examples, with the latter lifting 300 million people out of extreme poverty during the last two decades. Sachs believes a key element to accomplishing this is raising aid from $65 billion in 2002 to $195 billion a year by 2015. He guaranteed eleminating the problems of the global poor population, of the one billion poorest individuals by 2025. Understanding poverty and what to do about it, is a central concern of most economists. Yet the lay public is mostly unaware what leading economists have to say about it. The best sources for an accessible theory of poverty lies in studies by sociologists, and this project helps to further examine how the prevailing theories on poverty have unwound. The book describes the poor's struggle, offering us an opportunity to think of a world beyond poverty. It inspires its readers to take a step in supporting, if not joining the efforts to alleviate the humilating suffering  of one sixth of mankind. French economist Duflo expressed her belief that all it takes for politicians is just to \\"translate research into action\\"<br /><br />\\"Duflo, who last year won American Economic Association's prestigious John Bates Clark Medal, acknowledges that it is sometimes frustrating to get policy makers to apply the results of research that could improve people's lives.\\"  - A.

B004OFWLO0|5.0|Robert Johnson, blues pioneer and legend, would turn 100 next month if he were still alive.  In celebration of his centennial, his all-too-brief catalog-- 29 master takes and 13 alternates-- has been reissued.<br /><br />As I'm sure a lot of you reading this already have these recordings in some form or another, I'm going to start by talking about the presentation of this material.  Put simply-- this set is a revelation of sound-- it's remarkable, both the 1990 collection ([[ASIN:B000002ADN Complete Recordings]]) and the later reissues of [[ASIN:B00000AG6X King of Delta Blues Singers]] all have that \\"pre-World War II reissue sound\\".  Many of you know what I mean, scratches, pops, microphone hiss, etc.  It lends a certain charm to the music, but it can certainly change the listening experience.  This recording is remarkably free of that-- crisp, clean, clear, no artifacts of age or old media.  It's really amazing, I've never heard anything from this era that sounds like this, it has my salivating at the potential for remastering other pre-WWII music and it really brings Johnson to life-- with such clarity, both his singing and guitar playing leap off the recordings.<br /><br />And really, that brings me back to the recordings, a true treasure of their era, Robert Johnson was a powerfully talented man.  Generally recognized for his guitar playing (rumor has it he sold his soul to the Devil to attain such mastery), Johnson was also a singer of fierce power, channeling deep and powerful emotions and demonstrating excellent flexibility in his voice.  Accompanying himself on guitar, Johnson demonstrates remarkable technique, instantly recognizable as his own and never really replicated by anyone else.  I think it was best summed up by Keith Richards, who famously asked when hearing Johsnon, \\"who is the other guy playing with him?\\"<br /><br />The songs themselves have been covered and re-covered so many times, in many ways they're instantly familiar to us.  To hear Johnsonperform though is often a revelation-- he can bring forth such emotions seemingly at will, haunted fear (\\"Hellhound on My Trail\\"), anxiety (\\"Ramblin' On My Mind\\") and ecstacy (\\"They're Red Hot\\").  But for me, when he's at his best is when there's almost an acceptance of a dark resolution-- \\"Me and the Devil Blues\\" and \\"Cross Road Blues\\" come immediately to mind.  It's something I've never quite heard in anyone else's music, and certainly the many, many covers of the latter are simply lacking in comparison.<br /><br />The bottom line is, these recordings are essential parts of music history, it's hard to overstate this, and should be investigated by virtually any serious music fan.  For those who have previous issues of these recordings, the sonic upgrade here is to my ears worth the investment.  Highly recommended.

0765322889|3.0|I don't read fantasy as much as some of the reviewers. I have yet to read Martin or the Wheel of time, and will not read them until they are complete. But I have read Robert E. Howard (Conan), Tolkien, Donaldson ( Thomas Covenant) , and Zindell ( EA series). This gives me a basis to compare.<br /><br />The first issue I have with this book is the setup. In particular the maps, glossary and the list of people in the beginning of the book. If you bother to provide such things, I will attempt to use them as the story unfolds. Early in the book it mentions the 7 cities, which are not on the map. Other cities and areas are routinely mentioned, and you cannot find it on the map. In some cases these cities are on another continent, give me a break. The glossary and people explanations are so poor they are a waste of time. For instance there were numerous other beings who were just marked as non-human, but that was it. Various key cities were not even mentioned in the glossary, which would have sufficed in lieu of a map to give context.<br /><br />The next issue I have is the lack of descriptions for all of the exotic places, this is really missing. The Hounds were poorly described description, while the Quorls reasonably well. The worst was the description (or lack thereof) of the Barghast. Examples<br />o Paran sees a \\"Barghast\\" in a bar. He instantly recognizes the Barghast, but there is no description. The glossary just says it is non-human. How would he know???<br />o The Maranth- lacks description, but you find out later that they have concealing costumes and make sure they always removed their dead. Ok so maybe that is a mystery for later, right now I feel it is a cop out.<br />o These Warrens had some descriptions, but the characters who go through the warrens don't seem to experience much.<br /><br />Another issue is immersion- I did not feel the environment or the action at a visceral level, compared to reading  Howard, or Zindell, or Mieville. You just don't feel the smell, horror or creepiness. It is way too detached, similar to my feelings of Tolkien.<br /><br />Using magic should be physically and mentally costly, the magic used here is generally nondescript and seems to require little cost to the user, although there was one or 2 exceptions, it feels like they are turning  on a cell phone, the expenditure is not consistent. There is likely a hierarchy of power in magic, but it did not come across all that well. The recognition of sorcery was often done by smell, but it was just a stink. This is not good enough for a work as ambitious as this. What does the feel of \\"lingering sorcery\\" mean, how is it felt, what does it do to others, not enough here.<br />There are pluses obviously<br />The Plot was twisting, and did converge, the character development in general was solid, so I am going to invest my time further.

0765350386|5.0|I was impressed by Sanderson's work on Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, so I thought I would read some of his own work to see if I really liked Sanderson as an author or if it was simply Jordan's Masterful storytelling and the copious notes he left that captivated my interest.  I have now read a couple of Sanderson's books (Elantris & Mistborn) and found that I truly enjoy his writing.      I'm a fan of epic fantasy and Sanderson's style quickly caught my attention due to the rich world development, depth of his characters and innovtive magic systems.  Sanderson developed a dark and intriguing world in the Final Empire series.  You are brought quickly into the darkness of this world where the sun has gone dark, ash falls instead of rain, mists rule the night and the peasant class is treated like animals.       The magic system is one of the most interesting and innovative I've ever encountered - \\"Allomancy\\", a rare ability to internally burn metals that provides the ability to heighten senses and strength, and push and pull metal.  Very original.     I also love that Mistborn has a female protagonist who kicks as much ass as any of her male counterparts and that she's made more believable, rather than more stereotyped or confined by her gender.  Wonderful character development throughout.      I really like Sanderson's style, refreshing with a sense of modernness.      Great Book!  Highly recommended.

B004I4H8PO|2.0|The music sounds good, but I have only played it through a computer, so I can't speak to any marked improvements in sound quality. I'm sure there are Clapton audiophiles out there who have specific opinions about the quality of this new edition. Unfortunately, the packaging on this edition is a mess. All the pieces are loose in the box. The discs are placed in envelope openings with no bottom, so they slide down into the package and are almost impossible to extract without inflicting some damage. I will be very surprised if my discs are not damaged. What an embarrassment.

B0015DROBO|3.0|Although I did enjoy this book in the end, I found myself waiting for it to pick up in the beginning; it didn't until about Chapter 5. At about the halfway point, the book really started to pick up, and it was at that point that I couldn't put it down. The Swedish names are a bit difficult to trudge through, as is the information on the financial aspects of the book. I gave this book 3 stars because the story line was truly clunky at times. And then the end, however, seemed to wrap up too neatly and quickly, and from the torture chamber to the sheep farm, this portion seemed so undeveloped that it was difficult to believe. Although I don't regret picking up this book, I would not read it again.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I made the mistake of catching bits and pieces of TP on HBO and was not impressed. Owning Band of Brothers and having viewed this excellent series a number of times, I was looking for a similar experience in TP, and didn't think the fragments viewed on HBO came close in quality.    My opinion changed after reading E.B. Sledge's, With the Old Breed, and then viewing all of the episodes in sequence over a span of about 10 days. While the segments featuring Sledge were not 100% faithful to his book, they came closer to being accurate than all but a tiny handful of war movies. The movie's portrayals of the carnage at Peleliu and Okinawa resonate not just with Sledge's work, but with memoirs such as Manchester's Goodbye Darkness. Viewers who watch the whole series will see a much more complete view of its central figures than what is typical for a war movie. Some of this is the natural result of having 10 hours of programing to work with, but much of it is the result of what was filmed. This is particularly true of the final episode dealing with post-war transitions, where TP delivered a sense of what it was like for combat soldiers to return to civilian life...very touching to me.    Criticisms of the movie's feaquent focus on American cruelty and combat fatigue in Marines has some validity. If one is using Sledge's work as the key reference, then TP seemed to tip the balance in reporting a bit, avoiding some of the worst Japanese actions, while seeming to expand these a bit on the U.S. side. I also don't recall Sledge being as angst filled in his book as he was portrayed as being in the movie.    That being said, this a a powerful piece of film making, and I can think of few U.S films on war that would as compelling or as accurate.
B004L49K20|5.0|If you're considering purchasing this album, you already know that you like Duran's music. So, that being the case, PURCHASE THIS. I really, really like it. Not all the songs are absolute winners, but you cannot go wrong with the likes of Girl Panic or The Man Who Stole a Leopard. Vintage greatness. Sometimes, sounds a bit derivative of their old, early 80s, stuff, but always veers away before becoming too similar to those songs. Most stylistically similar to the first album, I think. Like I said, if you're even reading this review, you already know you love you some DD, so yea...click the \\"buy\\" button already.

Overall, the energy level is great, the songs are well written, it's got adventure, and the performance is what you'd expect from Iron Maiden (if not necessarily what you'd expect from a bunch of 50 year-old guys -- impressive, that).    But I listen to these songs and I think they could have been much, much better if not for the over-compression of the music.  It's not as bad as most and it could have been much worse (it's no Death Magnetic), but still it's bad enough that the music loses most of its power.  From 0:28 to 0:48 in 'El Dorado' the single snare hits should be much louder and have much more power -- instead, they're wimpy bits of snare drum-ish sound.  You can't tell if he just taps the snare drum, or if he really whacked it, and I want to be able to feel like he really whacked it as hard as he could -- that's one of the things Iron Maiden is all about.  The volume change at 0:48 when the whole band is in should be much more dramatic.  On 'Coming Home' Bruce Dickinson's voice is hugely compressed into a really thin volume band (though not clipped at all).  Much of the variability and expressiveness of his vocals is lost.  And there are just too many other examples to recount on the album.    The music, riffs and energy are just as good as Powerslave.  If it was mixed and mastered properly it would have sounded as good and smacked you as much as Powerslave.  Instead, it feels tedious half-way through.    More dynamic range, please.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|It's now my main calendar app. It looks just like my google calendar on my pc. Very smooth operation and set up.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|I like the app and the ability to see all of my calendars at once.  I would like to be able to see my Yahoo Mail Calendar, but I can't figure out how to add it.  Kind of disappointing....
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Really like this app, but for my HTC Evo I can't get the widget to come up on my home screen.
B0006VBFM0|3.0|O.K., get this clear: this watch obviously does not last forever. The face scratches easily, and the colors do not match with everything! The watch is fun, though, and totally worth the price for a few compliments. Also, there is a plastic covering that encases the band. I've been wearing this swatch for 6 months and that has started to peel off. The numbers are large and easy to read, to I'd recommended it to someone young or with sight problems. Also, the watch is extremely waterproof! I never take it off, not even in the shower. I love this watch, but it's getting to be time to get a new one.
0307477479|3.0|This book is not as bad as some of the reviewers suggest though it is not Pulitzer quality either. There are some genuinely moving sections--especially the ones which focus on the character Sasha's younger life. But there are some other sections which simply don't work at all--including an almost 75 pages section told in power point and a very ill-advised snippet invoving a genocidal dictator and a Lindsay Lohan like celebrity acress. I am glad I read it and some of it will stick with me but the author should have reined in her ambitions a bit.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|You'd be hard-pressed to find a better calendar app. This does a better job of mimicking my Google Calendar than Google does on my Android phone.
B000P0J09C|2.0|Not too bad at the beginning, but you expect it to build to something more than it does.  Kind of a let down with the ending.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Just downloaded as the free app of the day, but if I'd known about it before I'd totally have spent $5 on it. Best calendar app I've seen, super easy sync with gmail, beautiful widgets easy to use, nice in app help system. Is now set as my default calendar app
B000068TPN|5.0|This is one of the better ones.  Some parts could have been a little better but this is one of the best war type movies.
159420229X|4.0|'Once upon a time people invested in their memories, they cultivated them. They studiously furnished their minds. They remembered. Today, of course, we've got books, and computers and smart phones to hold our memories for us. We've outsourced our memories to external devices. The result is that we no longer trust our memories. We see every small forgotten thing as evidence that they're failing us altogether. We've forgotten how to remember.'     When Joshua Foer was sent to cover the US Memory Championships as a science journalist, little did he expect to return the following year as a competitor. And the idea that he might win after only one year of training was unthinkable. Yet that's exactly what happened. Like many people, Foer regularly forgot where he left his car keys and, on occasion, his car. He discovered from speaking with the world's memory champions that they weren't savants who performed miraculous mnemonic feats without effort, but ordinary people who used specific techniques to remember information; just as a physical athlete doesn't reach the pinnacle of his or her sport without training long and hard, a mental athlete must apply the same dedication and commitment to training the memory. Joshua moved to the UK to be coached by world-renowned memory athlete Ed Cooke in his rural English hideaway. Foer's description of his intensive training with coach Cooke evokes images of the training montages from the Rocky movies: no-mercy coach and gutsy athlete training together in seclusion from the outside world, only re-emerging once the fighter is in a state of perfect readiness.     Don't think for a moment that a book describing memory training and its historical background must be boring. Foer's incisive narrative is littered with witty stories of the endearingly eccentric memory champions who became his friends and peers. Their passion for all things cerebral flows over into their lives as a whole, so much so that by the end of the book, the reader can't help feeling that these would be fun people to have as friends.     Buy it, read it, change your worldview.
0470932139|5.0|This book is the best one I have seen to help improve my food photography. It is written in a conversational style that was easy to understand. My favorite part are the pictures and diagrams.The book is filled with hundreds of delicious looking food photos! I would suggest it to anyone who wants to learn more about what goes into making a great food picture!
0804115613|3.0|The book moved at a very slow pace. I found it not to be as good as the movie, which was why I got it in the first place. Generally, the book is always better than the movie.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I purchased one DVD and one Blu-Ray, just to support the filmmakers and have a DVD I could pass around at work.  It really is pathetic how few people even have clue one about just how they have been systematically ripped off, and destroyed. Say, is dancin' wid da stars on? WooHoo! I wonder who will win?    I assume you are not a dullard if you are researching this film, which was well done and easily worth triple the price; so here are some sites you should attend to if you would like a clue and want to stop being a mindless, gutless, pathetic American Sheep.    w   ww. zerohedge.c o m  w    ww. market-ticker.o rg  dollarcollapse.c o m  w  w   w. lewrockwell.c  o m  w    ww.    silverbearcafe.       c om/private/home.html    In all honesty, it probably is to late for you and your family...but at least you can learn who to blame.
B003O86FMW|4.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is the second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  I found this book to be a little slower paced than the first one, but it does do a better job of building Katniss' character as she struggles with thoughts of rebellion, running away, love for her family, and trying to sort out her feelings for Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />I rated the book down a star because we still lack information to understand what happened 75+ years ago to form the districts, and how things have deteriorated to the point where there is blatant waste in the capital while people are starving and brutalized in most of the districts.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is exactly what I have been looking for in a replacement for the generic Google Android calendar.  The flexible month/week/day views and appointment options are really nice, as is the information box when selecting an individual appointment.  Another great feature are the comprehensive widgets, which are FAR better than any others I've found.  Running this on a rooted Nook Color with Phiremod Gingerbread.
1416550550|5.0|I loved this book and hated to see it end.  The tragedy of Eliza's life, as well as Nell's, is spell binding.  I didn't find it confusing at all, as per another review, and found it simple and engaging to follow along.  This is a must read!
1439102724|5.0|As usual, Jodi Picoult did a phenomenal job doing her research from...LGBT issues to the religious right, music therapy to court trials.  The details were impeccable, and the story line was amazing, real, and current.  As a woman married to another woman, I could relate to many of the inequalities that we face on a daily basis...with our jobs, our family & children, our neighborhood, churches, legal issues and more.  Until people personally know a person who is gay, lesbian, transgender, etc., they can easily be swayed by media, churches, friends, etc into intolerance, bigotry, and even hatred.  It is hard to deny the equalities of people you personally KNOW & appreciate.  Our fears tend to drive our prejudices.  When fear of the unknown is gone, prejudice crumbles.    Jodi, thank you for writing this book.  I was so impressed (again), and admire you for tackling such a 'touchy' issue.  Your passion and courage shine through the words on the pages.  In reading some of the reviews here, I see that the hearts of many were willing to look at Zoe & Vanessa as people instead of those 'sinful lesbians'.  People who have the courage to change their views and be more loving to ALL people, give me hope for this world.    Thank you for the inspiring read.  My copy will get it's wear for sure! :)
0394800184|5.0|This was a book I bought when my daughter was pregnant for the baby.  I read this book over and over to her as a child because she begged me to.  I can't rate it's condition as I had it shipped to her 800 miles away.
031617789X|5.0|The title was chosen, explains Tina, because 'Two and a Half Men' was already taken. Non-stop short bits of humor are used to tell the story of her life, including becoming a director of Summer Showtime programs at Children's' Theater (age 18), her views on race, life with a strong father-figure, dating, first jobs, etc. Even her honeymoon disaster (fire on the ship) becomes funny when Tina tells the story. After college she eventually took improv classes - that turned her life around - she met her husband, spent 9 years on Saturday Night Live, etc. Women should also be certain to pick up on Tina's beauty secrets.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Great app but missing quite a few stations in this area(Norfolk, VA). Get all the stations and I would give it a 5 star rating!!!!

B002C6K7N0|5.0|Megadeth has been out there a while now but if you wonder things might be getting old a bit, think again because this album completely surprises you by providing fresh, hardcore metal and takes your head banging to new heights. Make no mistake, this is not your average metal album from your average metal band. This is Megadeth at its best!    Every song on the album has its own story and makes you reconcieve the fact that Dave Mustaine really is a prodigy. These are not mindless songs that are written in haste between tours just to come up with a new album. There is a real thought process involved in each one. The ones that really stand are \\"Dialectic Chaos\\", \\"1320\\", \\"Bodies\\", \\"Endgame\\", \\"How the Story Ends\\" and \\"The Right to Go Insane\\". In some of these, if you're in the right mood, you may eventually get dizzy because of banging your head too heavily. For example in \\"Bodies\\", it almost feels like Dave is injecting pure metal into your veins. It's a showcase of how beautiful a metal guitar can sound. In \\"1320\\", you feel the volume is never enough and keep turning it up until you get a complaint from your neighbors, or your speakers explode, or actually your head explodes, whichever comes first. Dave also doesn't hesitate to show his emotional side in the song \\"The Hardest Part of Letting Go...\\", which lays down your senses for a moment then takes them back up with another great riff. Not to mention the incredible solos in between these riffs, it all comes down to you towards the finalé that this album is a masterpiece of art in metal and it should be safely stored in UNESCO Metal Heritage Archives for generations to get inspired.    Thank you Dave and Megadeth, for being as good as you are, and for cleaning the rust from our ears.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|great customizations, great user interface, very smooh to use, very intuitive to operate, i also am in love with the little pop ups - this calendar app is the best! i was actually using the free version exclusively before this, thank you amazon!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|If I had known just how good this app was I would have paid for it, it's worth 5 bucks easy, it's extremely well done, 10 stars
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|From Amazon, of course! The first of six in this series of small town cop. I have all six now, for this collection. You can't stop watching these shows, they are great. Too bad there isn't more.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I purchased this item for my daughter, she was hesitant on purchasing a used item on-line.  When we received the item it was in perfect condition.  We also received the item within a couple of days.  Thanks.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I PURCHASED \\"THE TOURIST\\" FROM AMAZON WITH RESERVATIONS, AS MY FRIENDS, WHO DID GO TO THE MOVIES TOLD ME TO AVOID WASTING MY TIME, AS IT WAS VOID IN STORY  AND LEFT ALOT TO BE DESIRED CONSIDERING THE GREAT LEADS THAT HAVE HAD BETTER MOVIES IN THEIR PAST CHOICES....BUT AS I AM A FAN OF BOTH ANGELINA JOLIE AND JONNNY DEPP, I FELT COMPELLED TO BUY IT AND JUDGE FOR MYSELF (IN AUSTRALIA IT IS CHEAPER TO BUY FROM AMAZON, MOST TIMES, THAN PAY FOR A MOVIE TICKET) BUT I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING VIEWING BOTH CINEMATOGRAPHICALLY SPEAKING AND THE ADDED BONUS WAS THE EXCEPTIONAL  BREATHTAKING SHOTS OF VENICE AND THE GLORIOUS WARDROBE FOR ANGELINA JOLIE WAS TO DIE FOR AND SHOWED HER BEAUTY IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.......    WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT MR. DEPP, HE WAS PREDICTABLY QUIRKY IN HIS OWN FASHION AND FUN TO WATCH AND I AM SURE THAT HE ENJOYED THE HOT SCENES WITH MISS JOLIE......BUT WHAT WAS MOST INTERESTING OF ALL, WAS THE TWIST AT THE END, WHICH OF COURSE I AM NOT GOING TO SPOIL FOR EVERYBODY....SHALLOW SCRIPT BUT REALLY WORTHWHILE TO WATCH.    ALL IN ALL I REALLY ENJOYED IT AND IT WAS WORTH THE 3 GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS.  SOPHIA BASTAS
B00028HBKM|5.0|If you dwelled in a reality that was governed by Darkness, a world that the beings in that reality could only survive by eating other beings that carried the same life-force that they did, a world that was constantly in war somewhere, some place, and in that world a story was told about a being who came to save that world: a movie about that being that was at once beautiful and sacred, wouldn't you, if you were Darkness, want to destroy that movie, and what better way to destroy that movie than to destroy the reputation of the man who created that movie, and make him assist in that destruction of his own reputation, so that people would say,\\"Why would I want to see a movie made by such a monster?\\".  Then, of course, that movie would ultimately fade away and Darkness would not have missed a step, and Darkness would continue to prevail, because it knows that even if such a plot would be discovered, it would not be believed.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I MISSED SEEING THIS AT THE MOVIES BUT I WAS SO GLAD THAT I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SHAME TO HAVE MISSED IT ALLTOGETHER.      I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE GREAT BECAUSE I FIND THAT ALL MOVIES WITH MARK WAHLBERG AND CHRISTIAN BALE TO BE WINNERS AND THE FIGHTER WAS NOT ONLY NOMINATED FOR 7 ACADEMY AWARDS BUT ALSO WON THE OSCAR FOR CHRISTIAN BALE AND DESERVABLY SO...IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT MARK WAHLBERG COULD NOT HAVE SHARED THAT OSCAR AS THEY WERE BOTH VERY CREDIBLE AND DEPICTED THE TRUE STORY OF THE TWO BROTHERS WHO COULD NOT HAVE REACHED THEIR GOAL WITHOUT EACH OTHER'S SUPPORT BOTH MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY, AGAINST ALL ODDS.....    I ALSO APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES, THE REAL WARD BROTHERS WERE EXTREMELY HONOURED AND PLEASED WITH THE FINISHED MOVIE DEPICTING NOT ONLY THEIR HARD TIMES BUT WHAT IT DID FOR THEIR IMPOVERISHED TOWSHIP AND HOW IT BROUGHT NEW LIFE AND TOGETHERNESS IN SAD TIMES.     THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL THOSE THAT LOVE TRUE STORIES OF BOXERS WHO DO IT HARD TO GET WHAT THEY ACHIEVE IN THE MOST GRUELLING SPORT OF ALL.  SOPHIA BASTAS
B002ZG99IG|3.0|This is just another weird Single White Female movie. I pretty much got what I expected out of it because it was very predictable, and just as formulaic as the rest of the stalker movies from this genre. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it, it's just that the more and more I kept watching I couldn't help but think that if it wasn't for the \\"CW\\" network this movie wouldn't have a cast.  Quit frankly, between the girls from Gossip Girl, Hellcats, The Vampire Diaries, and One Tree Hill that makes up 90% of the cast (shows that I happen to love by the way). I mean, Billy Zane is barely in it, and Cam Gigandet is just thrown in for good measure. You know they always have to include the dumb jock/rockstar boyfriend who's just as clueless as the female lead of the movie. That's why I think he was strategically put there for no other purpose, but to be the boyfriend who saves the day at the end. I don't know if anyone else missed it, but he's missing for a nice chunk after they meet in the beginning of the movie. Honestly, I won't weigh my review down with a whole lot about the plot because we've all seen this before in some shape, form, or fashion. I just want to tell you what to expect. If you're looking to kill some time with a fun movie..this is for you! If you are looking for something with substance, depth, originality, plot, and a storyline that keeps you enthralled to the bitter end...keep it moving this isn't your cup of tea!<br /><br />In the end, my summation is that the movie is fun, but forgettable in every way. I don't see people knocking down the stores just to own this DVD, so they can watch it over and over again. Then again, when you include all the pre-teen viewers who knows.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I saw this advertised on TCM and was unable to make a copy.  I'm delighted that the DVD is everything the trailer said it would be.
B000002WYW|4.0|Wu-Tang Clan's albums drop in quality in accordance to the order of release    Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) - 10/10  Forever - 8/10  The W - 7/10  Iron Flag - 6.5/10  8 Diagrams - 6    Lyrically, they always deliver, but the energy of their last couple albums lacked the style and charisma that made their 1st album so epic.     Anwyway, Forever, is dope, a lot of filler, but it's good if you favor 1 member (everyone does, Meth is my favorite) because it doubles their exposure whereas a single disc wouldn't allow them to contribute as much.     In my opinion, \\"All Eyez On Me\\", \\"R U Still Down?\\", and \\"Life After Death\\" are completely justifiab;e in their double disc approach.     Some of my favorite artists have dropped double disc albums that would've been classic if they were regular albums (Bone Thugs, Nas, and Wu-Tang)...This would've been much better as a singll disc album.
B000B8QG22|5.0|As an Infantry Platoon leader in Vietnam, I  related to every scene.  I'm very pleased that this story was made into a movie.
B000000OF6|5.0|This collection is very good. All the hits....You can't go wrong with this CD. Once you listen to this a million times you can look for songs, on other CDs, that didn't make the best of. Queen is awesome....
0062060554|3.0|\\"The bedroom is strange. Unfamiliar. I don't know where I am, how I came to be here. I don't know how I'm going to get home.\\" - Christine's day begins like this. Just like the day before, and the day before that, and the day before that, etc.    This debut novel by S. J. Watson was very interesting in the beginning. About half-way through it, though, I said to myself, \\"OK I get the picture. Now get on with it.\\" For me, this was too drawn out with the protagonist, Christine, repeating to herself about how confusing everything is and how bits and pieces of her life before \\"the accident\\" pop into her head. Are they real or imagined? Is her husband, Ben, telling her the truth? Is her doctor? She writes about everything that happens to her in a journal that she hides from Ben. Slowly...very slowly...something like a remembrance of a past life drips into her head drop by drop. Rather than being involved in what happened to her and what will happen to her, I was annoyed to the point that I didn't really care.      The book jacket claims it to be \\"The most talked-about commercial debut of the year: a mesmerizing and unforgettable psychological thriller.\\" For me, it was neither mesmerizing nor unforgettable. My suggestion is to wait until it gets to your local library, if you are curious about it. Don't waste your money. 3.5 Stars
B004KD5TQI|5.0|Movie was cool... The soundtrack was cooler. Old songs remixed. The actors did the remixes. I really liked the music.
B004GYY714|5.0|Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Easy to use, clear, very little jumpiness.  Listening to local Philadelphia sports radio while living in South Dakota.  Recommend highly.
B000065KLO|5.0|What is there to be said about this movie that people don't already know. When I first saw it om Independent Film Channel, I was just in awe over it. Many years later I just had a craving for it again, and so I went on a journey to find it on DVD and what do you know, AMAZON had it. I have watched it several times since the date of purchase and recommend it to anyone who just loves multiple art media in one. It is a riveting tale of a Transsexual Germinate named \\"Hedwig\\" and her struggle to find love and her place in the universe. Beautifully directed by John Cameron Mitchell, full of songs that are guaranteed to make you laugh and cry. I highly recommend this film to anyone; if you ever so like this piece you will also might want to check out his following film, \\"Shortbus\\".
1440503257|5.0|I purchased this cookbook as a Christmas gift for my 15 year old niece, who is also a Harry Potter nut. She went crazy! She immediately dove in and got to baking. (We loved that.) She actually used the cookbook to create some of the goodies at her 16th birthday party. And, due to the response from her friends...blatant jealousy that she had something so cool....we bought another one and used it as a giveaway at her party. The recipes are easy to understand and execute. Each recipe cites where in the books the item is mentioned. This is the perfect gift for any Harry Potter fans that love to bake.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Pretty stoked about this app. I haven't fully explored all it has to offer yet, but I have gone through the standard initial setup and some basic customizations. I like the range of color coding options and its eagerness to sync my calendars. I can't wait to have a few minutes to explore the more advanced features. It downloaded quickly, and installed even faster. Sync was easy and I was finally able to get holidays to show on my calendar (I know, sounds like it should have been a simple thing).  All in all, happy. Thanks, Amazon, for featuring it today, or I may have continued to remain oblivious about this great app!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the show and wanted to have the entire series just in case they ever take the reruns off the air. My 16 year old niece is a fan as well. It's nice to have the complete series around in case we need a GG fix. =)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the angry birds games and just like the others I couldn't stop playing this game til I beat all the levels.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Very quick service....one of the most enjoyable of all musicals....also at the same time received the 10th anniversary copy of Les Mis.....Thank you for prompt service.....
B004N66XYE|5.0|I loved it, just extremely sorry they only made three episodes. I thought there would be at least 6-8. Lovely to see Jean Marsh again. She hasn't aged a bit! How did she do that? Still, there is nothing like the original 1970's series. A wonderful treasure of drama and history.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Received the item in quick order and have viewed some portions which seem in good condition along with the cover and written material. Although this is a somewhat violent movie, it depicts the mind set of uber  American/Western industrialists at the turn of the 19th and 2oth centuries.  And so, it is an interesting study of ambition and greed.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I really like how you can setup the widget to show exactly what you have scheduled. No more sense calendar that just shows a green notch.
0920668372|1.0|I read the book years ago, and I've read a number of the reviews, both pro and con.     Mother is crawling across the floor of the son's room from the time he is about nine. Why? And she keeps doing it!    So let's pretend that it's a father and daughter. He crawls across the floor of his nine year old daughter's room and picks her up... And keeps doing this until she is living across town, and then he brings a ladder.    It creeps me out no matter which parent does it, but you can see why the author (a male) had to write from the mother's viewpoint.    *shudder*
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Every possible feature I need in a calendar has been thought of here.  It is very easy to learn all of the features.

0062017926|5.0|This book is the third book within the SIGMA Force series (not including the prequel Sandstorm)   The book set's the bar higher in the SIGMA seris, This book is full or Ruins, Facts, and deep story-line that incompasses the entire book.   The book is full of mystery, action, and charictar depth. This book, so far is my favorite of the SIGMA seris and I recomended ot to anyone who wants a good book to read.   This book will grab you and won't let go.   Buy your copy! you won't be dissapointed.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I was surprised by this movie. I had read the book but I had (and still have) some unanswered questions. Primarily, how did Karl Rove get off without even a reprimand? How did Richard Armitage avoid prosecution? That is not to say that Scooter Libby was blameless, but he seems to have absorbed ALL the blame. If you are looking for answers to those questions, this movie won't help. If you want to know whether or not the press is in the hands of the Right, you've come to the right place. There is a huge gap between truthful reporting and what really happens.
0756404738|5.0|I found this immensely entertaining. All I can say is, where is the next one ? I envy the person who has read neither of the first two and now has both they can read back to back - what a treat.
B004FOA84A|4.0|OK, I'll start out by saying that I'm an old school Myst player.  This app reminded me of the fun I had playing that game way back when.  Graphics are great and puzzles are challenging but not frustrating.  There is no re-play value in the game, but I did enjoy watching my wife work her way through it once I finished it.  A sequel would be an awesome addition.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I was, by anyone's standard, no longer normal. In my own unique way, I had become severely mentally ill.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I follow politics very closely and I had no idea how this started. It seems unlikely that a group of people simply got greedy and crashed the housing market. I read everything I could find on derivatives and the burst of the housing bubble but the starting point was still obscured. Now I know how it was done but that leaves another unanswered question which is, \\"will this happen again?\\" The answer appears to be \\"yes, inevitably\\". The paradox is that the housing crisis was caused by people who gave mortgages to those who couldn't pay and then raided the government insurance plans to get their money back. Then they use their elected positions to slam \\"big government\\". A mortgage is supposed to be for people to pay off after about 30 years. It is not for banks to finance, counting on government money to guarantee the loan. You don't want to see this movie if you want to see a rosy picture of the future.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I was always disappointed with the calendar application on my droid. This app is the answer! It is visually pleasing, easy to use, easy to update, and of course connects the addresses in your appointments with the maps feature. You can have your appointments displayed as color coded bars or text. I love it!
B004TTMYQG|3.0|This is a nice app, but unfortunately the agenda widget does not scroll. I have been using LauncherPro Plus' calendar widget and may have to go back to that because I really like being able to scroll through my agenda. Hopefully the developer will add this soon.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|I can tell there are some cool features, but the app is ugly and hard to navigate. I'll keep it installed just for the times when the default calendar can't do what I need it to.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This app takes all the functionality and integration of Google and Android calendars, but drastically improves the graphical front end.

I am an avid outdoorsman and this book has taken the next step in my broad knowledge of the outdoors. I highly recommend this book for the casual outdoor enthusiast or the experienced traveler alike. I personally have enjoyed the section on how to build traps out of existing forestry material and a more in-depth review plants and there uses.<br /><br />Great book!
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Surtur Rising isn't a huge stylistic change for Amon Amarth - if you're a fan already, this release is a no-brainer. Get it. If you're new to Amon Amarth - this is (in my opinion) their best release for a couple of reasons, so... get it.    Why is it their best yet?    Technically, it's an excellent recording. Sound quality is top-notch; instruments and voice can all be heard clearly (well, for this type of music, anyway ;)  The band members are all in top form; I especially like the \\"singing\\" on this one (singing is in quotes because, to a normal person, Amon Amarth's singing probably sounds like an ogre with a bad chest plegm problem but if you're a fan you're OK).    Musically, it builds on Twilight of the Thunder God's style, but often resembles Versus the World also (super-fast chugging guitar passages). There are a few standout songs that do represent an evolution for Amon Amarth: Wrath of the Norsemen is so excellent and intense that I have hit \\"Repeat\\" quite a few times... For Victory or Death is another brilliant effort. (Don't you love the upbeat song titles?)    Anyway, for anyone who loves very heavy, fast, intense, viking-style metal, this one should be on your must-buy list. My only regret is that I can't make it to the Amon Amarth concert in my area.
B004BBDHEK|2.0|When Private Music introduced musicians like Yanni and Patrick O'Hearn back in the mid 80's, I was delighted to hear something different. Mr. Yanni Chryssomalis touched my feelings as I sailed the Aegean Sea on warm summer days. Some 25 years later I find it impossible to feel the same way as I listen to the \\"Truth of Touch\\". There are 15 songs on this album and I tried rating the tracks with the feelings of those days, but sadly the average turned out to be just 2 stars. The nicer tracks being \\"Mist of a Kiss\\", \\"Truth of Touch\\" and \\"Nine\\", and the mediocre ones \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Guilt of Pleasure\\" and \\"Voyage\\". The rest is not like Yanni I am familiar with. I guess I'll have to wait for the next one to hear something more like \\"Keys to Imagination\\", hopefully!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Ms. King's songs have so much feeling in them. I can't help singing the songs along with her. When she sings that she feels \\"the earth move under my feet,\\" I feel the same way.  Her songs really have soul to them because she writes them, sings them, and plays the piano with them. I would definitely buy more of her music.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|Mind-numbing boring is the main problem for these books - there is no drama, even though werewolves exist.  Apparently, walking around and laying on beds are huge plots to this author.  OMG, we went outside, wow, huge drama.  We then went to this restaurant, huge drama to order something to eat.    The male characters are described in the way a middle school girl would like them to be.  The author must be stunted in intelligence and experience.  Even middle school girls expect a little more sophistication in their books.    Wait, no the worst part of this book is the lack of humor. I think they are supposed to be funny in parts, but it is just plain dumb.    Embarrassingly bad.    DO NOT BUY.  You will be sorely disappointed.
B004G600A4|5.0|I took my 10-1/2-year-old son and daughter to see this movie, and we all loved it.  The twists on the original plot are smart, funny, and even thought-provoking. The songs, which are glorious, fit seamlessly into the plot.  Furthermore, they advance, rather than merely echo, the action.  Indeed, when we first saw the movie, we had traveled most of the way home before I realized the movie was a musical. This is a film for all ages.
B003CN3ZE0|4.0|GREAT live album! Even better if you're a White Stripes fan. I've got the CD/DVD combo of this. I believe it was a Best Buy exclusive kind of thing.<br /><br />The CD: 16 live amazing cuts. Some more raw and more passionate than on the studio releases. A couple songs I didn't know here before, but now love as much as the others. They do a good cover of Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene\\". Good track sequencing I think, with songs taken pretty evenly from though their career. Not only a superb live disc, but this also serves as the closest thing to a \\"hits\\" album until an official one is released.<br /><br />The DVD: Excellent bonus. A live DVD the way it should be done. Includes performances from all over Canada, big and small, as well as plenty of interviews of the two (ok, mostly Jack). This can be bought seperately from the CD also.<br /><br />Overall a must for the true fan. They will be missed. I suspect Jack won't disappear, I hope Meg doesn't either. She'll always be my favorite busty goth cheerleader...drummer.
0060899220|4.0|and I don't have chef experience, but as a writer, this memoir gave me the occasional twinge of unworthiness. Bourdain has a keen eye, a sharp ear, and an incredibly(although appealingly) dirty mouth. Of course, try as  I might, I could never write *this* book, because it's a New York book written by a man who appears to have clarified butter in his veins--a function of time, place, and experience. Thanks for having \\"No Reservations\\" about being so honest, chef. I'm definitely reading more of your work.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Series is great as I remembered.  I did miss some of the music that appeared in the original shows.  They offered something about extra fees to be paid to get permission.  OH WELL it was only 30 seconds out of each episode.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD is a great one, though the seller of this item did not describe the condition of the CD as it truly was.  When I tried to get my money back, the seller refused, even though the CD skips in places.  The seller said, \\"the CD plays great.\\" So I bought it used, instead of new.  I know, I'll never use this seller again.

0307472841|5.0|The Man from Beijing is an excellent new Henning Mankell novel. The exciting book is both police procedural and an international thriller dealing with Chinese politics at the highest level of government.<br />  The complex plot begins with the brutal slaying of 19 people in a remote Swedish village named Hundisvall. The slaughter is investigated by Judge Birgitta Roslin. Roslin is the mother of four grown children. She is having intimacy issues with her husband and is dealing with high blood pressure concerns. She visits China along with a female childhood friend to delve further into the perplexing mass murder.<br /> The novel also contains the story of a Chinese family of brothers who work on the railroads in te American West during the 1860s. The family is mistreated by a Swedish railroad boss vowing vengeance.<br />  The novel's action is painted on a broad canvas with scenes set in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the United States, Africa and China. Though this is a non Kurt Wallender novel the book holds your attention, makes you think about the roll of China in the 21st century and keeps you reading until the thrilling conclusion. Mankell has produced a first rate work of noir fiction.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Within the lapse of a decade, Hollywood has always prized some British film. So during the fifties and sixties, the maxim exponent of the British cinema - David Lean - with Bridge on River Kwai and Lawrence de Arabia, and Carol Reed with Oliver, the eighties with Chariots of fire and Gandhi, the nineties with The Englih Patient and Shakespeare in love.<br /><br />So, the first decade of this raising century The King's speech emerges from the theatrical stages to become the greatest film of this year. Captivating, absorbing, intriguing supported on a script zealously well written, a superb artistic direction and aditionally towering performances from all the cast.<br /><br />You may feel how the director makes use of a flexible tempo in order to make us aware about the different factors that preceed the big moment: the speech from his Majesty to the Nation. The magnificent edition and the agile narrative rhthym never falls into commonplaces or cheap sentimentalism. The amazing dramatic development of the evolution in what concerns personality through three key sequences during the movie (such as the initial confrontation with his tutor, the dialogue with his brother and finally the right move when he disautorizes the advise of the Priest and decides for his own to continue with his preceptor)is a visible example of genuine leadership at the moment to assume and take important decisions as a future King. The film acquires a distinctive and mesmerizing organic flowing, that gradually captures even the most exigent viewer.<br /><br />I would like to remark \\"the touch of genius device\\" at the moment to support the speech with Beethoven's Seventh Symphony Second Movement, hovered by the well sublime noblesse and aristoctratic majesty.<br /><br />A winner film all the way through!!!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is a terrific calendar, especially coming from a rooted Eris. I love the ability to change the viewing style (month, week, agenda, etc) and I really love all the widget options. My only comments would be that I would really like the ability to make a new calendar or be able to make certain events different colors. Also, and this is pretty nit-picky, I think the month view calendar widget could use a looks update. The agenda view looks great and I would like to see the month view look just as good.Overall this app is definitely worth trying since its free today, though I think its worth the price if you missed the free offer.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've used the free version for months and I love it. it has everything I'm looking for. better than stock app.
B004LFO0ME|1.0|Listen, if you are a fan of Wiz Khalifas earlier work( Flight School, POTC 1 & 2, BAR, Kush & OJ, i'll even say Cabin Fever) then theres a VERY low chance you will enjoy this album. I know personally as an old fan my heart was broken. Love song after love song, and while that isnt that bad, its the poppy lyrics and instrumentals he uses that ruins this album for me. In one album Wiz Khalifa contradicts every thing he once said he stands for. Please dont think im some Wiz Khalifa hater who decided to trash him on Amazon, I am really a fan. As a matter of fact the only reason im writing this is because Amazon asked me too. I had high hopes for this album but in the end it was a waste of money, and i gave the album to some high school kid, because they seem to be his target audience now. Sell out.

I like its potential if I can find a way to fix the issues I am having.  First of all I'm trying out at work and using wifi it shows 2 bars and I know at home I can get full wifi. So I am picking stations and they keep cutting out even the pod casts. Any advice?
0553386794|4.0|I have never been into fantasy fiction. My favorites have been science fiction, mysteries,and horror. But,this one really grabbed my attention. From the first chapter about The Wall to the tragedy of the Starks,this is first rate fantasy. I can see where the the War of the Roses influenced A Game of Thrones. Noble houses grappling for control and power of a kingdom. Plus, all the treachery, lust and violence make for great drama.

0307346617|5.0|Addictively readable, frighteningly plausible, and undeniably masterful.<br /><br />When trying to describe what makes 'World War Z' such a great book, one runs out of adjectives quickly.  What Max Brooks has done here is nothing short of genius. Quite frankly, while reading, it was hard to remember that this was all fabrication - there is the ring of truth at the heart of this fiction.<br /><br />The idea is simple: use the structure and concept of Studs Terkel's landmark history of World War Two ('The Good War') and make it tell instead the story of an undead epidemic in the near future as a historical document of the war against the zombie (or \\"Z\\" or \\"Zed Head\\" or \\"Zack\\" - the names for the undead are many). Starting at the advent of the first infected to the rapid spread of the plague to the turn of the tide and beyond, Brooks tells the whole story in the words of those who experienced it.<br /><br />What seems simple in principle can't have been as easy to do, and the craft here is admirable. Each story is unique and adds a piece of the puzzle while never revealing the full picture. Each voice is distinct and authentic. Each facet is moving in some way.<br /><br />From those who saw it happen from on high in the International Space Station to those who fought in the tunnels beneath Paris. From the soldiers who survived the disastrous Battle of Yonkers to those who were witness to the Battle of Hope. From the otaku who climbed to safety in Japan to the freedom fighter in the Middle East. From the trainer of a canine war veteran to \\"the Whacko,\\" the man who was once Vice President of the United States.<br /><br />In 'World War Z' we hear from each of these people, and many many more. Through subtle and clever cultural references and deep political background we see the world as it might become in the face of such catastrophe, when the entire human race is faced with total war against a relentless opponent. It changes the face of life on Earth and the way we look at war.<br /><br />All this in a book about zombies? You bet your life.<br /><br />'World War Z' is the first book I've read that takes the idea of an undead epidemic completely seriously. There are no winks to the reader or superheroes to save the day. It plays every fear to the hilt, and never falters. Simply put, this is a book that doesn't screw around. It goes right for the throat.<br /><br />There's a neat trick in 'World War Z,' a little misdirection that takes you by surprise. On the surface, it's a book about a zombie war - a completely ridiculous concept, right? But there are truths here that most books never touch, about brutality and war and fear, and also about honesty and faith and hope.<br /><br />The truth at the heart of 'World War Z' is the truth of the human spirit.

B003QO8TDC|5.0|I first saw Flashdance when I was 13 years old.  I've seen it like 300 times and can almost recite the whole movie.  I still enjoy it to this day.  I love the music and all the dance numbers.  My favourite is the dance to Imagination.  It's so 80's and I love the strobe light effect.  If ur in a dark room it totally strobes and trips you out. Flashdance has a wonderful underlying message and that is to go after your dreams, don't give up on urself and believe in the power of dance and music.

Oh and the widget choices are nice.
067144901X|5.0|I love all of Sandra Boynton's books but this is one of my favorites. It is not too wordy and perfect for a little one. We read this book before every nap to help baby wind down and she has shown more interest in this book than most of her others, even Goodnight Moon. I think the large black and white illustrations in this book are more visually appealing to her. I also recommend The Barnyard Dance by Sandra Boynton. It is a fun, sing song type book that parent and baby will both enjoy.
0316069485|5.0|Connelly proves once again how he's the master of the modern crime thriller, this time again merging Micky Haller and Harry Bosch in a 25 year old case of a man accused of kidnapping and murdering a young girl from an affluent Los Angeles neighborhood, who's conviction is about to be reversed. Frankly it's amazing to me that Connelly after over twenty novels still manages to mine good stories with a credible amount of suspense, and forward momentum for his characters, without selling them out. Really entertaining read.
1608201236|5.0|The final volume in this series is perhaps the best. With his store undergoing enlargement, gay writer and bookseller Adrien English uncovers a 50-year-old skeleton under the floorboards. The job of identifying the victim and then his murderer is full of surprises, twists and red herrings--quite a delight. In the interim our hero is re-establishing contact with all the great loves of his life as if he is interviewing candidates for a \\"life's mate\\" position. This is a wonderful series but we must congratulate the author for knowing when to \\"pull the plug.\\" No over-kill. Thanks for many happy hours.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I thought Hillary Swank and Choloe Sevigny did amazing performances.  There were times where you could tell Hillary was a female though but overall she meshed into her character flawlessly.  The only part I didn't like in the film is the rape sequence.  At that point I already hated the 2 guys so when they raped Tina Brandon, I wanted to skip past the scene.  Actually I ended up hating the entire family including the mother because they were poor white trash and totally incompassionate.  This was an interesting story and there wasn't a dull moment.  I almost wanted to cry at the end when the cop was interviewing Tina Brandon, and she told him the reason why she was doing what she was doing was because of sexual identity crisis.
B000FC13E0|5.0|I like that the book was kind of like a TV show, it moved fast passed most of the time. There were lots of twist and turns that were unexpected, or when you expected something to happen it didn't go the way you though it would go. This book has great character development, entertaining story.       The main protagonist Jack worked for a computer programming company. He then was fired after he learned that the company was corrupt. Jack's wife Julia works for a nanotechnology company Xymos, Jack later works there. Jack has some problems with his wife and thinks that she is cheating on him. He goes through denial, anger, and depression Jack takes care of his kids, and his wife is rarely around. Jack is angry about this. Then one night jack daughter wakes up in the night screaming, she is swollen and red, and in pain. He takes her to Xymos for an MRI, and then she is fine. After this Jack works for Xymos. The nanobots called the swarm escape; these nanobots are programmed with program Jack made called prey. They nonobots are smart and learn from experience. They are evolving and becoming more of a threat as time goes on. They must be destroyed     I really like how the book connects every thing together, and that everything that happens in the book, happens for a reason. Things in the book really didn't go the way I though they would especially the ending. When the people drank the virus after being infected with nanobots, I expected the nanobots to die. Because that what the virus is going to kill, but that not how it happened. They died instead because there body's where made of nanobots. I didn't even see that coming. I love a book with a good thrill.    How the characters develop in the book based on the situations, conflicts and how the live, catches your attention. Jack said, \\"If something can go wrong, it will go wrong, they will\\" this was a theme the theme for the whole book. I knew while reading the book that something would go wrong but I expected everything to be ok in the end. There would be a happy ending, but it didn't. They destroyed everything. Most of the characters in the book were infected with nanobots or dead. They destroyed everything and all evidence and data that this even happened. I am not sure if jack is infect or dead at the end because he just blackout.  It's not really clear what happens to him. I am not sure if he went to sleep or died, but I think he just went to sleep.      It ended like the movie End of Evangelion, and it just left you hanging. Who know maybe there will prey 2 or some type sequel to the book? After all 10 years later they made a remake of Evangelion, rebuild of Evangelion. The first move Evangelion 1.0 starts out the same as the first 6 episodes, and then Evangelion 2.0 is completely different story and new characters. You don't even know what going to happen in 3.0 or 4.0. This is really sequel to Evangelion, not a remake.  They just made it that way to make the story more of a thrill. Because everything that happens, happened for a reason, just like in the book prey.  They didn't destroy all the nanobots, maybe some escaped and infected every thing on the planet. Maybe they were all infected from the beginning, like his kids. Who know what happens.  They way the book ends it almost like there would be a sequel. Because I don't think that jack die, I think he just went to sleep, and he not going to forget about something like this ever happening. Even if jack did die, his kids are also infected, and they didn't destroy the nanobots in them. This isn't the end, there is still more to it. There are more nanobots, they didn't destroy all of them.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a lot.  We usually think of Queen Victoria as she was in her older years, but this shows her as a vibrant young woman.  We also don't usually hear or see much about her upbringing, as a sheltered princess.  I never realized how isolated she was or how her mother and her mother's advisor tried to pressure her into accepting a regency.  Anyway, the movie was well-written and well cast.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about Queen Victoria's early years.
0765318741|5.0|I'm usually not one of those people that reads the book AFTER seeing the movie, but this was the case for this particular story. I seen the Will Smith version and was somewhat confused as not much was explained correctly.  It was all too 'extreme' with the way the movie portrays it.<br /><br />The book (or rather short story) is really a fascinating dive into the brain of the last survivor of a vampiric plague. It really makes you feel like that last person siting there, while reading in bed imagining Vampires bouncing bricks off your house.  The different moods the main character goes through in his daily routine.<br /><br />Only thing I didn't like was the ending, but not for the reason that it ends, but that because after I flipped to the main page and continued reading 5-6 more pages before I realized I was reading ANOTHER short story.  This cover makes no mention of 'short storys' it just finishes the 'I am legend' one and continues into another, and another, and another.<br /><br />So it left me confused if THAT was it? that was the ending? But then I got pissed off because I kept reading and was confused by other short stories.  I can't say I really enjoyed the other ones tho, I bought this book for 'I am Legend'.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|awesome app, been trying to find something that plays bbc 1xtra.. not only does it play it, it'll search for recent played shows by djs as well! boom.
0316069353|5.0|Normally I don't do the reviews, but I just finished this book and enjoyed it very much. Yes, there was a lot of court room procedures, but that is what the book was about. Enjoyed the characterizations and the ending.    Also, I have a Kindle, but got the book from the library. I would not give a book 1 star based on the price especially as there are other alternatives to get the book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I travel a lot and this helps long drives bearable. Especially AM stations where you normally do not get clear reception, they are crystal clear on this app. Soo much to choose from.  Ability to record streaming audio.  Add favorite stations.  Search shows.  This app is incredibly easy to use.  Great for office use as long as you have good connection. Only minor con is that it taxes the battery a bit.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Blows the default calendar out of the water.  Actually worth $6 if you're a business user, I actually feel a little guilty using this for free. Nice thing is apps like launcher pro's calendar widget integrate perfectly with all the add/delete/etc features. Can also view multiple accounts on one calendar. Very nice.   Love the user interface. When someone's work week doesn't start on a sunday or monday, smooth scrolling a day at a time feels much more natural and useful. Only gripe is how small everything is but there's a lot of info here, and this would be perfect for a tablet as well.  5/5, A+
0738711500|4.0|I find having the book to read about the cards is very helpful.  The cards themselves are very beautiful.

B004DSX5B6|1.0|First off I'd like to say I own several multitools. I have 6 different Leatherman tools, a Coleman, Winchester and now this Gerber. I like Gerber knives so I figured I would give this multitool a try.<br />Some Features I like: It has a Rubber grip on the handle, nice fit and finish, Spring loaded pliers, a cool locking tool design and scissors, Nail nicks on the fold out tools and nubs on the knife blades that make deployment easy. It has a quality sheath however incorperates an inside pocket for survival instructions that constantly catches the tool when you try to holster it.<br />Features I did not like: Most of the tools that fold out are too small to use effectively. The phillips screwdriver seems to be copied from Coleman (Made over 10 years ago)and is a complete failure,Even my relatively low cost Winchester has it beat, the straight slot drivers are ok but could be better. The saw blade is too small to effectively use on anything larger than a dime sized diameter branch. The knives are sharp but small. The bottle / can opener is a cleaver design but when I put the can opener to work it seems to not be sharp enough to do a good job of cutting through the can lid. My other tools breeze through cans with ease. I tried out the cutters in the jaws to cut through a zip tie and was dissapointed, it took a few tries, my others slice through easily.<br />For comparison my go tool tool is the Leatherman Supertool 300. It is almost 3/4\\" longer but 1/2\\" narrower. I have also broken my leatherman tools 3 times over the years (They get heavy use)and I sent them in for repair and they always have returned them very quickly. As a technician this tool falls short for me, if you don't use multitools much this may be a good tool for you.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|Wow... where do you start with a film like this.  Very overwhelming to think that fracking is even legal.  The power of money moves many,but the POWER OF THE PEOPLE CAN DO MORE.... I watched this film 2 months ago and lost 2 nights sleep over it... truly that disturbing!!!  Then one day I was reading our local paper to find out that 11 wells will be fracked in my little home town in Pa.  I was so shocked to find this issue on my door step.  I live in a great community of strong good people and they are taking on the fight to stop the fracking here.      This film was such an eye opener I feel every adult and older children should see the results of greed.  We all need to do a better job of taking care of our dear earth....   GASLAND has touched me so I know I will never think of drilling in the same way.  Be aware and get educated....  Keep fracking out of our nation!
B0000C23DO|5.0|I'm not a collector of the Dead but I have heard various recordings from them, read the reviews on here and loved this collection of songs. Some think they are not talented, come on, if your around as long as they have been then they did something right! I do believe they never had the hits and were more popular \\"Live\\" then their studio albums but this is a good look into this band. It also has tracks from different labels which makes this the most complete collection available. So if your music listener looking for something different but yet intriguingly different then the regular bands out there (this band is better then anything coming from Britney Spears folks!)then, give it a try, like I say, not a Dead collector but just a casual listener of their music. Check it out, a mix of rock/country.<br />Check my site out sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" & say \\"Hi\\".
B002JYPV3G|5.0|I  SAW  SLIPKNOT  I  THINK  IT  WAS  1996  OR  1997  AT  OZZFEST.  THEY  ARE  ONE  OF  THE  MOST  BRUTAL  BANDS  I  LOVE  IT.  A  MATTER  OF  FACT  THEY  WERE  THE  MOST  BRUTAL  BAND  ON  THE  SECOND  STAGE.  ANYWAY  SLIPKNOT  IS  THE  BEST  AT  WHAT  THEY  DO  AND  THAT'S  MAKE  VERY  AGGRESSIVE  SONGS.  IF  YOU  LOVE  AGGRESSIVE  MUSIC  AS  MUCH  AS  I  DO  SLIPKNOT  (10TH  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION  CD/DVD)  IS  THE  BAND  TO  BUY.

6305212112|5.0|This is a very interesting movie, which juxtaposes the story of Whistle Stop during the l920's and 30's against the rapport between the old lady (Ninny Threadgood) and Evelyn Couch who visits her in the nursing home and listens with rapt attention to the story Ninny tells her.  I thought it was an excellent movie and have watched it many times.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles DO reach a peak with Revolver, but they never climb down  It seems to be the new conventional wisdom in pop music journalism that the Beatles in fact peaked with `Revolver' in 1966. Indeed, it is a great album. However, a lot more equally-great albums lay ahead. And the greatest of them all may have been the 4-LP 46-song extravaganza called `Black Box' (1973), aka `The Black Album'. I challenge you to find that one.

0316069353|5.0|Michael Connelly is far enough along in his writing career where you aren't going to get a novel that just overwhelms you in its greatness. However, for long time fans and for readers first discovering Connelly (perhaps from the movie THE LINCOLN LAWYER), THE FIFTH WITNESS is a really good novel, and one of Connelly's best in awhile.<br /><br />Mickey Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer, so named because he rides around in a Lincoln while working in the back seat. Haller was featured in Connelly's last novel and is back, this time making his money defending people from home foreclosures.<br /><br />Haller gets back in the business as a defense attorney when a women he's defending in a foreclosure is accused of murdering the banker trying to foreclose on her. Suddenly, Haller's involved in a high-profile case with a client who might actually be innocent.<br /><br />Why this novel is good: It's a great legal thriller where we follow the prosection and defense from end to end. While not in court, Haller is spending time with his daughter and trying to mend the relationship with his first ex-wife, Maggie McFierce.<br /><br />I thought THE REVERSAL, the novel before this one, lacked the ending to make it really good. THE FIFTH WITNESS is good to the very end, and the resolution of the case and Haller's personal life are pretty good. This novel shows that even though Connelly is writing 2 books a year now, he is still one of the very best.
B003Y8YXGM|4.0|Lennon in fact had a very productive 16 months or so when he was AWAY from Yoko and WITH May Pang, notwithstanding all Yoko's propaganda to the contrary. `Walls & Bridges' features several Beatlesworthy gems: Whatever Gets You hrough the Night, #9 Dream, Scared, Steel and Glass and Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out). Two other worthy songs--Surprise Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox) and Bless You--are a tad overproduced (a Lennon prediliction), and I regard the earlier takes on the `Lennon Anthology' as preferable. With basic music-editing software I reduced `What You Got' to a very punchy 2-minute screamer/lament for a drunken debauch. I don't think much of `Going Down on Love' or `Old Dirt Road', but nice Lennon song-lets can be carved away from the carcasses with the same software.   Are the above-cited tracks great Lennon? I prefer to regard them and listen to them as great `Beatles Releasing Collective' material, best heard in alternation with the best of same-era material from the other three Beatles. Beatles genius was nowhere near exhausted as of early 1970. Not by a long shot.

B004TTMYQG|3.0|Although Business Calendar looks better, and has more settings/adjustments, Calendar Pad (free) seems to work better for me on my Droid2. Business Calendar keeps on using one of my additional calendars in Google Calendars as the default. I tried changing the settings to ensure my main calendar was the first one to accept new appointments, but Business Calendar had a fetish for the secondary calendar. This means that by default, all new reminders/events are stored in the secondary calendar unless you change this every single time you make a new event. My secondary calendar happened to be my Flogs account, which I use for storing MotoGP dates and Superbike World dates. How silly is it to store a new event for my dentist appointment within the same calendar that I use for MotoGP and SBK races?<br /><br />I found Calendar Pad works better because it just syncs directly with Google Calendar, where I manage my additional calendars. Calendar Pad's default new events uses my main calendar, so it doesn't interfere with the secondary calendar.<br /><br />Overall, I will continue to use Calendar Pad free which seems to be far more easier to use.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is a very intuitive easy to use app with tons of features. I would highly recommend this to my friends.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Heard about a new take on the Robin Hood saga and was not impressed with the idea nor the trailers. Having been raised on the Errol Flynn traditional version I found it hard to accept what I was seeing in the ads for the movie. Had to watch it a few times before everything started to jell in my mind. Basically, since the Robin Hood saga are probably folk tales anyway, (although there are OE stories about a Robin Hood) I finally accepted the Russell Crowe Robin Hood as just more of the fantasy that envelopes the whole saga down through the centuries. This Robin Hood could be called a pre-quel to all the others. Since no stories exist about how Robin came to be an outlaw in the forest, this movie filled in admirably with a very believable story about his life before outlawhood.  Russell Crowe did a great job as Robin Longstride, and Cate Blanchett was a outstanding Lady Marian. (this part belies the Maid Marian parts of the other interpretations of the saga.)    So the movie turned me from being a critic of the basic plot to a huge fan of the movie once I got it settled in my mind where it fit into the big picture.     Highly recommend this movie if taken on the premise that it is a pre-quel to the original tales.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|this is avrils lavignes 2ed album and my fav from her. she is my fav singer and i just love her so much.  this album really shows how deep she can go when she dose song writing. this album is much darker than all of her other albums. its really raw personal and i gusse you could say 'emo,goth' but to me its avril and i think this should be ownd by all pop/rock fans. heres my track by track    take me away: 10/10    Together: 10/10    dont tell me: 10/10    he wasnt: 9/10    how dose it feel: 10/10    my happy ending: 10/10    nobodys home: 10/10    forgotten: 8/10    who knows: 9/10    fall to pieces: 10/10    freak out: 10/10    Slipped Away: 9/10    my fav songs off this album is my happy ending freak out fall to pieces are songs i seem to never get tired of and i feel like my happy ending is the best song ever becuase its so pretty how her voice gose with the song even tho the meaning of it is sad but in my book the best song ever and one of the best albums as well. DIFF WORTH BUYING!
1401225756|5.0|This is one of the most imaginative and interesting books I have ever read. I read this book originally 3 or so years ago and I have not been able to shake it from my brain ever since. I am not a big fan of caped crusaders or the usual fanfare for comic books, I tend to lean more toward the \\"graphic novel\\" side of the genre, but this stands out as my favorite. I have been able to re-read this 10 or so times since the time I bought it and it never gets old. It inspires me to think of cool new things and imagine new worlds for me to play around in. If you are a fan of comic books and haven't read this, what are you waiting for! If you aren't a fan of comic books, then you need to read this. It is on my top 5 list of all time, for sure. Do not miss this book.
B0034G4OUO|2.0|Dwayne Johnson (Driver) after being in prison for 10 years gets out of prison and starts to hunt down everybody on his list who killed his half brother.  There are two people who chase him: Billy Bob Thonton (a cop about to retire) and Oliver Jackson (a hitman).<br /><br />I did not care for the music, especially in the beginning of the movie.  The script was sparse.  And way at the end when Driver was shot in the head, because of the metal plate on the back of his head, he survived it.  That part was too much to swallow for me.  But the plot and the acting was good.<br /><br />There was lot of action, but not much of any special effects.

B004G600A4|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable to watch. I loved the music and the cute storyline taking a spin off a classic fairytale.  Thank goodness these delightful types of movies are still being made.
B0038Z5T4Q|4.0|I had seen this movie many years ago and watched it again last week.  It was just as enjoyable as it was the first time around.<br /><br />In this movie, ambitious stock broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) finally hooks up with Wall Street shark Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) to make easy money, and lots of it quickly.  Gekko accomplishes his goals by buying companies and splitting them up, and by collecting insider information from people around him.  At some point Bud Fox finds himself at odds with his father who believes in making a living the good old-fashioned way, by working hard and becoming useful.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is that the greed is good in all its shapes and forms as disclosed in a speech by Gekko at the height of the story.  Well, I don't know about you, but I disagree with that proposition.  Greed is like anything else: a good motivator in moderation, but very destructive in excess.  The latest examples of this point was the mortgage backed security debacle which almost destroyed the whole economy.  However, other excesses continue in the form of multi-million dollar CEO salaries.  Greed causes imbalances in the economy kind of like constipation in the human body.  Maybe greed is good for the greedy, but at the expense of destroying the lives of many others.<br /><br />I don't like Oliver Stone movies much because he creates his own version of real-life stories, but this one I liked.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|This album is a great rock/alternative album.  The meaning behind the lyrics is very inspirational for young kids/adults to be who they are and not who people say they should be.  Speak out, speak your mind. Don't worry about what others think of you.  Make a positive impact in the world.  Quote from one of the songs \\"You only live forever in the lights you make.\\" I've already recommended this album to all of my friends and family.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Unbelievably bad; I'd sooner have my teeth pulled out one by one than to have to sit through this again.  I can't say anything positive about it: script and acting very amateurish.  If I hadn't seen Billion Dollar Baby, Mystic River, etc. I would never have known that the director made brilliant movies.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my first Jillian Michaels workout. I don't watch her on TV, so I bought this dvd solely based on the glowing reviews.  Sure, I've seen routines with better cueing, better music, better dvd chaptering,...etc., but I have gotten RESULTS (which is what I'm looking for) after only three workouts on level one.  I am seeing more muscle definition and have lost about an inch already, and the other routines are longer, to attain similar results.  Also, there is no dread factor with this one; I figure I can keep up with just about any trainer for less than 30 minutes.  For the price, it's a good investment in my health and fitness.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought North and South based on the description of the product and the customer reviews.  It surpassed my expectations as it is an excellent production.  The music, the scenery, the actors, everything was fantastic.  I love period pieces and this one is the best I have ever seen.  I especially enjoyed the interaction between the Higgins (Nicholas, Bessy and Mary) with Margaret Hale; and of course the tension between John Thornton and Margaret Hale.  I highly recommend this product.

0061353248|5.0|I found this book to be highly entertaining and useful.    Rational decision-making is an important axiom of basic economic theory.  Dan Ariely argues in this book that not only is individual decision making often not irrational, but systematically irrational, thus producing large scale economic effects.  A variety of individual biases are identified and explained in an entertaining way through anecdotes and studies.  I can say that I experience many of the biases identified in this book on a daily basis.    That being said, this book is not a rigorous behavioral study, nor did I expect it to be (A book can't possibly hope to be scientifically rigorous and entertaining to a general audience, right?).  Because of this, the book is not likely to provide you with the details required to make financial decisions concerning \\"predictably irrational\\" behavior.  However, if that is your aim, this book might still provide a valuable starting point.  The many insights provided in this book could help you to identify relevant articles in a variety of behavioral science journals.    This book is worth a read if you're the curious type.
0439023483|2.0|I'll get the good stuff out of the way. You will refuse to put down The Hunger Games. It's a rapidly paced suspense thriller that puts you in the midst of the action with clever action and a fully fleshed out main duo. The action scenes are realistic, brutal and unrelenting. You should know the plot already, but if you don't, imagine Gary Paulsen's \\"Hatchet\\" fused with Kôshun Takami's \\"Battle Royale.\\"    There, now onto the not-so-great parts. The tone is awkward at best. For example, in the first third, the players are preparing to be sent into gladiatoral combat against their will, but the main character spends too much of that time admiring how wonderful she looks after a makeover. The pace keeps you entranced, but there's no real dramatic weight after the lottery scene at the beginning. It's unfitting, but forgivable. The really annoying part is what happens when the games actually start.     There are only three real characters in the book, (the leads and their mentor,) everyone else is just a walking young adult novel cliche. The kitten-like little girl, the snarky female villain, the big scary main villain, and his nameless henchman is the most complex we get in terms of character development. On top of that, the narrator goes on and on about how she's so afraid of the possibility of having to fight her friends, but it never happens, the book never follows up on the intense moral dillema and that it promises so frequently. In the end, it's just about the good guys vs. the bad guys, which makes the whole thing predictable. Once we meet the other competitors, you can make a checklist in your head of which ones you're going to see die and when. It's better than most quick, light reading, but some originality wouldn't have hurt.
044656740X|5.0|[[ASIN:B003UO653Y The Cashflow Quadrant - Rich Dad's Guide to Financial Freedom]] Some of the stuff in Rich Dad-Poor Dad could be dangerous and some advise Mr. Kiyosaki gives should be taken with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. Some of his information shed a lot of insight as how the rich don't like to let go of money like not paying bills first as mentioned in his book and how they invest money wisely. I learned a lot about goal setting and how to \\"pay myself first\\" (investing mutual funds and stocks) like Mr. Kiyosaki said in his book. I recommend reading his book for entertainment and upbeat motivation. Also as a last thought; I like the way he mentioned how to make money work for you and not let money be in control of you-you control money and not let work control you.  As Mr. Kiyosaki mentioned: \\"I don't work for money, money works for me\\". interesting thought!<br /><br />Live well, laugh often, love much,<br />Sluggo

159448385X|5.0|This was a brilliantly crafted novel about Afghanistan from the Soviet invasion through the Taliban takeover through the points of view of two very different women. Reading their stories made me grateful to live in a society where women have most of the same liberties as men. I appreciated the insight this story gave me into the worlds of women so different from me. We need stories like this to remind us of how precious basic civil liberties are for all people, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, in order for the pursuit of happiness to be possible.    I highly recommend this book and put it up there among my favorites. I recently read it a second time.

B00080ZG1A|2.0|This was a very choppy movie. I understand that Mr. Hughes was a busy and complex man, and that the movie spanned years of his life, but there was a serious lack of continuity. Events jumped from one time period to another without clarification, events and issues were left unresolved or briefly hinted at then dropped, and the end felt particularly abrupt. Not what I'd hoped for in a highly acclaimed aviation movie.
0156027321|5.0|Not everyone in the club loved this book as much as I did, but it sure sparked some really good conversation. This was definitely one of my favorites.    To some of my book club friends, this novel started out slow, but I enjoyed learning about this boy's interest in all religions, about his father's zoo-keeping, and about the differences between the two and three-toed sloughs. All of this prelude is so crucial, in my opinion, to the metaphorical significance of the rest of the story, which, once you get to, is amazingly compelling.    I loved this book and highly recommend it. I think this novel is an expression of something Joseph Campbell once said in one of his books, about metaphor being the penultimate truth.
B00362DRQS|1.0|I'm afraid I have to jump in on the side of the negative reviews on this. I had previously picked up both the remasters for [[ASIN:B002YT03I4 So Red the Rose (2 CD/DVD)]] and [[ASIN:B0027REDK2 Rio (W/Book) (Coll)]], which are both excellent, so I had cautious optimism for this release, despite the negative comments. However, after picking this up yesterday, I cannot recommend it. These songs were not remastered. Someone merely jacked up the levels to the point where the peaks on the songs are distorted. I compared it to my original release of the CD, which I got nearly 20 years ago, and the old CD actually sounds better and cleaner. This is the worst \\"remaster\\" I've ever heard in my life, to be honest. It's just atrocious. I've even tried it out on a few different sound systems, and it sounds equally horrible on all of them.    As if to add insult to injury, the box contains no write up on the album whatsoever, nor any lyrics; even my 20 year old CD has the lyrics. We do, however, get plenty of photos. Yay....    The only reasons to buy this are for the b-sides, remixes and live tracks on the bonus disc, which do not seem to suffer the same distortion as the first disc. Also interesting are the videos and concert footage on the DVD, which appear to be ported from a 3/4\\" tape.
B000HF0IIC|5.0|Batman Forever is one of my favorites.The other batman movies with the joker,the peguien, and catwomen were ok and batman & robin was alright but none of the villians measured up to the one's in batman forever. Val Kilmer played batman perfectly, Tommy Lee Jones played the cold harded two face brilliantly,Jim Carrey was halirious as the riddler, Nicole Kidman played the beautiful chase merridian and Chris O'Donall was a good choice to play robin. Overall,This is the best batman movie from the '90s.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|We bought this watch for my wife who is training for a half marathon.  The watch is great in some ways, and a total pain in others. The GPS function is excellent, as is the USB connect feature. It uploads easily to the software and tracks everything for you. It is however, quite complicated to set up initially, and takes some time to figure out the functions. The bezel is terrible. I have no idea why they designed it this way. She's accidently hit it while running and didn't realize she stopped the chronograph. There is no \\"back\\" function, so once you screw up and go into the wrong section, it's a pain to get to where you were intending to go in the first place. The GPS synchs quickly, and now that we have it set up, it's working fine. The heart rate monitor works great too, but just took some time to set up. But the 405cx is not user friendly in any way. I was originally thinking of getting one for my own training, but I will be looking at either the Garmin 305 (but it is just so big and bulky) or most likely the Timex Ironman GPS. I use an Ironman for just the chronograph and it's ease of use can't be beat. I've seen the GPS version, and it's also quite easy to use. So overall, the 405cx is a good GPS watch, but absolutely NOT user friendly and the bezel is horrible. I'd say a 3 out of 5 overall.
0143034901|5.0|I loved this one so much that I read it twice. This story of a boy named Daniel, whose father deals in antiquarian books and whose mother dies when he's very young, intertwines the world of fiction with the world of reality. I love books that blur those two worlds while maintaining an absolute strict adherence to realism. This book is not mystical, but it brings you to the edge of mysticism.<br /><br />If for no other reason, you have to read this book just so you can meet my new absolute favorite literary character, Fermin. He is a hoot. He is both tragic and comic and will make you laugh so hard, you'll cry.

B0029LHWKO|1.0|I just finished reading this book, and it wasn't easy. The characters were vague, frustrating, and aimless. So, who cares about them, not I. Life is too interesting to be so pointless, and there are too many interesting people in this world, so why write about such dull souls. The author's picture on the front cover seems to express her own feelings...Yawn.

1439152780|5.0|Kate Morton weaves a fantastic tale of a girl, a castle, and three sisters who are not-quite-as-they-seem. It all starts with a lost letter found. The decades old letter leads a curious daughter on a journey to find out about her mother's mysterious past and leads her right to the doorsteps of the dilapidated Milderhurst Castle and in the hands of the Sisters Blythe.<br /><br />Heartbreak, tragedy. even murder lies within the castle walls. It is up to Edie to discover the truth.<br /><br />The Distant Hours was an enjoyable read. The characters where well developed and interesting. At times Morton can use just too many words. I would find myself scanning, then having to go back because I missed an important detail. She introduces some potentially frightening moments, but often doesn't carry them far enough to give you a real chill.<br /><br />That being said, on a rainy day I couldn't wait to snuggle under a warm blanket and read this book.

B004R10L4S|1.0|we knew sean penn was a loon, but when you consider the degree of the lies in the movie and also consider how relatively soon after the scandal this movie was made, it's shocking how much disregard the film shows the truth.  as if there isn't detailed information all over the internet to refute the lies.  no valerie plame story would be complete without dick armitage and it's almost as if he doesn't exist.  so i guess this was a fun little dress up movie for sean penn and hopefully naomi watts isn't part of the leftist scum brigade in hollywood.

B003ASLJRW|5.0|This movie is stupendous! Absolutely the pinnacle of Clint Eastwood's directing career and acting talent. You knew him before when he was being directed by Sergio Leone in movies like A Fistful of Dollars and Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (etc...) but this is a movie made by himself.    It is different than the others but is still the same, if that makes sense. The Preacher, Clint Eastwood, strolls into a town on his horse and finds tat the town is being extorted for money by crooks who are also looking for gold. Apparently the town is sitting on a treasure trove of gold that only needs to be dug out, problem is, that would destroy the town. This all started when a man in the town founbd a lump of gold the size of a baseball and blabbed his mouth too much, and crooks came.    Clint Eastwood is the problem solver! He solves their problems, and the crooks die horribly. And I mean horribly. They are shot one by one in executioner fashion in an adjacent town because they are so ruthless to the mining town which they want uprooted. Ine essence, the preacher is a very violent and cunning man. He methodically eliminates all the bad guys in a scary way, not like his other movies with the long staring seen just prior to shooting each other, as in For A Few Dollars More. Clint kills all of these men at night, plucking them off like a shadow moving amongst shadows and adds almost a horror element to the movie.    Yeah he got angry....bad guys go bye bye...

B002NZK5TG|5.0|I was looking everywhere for this item.   I finally found it at amazon.com.  It was brand new and a great price.  It came in a protective package and it only took a week.

I am definately going to use them again for future purchases.
0316067938|5.0|Well, this book just wrapped up that series nicely and was by far the best book of all.  Bella, who I found hard to respect throughout the earlier volumes comes through in this one!  With more action, more intensity, more near misses, and mysteries and twists than anyother previous book, this book strung me along and I couldn't let go. I found this ending awesome! Nothing left unanswered, nothing left open, perfect ending to a perfect story! My biggest problem now--I'm done!! What is next? I'm going to read the Enders Series for now and hope that Meyers comes out with more books.

B000ZJTPLG|5.0|I just received this small headphone amp and just quit playing it after two straight hours. I purchased the Vox Amplug AC30 about a year ago and was less than impressed with it. At the time, I was running it into a Highway One Telecaster with stock single coil pickups.     I now have a Gibson SG Standard with stock pickups. I really debated weather or not to get the AC30 again or the Classic Rock because I couldn't find any definitive reviews about how clean the Classic Rock could get. Let me be DEFINITIVE...It can do cleans really well! It can also get some crazy gain too. I was really impressed by how responsive it was to my playing dynamics. Even with a lot of gain, all I had to do was roll back the volume and it sounded so warm and full.     Having watched the few YouTube videos with the AC30, I didn't think it would have enough gain or crunch. I'm so glad I went with the Classic Rock.
0670022411|3.0|This book is obsessed with the romance between a vampire and a witch.  I generally avoid paranormal romances because I think vampires are icky, but I was sucked into buying this one because I do like fantasies that take place in libraries.  I suggest that you don't buy \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" for the same reason I did.  Yes, the heroine spends time in Oxford's Bodleian Library, but she might as well have been in County Down, or in New York, or Gay Paree, or even London Town.  Basically, the library is the place where she meets her vampire.  She also discovers a book that only she seems to be able to check out of the stacks.<br /><br />There are more scientific trappings than are usual in a romance.  For instance, the vampire hero is a professor who is making discoveries on the leading edge of DNA technology, although we never really learn what these are.  All the elaborate DNA build-up delivers is a breathless account of how the heroine's DNA indicates that she is loaded with every supernormal talent ever bestowed on a witch.  The science of vampire physiology is probably the weakest part of the book.  If Matthew Clairmont's heart only beats once every few minutes, then the scene where he almost bleeds to death when another vampire rips open his jugular doesn't really work.  If his heart isn't pumping, then he should just be oozing a little.  Anyone who has ever watched \\"Dr. G: Medical Examiner\\" or one of the CSI shows knows that.<br /><br />Plotwise, it's the heroine and her vampire against the rest of the occult world, as romances between different kinds of supernatural creatures are strictly forbidden.  The mysterious Congregation does everything in its power to keep them apart, although I was never really sure why witches, vampires, and demons weren't supposed to mix.  The heroine, who was traumatized at a tender age by the unsolved murders of her own witch mother and wizard father (shades of you-know-who) spends the first half of \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" denying her own talent.<br /><br />I did finish \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" and will probably read the sequel, if I find it in the library.  It is well-written, and the romantic elements are terrific, as is the historical background.  However, the attempt at giving the supernatural a scientific setting is weak, and the fantasy elements aren't particularly original.nt.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|Loved the story - the message - the photography, the music and as for Shah Rukh Khan & Kajol they were great. I consider his acting as a man with autism brilliant. I saw it the first time with a friend and immediately ordered a copy for myself. This movie far surpasses anything Hollywood has done for a long time. Many others have already discussed the plot. I will just say contrary to the views of some I thought the part in Georgia was very important to the whole.   An incredible movie!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Just the concept alone makes an intelligent viewer question just how chilling and frightening this movie could be.  I suppose I was kind of influenced by the hype and advertising surrounding this movie when it was released in theatres.  Sad to say that, as I try to be quite skeptical about what the media feeds the public.  So I couldn't help but think that many of those people who actually went to see this movie in the theatres must have felt duped.  There really is nothing to this movie for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that the build-up of \\"paranormal\\" activity didn't exactly have me on the edge of my seat.  In the last three minutes or so there is a mildly shocking climax, hardly worth watching a whole movie for.  The alternate ending is no better, quite pathetic in fact.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is really useful for those who love to read. I have the kindle third generation and use both my Android and kindle to simultaneously. At first I thought I wouldn't get use to reading on my Android phone but once I start reading I can hardly tell the difference. Also  if sometimes you forget your kindle at home like I do, this app is useful to continue your reading without missing a beat. There were a few problems with this app during the first download including devices wouldn't always sync to last page read when I change devices and highlights bookmarks were limited, however this app was updated four days ago and I haven't had any problems and it has work very smoothly since then.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|I have enjoyed the other Harry Potter movies but this one is VERY dark.   OBTW: You can not watch it in daylight! Any light washes out the picture.    The sound quality is not very good as well. It is either too low or VERY LOUD.    This version is not worth the price even at a 75% discount.  I would hope they can re-cut this in the light of day.    It appears that success has not been good for the Harry Potter series.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg didn't make this album to fill it with \\"hits\\".  And even though there are only a couple of newly written songs on the album, it isn't even a traditional album of covers.  What it is is Gregg Allman delivering the blues, using his past to push this album into the fore.  These are blues so thick you have to wade through them.  You can feel it the instant the album starts, the air gets thick and heavy, there seems to be smoke wafting in the air, the voice doesn't seem to have a hint of falsetto and the songs evoke an imagery that is easy to relate to.  Gregg has always been known for the blues, but this is the \\"mo' betta'\\" version from way down in the back country where only the locals go.<br /><br />This is by far one of the best recordings that Gregg has ever done.  When asked to assess his work Gregg speaks about the album \\"coming from the heart\\" and when you listen to this, you know he's right.<br /><br />I suggest that you click on the Amazon link and grab yourself a copy.  An' when da' mailman come, prepare to haf a serious case o' dem ol' blues.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I was using Jorte before and after trying this for a few min, I can immediately notice the functional difference.  My only complaints (suggestions) would be:  1) add support for more color options/themes. 2) Not sure it is worth $5 but definitely worth paying $3 (would probably change my opinion if more color options were available).
030726999X|5.0|I picked up \\"the girl with the dragon tattoo\\" in the states when i was traveling last summer simply because i heard about it somewhere and saw it on the bestsellers list, and have become addicted to the series ever since. Lisbeth Salander is such a unique and interesting character and it has been a joy to follow her story. This last book was really very good, although it deals a lot more with the political aspects and was just a bit dry sometimes, but the ending is really very good. You will really enjoy this book.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|The bezel is a classic size, not like the many gaudy over-sized bezels that are being churned out by every watch company these days. It's not tiny as suggested by some other reviewers, i'd say it's about the size of your average Timex Iron-man digital watch. It's thickness makes up for the smaller bezel diameter. I would sorta understand the size complaints if it were small and thin, but it's sits on the wrist with ample thickness to convey that it is indeed a mans timepiece. Not dainty by any means.     The green face is very unique yet understated. There is the option to view the day in English or French. So far it keeps very accurate time, I've only owned it for a few days so i'll update this review if anything changes. The watch is very light and comfortable to wear. Overall, i'd say you can't go wrong with this one in any color.
0670022411|1.0|because they earned every penny.  I like supernatural fiction.  I like historical fiction.  I even enjoy an occasional romance.  So imagine my delight when NPR review a book that promises all of this.  Plus, the review states the book it well researched more \\"cerebral supernatural fiction\\"  Well, I pre ordered it as soon as I got to a computer.  As soon as it came in the mail I began reading, and reading, and hoping, and then I got angry.  NOTHING HAPPENS!  I got so bored that I had to skim.  I finally gave up with 20 pages to go.  No strong female character.  All the characters are flat.  They basically eat, do yoga, and research. Then something kinda interesting happens, and once resolved they go back to eating, yoga, and research... oh wait,  they drink tea too.  That's it.  The first half seems like maybe a romance, and then the second half turns in to a really weird, silly children's novel.  Seriously, it felt like I switched books half way through.  I don't understand how anyone could have enjoyed this incredibly boring novel.  And I feel cheated by NPR for leading me astray.

1843119013|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3Q1ZUOAM6TFVN]]ON CONTRACTS AND CONSTRUCTION LAW PRINCIPLES<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />There is no question that Cyril Chern is expert Counsel in many aspects of both academic law and what we loosely call `Construction' at least as far as the Bar is concerned when handling disputes.<br /><br />Even the Preface to `The Law of Construction Disputes' in Informa's `Construction Practice Series' gives the reader a flavour of what is to come with the anecdote from a former Commonwealth colony court (no names!) which sets out the genesis of the book- not just the `rule' but the reasons for the rule when queried by a testy judge which we have all been in front of... and was even prominent in a film 60 years ago - `Brothers-in-Law' - as the old judge does actually help out a new barrister in the formidable Official Referee's Court dealing with a `Scott Schedule' which Counsel (Ian Carmichael) appeared to have never heard of!<br /><br />Cyril Chern is well known to Informa readers for his expertise and this work handsomely creates in just 600 pages an analysis of the most recurring questions and points of law arising in construction disputes.  It's a book which one would often like to have had when a particular point is disputed at the last moment in court. Now we have something which covers the entire spectrum of this area of law mixing the theory and the practice neatly in one volume.<br /><br />One aspect of dispute work at the Construction Bar is often the short point which requires a quick reason. To fulfil that requirement, Chern has detailed research of a very high standard which is explained with ease for the harassed barrister.<br /><br />There are 15 chapters and 16 Appendices in this book which is seriously needed by the Construction Bar together with its colleague title `Remedies' recently written by the &#34;ter Haas&#34; team. Chern's statement of practice, with an excellent bit of history at the beginning, contains the practical elements of what we need to tell the clients in a construction dispute- what can I get from this case and is it strong enough? It's especially relevant when negotiating a settlement which can occur quite frequently in this specialist area of law, sometimes when the case is part heard because of the way the evidence has gone.<br /><br />For the newly initiated, start the book with the excellent glossary at Appendix 1 which is worth turning to first, then take a look at the detailed index for what you are looking for. The sparking commentary throughout is a great bonus for this essential reference book for a Construction Bar set and to refresh one's memory.<br /><br />The book starts well with a description of what we do at the Construction Bar- in general we cover building, engineering and technology projects with particular detail made to standard forms of contract although most disputes arise out of or in respect of construction projects themselves. The term is quite loose today as it covers a number of linked substantive law areas and the remedies available in them. Chern goes at quite a pace to highlight the common problems and he succeeds.<br /><br />It's worth looking at chapter 15 on `key issues in dispute resolution' because there are some very handy hints on how the courts may well be viewing the timetable of proceedings in the future.  Throughout, the author has useful page sub titles at the top of each right hand page so you can find what you can find what you are looking for.<br /><br />Chern also sets out a great case for handling the thorny issue of remedies with intelligent use of authorities throughout but the book is not designed to cover or include a whole range of problems in commercial construction projects, but gives a welcome identification to the complexities of the dispute, and much detail to the areas that are likely to be of interest when running all aspects of your case so it's very much Cyril Chern's creative commentary on construction contracts for 21st century.<br /><br />SECOND EDITION<br /><br />THE DEFINITIVE TEXT FOR CONSTRUCTION BAR PRACTITIONERS:<br />NOW IN A NEW SECOND EDITION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Disputes arising from construction are many and various – in fact, almost infinite in their variety.  Fortunately for the practitioner in this diverse and complicated area of law (in which more often than not, vast sums of money are at stake) Informa from Routledge have just published a new second edition of Cyril Chern’s highly regarded and definitive test ‘The Law of Construction Disputes.’<br /><br />Since the first edition was published in 2010, ‘there have been many changes in the field of law dealing with construction,’ says the author ‘especially the disputes that arise in a construction setting.’  This updated edition contains a wealth of new material aimed at enabling the construction law practitioner to understand both the ‘rule’ and the reasons behind the rule on any number of recurring points of law in this field.<br /><br />Within its almost 700 pages, the book covers the questions and points of law that occur in virtually all manifestations of construction activity and the disputes that often result -- those that occur most frequently that is, across a wide range of issues and geographical locations.<br /><br />As the author explains, the list of matters discussed is not exhaustive.  Rather, they are garnered from his own experience of construction and disputes throughout the common law countries of the Commonwealth and North America, plus further selected discussions of other court systems including civil law and Sharia law.<br /><br />The detailed yet succinct discussion of Sharia law with respect to construction is as clear and comprehensive as you’re probably likely to find anywhere.  It must also be said here that clarity of expression in this comprehensive legal text is just one of its distinguishing features.<br /><br />To say that Cyril Chern brings an impressive array of qualifications and experience to the production of this book is a monumental understatement.  He is both a Barrister at Crown Office Chambers and a Chartered Architect.  His numerous qualifications are too numerous to list here, except to point out that his experience includes international civil and structural engineering design issues, plus over three decades of experience in arbitration, mediation, adjudication and other forms of dispute resolution.  There can’t be any practitioner at the Construction Bar who wouldn’t value having this cornucopia of expertise placed readily to hand in this one handy volume.<br /><br />For obvious reasons, the bulk of the book focuses on design and construction disputes, defences to construction disputes and the various issues relating to contracts, from contractors’ rights and obligations to termination of contract.  Also note the two lengthy chapters on dispute resolution.<br /><br />Researchers will appreciate the extensive tables of cases and legislation, plus the sixteen appendices and detailed table of contents and index. Any practitioner involved in, or anticipating a career at the Construction Bar will no doubt regard this book as absolutely indispensable.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at 2016.N  THE DEFINITIVE TEXT FOR CONSTRUCTION BAR PRACTITIONERS:  NOW IN A NEW SECOND EDITION   An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers  Disputes arising from construction are many and various – in fact, almost infinite in their variety.

There can’t be any practitioner at the Construction Bar who wouldn’t value having this cornucopia of expertise placed readily to hand in this one handy volume.  For obvious reasons, the bulk of the book focuses on design and construction disputes, defences to construction disputes and the various issues relating to contracts, from contractors’ rights and obligations to termination of contract.  Also note the two lengthy chapters on dispute resolution.   Researchers will appreciate the extensive tables of cases and legislation, plus the sixteen appendices and detailed table of contents and index. Any practitioner involved in, or anticipating a career at the Construction Bar will no doubt regard this book as absolutely indispensable.  The publication date is cited as at 2016.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|i almost didn't get this book because of the skewed star ranking! i bought my Kindle right when the Kindle 2 was released and nobody ever took the price into consideration when giving a star rank.  I was stunned to find out that this was happening.  Authors DO NOT set prices, publishers do.  Do not punish the authors by ranking their books because your angry about the price.  it is just wrong.  This is a great Michael Connelly book that should be read by long-time fans and newbies alike.  This character, Mickey Haller is progressing and maturing beautifully with each book. And the court room drama rivals Grisham at every turn.  Please check it out. And remember, it is still cheaper than a new release hard cover!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'll leave it to the hardcore fans to rate and review each song individually. I'll keep it short by saying this is one of the best albums i've heard in a very very long time. if you like soulful music and voices such as amy winehouse you will not be disappointed here.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This calendar application is excellent. So much better than the stock app provided on my Droid X. It reminds me of MS outlook, which is my calendar of choice at work. Thanks.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Another great free download from Amazon. So far it works pretty good but a couple things could use improving as has been mentioned by other reviewers. I'm using a stock HTC EVO.     1) Agenda widgets need finger scrolling like the Sense widget. The little buttons are ok but I can imagine on a smaller screen they are more of a problem.  2) Tapping on event in agenda widget should open the event not the calendar.  3) When space permits on agenda widget, always show the date for \\"Today\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\".  3) Main calendar \\"day\\" view could use vertical scrolling so I don't have to set the time span to 7am-11pm to see where most of my appointments fall.    Can't wait to see what the developer does with this app. Between this app and Calendar Snooze, I should be all set.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I had my doubts but this works great. After some tweaking with the settings, I hardly notice that I'm not playing on a pc. It has allowed me to play COD Black OPS online and not get slaughtered, because I'm horrible with the analog sticks. I return items that I'm not happy with and I'm keeping this. Buy it. You won't regret it.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I have been using Touch Calendar along with a separate widget for viewing my events. This has replaced my Touch Calendar by leaps and bounds.  The widget still needs some work, mainly on the customization front. Allow me to choose which calendars I may view and allow for multiple widgets. Oh and scrolling capabilities, please. Besides the widget needing some extra features, loving it guys!!!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I've had this app for a couple of months.  I bought it after trying well over a half-dozen PDF readers.  What sold it for me was the \\"Fit Text To Column\\" viewing option.  Not fit page, but fit column, that is, it ignores the white space in the margins when resizing!  If there's another reader that does this, let me know.  I'll probably still stick with ezPDF reader, tho'.    (Yes, I know it says I purchased it from Amazon, but I clicked on the Get App button when it was free on Amazon even though I already had it 'cause I was curious to see what would happen.)
0439023513|5.0|This is such a great series, I was so addicted to it! The writing is nowhere near JK Rowling quality but you get so entranced in the story it doesn't matter. It has the perfect mix of action and romance. My 14 year old brother is reading this currently and loves it so it's not too mushy. I would recommend this so anyone who loves Harry Potter, Twilight, Gemma Doyle Series, or anything young adult.
B004G6009U|5.0|I adore this movie!!! It is super cute, has hilarious sidekicks, and has a great cast of actors who breathe life into these characters.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for people of all ages. It is great for kids because the villain is not too scary. It is great for older kids because the characters are super funny. It is great for adults because it has a well written story. And it is DISNEY!

0545128285|4.0|Overall, this was a cute book. I was a little disappointed because there are only 5 stories. I had really been hoping that there would be more because JK Rowling is so creative. I did enjoy \\"Dumbldore's\\" notes though :)<br /><br />Now, this next thing I say only because I absolutely love the Harry Potter Series a believe that J K Rowling is a phenomenal writer...<br /><br />But honestly, the writing was horrible. I found it choppy and lacking the same charm that I fell in love with in Harry Potter. There are still hints of wit and brilliance, but those little bits were vastly overshadowed by what felt like rushed writing and half-hearted ideas.<br /><br />But despite this flaw, I liked the book enough to buy it after I had read it...I just expected more from the author of Harry Potter

0783225857|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie version of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, will never cease to be a wonderful film. Gregory Peck rocked the Oscars that year (1962) by taking home the trophy, and he surely deserved it. Peck, as Atticus Finch, is an inspirational movie hero who will stick with you for years to come. The character of Atticus Finch does an amazing job standing up for what he believes in regarding racial justice in 1930s Alabama, regardless of how it might cause others to treat him. Although black and white, the film's mystery, suspense and family drama keeps this movie intriguing and entertaining even by today's standards. Mary Badham as Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, is a stand-out at just 7 or 8 years old. She was incredibly convincing, and could show a wide range of emotions on her young face. Sagel Friendsmith wrote her Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment Test Essay on this legendary movie and earned the highest score in her entire school. She was able to recall important details about the story because they had made such an enormous impact on her when she saw it. This movie should be shown to the whole family on movie night and later discussed as an interesting way of teaching kids about American history. Five stars - an American classic!
1589795474|1.0|I seriously gave up on this book after 2 chapters and then skimmed the rest. I am 25 years old and 98% debt free and still found this book a complete waste of time.  What did I learn? Don't spend money, live in a shack in the worst part of town due to my sub par income and never go outside if it looks dangerous. I feel sorry for my dad and him buying this book and then spending money on having to ship it to me. I would send it back to him but that wouldn't be saving my money and penny pinching.<br /><br />Time to turn on Swamp People and learn about real life living and gator hunting!
B004QMRHHW|4.0|I like this album a lot.  The best track by far in my opinion is \\"A Beast Am I\\" - it's fast and brutal and the lyrics kick-ass!  The only thing keeping me from giving this album 5 stars is the overly-melodic parts and keyboards, like in the song \\"For Victory or Death\\".  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Amon Amarth fan and own everything they ever made, but I prefer the faster more brutal songs, and wish this album had a few less slow parts.  Over all, I highly recommend this album.
B004FOA84A|4.0|great little game! super fun, not too easy or too hard. i hope they come out with a part 2 or a longer version. was able to finish game in less than an hour.
0393338827|5.0|This is a really entertaining read on the financial crisis.  It does a great job of telling the stories of three groups who were on the \\"right\\" side of the meltdown.  These people didn't necessarily make the most money as a result but they're probably the most interesting.      Lewis does a decent job of explaining the financial instruments that are behind the mess.  However, the book doesn't explore some questions:    * Are you really investing if you're placing money in the hopes something will fail?  * Should we be able to buy insurance on things or events that have no direct connection to us?  * Why is placing a bet on a horse race gambling but placing a bet on default rates investing?

B000KITQK2|5.0|For what you pay, and what its worth, this device does sound pretty darn good.  I use it predominately with a Mandolin and [[ASIN:B0002D071C Fishman Classic Series V-100 Violin Pickup]].  I can really draw out the lower rich tones of the instrument using this device.  Low to zero noise, no latency, and other decent features make it really simple to use.  I can use it with a Violin as well, but I rather just mic that instrument.<br /><br />Feels solid, so do the knobs.  Red LED isn't too bright.  XLR and 1/4\\" jacks are nice when hooking into various types of equipment.<br /><br />I had a 9V adapter laying around that I could use with this device.  Just make sure the polarity of the plug is correct and it will supply enough amps.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|The walking dead is not your typical zombie show.  Yes it has blood, gore and Zombies, but it has more then that.  It is a story of survival and what happens after society ends.  What do the survivors do?  How do we live?  How do we live with each other? Sometimes humans can be scarier then the zombies.  The Walking Dead isn't a \\"supernatural horror thriller\\" show it is a drama and it is a darn good one.  The first season was a short 6 episode season but expect that season 2 will be bigger, better and more exciting.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app is 10 times better than the stock android calendar. It has many more features. I prefer to stay in the month view, and with this app, I can easily see my appointments while staying in month view.

B001UW58YK|3.0|I purchased this after reading the reviews but was disappointed that even with a Blu Ray player and HD TV, the quality of the music was great but Michael's voice fell in the background. Perhaps it is my sound system but I found the concert to be great just the same. For those with an older stereo system, the sound quality is not great.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie was awesome when I saw it in 3D. I bought it as one of my first blu-ray purchases. The extra 16 minutes on the extended director's cut really add new depth to the adventure. I'm very happy with it and I can't wait to watch the extras and learn some movie magic.    The BD-Live feature is pretty cool too. It makes the pause menu a little more interactive (although I'm sure there's more that it does). The progress bar is a tree limb and there's a dot signifying the beginning of each chapter which shows a screenshot and the chapter name.
B004NDVJOG|5.0|I still have my original vinyl of this album - interesting to see that it is being re-issued.  This is one of my favorite live albums of all time - if I could only have 10 albums on an island, this would be one of them.  It is a shame that Rory never received the commercial glory of the other \\"guitar gods\\" as he could hold his own with any of them.  \\"A Million Miles Away\\" still blows me away every time I hear it!
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Business Calendar is a really good complement to Google Calendars and it adds some nice features like multiple day recurring appointments, color coding, nice quick zoom for days / events. This application is very useful and will help you make the best of Google Calendars.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Phantom is one of my favorite musicals, and this film is overall quite satisfying.<br /><br />Gerard Butler delivers a superb, moving performance as the haunted Phantom, and is by far the most expressive actor.  The other really good actor is Minnie Driver (Carlotta).  I'm used to seeing her play benevolent side-characters, so it was interesting to see her be a sort of leading bi*** girl that nobody really likes, and speaking Italian.  \\"Christine\\", although she has a truly lovely voice, is somewhat bland as far as acting and expression, as is \\"Raul\\" who is even more so.  The acting of these two is all that keeps me from giving this film 5 Stars.<br /><br />The scenery is wonderful, which was a relief to me, having seen so many stage-to-film adaptations that rather disappointing.  It is filmed on different locations besides the opera house.  The costumes are also quite spectacular, though secondary to the main story.<br /><br />Those who adore musical theater should definitely include this in their collection.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|I downloaded this app with the hope that it could better do tasks that I have split between astrid and the default calendar. It disappointed, and combined with the wholly unintuitive UI which made it difficult to navigate with ease, I would not recommend, even for free.
0920668372|5.0|Over 20 years ago a friend recommended this book to me. After reading it to my own young child, I understood the warning my friend gave about the bittersweet ending.  It's a beautiful story, but also the repeats of the title phrase throughout the story makes it something to pass on to the next generation.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Great app for listening in an office where computers interfere with radio reception.  One problem on my Samsung Epic, sound stops if I switch between bluetooth and headphones. Have to stop and restart the audio stream. This interferes with ability to record.

0670022411|1.0|I started into this book with great expectations,  hoping for engrossing fantasy fiction along the lines of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, or The Historian.  Unfortunately, this book never knew what it wanted to be, in turns a talky, historical/scientific lecture series, a slightly embarassing romance novel, a young-adult fantasy fiction, etc., etc.  As others have so frequently noted, for all these various genres, nothing much actually happens in the way of plot.  The characters are pretty two-dimensional, with the heroine an irritating contradiction of being weak and whiny, alternating with inappropriately-timed stubbornness.  I vowed to get to the end just to see how the thin plot resolved itself, but - oh noes! - I found out too late it's part one of a trilogy.  Wow - I'm just pretty bitter about this whole experience at the moment.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|If you are running the CyanogenMod 7 OS, you cannot edit calendar events from an exchange calendar with the standard Android calendar.  With this app, it lets you do just that.  This is a very nice feature on top of the wealth of other features.  The home screen widget is great also.
0307477479|1.0|Several years ago I watched an episode of 60 Minutes that exposed pretentiousness in the art world (visual art).  Here are some of the absurd scenarios that they reported on: One so-called \\"artist\\" defecated in a tin can; a bunch of mindless idiots in the art world went crazy over this \\"work of art.\\"  Another so-called \\"artist\\" presented a huge blank canvas (it was literally blank--it had nothing on it) and some of the morons in the art world were amazed; a stupid, mindless woman paid a huge sum of money for this idiotic vapidness, calling it \\"minimalism.\\"  Sadly, the literary world is infected with the same kind of atrocious stupidity.  The fact that Jennifer Egan's latest \\"work of art\\" won the Pulitzer Prize is a testament to the fact that ignorant, pretentious, cowardly, moronic, dumbass critics rule the \\"literary\\" world.  This book is just plain silly.  It is a bore.  It's stupid.  It contains nothing that is worth any intelligent person's time (or money).  The plot is a convoluted mess, revealing the author's confused head (college degrees never seem to be an indication of intelligence or talent, at least not when it comes to fiction authors--think Jhumpa Lahiri).  The real \\"Goon Squad\\" is in Egan's head: it's the poor quality neurons that congregate in her cortex.  Hopefully Ms. Egan will take her money and go away.  She has dumped enough of her mediocrity into the \\"literary\\" world.  If she really had something worth putting into print, she would've achieved that by now (I've read some of her previous short stories--god they are AWFUL, and boring).  She is yet ANOTHER product of  marketing hype; her so-called talent as a \\"writer\\" is pure illusion created by media spin and literary lackeys.  It is bad enough that writers this horrible are put into print (I will never understand why people think that the New Yorker publishes the best writers), but the fact that so many critics PRAISE this amateurish nonsense is, well--it is DISTURBING.  Life really has a purpose?  Hard work and talent are rewarded?  Things happen for a reason?  The universe is just?  Not likely.  You can toss this book into the same pile of worthless, over-hyped Pulitzer Prize winners of the past.  Better yet, just toss it into the garbage.  Every time I am afflicted by the third-rate garbage of yet another untalented darling of the publishing world, I can only recall the immortal words of Ecclesiastes:  \\"Meaningless, meaningless.  Everything is meaningless. . . .\\"
B004I4H8QS|4.0|CD1 is exactly as the original, but slightly better sound.  CD2 is as if they put out a 2nd album, a couple alts to originals but mostly new stuff.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|People are imperfect things.  I have never met any two who are exactly the same.  Our DNA says so.  The 4 Hour Body is just the starting line for the race to come.  I am 50 and when I started this book I immediately loved the fact that Tim said don't read it cover to cover.  Find your interests and go from there.  Simply put I am stronger, I have more energy, I have more lean muscle mass than when I crossed the 4HB starting line.  Some things I have been doing for years but didn't know the science behind them; thanks Tim for that new knowledge.  The new activites have really blown me away with the way my body has responded.  I think I am on my way to superman.  Is it for you?  Only you can say but you first must take that step out of the darkness to find out.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I bought this watch through Amazon for about $60-80.  It was at the time offered by Amazon itself.  During the day, after \\"winding it\\" by moving my hand (as I do with my Rolex), I would go about my day working.  However, the watch would stop working periodically; therefore by nightfall, it would be of by tens of minutes (not seconds).  Then at night, the watch would stop working when I would go sleep with it on my wrist - the automatic movement could not wind the watch enough during the day to keep the watch going throughout a night of sleeping, even after several days of wearing it.  I exchanged it for another one and that one had exactly the same problem.  No wonder Amazon stopped selling it.  I have owned/own automatic watches from Seiko, Citizen, Rolex, etc.  None of them would go to sleep two hours after I went to sleep!  It is a nice looking watch and price is good, but don't buy it if you want it to keep time. Buy it as a pet that has mind of its own and goes to sleep when you do!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game &amp; graphics, fun to play. A little short. If it force close, you might not have enought free memory of your device.  Also try restarting the device or shutting down other apps that are using up memory.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Looks great.  The actual calendar itself is a huge improvement.  The swipe to select number of days view is slick.  My only complaint is the Agenda Widget.  It needs swipe to scroll like the HTC Sense widget has.  If that is added, 5 Stars.

B004N66XYE|4.0|Having been an avid fan in the 1970s of the original Masterpiece Theater series of \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" and after reading the glowing reviews herein to this miniseries that is post the Bellamay family, I was most eager to return to 165 Eaton Place, the former residence of the Bellamay family and where I spent many hours well entertained by the downstairs servants and by the wealthy upstairs folks.    In this 2010 Masterpiece Theater miniseries in 3 episodes on 2 discs, it's 1936 (pre World War II) and we have new upstairs and downstairs inhabitants because the Bellamays sold the property many years before.  A newly married couple along with the husband's overbearing mother (brilliantly acted by Eileen Atkins--she is wonderful) to wait on the upstairs folks we, of course, get a \\"new\\" crop of servants that are now \\"under\\" Rose, the parlor maid to the Bellamays that's been promoted in this miniseries to head housekeeper.  This lavish and greatly acted production gives the audience a peek at the very rich and their servants after World War I along with the political and underclass upheavals in England during the 1930s while Hitler and his forces were gaining strength in Germany.  I was well entertained and really enjoyed visiting 165 Eaton Place in its new guise.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I'm not quite sure why the description calls this series a 'trilogy'!?!  There are currently seven books in the series along with a companion book to keep them all straight!  Diana Gabaldon creates amazingly complex characters and plots.  Intrigue and action abound in this transitional third installment in the \\"Outlander\\" series!    Claire, Jamie, Mr. Willoughby and many other endearing, disturbing and curious characters make this a page turner in the true sense!    I keep several copies of each of these books in paperback to lend out and another in hard-cover to keep for myself!      Don't let the historic romance/time travel genre fool you...there is something for everyone in this series!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Thank you Marcus for your dedication and service to this country. I'm sorry the heroes you served with had to make the ultimate sacrifice and may God hold them close to his heart. Fascinating book on several levels. The descriptive nature of the intense preparation to become a Naval SEAL and vivid portrayal of the battle and the culture of the Pushtun people. Well done!
1586487981|5.0|Poor Economics is an excellent survey of empirical data on the world's most impoverished areas. The amount of work put into the studies (the authors have extensive work in their own control studies) is astounding, and well worth a look for anyone interested in the data.  The general picture one hopes when reading a book like this is a &#34;silver bullet&#34; that will solve the problems of every kind of poor people around the world. As the authors are quite upfront in saying, this is not realistic. Economies are complex and work in strange ways. Anyone familiar with systems dynamics will recognize the traps that &#34;silver bullet&#34; theories get into: one quick fix leads to some improvement, but causes side effects that might make matters worse in the long run.  This book examines how the predominant theories on poverty have played out. They cite Jeffrey Sachs' [[ASIN:0143036580 The End of Poverty]], in which the idea is that aid will bring an end to a &#34;poverty trap&#34;. And then regard William Easterly's [[ASIN:0143038826 The White Man's Burden]], in which the idea is that aid tends to make people dependent on it and thus makes them less capable. With these plausible arguments as a backdrop, they delve into the examples and case studies to identify instances where one or both or neither are true.  Ultimately, the argument that is made is for a comprehensive understanding of the way poverty works in order to apply proper levels and composition of aid. Though, this isn't a grand theoretical survey of the way economies and systems in general function. It is still a penetrating survey of poverty and offers the reader the tools to do something about it.

1936719010|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Simply a collection of truisms, flat words and ideas thrown at the reader. A serious lack of helpful ideas. Just a series of stupid sentences like:  \\"Resistance is the shadow cast by the innovative self's sun\\"  \\"The enemy is Resistance\\"  \\"Break the sheet of foolscap into three parts: beginning, middle, and end.\\"  It felt like an endless series of encouragements with no value: You can do it, do it, resistance is the enemy, fight the resistance, do it. And worst of all the book encourages people not to plan, not to think, not to prepare. Just DO IT!  That's how many companies went bankrupt - they did not think, they just did it. In the stupidest possible ways.
1557048630|4.0|This book has the art work from Dreamworks as they worked on designing the characters, dragons, and setting.

B0041KKYBK|3.0|It's clear that the 2009 financial crisis resulted as a consequence of Wall Street's excesses, and this film attempts to shed more light on greed that runs rampant in the financial sector. Indeed, this film had great potential; however, I feel that it is a bit overrated, because it does not adequately fulfill the task it was set upon doing. Still, it is intriguing enough for those who want to learn more or for those who have an interest in economics.     It is important to note that the word \\"film\\" is misleading, as the Inside Job can be more adequately described as a documentary. It starts out with a fairly long introduction on the privatization of Icelandic banks and how New York can be traced to the collapse of the Icelandic banking system. Because of this, it's pretty slow at first, but after the credits roll, it jumps into a highly structured, though not consistently coherent, presentation divided up into five separate sections, almost like a PowerPoint presentation. The fact that a brief summary of the history of deregulation that followed after the introduction lends to the lack of flow in the film.    The presentation of the content can be dry at times, consisting mostly of interviews with academics, industry experts, and foreign government officials from mainly France, China, and Singapore, interlaced with C-SPAN and CNBC broadcasts and graphs depicting certain data. Some of the interviews are interesting; for example, a memorable quote was made by an MIT dean who described a medical study that showed that people reacted similarly to money as cocaine, though these jokes are far and few in between, given the serious nature of the topic. It was also interesting to see how deeply involved executives are in government and in the academics (which makes me wonder at my ongoing college education) and how arrogant some academics can be, as an interview showed a Columbia prof who literally tried to rush the interviewer out the door. The absence of many US governmentofficials in the film is remarkable.     One important drawback to the film was that it failed to address where and how these bankers were making these profits - the film made it seem that these executives ripped off the masses, sold off junk assets, sank their companies into trouble, and made off with millions of dollars. How did these profits appear when they were so incredibly worthless? The film also seemed narrow in focus; it focused significantly on the profound impacts on the US, and only very briefly mentioned other countries. I think it would have been better to provide a more global perspective, and perhaps connect the core of the film with the introduction with Iceland, because it almost makes the introduction seem disconnected with the package as a whole. It also lends to a lack of polish on the part of the editors.     \\"Inside Job\\" isn't an entertaining film for the masses; however, it is a fairly well-made but flawed documentary about the events leading up to the global crisis. It's bound to infuriate a few; however, the film isn't revolutionary by any means, and as the film hints at the end, life is likely to continue as it has been for the last 40-some years.
B001GMH8SI|2.0|Give me a break - are we supposed to identify with this self-centered, inconsiderate kid who needs to \\"escape\\" from parents who want to buy him a car and send him to law school? If he hadn't been so self-absorbed and sure that he knew more than everyone else, maybe he would have realized how woefully unprepared he was for his little adventure. He obviously didn't care about anyone else, or the environment.    The only thing this movie offered was great scenery.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I really love \\"If I Die Young\\"!  It is one of those rare songs that will make you stop whatever it is your doing to just sit there and listen!  Just a stunningly beautiful song that almost always brings tears to my eyes!  That is a very rare thing for me!  They are so different from any other country act now!  I love the sound of the mandolin too!  So unique and so beautiful!  Can't get enough of \\"If I Die Young\\" and the video too!  Amazing family!  Did I mention I liked \\"If I Die Young\\"?!
0783240236|2.0|I must preface my review by saying I am not a horror fan, but I am a Hitchcock fan so I wasn't sure whether I'd like The Birds.  I tried to watch it with an open mind.  Even with the dated special effects and annoying electronic bird squawking, it was scary-- especially the scene where they're trapped in the house just waiting for the next bird attack.    However, the script and characters in this film are severely lacking.  The romance between Melanie and Mitch is not only far-fetched but annoying.  What does he see in her?  I usually disagree with Hitchcock in his choice of women; he likes the icy blonde ditzes.  'Tippi' Hedren is a Grace Kelly clone, and I didn't care for Grace Kelly.  Worst acting award goes to the girl who plays Cathy.  I have never seen a more wooden performance in my life.  Amazingly awful.  The rest of the characters weren't much better.  The mother was scarier than the birds (sidenote: there are a lot of creepy characters in this movie- the elevator man is another), but at least she didn't like Melanie either.  Who could like someone with an IQ that low? \\"Hmm, Lydia told me to pick up Cathy from school immediately, but they're singing a horrible song.  Should I rescue her?  No, I'll smoke a cigarette outside.\\" \\"Hmm there's a million birds outside.  Let's go outside children!\\" \\"Oh my gosh, the gas station's exploding and birds are attacking everything!  Let me just go outside and get a better view from this phone-booth!  Ooh, maybe I can open and close the door randomly!  Here come some birds: open.  Here comes a man who desperately needs my help: close.\\"  \\"Huh?  I hear vicious birds upstairs?  Why don't I just explore the house alone?!\\"    Hitchcock overused the green/blue screen in this film.  I can understand using it in the scenes with the attacking birds, but for a quick boating trip across the bay?  It makes Hedren seem impossibly prissy.  \\"No, there's no way I'm going to actually get on a boat.  There might be some wind that would blow my hair onto my obnoxiously large forehead.  I'll just sit here in the studio.\\"    I think I was more upset that this movie didn't have a point than that it didn't have an ending, although that didn't help things.  It doesn't take a genius to write a story with a million loose ends; it takes a true genius to tie those all together in a believable storyline.    You can hyper-analyze this movie if you want and read into it all sorts of deeper meaning and how the bird attacks are symbolic of the women all fighting over Mitch, but I think that's going too far.  I think many times people read too much into films and turn them into something they're not.  (Though even if the attacks ARE a commentary on the relationship between Melanie and Mitch it still is not a poignant film-- it is too stilted, too wooden, too melodramatic.)   My advice: skip this one and watch Rear Window or The Man Who Knew Too Much instead.
B001GJOL22|5.0|After I purchased my first blu-ray player, I bought the blu-ray version of this and R30 at the same time. After the extremely disappointing Rush In Rio dvd, I was pleasantly suprised about the quality of Snakes And Arrows live.   Audio: As far as audio quality is concerned, this is the best live Rush concert video they have ever released. When you play it loud, it sounds like you're actually there. The drums have sort of a raw feel to them. Everything is crystal clear and sounds perfect.  Video: For the most part, the video editing is perfect. With the exception of 2 songs, the video editing is they way it should be: not fast-paced MTV-style whit the camera angle changing every 1/8th of a second. For some reason, the video editing IS that annoying fast-paced style during Far Cry and One Little Victory, but thankfully, it's only during those 2 songs.   I would highly recommend this dvd to any Rush fan, or even anyone who considers themselves a \\"part-time\\" fan who only knows their hits. Get the R30 dvd, too.  They filmed the Cleveland show of the Time Machine tour earlier this month, so hopefully you will have a 3rd awesome blu-ray show to enjoy.

B0000714BP|5.0|This was the first movie that I ever laughed out loud during in the theater!<br /><br />The other reviewers have touched upon the acting, the casting, the scenes and the theme... so I won't.<br /><br />I'm just writing to say that on those days when nothing is funny, when it's pouring rain, when you've already screamed at the cat, the dog, the kids and the tropical fish, it's time to sit down and watch this flick to restore your faith in the world. Or just a small part of it.<br /><br />Do it, or you'll loose all your princess points!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Bought this for our 18 month old son.  Love that it has both the blu-ray version of it so we can play it at home and also the plain old dvd version of it so we can plan it on my macbook when traveling.  We are huge fans of classic movies & cartoons for our 18 month old and this was one that was a must-have on our list to get for him!

B003ES5ZTG|5.0|This is the perfect HDMI cable. Relatively inexpensive, with built-in port savers. The clever connector \\"automatically\\" rotates and pivots based on the tension applied. These make connecting multiple devices to your flat panel much nicer. The new TVs have hdmi ports oriented and stacked vertically, making a mess of the cables. This hdmi cable allows you to position the cables so they do not collide, reducing stress on the TVs ports. The flat shape of the cable reduces weight and allows for easier routing through the back of your media cabinet.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|From the Title this might not seem like a laugh out loud funny movie, but the situations in the movie make it so. There are three main story lines in the film that make it funny<br /><br />Daniel lived with his parents and his wife outside of London. His father unexpectedly dies and he has a funeral for him at his house. While dealing with the death of his father he also has to deal with his famous broke brother, and a small guy who was lovers with their father who is blackmailing him.<br /><br />Then there is Daniel's cousins Troy and Martha. Martha is engaged to Simon who is a lawyer. He is nervous about going to the funeral and while picking up Troy Martha gives him what she thinks is Valium, but is actually a drug concoction Troy made up.<br /><br />Then there is Daniel's friend Howard and his friend Jason (who has a thing for Martha.) They are in charge of picking up and taking care of moody Uncle Alfie.<br /><br />As the funeral gets underway the three stories converge into what is a funny movie.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|UPDATE After review of system event log it appears there is a conflict with an EQ library loaded by the Equalizer app. After stopping this app Amazon MP3 player works fine, no Force Close. After loading Amazon MP3 Player, the Equalizer app says the device does not support Reverb effect, so it looks like two conflicting libraries using the same API and if Amazon's loads first both programs can co-exist but with reduced functionality in Equalizer.    Useless. Any attempt to open the settings menu or play music causes a Force Close. Test this code on Google flagship phones before you release it, ya big dorks.    Nexus S
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This app is a great upgrade to the default calendar. It has more options, more widgets, and improved ease of use. If I was using my phone for business purposes (keep track of meetings, etc.) this app would be a godsend. Even without using it for that purpose, I've already added a lot more to my calendar since installing this app and anticipate using it more.  However, for light personal use, the app is a little pricey. I'd recommend trying a cheaper (preferably free) app before paying for this one if you aren't a heavy user.
B0040ZA2FE|5.0|If you're a fan of vinyl, this one's a no-brainer. A terrific album now benefiting from some vinyl mastering. I don't need to add anything to the other great reviews of the music, as this band's songs really stand up over time,  and fans of vinyl records deserve class of this nature to get issued. Thanks to those who worked hard to get these Jayhawks reissues out on vinyl, they sound immaculate!

B001NEK2GE|4.0|First of all, I am new to the world of MMORPGs. I got into WoW 100% off the bat, and within weeks went from feeble movements with wasd and clicking my abilities to mouse movement and keybindings. I quickly ran out of keys to bind that would be comfortable to use, and after a few hours my hand was in pain, so I began to look for something that would remedy that. After weeks of research, I decided to go with the Logitech G13.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />I love the design of this. I use a straight keyboard and I'm not a fan of ergonomic keyboards, but the design of this is perfect for hours of gameplay. I don't have great posture, and I use a corner desk, so I find it most comfortable to move the gamepad far back on my desk so that my elbow comfortably rests on the desk. The wrist support isn't overly padded so I don't get sweaty from keeping my hand there. There are a few buttons that I have to move my hand to reach, but I mapped less-used keys to those. I have 16 keys that I use frequently for my abilities, G3-G5, G10-G13, G15-18, and G21-G22, along with the joystick buttons, which I mapped for shift and alt. This combination gives me a possible 36 actions, my targeting function, and jump. I can access all of these keys (I'm a woman with large hands for a woman but smaller than an average man's hands) without moving from my home position. The other 7 keys require slightly more attention for me to reach and get back to home, but with practice I've become able to use those without much effort as well. I use the joystick for movement during a fight (mapped to tradtional wasd movements) but I don't use the joystick \\"button\\" for anything that I would need quickly (it opens my guild tab). It's too hard to press reliably to make it functional during action.<br /><br />Ease of Use:<br />This pad takes practice to use, and it takes time to set up keys to your liking, but the ability to put in key combinations in mapping is a nice feature. I wouldn't recommend this for someone with little to no computer literacy, but I think the average gamer will have little problem setting this up after exploring the features for a bit.<br /><br />Construction Quality:<br />No complaints other than the joystick's button feature. Almost impossible and rather painful to push. It seems quite sturdy and the angle is perfect for long sessions, as long as your arm is comfortable. (I wouldn't like to use it if it was on the edge of the desk with no support for my elbow)<br /><br />Documentation:<br />? Documentation? you mean the pretty pictures in the book?? Waste of time. Tutorial? No, more like an ad. You need to figure out what you're doing all by yourself. The documentation was a joke. Good luck getting this working if you're not familiar with computers. Not going to happen using the \\"documentation\\"<br /><br />Software:<br />This is not a plug-and-play device. The device can search your comp for compatible games and the offers default keybindings. It took quite a bit of setup to get the keys mapped to my liking. I have a couple profiles set up and when I switch toons I switch profiles. There never seems to be a problem going between the profiles. What does seem to be a problem is that it will randomly stop working in the middle of play. This is recent and I will have to investigate if this is something I did when messing with settings. The fix is to close out the logitech programs and restart them. I'm pretty sure this is happening because I took the software off my startup list, trying to make my computer more efficient, but I'm seriously considering letting it start itself so it will behave. The stability of the software wasn't an issue at all until I made this change. I've been quite happy with the ability to set it up once and just run with it.<br /><br />Other:<br />While I figured the screen on the gamepad would be totally useless to me, I actually find myself looking at it frequently because of the info available (equipment durability, especially, which is given as a percent on the screen). I don't care about the backlighting, and in fact can't really see the backlighting on the keys, but I don't look at the keys anyway since the home keys are depressed and easy to find. There is not an obnoxious glow coming from the pad, and so it's not distracting. I keep the lights on because my different profiles are mapped to different colors so it's a cue that I'm on the correct profile.<br /><br />There are several nifty options for what to display on the screen, and I keep the performance monitor up when I'm not playing. There is a stopwatch, RSS feed, WMP feed, and several other things, most of which I have disabled. It auto-senses the game you're playing and loads up the profiles.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I am satisfied with my purchase and would hate to switch back to traditional keyboarding again. I use my left hand for action buttons and this is most definitely for the left hand, so it works well for me. It has recently become less reliable and I will need to look into the cause of this, but I still appreciate the product and feel no need to look for something different. I recommend this product to people with computer literacy who possess the flexibility to work on something for a while to get it to suit them, who would enjoy more comfort in long gaming sessions. This is not a product for everyone, but I would and have recommended it to fellow players who want to take their game to the next level.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++UPDATE+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />I would like to take a moment to update this review. I have been experiencing performance issues with this gamepad recently and today it stopped working completely. When I opened up the program I met with a blank screen. After scouring the net for some answer, I came across the jackpot - I've been putting my computer to sleep. Apparently the G13 doesn't like this. After a restart, everything came back right away. While this is silly in my opinion, if anyone else has this problem, hopefully this will help.ighting, and in fact can't really see the backlighting on the keys, but I don't look at the keys anyway since the home keys are depressed and easy to find.

0805080120|5.0|I read the hardback version of this book when it first came out, in 2005, and liked it so much I passed it along to other readers. Deutscher presents his argument in an easy (easy as in clear, not as in too-simple) to comprehend way. The book is full of fascinating pieces of information, such as how languages are constructed with either the Subject-Verb pattern, or the Verb-Subject pattern. I highly recommend this book.

0060523808|4.0|\\"Watch the turtle. He only moves forward by sticking his neck out.\\"<br /><br />Louis V Gerstner, Jr (1942 - ) IBM CEO 1993-2002<br /><br />The above quote quite aptly describes his work ethic. A leader who was not afraid to upset the apple cart by introducing massive change to an organisation such as IBM. His effort being rewarded by rescuing IBM from the brink of disaster.<br /><br />Louis Gerstner started his working in life with McKinsey & Company in 1965, joined American Express as their Head of Travel related Services Group in 1977 and accepted the CEO's position of RJR Nabisco in 1989.<br /><br />I really liked Louis Gerstner's very own style of writing and the way that he turned around IBM. In 1993, IBM was losing market share and perhaps on the verge of bankruptcy. Louis Gerstner accepted the job and walked into this situation without really knowing whether he could revive IBM to its glory days. A job he completed remarkably well, considering revenue generation and profitability during his tenure (other change initiatives may well have been considered controversial by IBM employees, such as the culture change, especially the 'job for life' ethos with associated perks etc)<br /><br />I will finish off the review with a sign in Louis Gerstner's office, again stamping his work ethic:<br /><br />THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF PEOPLE:<br /><br />THOSE WHO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN<br /><br />THOSE TO WHOM THINGS HAPPEN<br /><br />THOSE WHO WATCH THINGS HAPPEN<br /><br />THOSE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING

B004O3YGMC|4.0|the program looks and works great when it can connect. maybe its my setup but most of the time it won't even connect to my computer. I have to close the app down and re open to get it to connect. its still worth the price!
0811879542|5.0|Bought this for my 2.5 year old and he loves it. I think he really does think he is manipulating the little dots with his actions. He treats the book with a bit more reverence. Fun for us to read too as it allows us to get the kids involved. Something different.
0143034901|2.0|The only reason I'm giving this book 2 stars (rather than 1) is Carlos Ruiz Zafon's  brilliant ability to turn a phrase.

If you are looking for a treatise on \\"How to live a life completely out of God's will, and die, often times young, in utter despair,\\" this is the book for you.

0743243315|1.0|I really wanted to love this book. I got lost in the letters from Razia and I just couldn't get a handle on Nazneen and Karim's budding relationship. I thought the daughters were poorly developed and the husband was ridiculous. Cutting corns and trimming nosehairs are not my idea of a successful marriage. So I will say that Monica Ali definitely portrayed their lacking marriage successfully. I wish I would have liked it more. I am interested in seeing the movie, but I think it's a shame when I have a feeling that the movie will be better than the book.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Great movie! Fun for the whole family. So good, that I rented and after I had got done watching, went online to buy it.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|I just love this movie! I saw it in theatre twice and rented it from redbox and proceeded to watch it two more times! I just love the dialogue and bantering from all of the characters. I think its a marvelous cast. I absolutely love Diane Keaton. She is the truth when it comes to acting. Rachel McAdams is perfect for this movie. She hits the nail on the head when it comes to nerotic workoholics. Harrison Ford is amazing. He fits into any role.<br /><br />I recommend watching it!

I recommend it for all ages.
068484267X|5.0|This memoir of young Frank is written in the most accurate, detailed, and stunning way an author can relate to his reader. I cried a few times holding this book, and am absolutely humbled by the various hardships this Irish family endured throughout the years. His story has to be told, his story has to be read. The viewpoints of Frank living as a Catholic, poor, and the oldest of his family is completely realistic, as he writes from the mind of a older child. Excellent dialog, phenomenal imagery, accurate details, and this book can be read again and again to learn of the human experience. This book has stood its test of time and will continue to be a great read forever. Absolutely epic book.
B004KD5TQI|3.0|I bought this album immediately after seeing the movie because on film it was absolutely insane.  But although it is a pretty good Soundtrack, it loses alot of its appeal when you don't have the amazing images to go with it.  It's dark, intense, and addictive, just seems a little watered down as just a soundtrack.  I'd say out of the nine songs, there are four I love, three that are alright, and two that I skip every time.  The songs grow on you the more you hear them.  I would buy it again but this time I would wait and buy it instore, its not worth the shipping I had to pay for it.  Enjoy
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|The show is great etc, etc.    My main pet peeve is the packaging. The plastic is  too brittle and breaks. You can hear it rattling around inside  the sealed season sets.    I wasn't happy. I returned it and exchanged it for another set  BUT EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM!!!    This wasn't as bad as the first set, so I'll have to keep it.    Paramount, USE BETTER PLASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|Set in a dystopian society where each year a male and female child are selected from each of the 12 districts to literally fight to the death in a live televised event, this novel is literally a page turner.  I had seen this on several bestseller lists but never really paid too much attention to it given that I don't normally read YA fiction.  This was recommended to me and I am so glad I picked it up to read.    From the first chapter I was hooked, and wanted to know what would happen next.  It is an addicting story and I highly recommend that you have the second and third novel on hand once you have finished this story.  You will definitely want to know what happens in the next instalment once you have finished this one!
0205313426|5.0|I received this book in a goody bag from O'Reilly Media just prior to starting work on my own book Asterisk: The Future of Telephony. I referenced this book many times and learned a significant number of things which I've taken with me in all writing to this day. The best part is it took less than an hour to read, and for a book on grammar, it was quite an enjoyable read. Well laid out, and didn't contain more than you absolutely needed. Highly recommended reading for anyone.
1416914307|3.0|This third book definitely wraps pretty much all of your questions up, maybe a little too quickly for my taste.<br /><br />Still a fun read and it kept me going, but predictable.  And the whining got a bit much by the end.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Since I do not use my Google Calendar heavily, I was skeptical that this app would be very useful to me, but just after a day of using it I've already changed my mind. This app adds every feature supported by Google Calendar into a very intuitive and manageable user interface. The menus are easy enough to navigate, and it runs well on my entry-level LG Optimus V. Definitely worth the price, a steal for free!
B003EYVXXW|1.0|Mr. Amen&aacute;bar doesn't mince words: if you believe in God -if you are a Christian in particular- you're nothing but an ignorant, brutal, misogynist moron. On the contrary, if you adhere to Hollywood's amoral anything-goes platitudes, you belong among the wise, learned, tolerant and heroic. Not to mention young and beautiful.<br /><br />Yeah, sure..!<br /><br />For the record, no direct evidence relates Hypatia's death to either religious dogma or Cyril in particular. It is mostly agreed she died an old woman murdered in a political riot among Christian sects. No actual writings of her own remain, although she is credited with inventing the hydrometer. Her astronomical achievements are unknown, but to claim that she surpassed Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler is mere preposterous hogwash. So is the film's portrayal of Roman society as a tolerant agora of gender, race and creed tolerance, or Ancient Alexandria being a city built in Pharaonic architecture. It's like imagining XX Century Manhattan as a metropolis of tepees! As for Christian obtuseness -the movie's bottom line- St. Augustine (Hypatia's contemporary) believed time was born along with space, and Thomas Aquinas believed all natural knowledge should engage both mathematics and experimentation. Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton were devoted Christians, formed, shaped, and trained by Christian Universities. In fact, everything we know about the ancients we owe to the thousands of unknown Christian scholars that salvaged, preserved, copied and divulged their knowledge! Mr Amen&aacute;bar, on the other hand, is a product of the hate-mongering Spanish Left that burned churches, killed priests, raped nuns much in the same fashion his movie depicts, only those atrocities were committed only 80 years ago. I'm still waiting a movie about them.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Great app BUT... Useless for me personally until there is a widget. Dont need to have to start 2 apps.
B004FOA84A|2.0|DROID X this would be a fine little game except for all the force closes, the music volume that won't stay turned off and also which sometimes doesn't stop playing after you close the game and you have to kill it. The game also would be nice if it saved your progress when you close it instead of making you start over.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This is a nice calendar application. The feature that I like most is the configurability of the widget. One can choose from a grid size of 2-col x 1-row up to 4-col x 4-row, thereby trading screen space for amount of information. The widget can be configured for Month, Week, Day, or Agenda view.    In the agenda widget view, different days are divided by a horizontal line. However the date of the event displays within a different block from the events themselves. I find this confusing and feel it would be better to have horizontal separator, day of event, events. Undoubtedly the developer intended for the horizontal separator to be a header line, with the day of event on top of the header. This only works visually if there a vertical gap between different days, which there is not.    In 3-col or 4-col view, also suggest putting date on same line as event, to save vertical space for more events.    Edit: Have to lower to 2 stars. I only have about 10 apps installed on my phone. This one introduced instability. Sometimes my phone would freeze for 10 secs or so. Other times it would freeze permanently and I would have to restart my phone. Then the widget disappeared from the screen. When I tried to add it back, it wasn't available to add any more. The fault was pretty clear. I had to uninstall the app.    Edit 2: Raise to 4 stars, after some gyrations with installation, app location, and phone restarting as seen in the comments.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the calendar app I've been looking for. I've tried all the other calendar apparently out there and none come close to this one.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|A great album, from beginning to end.  The hit \\"Rolling In the Deep\\" starts things off, and \\"Rumor Has It\\" keeps it going.  Adele's gorgeous voice pangs with emotion on each song, songs that make you want to move & songs that make you hurt for the memories they can bring up.  This album already feels like one of my top 10, and that's after only 4 listens of just digging every song.  I hope you buy this album, as a voice like this should be enjoyed by all.
0345509617|5.0|There is a TON of information contained in this tome. I can't add a lot to what so many many other reviewers have mentioned, except that I do think this is an awkward format for a book this thick. It essentially forces you to put it down flat while you read. A taller book would have overcome this. This is a minor complaint, but it means I can't read it as easily in bed. :-)
0736092269|5.0|Great book. He illustrations are fantastic. If you are looking to learn about muscular anatomy and about the muscles used in various exercises, I highly recommend this book.
0785151303|4.0|I just received my copy of The Art of Thor and overall my first impression is good. It comes in a slipcase with a nice spot varnish printing. The book is bound in a brown faux leather with gold embossing. This was a very nice aspect to the publication. The paper stock is ok (I've seen thicker) and the printing is good overall, but I noticed that about half a dozen images were enlarged too much and thus pixelated (on a first browsing of the book).    The book is divided into 8 chapters:  1. Forging a Hero  2. Gods and Monsters  3. Brothers in Arms  4. Brave New Worlds  5. Tools of the Trade  6. Closer to Home  7. Bringing the Thunder  8. The Legend Debuts    For better or worse this book isn't text-heavy. It is an Art of book so it really does showcase the art. Maybe they will also release a making of book in the future. I did enjoy looking at all of the concept artwork, particularly the Brave New Worlds chapter, but I have a particular interest in conceptualizing environments/architecture etc. I also enjoyed the content (i.e. Norse myth and narrative) and following the process from concept to visualization.     My only real complaint is that some of the images are enlarged too much and are pixelated.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great app! Needed something like this. I'll let SwiftKey finish this review. You should therefore carry out your own virus checks before opening any attachment. Please note that the information in this outgoing message. Haha! Love it
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game has excellent graphics and sound.  it looks and feel real. Challenging puzzles. family friendly, finally a great game without any trace of violence.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|How do you get the widget to appear? I long-press on my homescreen and go to widgets and there is no option for this app...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best books I have ever read, and I am constantly reading something new. In the last two days I read an 1000 page book. Collins has a masterpiece here, once you pick it up, you will not put it down.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I bought this one days before it subsequently came out as a freebie.  Force Close no matter what I try - it will not open at all on the Viewsonic G-Tab ( Android ), and the option of trying to do a data clear is also not available.  It looked like it would have been a lot of fun, too - but not if it won't run.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Great calendar app, however, I like HTC's calendar widget better because I can scroll up and down with it, with this app, I have to click on the up and down arrows and doesn't feel smooth.
0393338827|5.0|I can say that this book was way better, way easier to read than any of the other \\"exposes\\" on the financial meltdown/crisis in 2007-2008.  Its a very interesting read, fun to read.  This is not a booring read, like \\"House of Cards\\"  I really liked this and learned a lot.  You'll walk away ticked off!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I suppose I over think the movies I see, because I am very sensitive to the sub-text associated with every movie released. Often it is that adults, and especially Dads, are clueless,(not the one in the movie Clueless, he was awesome) bumbling, and most importantly, impertinent. Please don't hit me with all of the exceptions. It seems that anymore to see a movie that uplifts the customer, we have to go to the animated/CGI studios. Why is that?  \\"Despicable Me\\", partially funded by the French government(for crying out loud), brazenly stomps on these current Hollywood values. It is like a photographic negative of the gazillion dollar formula of former Disney movies, about how a kid can grow up. This is how an adult can accept responsibility and find the deepest satisfaction in loving his children(even if they are not his). The women take a bit of a hit here and come off as slightly smarmy. And the cartoon Dr. Evil resolves his inner conflict between his selfish desires and surrendering to his kids' needs.  These days, when kids don't want to grow up, this is an important message, delivered in a creative, entertaining, and funny way. It even gives Tex Avery a run for his money, with over the top exaggerated gags.  It is the emotional core of this movie that the Dad is absolutely necessary to the family. Yeah, sure, he's all the girls have, but isn't that the case for all of us?
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've used the Jorte calendar for a year and it was my fave, but it cant sync added calendars in your google account, like Jewish Holidays...well, this one can! the monthly view (my default and fav) is a little ugly and hard to decypher on this app, but that might just take some messing to get it to look how i like.
B004FOA84A|5.0|was great, but was done in less than an hour.  need more adventures or levels.   keep up the good work and create more adventures.  that all
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What else needs to be said that hasn't already about 'Angry Birds'?  Great game my whole family enjoys.  The free 'seasons' update adds another layer appreciation for the developer and enjoyment for us fans.
B004FOA84A|3.0|can anybody just let me know were grandpa is or ...im stuck with fish bowl and paper and how you open door with no lock
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I was looking for a Cal app that had a good widget, this is it. I'd reccimend it if you need a full featured Cal app to keep track of multiple Google calendars.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|When it comes to Ricky Martin, he's at his best when he sticks to his Latin roots. And because of that, M+A+S is a great listen. Yes, he's older, more mature and that certainly shows, but in a very good way. It's not just Ricky that's at his best, this is music at it's best! 
0316056863|5.0|I'm giving this as a gift to all the women I work with.  There are so many incites into how we women manage to pull everything off while at the same staying human, insecurities and all.  I also love how she links learning from her theater experiences into the real life work place.  It's right on the money.  A really fun read.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|i use mobile me on my mac and ipod touch with busycal to sync with google calendars and then with my droid. sounds complicated, i know. the native cal app on my droid doesn't have a whole lot of functionality and frankly is a little wonky. i grabbed this app on amazon's free day and i'm pretty impressed. clean, smooth scrolling and relatively easy to figure out. i love the drag and drop features and the level of customization. the only thing i can't figure out is the widgets.. other than that, great app. looking forward to updates.
B004G600A4|5.0|I am a huge Disney fan and I have to say that this movie has just climbed my list of top 5 Disney films.  Loved it!!!
B004J4RQIM|5.0|They say that second parts are never good. But this is the exception to the rule.<br />Great concert, great artists, great sound, great photofraphy and superb selection of songs.<br />David is an all star musician.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|i have to manage multiple apps and this works wonders! it's probably a bit complex if you just have a personal calendar but if you have many, it's awesome! great as a widget too!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Graphics are food.  Story line fun.  Puzzles challenging but double.  Am good couple of hours of fun for a buck.  ;)  Looking forward to next installment.
B004G6009U|5.0|I bought this movie for my two children, aged 8 and 5, and they loved it. There are a couple of slightly scary moments but none which caused me any concern. I watched the movie with my kids and enjoyed the humour and amazing visuals. The Blu-ray looks stunning, even in 2D, and this disc plays fine on my Region B Blu-ray player. Highly recommended.
0307474712|2.0|A co-work referred this book to me stating it praises, but as with most books I come to Amazon and read their reviews. Though I'm still reading it I have completed most of it, 3/4th has been read.  This book did not grab me at the beginning and I shared this with her who stated another friend said the same thing, she said it starts slow but gets better. Let me tell you it does not!!!  Before I  had reached the half-way point I knew would not refer this book to my friends or co-workers with whom I share my love of reading with. A large part of that reasoning for me is that Dexter is not a likeable character; I had no sympathy for him.
0061537969|5.0|This is one book that you will not be able to put down! Such a heart wrenching book that is full of emotion. It is hard to find a good book like this but Garth Stein has done a magnificent job in captivating the readers. Can't reccommend it enough. This I'm sure will be a movie one day just like Marly and Me. Will read the other books Mr. Stein has wrote too. Hopefully they are as good as this one?
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I randomly came across this book and purchased based on the positive reviews I saw.  Typically, it takes me a month to read a book based on a hectic work schedule, but I managed to finish this book in three days.  It's a little slow and seemingly redundant in the beginning, but quickly escalates into a page turner.  I definitely recommend!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Love this calendar.  Way better than the droid x's default calendar.  I was actually hoping that amazon would give this away, and to my suprise, they actually did.  Love it.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|It's about time Amazon released something useful on their app a day. This thing is awesome. Just wish you could resize the widget without having to create a new widget.
B004Q9T4E4|1.0|I purchased this book, after thoroughly enjoying \\"The Ascent of Money\\",and thought this book would be as intellectually challenging and educational as his previous books.There are serious \\"factual inaccuracies\\" in this book which really disappointed me. Sadly these inaccuracies all have the same theme (perhaps intentional?).<br /><br />I will quote just a few in this review.<br /><br />1.Ferguson writes \\"The caliphate also produced what some regard as the first true hospitals, such as the bimaristan established at Damascus by Caliph al-Waleed bin Abdel Malek in 707 AD, which was designed to cure rather than merely house the sick\\".<br /><br />A cursory glance at the history and origins of hospitals in Wikipedia shows this to be patently untrue. \\" Following First Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. construction of a hospital in every cathedral town was begun. Among the earliest were those built by the physician Saint Sampson in Constantinople and by Basil, bishop of Caesarea in modern-day Turkey. Called the \\"Basilias\\", the latter resembled a city and included housing for doctors and nurses and separate buildings for various classes of patients.[17] There was a separate section for lepers.[18] Some hospitals maintained libraries and training programs, and doctors compiled their medical and pharmacological studies in manuscripts. Thus in-patient medical care in the sense of what we today consider a hospital, was an invention driven by Christian mercy and Byzantine innovation\\"<br /><br />He wilfully ignores the very well-documented role played by the Catholic Church in the formation of hospitals fully 332 years before !!!<br /><br />2.Ferguson writes \\"Spanish rule also meant Roman Catholicism, which was not all bad.\\"<br /><br />He knowingly does not comment on the benefits of Catholicism in South America, and the work done by thousands of Catholic missionaries on the continent.<br /><br />3.Ferguson writes \\"Wherever Protestant missionaries went, they promoted literacy,with measurable long-term benefits to the societies they sought to educate;the same cannot be said of Catholic missionaries throughout the period from the Counter-Reformation to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1962-5)\\"<br /><br />Ferguson once again ignores centuries of Catholic missions in totally hostile regions and the brave work they did often resulting in death for the missionaries.Why someone chooses to be a missionary and does not want to teach literacy defies logic.<br /><br />There are many other examples of this anti-Catholic bias throughout this book.The recurring theme throughout this book is the Roman Catholic Church played a negative role in the rise of the West, and any good from Christianity was due to the Protestants.<br /><br />I have read similar teachings in Freemasonry writings. I wonder if there is a link between Ferguson and the Freemasons?to educate;the same cannot be said of Catholic missionaries throughout the period from the Counter-Reformation to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1962-5)\\"    Ferguson once again ignores centuries of Catholic missions in totally hostile regions and the brave work they did often resulting in death for the missionaries.Why someone chooses to be a missionary and does not want to teach literacy defies logic.

B0040QYROA|5.0|If you call yourself a film connoisseur, you've got to have this on the top of your list of all-time greatest films. This film transcends time in that it resonates to this day and will so in the future. This is German Expressionism at its best. Lang explores society in a disturbing and alarming class-conscious outlook. The film comments heavily and criticizes capitalism. Set in a daunting and massive futuristic city, the viewer is allowed entry into the world of the workers and the privileged. The visual effects and propaganda-like design are incredibly impressive. Cubist artists must revel when watching this film. Exploring with music and effects this film is a spectacle. Considering that this film was made during the beginning of the Nazi regime, it is not in the least bit surprising that the Nazi Party fell in love with this film. This film speaks to the masses in its commentary on capitalism and the harrowing effects of a class-conscious society. Perhaps the most notable difference in the different releases of the film is the film's score. The jazz that plays in the background for one release is surprisingly ineffective... this would be my only critique against the film. Often in silent films this is a problem for modern audiences but I think had this film been made with a futuristic score, something sweepingly dark and moody, this film would be more powerful (if that is possible). I highly recommend this film to anyone that is interested in German film, design, expressionism, architecture, etc. I've seen this film four times now and I would still be glad to see it again. This film is a film that stirs the mind and begs to be viewed again. It's a long film so make sure you've got good time to give it justice.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I needed a bag that could hold my SLR, Camcorder, P&S, lenses, flash, media, batteries, charging equipment, filters, cleaners, etc. This bag handled them all with ease and for a little over $20!!! Mind you, this is not the Lowepro construction and it is not comfortable enough to even be a day hiker, but if you need a secure place to store ALL your equipment, this is your bag. If you already have a nice sling, holster, or mid-size SLR bag, this is your bag. If the bag is going to do some light travelling, this is your bag. If you travel the world and expect this bag to protect your valuable equipment, this is NOT your bag. While the interior is customizable, it is difficult to truly secure all the equipment.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I LOVED this book! Hilarious! I only wish the publisher would enable lending for 14 days so my friend could read it without trading Kindles with him!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I watched this movie more than 2 times. And it's really great and I also liked the music and liked the movie. It really attracted me to watch it again and hear the music of it.
B00000DD2D|5.0|I tried and tried to find a copy of Blues Blues Blues to no avail.  Found it on Amazon.  Received it promptly and am enjoying it.  Thanks.

0470932139|5.0|I have just received a copy of \\"Plate to Pixel\\" yesterday and I am really thrilled! I could not put this book down (my family can testify as dinner came later than usual...).    I am amazed at how much extensive information the book provides and how clearly the information is organized throughout the book including many examples in real life situations, great pictures and illustrations, settings, tips...     The style all along is very easy to grasp and convivial. You almost feel as if the author is sitting on a chair next to you sharing a cup of coffee while explaining in detail the ins and outs. It just flows naturally and you learn so much out of it.    I would definitely highly recommend this book! The book offers a tremendous amount of useful information on both photography itself and food styling. Obviously, all pictures are amazing as you can expect for those of you already familiar with Tartelette's blog. The resource list at the end of the book is also a very nice added bonus!     I am grateful to the author for doing such hard work with such ease!
B004NSULHM|2.0|Of course the music is pure genius. There are very few artists who could create something so complex and non-traditional. But unlike their last 2 albums, this one really is background music only. That has its place. But to me it's all very boring.

B004TTMYQG|3.0|I've been using HTC's stock sense calendar app and widget. Both seem to have a sleeker look and feel to the alternatives available in this app. For example, htc's agenda widget is more readable imo, and you can scroll via swipe gestures as opposed to tiny unintuitive buttons. This calender app potters far more configuration options than HTC's and I really like the week view. I'm sure this beats the pants off stock android and if they we're to hire a UI guy to give the app a new coat of paint, I'd have no trouble recommending this asp to all my friends (even those using sense). Until then this is still worth the download while amazon is giving it away got free.
0393337170|4.0|This book gives quality-time to my hero Garrett Hardin on \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\" as the root of many problems.  They even recommend Poundstone's \\"Prisoner's Dilemma\\", which would be my recommendation if you are just starting out, because no one can weave in the human interest to keep you reading like William Poundstone.  Yet this book has way more technical content, presented accessibly, than \\"Prisoner's Dilemma\\".
B002KE47Z8|5.0|Lahiri has such a simple way of writing simple stories. Yet the straight-forwardness of her prose leaves much to the imagination and doesn't waste your time with lengthy, pretentious elaboration. Shakespeare said, \\"Brevity is the soul of wit.\\" Lahiri understands this perfectly.
B000KFCJAY|1.0|My experience with this unit was identical to that of Rod C., above - endless clogging of the tube that delivers the sand to the gun. A commenter to Rod C.s review recommends covering the sand source and elevating it above the level of the gun. I tried this without success. The commenter continues: \\"if reading and following the instructions isn't your style..\\". I don't know what instructions he is talking about. The only instructions are a couple of text-free cartoon images on the box, showing the sand-bucket at ground level and uncovered. Some time after I gave up on this unit, my pressure washer, also a Karcher, died on me. So I will junk both and start again - with a different brand. Ironically, the price of this unit has gone UP. I paid $75. It is now near $100.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this app.  As others have said, it's very short but the story is good and challenging.  I hope to see more like this from this author.  More than worth the price.
B004I4H8PO|5.0|I pre-ordered this box set back in February.  Very excited about it coming out.  Then the closer it got the more scared I became.  I kept hearing about all these problems with bum discs and damage in transit, so when release day came I held my breath.  Upon receiving my Amazon package I carefully opened everything.  Everything was fine except three out of the five discs had came free from their little slots in shipping.  I immediately checked for scratches and lucky I found none.  The discs looked great.  No evidence of \\"glue\\" that I have seen in other reviews.  Other than that the box set looked great.    First of all I was very impressed with the \\"extras\\".  Example: The book is not some cheap book, it is a hardback book with 48 pages with lots of pics and text.  The \\"Derek is Eric\\" pin is heavy cast pin with a push back type of pin.  I expected some kind of do-it-yourself pin you make at hobby lobby.  Finally the thing that impressed me the most was the 3D-art work underneath the lid.  It looks awesome as you lift the lid.  I read other people's reviews and I can see how this could be damaged and I'm going to handle mine with care to ensure it lasts.      Music:  Well I've only listened to the Music-DVD and I can say I was impressed with what I heard.  Very good sound.  Loud.  I was blaring my copy at what my DVD player considers a low level.  But that is all I can tell you, I have no expert ears.  I'm not worried about the rest of the music because I am a fan and heard most of it all before.    Bottom Line: In my opinion this is a very nice set that if you can find a copy that hasn't been damage/scratched then I suggest you get it.  I'm going to enjoy mine.  If you did get a bum copy all I can say is I feel for you.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Just AMAZING, these are the words I have to describe this CD. I like every song on this album but \\"How I Roll\\". My favourite one is \\"Trip to your heart\\", I hope this song to be considered a single. The extra sonsgs are just great!!!  If you are Britney fan you have to buy this cd right now if not, this is a dance/pop album that you will enjoy from the beggining to the end.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Poor organazation and few choices. I was hoping that this would pick up on the appointment color coding from Outlook and import it. Sadly, it does not.  Jorte is, by far, the better calendar app/widgit. And, Jorte is free every day.
B00069A5GE|5.0|I am not rating the music (which is great), but rather the DVD-Audio portion of this 2 disc set. If you enjoy this album and have a decent DVD-Audio set-up, this is the format to get! Buy it now before it is out of print.
0316056863|5.0|I read this book because I wanted to be entertained and get a glimpse at Tina Fey's life.  I wasn't looking for deep revelations or something I can apply to myself.  I was not disappointed.  She is funny as heck.  I read it in a weekend, and laughed out loud a lot.      I actually did get something I could apply to real life, though.  The rules of improvisational comedy are pretty cool to know, and not a bad way to think of living your life.      I hope she writes another book in 10 years (or sooner).  I will read it in a heart beat.
B004FOA84A|4.0|It is possible to solve some of the puzzles out of order and get trapped, but overall a great point-and-click adventure game!
0316069353|4.0|Stay with Michael Connelly's \\"The Fifth Witness\\" because his last minute contortions will probably grab you as it did me. Try not to miss any details as you read, and you may sniff out some of the surprise ending. Connelly is one of the cleverest, most inventive plot constructors out there among American crime writers, very original and very good at flipping his stories into unexpected territory.<br />Parts of this book, particularly the courtroom scenes are very well-done, full of suspense, but it's a rather long book, and it does have its moments that lack authenticity and are formulaic. Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer, is back, but I miss having Harry Bosch around to stir the pot. This one has more scenes about Mickey's family and love life with former wife Maggie which seem drawn out.<br /> There's good by-play between Mickey and the assistant d.a. He is defending a client from hell; she's bi-polar and manipulative. The mortgage crisis, the housing bust and the foreclosure mess are crucial elements in this book, and are the reasons that his client Lisa Trammel has been charged with the murder of the mortgage bank officer Mitchell Bondurant.<br /> Mickey is always maneuvering, like his novelist creator, looking for that angle that will save his client. All the odds and evidence are stacked against him, but faced with one dead end, he goes back and tries another tack. How can he possibly persevere? Guts, ingenuity, a quick legal mind, often with his ruthless need for survival. He's training a new assistant, a female lawyer, who wonders about his principles and ethics. He gets beaten up by goons, and it's a mystery who and why he was attacked.<br />I love the legal slang: if you take the Fifth Amendment privilege, you're taking the nickel. When you're picking the jury, you look for \\"the hanger\\", the person who will hang up the jury and get you an acquittal. If you okay someone for the jury, you punch their ticket. Watch for the interesting use Connelly makes of Ravel's \\"Bolero.\\"<br /> Connelly is the master of plot twists and turns; he manipulates the court and the reader, but the results are satisfying and entertaining. When the novelist is the scam artist and con man, we get caught off guard, but that is what Connelly manages to do. He scams us into reading and then by tricks and gimmicks, he keeps us going until we're ensnared but satisfied by his ingenuity and cleverness.\\"   Connelly is the master of plot twists and turns; he manipulates the court and the reader, but the results are satisfying and entertaining.

0545265355|5.0|Books arrived quickly, and the 3-book boxset is attractive on my bookshelf. These books are incredibly addictive-once you read the 1st you can't stop, so you may as well order all 3!
0439023513|5.0|I read all 3 books in about 4 days.  I was so engrossed in them I could not put them down-I would even read during work on my Kindle app!  The ending to this series is perfect.  I think Collins did each character justice.  I don't think I would have differed much from the book even if I were writing my preferred outcomes for the characters and the city of Panem.
B000K1P66W|5.0|Bought this book as a companion to a webinar covering the four agreements.  Webinar helpful but book could stand alone.  Find myself referring to various parts of it as life situations arise.  It is indeed practical and simple to follow but not necessarily easy to incorporate into life - great benchmark though if you do a daily inventory to see where using one (or more) of the four agreements would improve life and relationsips. Recommend highly - but keep it handy 'cause your gonna refer to it frequently.
B000002TLX|5.0|If you like Richard Marx you will love this greatest hits album.....it has all the favorite songs. I've really been enjoying listening to it......brings back a lot of memories.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I almost didn't bother downloading this app.   Although I'm not really happy with the stock calendar (it always opens on the wrong day - maybe it's an EVO thing?)  who'd have thought someone could build a better app than Google on Google's android platform using Google's calendar?  Well this guy did!
B0002KP5FI|5.0|Nicola Conte moves from his electronic-jazz hybrid to a more full-on jazz album with _Other Directions_. The summery vibe still remains, but Conte eschews the exotic locales of _Bossa Per Due_ for a more straightforward groove (though the Brazilian vibe lives on \\"Sea and Sand\\". \\"Wanin'Moon,\\" for example, has a classic structure, replete with sailing vocals, while \\"Impulso\\" surges forward with a quick step rhythm. \\"Kind of Sunshine\\" brings in the house kick-drum, it's only appearance on an otherwise sedate album. If anything, Nicola Conte and Koop have the same aesthetic: keep it mellow, keep it pleasant, keep it sensuous. And that's always a step in the right direction. \\"Aphrodite's Dream\\" soothes like a Swedish massage, while \\"The Dharma Bums\\" feels like a summer drive along the Italian coastline. The title track takes its own journey on the double bass and sax. But it's Conte's cover of Krzysztof Komeda's \\"Le Depart\\" that really travels the distance, stretching, as it does, from Poland to France. Any direction is a good one to take with this album.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|The app itself runs smoothly and I haven't seen a better calendar. I especially like how adding events and setting up reoccurring ones is super easy. The widgets on the other hand don't display well on my droid x with launcher pro.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I recently switched to the free version of this calendar app because I was sick of how bad the interface was on all the other calendar apps I'd tried. Now I see the full version offered for free today, there's absolutely no reason not to switch! Get it while you can! (Though to be fair, I never saw any problems with the free version!)
B004FOA84A|1.0|I can't give it anything more than 1 star since it won't run on my Atrix.  I immediately get a force close upon starting the app. Happy I got it on the free app day!
B0028R3NCU|2.0|Like most of the one start reviews for this, I have to agree it is a handy, fast, small micro SD reader. While it works great it may not work long. I ordered the reader on March 8th and by April 25th it was done. I give it 2 stars just for how well it worked considering the amount of usage it received in the short time it lasted.      If you need one of these for occasional or lite use I recommend this reader, otherwise look for something built for heavier use.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|First off, after having a 50\\" Panasonic plasma and using my PS3 as blu-ray player for a few years now, I thought I had seen the full potential of my HD equipment, but the amazing quality of filming presented in this series blew my mind! The quality of the footage these people recorded far surpass any other similar footage like planet earth, plus you throw in David Attenborough and this is purely amazing, and again, the highest quality I've ever seen come out of Blu-ray discs.<br />Also, I am a biology major from Colorado State University, and the information presented in this is also spectacular. Not too over the top where you don't pay attention, and not to broad where you don't take anything away. I have studied the presented material within this series immensely and I still learned a lot by watching these. I felt it covered the animal behavior especially well. This really should be in all biology classrooms and school libraries - I remember learning this stuff on slide projectors with cheesy cassette tape audio backing.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go. The story was classic and I highly suggest downloading as many of the free classics as possible.
B0035G5IOE|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater, the history of how it was created was clever and the preview made it look quite interesting.     Well the story was weak, the plot un-entertaining, and the ending - dull.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|I'll try to be brief . . . that's all this 2 1/2 hour piece deserves.<br /><br />Wonderful opening scene of a high suspense dialogue between Nazi SS officer (\\"Jew Hunter\\"), and rustic farmer (harboring Jews) at his primitive kitchen table.  Masterful suspense.<br /><br />I'm not sure what happened after that.  The film degenerated into 150 minutes of tripe:  Improbable characters, gratuitous violence ad nauseum, repetitious improbable situations (\\"I've got a gun on you, but you've got a gun on me, but my partner has a gun on you\\").  Was this written/directed by a 12 year old?<br /><br />The storyline is self-indulgent Hollywood garbage which rewrites the culmination of the WWII war in Europe such that it takes place at the screening of a major new Nazi film at a Paris theater.  No kidding.  Yes, of course!  Opening night! Film-making and it's deserved central role in the play out of major world politics!  What crap.<br /><br />I'll admit, at close it did make me sit and think/question for a few minutes.  Had I just watched a comedy? (I don't think so).  Why did director Quentin Tarantino do this to himself? (over-confident?) Will lead actor Brad Pitt ever be able to show his face in public again? (was this a desparate rehabilitation effort?).<br /><br />I'm not going to explore the complex element of the infamous persecution of Jews by Nazi Germany.  The story must be told and re-told, but much money has been made from The Holocaust.  I'm not sure when that line gets crossed (here?).<br /><br />I'll give credit for the production sets (above average) and most of the acting (not Brad Pitt). But Inglourious Basterds is high budget garbage.
061891868X|2.0|Lee Smolin is a Grinch!<br /><br />There, I've said it.<br /><br />But being \\"detailed and specific\\" as Amazon asks for in these reviews, this book is way too long, way too repetitive and came across to me as a case of sour grapes from a physicist on a crusade because he feels he has missed out on something.<br /><br />Just what that \\"something\\" might be is clearly intensely personal - and I actually liked that Smolin has the guts to wear his heart on his sleeve even if his angst was so terribly teenage - but really, his premise that physics has failed because there has been a significant investment in string theory to the detriment of anything else is as untestable as the various 'string theory fails because...' scenarios he paints in his book.<br /><br />Smolin brands physics (and by implication \\"science\\" as a whole) as very much herd behaviour with some alpha males (sorry, not being sexist but this is serious geek territory and 99.9% of the players are male) leading the lemmings over a theoretical cliff.  Then there are the hints of a whiff of a sniff of something controversial but it turns out that Dave didn't talk to Roger at that particular conference and they both turned their back on Stuart...so take that Smolin, you Quantum Loop Gravity guy, you!<br /><br />Smolin is clearly not an alpha male and perhaps it is that lack that causes him to deliver numerous statements of \\"fact\\" that are anything but, such as this interesting edict:<br /><br />\\"Science requires a balance between rebellion and respect, so there will always be arguments between radicals and conservatives. But there is no balance in the current academic world. More than at any time in the history of science, the cards are stacked against the revolutionary.\\"<br /><br />What utter tosh!  Is Smolin in danger of being burnt at the stake for his heretical views?  Not likely!  Will he be hounded out of his country of birth on the basis of being the wrong religion?  I don't think so.  And will he be ignored because of his sex, the colour of his skin or because he is hidden behind an Iron Curtain?  No of course not.<br /><br />I certainly think that a critical review of how we do science is worthwhile.  And with a sceptical editor this might have been such a book.  But as written it's just a big dummy spit chock full of dubious claims and unproven assertions that undermine the very arguments that it is trying to support.ause he is hidden behind an Iron Curtain?

B001TH8UUA|5.0|Love Amazon Basic cables, and cannot recommend them high enough.  They are well made and fit well, perfect for the job.  I only buy these cables    If you think you need to spend big money to get good HDMI cables you are WRONG.  Basically HDMI cables transmit 1's and 0's, and you cannot improve them over a cable - so why pay more.  Some manufacturers make up all sorts of rubbish to allow them to charge stupid prices for cables.  It would be like buying a garden hose because the manufacturer said the water will be better quality when it comes out the other end (but some people still do).
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Until you install this great app, you don't know how much functionality you are missing from your android powered phone. Once you install it though, your phone becomes a beast!!!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Love these Amazon Basic RCA cables, and cannot recommend them highly enough. They are a really solid cable and fit snug on the RCA jacks.  They can be a bit difficult if you have a tight radius as they are a thick cable and don't bend too well but I don't have that problem.  Overall great cable and great price.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|I had been using the stock HTC sense calendar on my desire for a while now. It is a well presented calender but lacked basic, like the widget calender would not show the different colors of my calenders, just a generic mark for my appointments. After having used biz calender I can safely say I have found an amazing replacement. It might lack the visual flair of HTC sense calender but it more then makes up for it in function. You will greatly appreciate the depth of features the calender provides.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|While it may take a village to raise a child, if the village in question is Charlestown, MA , the child may very well be trained in the modern guild of bank robbers. \\"The Town\\", Ben Affleck's second film as a rapidly maturing director in the no nonsense mold of Clint Eastwood, gets it right, from the broad \\"a\\"s that trip naturally from Affleck's tongue to the Notre Dame tattoo which simultaneously adorns and identifies the neck of the Jeremy Renner character. Shot largely on location,\\"The Town\\" uses the people, sports facilities/teams and especially the neighborhood bars and strip joints to create a tribal world of crime and corruption,loyalty and omerta which defines and delimits its characters.  In the past filmmaking decade, blue collar MA has become a favored setting for films as diverse as \\"Mystic River\\", \\"The Departed\\", \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" (Affleck's first directorial effort) and \\"The Fighter\\". Where \\"The Town\\" has the edge over the Eastwood and Scorsese efforts, and parallels that of David O. Russell/ Mark Wahlberg, involves the question of home turf. From the time of his Oscar winning \\"Good Will Hunting\\" script to the present film, Affleck has been most successful when he sticks close to home. Here he expertly directs a superb cast which features \\"The Hurt Locker\\"'s Jeremy Renner (in a performance of deeply unsettling precision and nuance) as the always ready to explode character of the best friend, Blake Lively as the sluttish, drug running and addicted single mother (a direct parallel to the Amy Ryan character in \\"Gone Baby Gone\\")who was once the Affleck character's girlfriend, Jon Hamm as the tenacious but outplayed FBI agent and Pete Postlethwaite in his valedictory performance as the skeletal but lethal crime boss.  The extended Blu-ray version of \\"The Town\\" deepens the central relationships between the Affleck and Rebecca Hall characters, bank robber and bank robbery victim/hostage who become lovers, and the Affleck and Renner characters, boyhood chums raised in crime school together. The Blu-ray makes additionally fine use of the city of Charlestown/Boston as a main character and punches up the energy level in the film's two most memorable sequences: the \\"nuns with guns\\" masked robbery and subsequent chase through the narrow and winding historical streets of Boston's North End and the extended robbery of big game(Yankees) receipts from Fenway Park, the cathedral of baseball. In their scripting and directing, but especially in their sound and visual editing, these parts of \\"The Town\\" belong in the company of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Heat\\". In general, this Blu-ray's images are vivid and almost palpable, the sound track crisp, deep and rich.  Ben Affleck's \\"The Town\\": local boy makes good, really, really good.

0316056863|2.0|Goodness knows I love Tina Fey; her wit, her graciousness, and her standard WTF look, but this book is just boring and gets bogged down in minutia. I understand it's hard to write a memoir knowing you have to at least pound out 50k words, but that only serves to further my argument that all memoirs should be self-published, or electronic, and cost no more than 2.99. I don't care if they're written by rock stars, jock stars, actors, politicians, or the purple elephant in the graveyard.    It would've been far better for Tina to record her memoir in some form or fashion instead of writing it. Her book voice just doesn't carry through enough to sustain even a short memoir. Which this is. There was also more vulgarity than I would've liked, but that's just me. I admit I'm tired of fart jokes, fat jokes, fertile myrtle jokes, or the queen visiting once a bloody month jokes, as well as the bodily function jokes, or \\"how I lost my virginity\\" jokes. It just smacks of juvenile humor and I'm tired of that schtick.    So, its with a heavy heart that I give a thumbs down on the book.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Ok, thought I'd give it a go since it was free, comparing it to the stock calendar app that came with my Epic.  Generally, the functionality is pretty much the same.  Business Calendar is much more configurable though, including changing how the display looks (colors).  This makes it visually more appealing for me. The addition of text on each event is a welcome difference, so I don't need to switch to list mode to see what that upcoming appointment is.  Much more like Google Calendar in how it all looks.  Moving appointments is a lot easier, as I can just drag and drop them from one day to another instead of having to edit them.<br /><br />I've run into a few small issues so far though.  Switch views on the fly is the first.  When in week view, there are menu items to switch to month and agenda views.  In Agenda view, there are menu items to switch to month and week views.  When in month view however, there is no button for switching to week view. Instead, one selects which days to zoom into, which is detailed in the help section.  While this works, I feel it's inconsistent with the rest of the menu system and not intuitive (minus star).  Also, I'd normally use the back button to back out out of an app, but in Business Calendar the back button has been rigged up to first scroll back through all the view one made, which can be a long process (minus star).  Yes, one could just use the home button, but this leaves the app running in the background, consuming resources.<br /><br />Worth the typical $5 price?  No, at least not yet.  There isn't a killer feature in here to justify it, at least not for me.  Will i keep using it instead of the stock calendar app?  Yes, certainly.  I like the visual quality better.<br /><br />I hope you have found this review helpful.  If not, please feel free to leave comments/questions.
1936594234|5.0|Great little book; perhaps tries too hard to prove a point that's been well presented, but I would rather have too much explanation than too little. Very true to the core of what the subconscious is all about. Fun to read and a joy to practice.

B002RKSZN0|4.0|Mansfield Park is an excellent novel written by Jane Austen. Her story resolves around a society based solely on material possessions. The family is a very wealthy and illustrates a world where wealth defines all. The main Character, Fanny, comes to live with her wealthy Uncle and Aunt . Previously, her lifestyle was placed in an impoverished environment. Her situation has changed thus allowing her to focus on other thing such as her own personal desires. Although, powerless in a male dominated world she perseveres against the odds and  at the very end achieves what she wants. Her dramatic change is witnessed through \\"Mansfield Park\\". The novel argues against how much power a woman actually wields despite her hindrance of society against it.Unlike her previous novels Austen does not completely end the story as a happy ending. Her novel includes a divorce that affects the very fabric of society. Her introduction of numerous characters is very overwhelming. I personally had to reread the first chapter multiple times. The conflict in the novels are condescending and diverse much like modern day House wives. Austen attacks society as she explores adultery, male dominance, primogeniture, and affection through the texts of her novel \\"Mansfield Park\\".
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have been using this app ever since the Beta was started in the Google Market.  I loved it and love the ability to add and view events from multiple calendars.  However, at the end of the Beta period, I felt that ~$5 was too high, thus I am thrilled this is the free app of the day.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|I love this album.  I saw him in Seattle twice recently, and the songs translate very well to concert performances. I am a bit bemused by the complaints about Paul \\"preaching\\". He follows no religion, not even the Jewish faith. However, he is always questioning the meaning of life. He is in no way trying to recruit anyone to any religion what so ever.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This was a very helpful read that should be purchased by authors or artists who have ran into a wall. It covers a lot of problems in a short amount of time, which I have never encountered in a book like this. There may be better books for help out there, but this one works just fine.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've had this app for awhile and I love it. I think its awesome that Amazon has it free today, that gives others a chance to try it out. To me its way better than HTC stock calendar and Jorte.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Bis calendar only shows colored square in month view if you have an entry so you have to tap each one to see what they are. That was the biggest annoyance with HTC calendar. Jorte displays the text. Has more view options and it DOES sync with Google. I can set Jorte widget to display this week and next week only which I like. Also you can tell it what day to start. I have mine set to start each week on Sat since that's when my pay period starts. My advice, grab this one now cause its free but also get Jorte and see for yourself. For all you pilots put there...Jorte makes a great logbook! Just enter the flight info on the day you fly then print out your g.calendar once a month and you're done!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|i was so happy when i saw this calendar app was free. it works perfectly and i cant say enough good things about it. definitely worth the 4.99 and even better because it's free today!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This has a layout similar to the web layout. I've been disappointed that Google didn't make a app like this, but now someone did! I got it when Amazon had it as a free app, but I think its probably worth the money. From what I've seen from it over a day of us, I love it.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I won't repeat anything the top three reviewers have to say about Hereafter.  I will simply add that the three stories of the French journalist brought back from death, the English boy trying to learn to live without his twin brother killed in an accident, and the American, Matt Damon, attempting to ignore his gift of being able to connect to the spirit world do come together, if only briefly, at the end of the film.<br /><br />Matt Damon's character is at the center of this film.  Damon knows that when he touches people he occasionally sees visions and hears voices from people who are dead.  When he shares his visions with the living they tell him that he has truly contacted a dead person.  This is dangerous territory for Damon who is confused and upset by his extraordinary power to connect with the dead.  He refuses to use his gift, which he calls a curse.  Instead he escapes to London where he meets the journalist and the boy.  No surprises here.  From the beginning we knew that the stories of the journalist, young boy, and Damon would come together if we were going to be able to make sense of the story and arrive at a satisfying conclusion for the movie.<br /><br />This film has generated mixed reviews on Amazon.  Some viewers love it; others hate it.  I must say that I thought Clint Eastwood did a good job on a most difficult subject.  Even though the film was slow paced, that is, after the opening tsunami sequence, it kept my attention throughout.  The film makes clear, at least to me, that a spirit world does exist and a few people are able to connect with it.  Some people will find this dramatization of the reality of the \\"hereafter\\" convincing.  Others will point out that it is simply a movie and has no truth value.  The former are likely to be entertained by Hereafter, the latter, bored and disappointed.  Eastwood might well be in a third group who are unsure about what happens after death and who are willing to entertain a variety of points of view on the subject.  This third group is unlikely to be convinced that a spirit world is real, but they may well be entertained by Eastwood's presentation.  Recommended with reservations.his third group is unlikely to be convinced that a spirit world is real, but they may well be entertained by Eastwood's presentation.  Recommended with reservations.

0547482655|4.0|This is a very sturdy and cute pop-up of The Little Prince. I barely have enough French to plow through it, but the illustrations and pop-ups make it worth the effort. Wonderful to share with a young reader.
1401307450|3.0|But I just shook my head so many times as I read this that I almost got whiplash.  He tries to be everything, in terms of writing style, at once.  I really wonder how much is his words and then how much is the person who helped him.  There are real interesting tales that he wove throughout the book filled with sex and drug use.  I am in recovery and can appreciate some of the tales but at times it just gets repetitive and self indulgent on his part.  If you see the book for $5 I recommend picking it up if you like rock'n'roll bios.  Good but far from great
0375831002|5.0|although this is rated for young adults ,I found this book(as a senior citizen) a very moving story. Every emotion was touched, fear, anger, hope and the innocence of youth.The mature theme of adults trying to survive yet not losing compassion for others. The young people are fearless and hopeful ,but  inspite of it all are still children growing up with different rules of survival. read it if you dare, you will never forget it and learn to complain less.    This book was part of my local book club, but I knew that I wanted this in my own library to share with others and bought  a copy from Amazon as I do with all my must have books.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Downloaded but did not find many more features than the pre-installed calendar, or maybe I don't require more than that. It  did sync with my corporate outlook calendar, but drained my battery pretty quickly.  Droid Pro.
B00000EI45|4.0|Even though he is the classic voice of Iron Maiden, out on his own, the music and tone of this album is all Bruce. I was really expecting this to sound just like Iron Maiden with Janick Gers a soon to be member of the band being in the fold, but as it turns out, the music takes a different direction and is actually quite good.<br /><br />There are some decent cuts on here and I found I liked all of them except I don't think he needed to add in All The Young Dudes. That to me seemed filler material. In a way, it kind of disrupted the flow of an otherwise decent solo effort. I mean, the song is fine, it's just that Bruce didn't need to do it.<br /><br />In the tough world of rock and roll, I doubt if this music would ever make it to the top on its own, but for my personal enjoyment, I thought it was a fine effort. Well done and highly recommended, despite the slip up with Mott the Hoople.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I added several events to the calendar and after an hour or so they no longer appeared on the calendar.
B000002J0H|4.0|I burned this to CD the other day after having not listened to it in two decades. It is in-your-face brutal thrash. Lots of great thrash riffing, down-tuning, plenty of fluid million-notes-a-second guitar leads sprinkled throughout (sparingly), and the great voice of Chuck Billy. Though I couldn't understand many of the words, the lyrics seemed to be about dark subject matter. Don't really care. They are just articulated vocal noises anyway.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty decent sound experience. My only problems with it are that the vocal melodies seemed a bit interchangeable from song to song. They sounded a bit samey from the beginning to end as if Mr. Billy were singing the same melody to completely different songs. That was really a minor quibble as the music varied enough from brutally intense to quiet interludes which kept it interesting. My other problem is that there was no particular outstanding cut or riff that I could pick out of it. There was not a single track I could say was my favorite. It is more of an overall experience, rather than a particular song. As it is, all of the tracks run together anyway except the final instrumental, Last Call, with which there is a slight break before it kicks in.<br /><br />These guys have been around awhile and with what they do, I can see why. Recommended for thrash fans.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I build computers regularly (search for pdxmicro on facebook), and I can tell you from experience that Arctic Silver 5 is THE BEST in thermal compound. I couldn't imagine using anything else and will continue to use it in all of my future builds. In many cases, AS5 has dropped CPU temps by over 5 deg C - and even some at 10 deg C. I highly recommend reading the proper way to use AS5 from Arctic Silver's website. Even a lot of \\"computer tech's\\" don't know how to use it properly. An example: Core i-7 990X 6-Core + HT Technology (12 cores total), my temps at idle = 20 deg C. Temps at full load = 40-50 deg C. This is air cooling by the way :)

1400032717|5.0|With more than 1600 reviews, this book likely doesn't need more... but I feel compelled to add to its praise! This book is truly amazing, from the storyline to the voice and writing style to the way it gives you a window into what it would be like to be autistic. Simultaneously charming, witty, bittersweet and engaging, this book just keeps delivering... and the end will make you want to jump up and shout 'yeah'!
B000007492|4.0|This song is becoming a near and dear favorite to me these days, and what's really nice that this British pop/prog rock unit's music is intelligent enough not to make you feel stupid, and relatable for anyone in any situation.  Great melodic sensibilities, beyond creative musical passages, and distinct vocals, these guys have a style that changes with little effort and is always true to their particular sound.

B002S0OBMS|5.0|I'm a big ALW fan and have loved POTO since first hearing it. I am disappointed to see so many reviews totally trash LND, ALW, and the musical (which most have not seen). Is it different? Yes and no. I see sparks of many of ALW's other works and enjoy that. Yes, I too was initially  put off by the changes in Raoul and the Giry's, but 'that was then, this is now' as it's 10 years later and life happens.      After watching the lead singer in the new PBS showing of Les Miz, and hearing some of the tracks on Comcast's music station, I was drawn to LND. After listening thur twice, I could easily visualize the plot. I love both lead voices, and the score. Had I listened to all the nay-sayers, I would have missed this wonderful music.     Think for yourself and don't be dissuaded by those who I suspect live to trash ALW. I've not seen any UTube snippets, but now will go look. Would see the play if it comes to Seattle. ALW, you rock!

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|While one can't help but be surprised--even now--that Clint Eastwood had anything to do with this particular film (Harry Callahan is most definitely a thing of the past), he does an excellent job teaming up with Peter Morgan for this pleasant oddity which manages to transform Bahhhstan actor Matt Damon [[ASIN:6305216088 Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)]] [[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed (Widescreen Edition)]] into a reclusive psychic (a real one) and a lover of Charles Dickens.<br /><br />Damon's character George Lonegan, a man who works on the docks of a shipping yard while possessing the ability to contact the dead, is a strange guy who no longer wants anything to do with the John Edwards' or Uri Gellers' of the world.  Once a professional psychic making tons of money, he now wants only to live a quiet life apart from the hereafter and in the now. The problem is that every time he touches someone, their past is revealed in a kind of watery cinematography that Eastwood clearly favors over the stereotypical \\"flashback telepathic vision\\" scenario.<br /><br />His brother Billy (Jay Mohr) is a man who rightly or wrongly feels differently and wants George to return to the I See Dead People Business.  Not only, he reasons, might this garner some cash--his brother is the real deal and in one of the most affecting scenes in the film, Lonegan gives a private reading to his a co-worker of his brothers' coming directly from his deceased wife.<br /><br />Cecile De France plays Marie LeLay, a famous French newscaster who is happy, famous, beautiful and all until she has a sudden vision of a tsunami while on vacation with her agent.  What exactly she sees may be open to the interpretation of the viewer: her own death?  The apocalypse?<br /><br />Because of two chance encouters--what makes this film touching and believable is that it adds an all too human dimension to the otherworldly subject by portraying quite worldly concerns, perhaps the most memorable of which concerns two small London boys with a heroin addicted mother--LeLay and Lonegan are brought together.  What happens at the end is certainly left open to the viewer's interpretation, though something big is definitely about to occur both in the metaphysical and worldly sense for the two protagonists.<br /><br />This is a film which stands on it's own merits stylistically but also delivers a message that needs to be sent: that those who quest for the afterlife, for the ultimate, are not to be laughed or sneered at.  Have we come so far that we can no longer believe in anything but the material world?  Why, then, do we watch people running around on television with glow lights and EVP monitors?  A brilliant movie and a must see.with a heroin addicted mother--LeLay and Lonegan are brought together.

B000QRIGLC|1.0|Notwithstanding the authors service to our country his infusion of right wing reactionary diatribes against \\"liberals\\" and others who might question US policy does a disservice to his story.

0439796636|5.0|I read this novel (not in play format as others have noted) in response to the excitement about the Broadway production that I will soon see.  Yes, it is for young adults, but the story line is wonderful and adults can also enjoy the relationship shared between a young boy and the beautiful horse he raises.  It is the core values shared by all characters that binds this tale and gives insight to the choices they make. Told in the first person of the horse, it reminds me a bit of The Art of Racing In the Rain (a book narrated by an aging yellow Lab).  I found the relationship between the horses Joey and Topthorn deeply moving, as well as the scene where the German and Welsh soldiers pause in their battle to  flip a coin.  The history of the war and the roles horses once played in battle, the struggles faced by the characters during economic and personal hardship and the values shown by the characters help to make this a classic read for the young and old.  My issue with other reviewers - please judge the work by its content, not by the format you received.  I wish readers would not give negative ratings simply because they purchased a play version by mistake or because it didn't download correctly.  I hope those readers can find a copy at their local library, sit back for a few hours and learn about Joey and Albert.
B004XS97QS|5.0|O.K., I'm more hooked on Doctor Who now than I was when I was much younger, and after season 5 so is my whole family. I really enjoy all the episodes with River Song in them and this one was mind blowing. Expecting a really good season 6 now.    Also, went back to watch Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead(it's in Season 4, first time the doctor meets her) and sure enough what River Song says there is even more touching now. Listen to all of her dialog, even at one point where she does some narrating... enjoy!    (All seasons referenced above are from the new series, not the original seasons)
B004GHYCKW|4.0|...to a brief review of what has turned out to be my favorite album of the year thus far. Still singing in her higher register ala' \\"White Chalk\\" but in a more lighthearted mood, Polly Jean has fashioned something of a history lesson/love letter/critique of her beloved 'Eeen-gu-laaa-haaand'and done so with some of the catchiest, tightest and folkiest tunes of her career. Collaborating again with John Parish, these short songs are sprinkled with dashes of light electronica and exotic percussion and seem to speed by in the blink of an eye. The flamenco laced \\"The Words That Maketh Murder\\" is my current fave and bears repeated listening. Overall, this is a delightfully caustic and melodic album that will please new and longtime fans alike.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|This may well be one of the best hard rock albums to come out of 2010, and to my ears the best thing Slash has put out since his Guns and Roses years.  The album features a veritable who's who of modern rock vocalists including Ian Astbury (The Cult), Ozzy Osborne, Fergie (Black Eyed Peas), Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge), Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave), Andrew Stockdale (Wolfmother), Adam Levine (Maroon 5), Lemmy (Motorhead), Kid Rock, and Iggy Pop.  Many guest instrumentalists are also along for the ride with Slash's guitar leading the way.  The songwriting on this album is top notch and I could imagine just about any track on it blowing up the radio.  Along with the vocal cuts, the instrumental \\"Watch This Dave\\" featuring Dave Grohl and Duff McKagen is another killer track.  The album has a lot of variety with really hard rockers to ballads with a lot in between.  This album seems to be getting mixed reviews from Slash fans, but I am not sure that I get why.  For me there is not a weak track on this one and I am enjoying the hell out of it.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|The only keeping me from absolutely loving this app is the inability to customize the color of the calendar. Most important adjusting the color display of the widget.

Great start, dev. Thanks also to Amazon appstore for the freebie.

B004NSULHM|3.0|Briefly: I concur with many of the reviewers here who have expressed disappointment that this offering is so abbreviated. None of us are getting any younger, including Yorke and the others. How long will we have to wait before we get a full-length album?    I will say, though, that although brief, this CD contains two of the best songs Radiohead has ever recorded: Little by Little and Lotus Flower. These are really, really excellent.    I did not care for In Rainbows when I first listened to it. But over time, I really began to appreciate it and now regard it as one of Radiohead's finest collections. I'm doubtful that I will ever form the same opinion of King of Limbs. Still, we all have to admit that even at its weakest, it's still better than the vast majority of music being put out there today.
1449382673|2.0|I bought this book because I liked the 'Head First Java' - A mistake. I guess not all 'Head First' books are created equal. This book is not just a tutorial, but is an introductory tutorial. There are two main problems with this book: 1. Same elementary concept gets repeated over and over and over again. 2. Trying to cover way too many topics, i.e. Web programming. This perhaps is good for someone who has little programming experience who wants to have an overview what Python can do, but is absolutely inadequate (and frustrating) for experienced programmers who want to actually learn something useful Python knowledge.
B003UESJH4|4.0|This is a well made film with high production values and a literate script. It is worth seeing, although for me,  it was not a story about the friendship between a prince and a pauper or the courage that it takes to overcome a disability, as other reviewers have suggested. To me, this film dramatizes the conflict between the authority to do something and the ability to do it.<br /><br />We have a king whose job it is to give speeches, but who is not suited to the task, due to a speech impediment. We have a speech therapist who has no credentials and no training, but who is talented and motivated to help others overcome.<br /><br />The film acknowledges that the English monarch has been reduced to the role of an actor. He is given a speech written by others, and his task is to deliver it effectively. In a perfect world, the best man would be chosen for each job. But in this world, a man who might have been a fine commander-in-chief or even an excellent writer of speeches to be delivered by others is cast in the role of public announcer, even if that role is not right for him. When he seeks help in overcoming his disability, the one man who can help him is missing the credentials that would give him the authority to do so.<br /><br />In the end, the king stands by the therapist who has no authority, while he uses his own authority to deliver a speech written for him by others. Even with the best help and with the greatest of effort, he reads the speech haltingly, word by word with great pauses in between. But since he is the king, his effort is well received and he is applauded.<br /><br />The performances are excellent and there are many touching scenes. In one, the King and his family watch footage of Hitler giving a speech. \\"What is he saying?\\" The King replies: \\"I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well.\\"<br /><br />Both Hitler and Churchill were excellent orators who wrote their own speeches. Churchill reassures the King that he, too, had to overcome a speech impediment; but there is no comparison.<br /><br />One caveat: the therapist makes a sweeping generalization at one point that no child was born with a stammer and that stuttering must result from a traumatic event. The royal parents are absolved of any responsibility in this matter, and the blame is shifted to a cruel nanny. However, the implications of this claim could be devastating for families of children with speech difficulties. For a more even handed treatment of family dynamics surrounding a speech impediment, I suggest watching [[ASIN:0783231210 Paulie]]omparison.

B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Verismo is an Italian operatic movement, but we haven't had a fresh leading tenor from Italy in decades, so who is to sing this music? Russians, Americans, Germans? The least likely would appear to be a German tenor like the acclaimed Jonas Kaufmann. Vocal aficionados used to consider the German style of opera singing a separate kettle of fish from the Italian style, and it was all but unknown for the two camps to cross, although an outsider to both like Jon Vickers successfully negotiated the chasm. Vickers is the closest comparison I can make for Kaufmann's approach to these passionate, at times violent arias, which represent probably the most visceral music ever written. (I can hear Vickers' keening vowels in Kaufmann's agonized cry of \\"Ridi, pagliaccio.\\")<br /><br />Like Vickers, Kaufmann's victory is one of power over finesse. Neither can be considered to have an Italianate voice,  which is supple and seductive. Neither has an ounce of smiling charm--Kaufmann's Turiddu is already doomed as he raises his glass in \\"Viva il vino.\\" But through sheer courage he wrenches himself into frenzied emotional states that can be hair-raising. In addition, Kaufmann has personal force; you recognize a specific personality throwing itself into the fray. Vickers was gripping in his Verdi roles, even though his Radames sounded \\"all wrong,\\" and his Otello was like a suicidal Christ -- there was little romance before the hero's suffering engulfed him.<br /><br />When he made his first album of arias, I prayed that Kaufmann would be the Wagner tenor the opera world so desperately needed; unless Domingo lived forever, it seemed as if we would never hear a first-class Parsifal, Lohengrin, or Siegmund for another decade. Yet I foresaw that for classical record labels the real money was in Puccini and Verdi. Kaufmann quickly went on to sing a rather beefy but charismatic Pinkerton to Gheorgiu's Butterfly. Happily, he didn't ignore the German repertoire, and now he has grown into Lohengrin and Siegmund as well as Cavaradossi. So the two worlds are merging, and out of gratitude for such a sterling singer, one gifted with excellent intonation and musical instinct, we might as well forget the division between Verdi and Wagner.  The voice has grown darker very rapidly, and yet there is still enough ping at the top -- what the Italians call squillo -- to bring a thrill. I don't think Kaufmann will return to the Mozart and Schubert roles of his youth (he will turn 42 this summer), and with Otello in front of him, Alfredo is getting farther behind.<br /><br />This album was held up for a disgracefully long time since its initial release in Europe, and perhaps its release  in the U.S. has been timed with Kaufmann's appearance in 'Die Walkure' at the Met.  His Siegmund was a clamorous triumph, but I notice very little stir here at Amazon. Are record buyers stuck back in the age of Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras in their prime? If so, they are missing a tenor who is worthy to stand beside them.

B0000248VB|1.0|If you're a fan of Henry Mancini's music as you've heard it all your life, this isn't the CD for you. This bland collection of re-worked pablum was assembled after he died, and perhaps its only saving grace is the fact that Mancini wasn't alive to hear it. The reviewer who referred to this album's \\"Hammond organ\\" sound was spot on... most of the tracks have the same feel that you'd get from hearing them performed as part of a medley on the Lawrence Welk Show; you eventually recognize the tune, but there's no way you'd confuse it with the original.     In particular, the two tracks I bought this for (The Pink Panther Theme & Windmills of Your Mind) sound too plinky and cheesy to even listen to. I got this disc REALLY cheap, and I'm still completely disappointed. There's plenty of \\"Best of Henry Mancini\\" albums out there... choose a different one.

B0041KKYBA|4.0|This is my first movie review in Amazon; this kind of horror movie should be rated XXX since what was done to us \\"peasants\\" is obscene.    How could we let the same clowns running our lives since the Reagan years' of deregulation?  Both parties are guilty as hell.  In this movie/documentary, I was surprised that Barney Frank came out like a decent fellow which is a travesty.  He was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee after all.  The ivy league economists/consultants were also to blame.  Wall Street is Wall Street; self-regulation never worked.  Greed is always mightier than risk, especially if one is risking with our moneys.    It was also a crime that AIG (our moneys again) had to pay GS 100 cents on a dollar for  the credit default swap, since AIG was broke.      The drugs and broads were not necessary; it's human nature since pre-biblical time.    Too big to fail means too big to save.  The next bubble will put us to financial slavery, if we are not there already.    It's a must watch.  BTW, Spitzer came out OK in this version.  I can see why he was prosecuted while none of the bankers got their bonus clawbacked - payback is a bit**.  It showed who is running our country - Wall Street and the elite school economists.
B003EV6DBW|4.0|Action, adventure, drama and a little side humor on the side wrapped up into a fun season with Doctor Who. I love Dr Sung always saying spoilers and keeping quiet about the future possibilities. Although there are hints throughout the season that a 6th season is in progress you just don't know it till the end. And no cliff hangers to keep us waiting like previous seasons. I can hardly wait. My biggest disappointment is the short seasons. In my book a season is 22 episodes. Today at most we get 12 to 14. So these season set are getting pretty expensive. But Love the show so I either buy it or leave it. I choose to buy.

0061726826|4.0|Contrary to many of the young adult novels released lately, Oliver has created an utterly realistic protagonist. Lena is seventeen years old and plain, but beautiful in the eyes of her love, and terrified of the emotions reeling inside of her. It would be unrealistic to make our narrator embrace the emotions of love, as she has been raised in a world bereft of strong emotion. We, as readers, join Lena in her transformation from mindless acceptance of childhood, to questioning adulthood. We witness Lena come to terms with her affection for her first love, as well as her love for her best friend. Oliver creates a dystopian world that is frightening with its realism, and she weaves together a story that is at times heartbreaking, and at others gripping. A very fun read.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Pretty good. still has a little room to grow. icons / buttons on widget look childish. app should directly handle reminders instead of letting stock calendar do it. at least provide option to go to this app from reminder if nothing else. despite these small items, app is very polished and professional. look forward to more updates.<br /><br />Edit: 5-24-2012.  All of the issues I mentioned above have been addressed for a while, so I changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars.  This has replaced my stock calendar for quite a long time now.  The available widgets and options have improved dramatically, and so have themes and other options.  Although the snooze options are not as good as the standalone app Calendar Snooze, your available options are as good as (if not better) than the stock calendar reminders.  So I would not consider that a complaint - just a feature request.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|The concept for \\"The Maze Runner\\" is initially fascinating.  Amnesiac boys are trapped in a dangerous labyrinth, forming for themselves a structured militant society akin to \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"  Our protagonist is fearless in his quest for escape and is shaken by his psychic bond with the doomsaying female who arrives last. The concept is brilliant, as is the world crafted by Dashner. The monsters in the maze, the camera bugs, the writing on the walls, all lead to a fascinating conclusion where the reader is eager to meet the protagonist's spectators.<br /><br />It is ultimately the end that loses my interest.  Dashner takes a creative, if unethical, experiment and throws it into a confusing post-apocalyptic world with too many twists and turns.  Any satisfaction brought on by the protagonist's escape is lost at the very end, as he is thrown into another kind of maze altogether.
B004L49K20|5.0|I was a 12-year-old pre-teen on a cold Saturday night in 1981 when I first saw five very strangely dressed guys, with even stranger haircuts. A few minutes later one of these guys - the one using a hang rope as a neck tie - jumped down a thousand-mile-high platform into planet Earth. My percepcion of music would never be the same again.<br /><br />And so I was the kind of fan that had to wait until RIO came out.<br /><br />If you are one of those early albums fans, \\"All You Need Is Now\\" is the record for you.<br /><br />Simon's voice is clear: not once did he do that thing the New York Times referrs to as \\"whining\\";<br />Roger is in that \\"design to make us happy\\" kind of beat,<br />Nick is wonderful, in a truly highlight moment.<br />John is surely in his best work ever.<br />I also thank Dom for his cooperation, in co-composing the songs,  for giving them back that edgy guitar I missed so much during the \\"Andy-absence years\\".<br /><br />Not one of the songs changes the excellence of this album. We all \\"danced in the mood we did when we were younger\\"; who didn´t get lost for trusting in our cars GPS's system?  Who never thought to conquer someone and then realised to be the prey instead? Who didn´t dream of a girl who thought she could do better? Who never told a girl \\"too bad you're so beautiful but so complicated?\\"<br /><br />After getting lost dreaming about revolutions on New Moon On Monday, an underground world in the Union of the Snake, or after seeking for an Electric Barbarella to be satisfied, this is finally an album that speaks to the average men. Thank you Mark Ronson. Stay with us a little longer.<br /><br />This record brings me back to the dancing 80's, and is definitely a top five (my favourites, the first and second, the Wedding Album, Astronaut and this one). Maybe, this is a top three, side by side with the debut album and Rio.<br /><br />As for the Vinyl issue, Amazon USA regretfully doesn't sell the version that includes \\"Lost Weekend\\", an extra song included in the european version, nor the remix for \\"All You Need Is Now\\", included only in the UK version.<br /><br />I didn´t care much for the cover too, and seeing it in a larger version is not a pleaseant sight. Plus, a two disc set might as well have been released in a double feature cover. This wansn't.<br /><br />Still, it´s the music that matters, and this release features the Wild Boys in their best shape!<br /><br />Congratulations, and more importantly, thank you!

By the way, the Features were great!

B004TTMYQG|4.0|This app is much nicer than the default Android calendar (pinch zoom, *TONS* of customizations, etc). I do have two problems with it, however, which led me to only give it 4 stars (I would give it 4.5, but I can't).    The first is I haven't been able to sync events with special characters (umlauts, for example). Calendars with umlauts work, but events that have umlauts in them do not sync over. I'm not sure for what reason, they just don't work. Yes I'm being picky, but Google Calendar does do that.    The second problem I have is that it utterly spams your \\"Add Widgets\\" dialog with 12 individual widgets (2x1, 2x2, ... 4x3, 4x4). I am going to assume this is a side effect of how Android handles its widgets, but it's quite the bother and makes my phone feel cluttered.    Other than those two, very random and extremely specific problems, I very much enjoy this app, and if they fix the umlauts thing soon, I'll be keeping this as my default.
1594488916|4.0|I can see where this might be a long read for those who don't love - or rather, worship - books. But if you get high from the smell of the rare bookshop, you'll quickly get caught up in this absolutely true story of a book lover who took things too far - putting it mildly. John Gilkey's story is one of illness as much as a of love for books as Gilkey was obviously fixated, in a most unusual way, on acquiring a rare book collection. The whole story of what went into his criminal enterprise and the sleuthing that brought him to justice is fascinating. So many other reviewers have laid it all out so well, I'll just add that there is a little, tiny portion of me that could relate to Gilkey and his obsession. Some of us have the power to control our urges while others - like John Charles Gilkey...uh...not so much. It's an over-the-top love taken many steps too far, but an engaging read for those who understand the love of books.
B00005K3NR|5.0|My older brother and sister went to see this as teenagers. Thinking back on it I could tell they really liked it. When I saw it on TV sometime when I was in my 20's, probably, I liked it. The ending/false ending was quite scary. A few years ago I caught the whole thing on television, from beginning to end pretty much, I think, and all I can say is, wow, this has to be one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />Saying that is going to encourage endless copy movies that having lots of blood as their only similarity to this film. . . oh the danger. I'm not sure the crazy mother was done very realistically in the film. . . It would have been more realistic if Carrie's mother were played, not as a kind of religious zealot, but instead perhaps as a feminist zealot of sort? It might make a more realistic portrayal of a mother of the times? Her behavior might not be all that different? There was perhaps room in the film to contrast these two views, religion and science, and show that both oppressed Carrie. I didn't really noticed such a comparison in the film. Even remembering the scene where fellow students throw tampons at Carrie, I didn't notice this being done.<br /><br />There are, or were, people who were religious and like Carries religious mother, no doubt. I knew a father like this. One of my close friends in school was forbidden from reading most books and from listening to music, even most country music, by a religious father. Can't play cards? That's for sissy fathers. You'd be surprised what you could get away with tho. His dad was a single father and worked a lot. He hid books under his bed, we played Dungeons and Dragons on occasion, and frankly, he smoked a bit of dope and listened to a lot more rock music. My friend had good taste, anyway, better than mine. His favorite band was Genesis. Mine was Judas Priest or Black Sabbath. When Rush turned disco, or whatever it was they were playing, my friend was as happy as could be. He also read a lot. A lot. A book a day every day on average. He ended up going to MIT.<br /><br />Although the portrayal of Carries mother is debatable (and perhaps the way she is portrayed is the way this religious mother would appear to the mind of an adolescent) there is something real about the rest of the characters in the film. The bad guys aren't bad, just to have bad guys in the movie. Their actions kind of make sense. The female gym teacher, possibly a lesbian, acts to stop students from abusing Carrie. For her that means punishing the other students. They respond. Perhaps this shows the helpless nature of those subject to bullying. Even efforts to stop it only make it worse. Bullies perhaps count on this fear. Nowadays bullies perhaps depend on adults themselves to back up their authority. The only solution or relief is getting permanently away from the bully, unless you're Carrie.a day every day on average.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|this application is awesome and functions great. supports multiple calendars. Great job!   suggestion: change icon, looks cheesy and improve look of widgets.  Everything else is perfect! Thank you. Must buy app!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Very good calendar application with easy user-interface. Makes it convenient to view multiple calendars. It is also easy on the eyes.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This was not the best of movies, was not described to me<br />as it really was.<br /><br />Not a good review for Natalie Portman. She does not fit for<br />a role like this.. Not recommended . Will see other better<br />movies with her in it......
B004NSULHM|5.0|I just can't stop listening to this album. Since I bought it, I've been listening to the whole album at least twice a day everyday. It reminds me Yorke's The Eraser, which is equally marvelous!
B002VECM6S|2.0|I gave this movie two stars only because it is supposedly based on a true story, so the director had some restraints.    I watched it in two sessions.  It started out as an intriguing story, and I was curious how Michael would end up.  In the middle it became more and more predictable that he would become a football star thanks totally to the coaching of Sandra Bullock and his annoying adopted kindergartner brother.  Altho a huge man, he had shown no inclination to or interest in football.  I turned it off.    Two days later, I thought, no, there will be a surprise twist coming and it is supposed to be a great movie, so I hit Start again.    Ugh! The plot became more and more predictably stupid as it went.  The one possible redeeming moment was when Sandra Bullock asked, \\"Michael, do you even WANT to play football?\\"  I was holding my breath, hoping against hope that he would say \\"No, not really\\" and move on to his own life goals.  But no, he didn't even answer, simply said \\"Well, I'm pretty good at it\\".  And it was straight down the trite hollywood sewer after that.
1401307450|1.0|This book was a complete waste of my money and time.  It multiple places in the book it talks about him having sex with underage girls.  One girl listed in this book was 14.  Anthony Kiedis is a pedophile and should be in prison.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|this calendar is so much better than the Droid one.   I can see much more detail at a glance.   I like the agenda view.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Brought back many memories of games of this nature on my Mac!  As with most people, I found that the game was way too short,  and maybe a tad bit easy. Maybe more than a tad bit?
B000TU16GS|5.0|this is one of the best books i have ever read. this is a book about a 14 or 15 year old boy. his uncle had just died and he wants to find out how. somebody told him how his uncle died but he dose not belive that. he is determened to find out how and he will not stop untill he dose.
0375842209|3.0|Don't feel badly if you don't like this book. It's dreary. Its history is already written. You know where it's going. It's beautifully written and artfully as well - but at the end of the book you arrive exactly where you thought you were going to - and I would have preferred something more uplifting along the way before I got to that ending. For some, the story is enough. This is where a matter of taste comes in.   I have read many books written about  this period of time but for me, this particular story was an unnecessary return visit to despair and the quiet horror of the reality of the times. I would never recommend it for a child even though the ugliness is certainly presented conservatively.
0307712508|5.0|The two narrators fairly cleanly blend, and the principal narrator does well to evoke the reporter's remoteness and Skloot's young emotions as her characters involve her in their lives. As I listened to this I wondered if someone else might be interested in only half of the book, the HeLa historicity, rather than the whole. For me, I found the whole thing compelling (in a stay-up-all-night-reading kind of way).  I did not mind the double-spiral entwining of the medical history of the cells, the social history of the family as it relates to the cells and, arising from that, issues of privacy and ethics and how we want to define ourselves as a people. It put me in mind to recall the last two of the \\"three paragons\\" of our great conservative Barry Goldwater: 'do not debase the dignity of others' and 'maximize freedom consistent with necessary safety and order.' He emphasized freedom.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've only used this calendar program for a day but I see no reason to ever go back to the stock android calendar program. The business calendar has a better week and month view and the ability to create multiple reminders for a single event, which I didn't realize I needed until it was possible. Add on the pinch to zoom in the views and you've really got something special.
B004FOA84A|1.0|this game i downloaded and it will not play on my atrix. hopefully thos is just a glitch and they will fix this i really would love to play
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I almost hate everything about this product. It is awkward to hold, and the sharpeners don't sharpen very well. It's more of a blade maintenance tool than a true blade sharpener. I gave it two stars for the fact that it is compact and portable, but they could have made a much better product.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Allows me to switch events from one calendar to another! Great visual displays of information. Love it! Samsung Fascinate Galaxy S.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|Just received this cd/dvd, played it this morning, fantastic. Mariah has a very beautiful voice. The songs were very enjoyable to listen to. The sound qaulity of the cd is very nice and clear. The dvd videos are icing on the cake and somewhat sexy. Mariah is an excellent entertainer, and has a very special presence. It's fun to watch and listen to her perform. I would recommend this dual cd/dvd package, it will bring you a lot of listening and viewing pleasure.
B000J2DAYM|5.0|I don't want to give anything away about this movie, it is one of those movies where the less you know, the more fun the ride is. The writing is brilliant, the characters are interesting and compelling. The style is reminiscent of the best film noire has to offer, while having a fresh, edgy style. Before reading any other reviews that give away too much and ruin it, just watch this movie and enjoy. It is a must-see and I am glad to have it in my collection.
B004DK5CW4|1.0|I was very interested in race horses and I ordered and prepaid for this DVD \\"Secretariat\\" some 4 months back.  I thought I was able to give my view on this particular disc but it never came.  I reported the non-delivery and the only answer I got was a refund of my postage.  I reminded and re-reminded Amazon's staff that I still wanted this disc but got zero reply.    How do Amazon expect me to review this disc? [[ASIN:B004DK5CW4 Secretariat]]
B004G6009U|5.0|I have two little girls, of course they love the movie. I got the Blu Ray combo pack only the Blu Ray has the extras that DVD does not have.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I don't think I've loved a show this much before. I never get tired of rewatching Community; I've seen every episode at least 5-6 times. Abed is a gem & unceasingly hilarious. I showed 'Modern Warfare' to all my friends (reviews of \\"badass\\" across the board) and 'Debate 101' is probably my favorite. Only one or two episodes out of the entire season seemed a bit 'flat' and not especially funny to me.    I highly recommend buying the DVD!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun, challenging but not so long you get bored with it. I would love to see a sequel or three!

I can eat as much white meat chicken, lean hamburger patties and nonfat greek yogurt as I want.  The Oat Bran is yummy.  Not hungry at all.  Going to keep at it until I am 115, which should be 3 weeks max.  Great book, great recipes!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Can't believe how convenient this app is. I have it on all my computers and phone so I can get to and add information from anywhere. Just download it- you won't be sorry!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I was on the search for a better calendar widget, with an easy agenda view of upcoming events. A couple were decent, but the widgets added here are versatile, clear, and just what I needed. Add to that a well designed interface in the app, quick switching between calendars if desired, and just works.
B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled is a great movie that is fun for the whole family. The blu ray disc looks stunning and the dolby surround sound audio is a great compliment to it. I had a blast watching this with my family. The horse was especially funny to me. If you are a fan of Disney movies in general, you will like this one too.     The blu ray/dvd combo pack is great because I can keep my blu ray at home with my home theater and take the dvd on trips so that my daughter stays busy.    I got this for only 20 bucks on Amazon.com and it was worth every penny. Thats much cheaper than most stores carry the combo pack for.    Highly reccomended movie and a highly recommended seller in Amazon!
B000R9J3X4|5.0|I felt like I no more and ordered my CD and was already listening to it!  I work full time and have children so I never have time (or money) to shop, so this fast and inexpensive venue is the way to shop! Seller was fast, CD was perfect.  Thanks a mill!!
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This is a fantastic calendar app. I have tried a lot of calendars, but this is the best. It's a little on the plain side as far as looks go, but the functionality is terrific.
B000HEVALC|1.0|There is not a single complete song on this CD.  All it is, is the four talking and messing around in the recording studio.  May be of interest for a huge Elvis fan that needs everything he ever did, but don't buy this for any music content.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Love this app. Actually shows what each appointmenr is, not just a line. I use it all the ime. Syncs with my google calendar too.
B001GQO50I|5.0|Years ago I had this on a bootleg CD.  When I saw that it was released to the public I went crazy.  This is one of the best Doors live recording you will find.

B002GJU54E|4.0|On the search for a geeky dude named \\"Munch\\" and in over her head as always, bail bonds woman Stephanie Plum gets into all sorts of jams when she enters the scary redneck territory known as \\"The Pines\\".  The usual sexy men in Stephanie's life make appearances as well as a Mario Bros. loving monkey, his slew of new monkey pals and, of course, Lula with her usual her zany awesomeness.  I think I missed a few Plum books along the way because I had to do a double take (make that a rewind) when Diesel, a fellow bounty hunter (who is drop dead gorgeous, wouldn't you know?), drops in and makes himself all cozy in Stephanie's bed.  Wait!  What?  How did I miss this?  And he has some superhuman powers?!  Rounding out the bunch is a guy whose farts set his *ss aflame.  Only in Plumlandia . . .<br /><br />This book was so much fun.  Even though deranged Munch desperately wants to use Stephanie as his own personal sex toy things never get too dark here.  I don't know if I could stomach a steady diet of these Plum books but I do so enjoy reading them every now and then to cleanse my brain of dreariness.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|at about the two thirds point... since i enjoyed the first book and generally love fantasy it might just be my mood. Not sure, i just became bored and even annoyed. I will pick it up again later...
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Had the opportunity to see this concert live and the CD replicates that concert...just amazing vocal work by these Irish ladies!  Great recording!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Gotta admit it - unless this app simply doesn't run on your phone you gotta love it. Well organized and effective. I love it!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Well worth the 5 bucks. Widget is excellent as is the application and I was able to eliminate more than one other application from my phone when I got this. Very customizable and does everything I need it to do. Very impressed and I highly recommend.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|I've been a fan from the beginning, all I can say is that this is one of the BESTrock and roll records I heard in a very long time. When I heard of the original lineup was getting back together, I knew that the magic was about to happen once more! I ordered the vinyl version, I was not disappointed!  Get this disc if you want to hear not only great rock n roll but great music altogether!
B002UXRGM0|4.0|I bought this on sale for $27.99 on sale from Amazon.com and it is superb in every way but it is like buying a CD with no cover notes.. Surely a 4 page glossy booklet isn't too much too ask? Even just a menu map would be great.. Other than the box/packaging I might as well have bootleg copies.. I don't read the box to find out what the aspect ratio is, or the sound system used..  With a booklet I would have given it 5 stars...  PS A lot of BBC America products have no booklets.. eg Lark Rise to Candleford and other Masterpiece Theatre sets.. which I also own. Am I the only person who misses the booklets?
0756404746|4.0|I am always on the search for a new series. This has made my list.  The Pros:  Kvothe is an engaging main character -- watching him grow up in school was reminiscent of Harry Potter, but I liked that this character wasn't as clueless as old Harry.  There is a thread throughout where you see how heroic myths grow from the hero's actions in situations where he did the things a normal, ambitious person might in his shoes. Love that. Makes a person think that heroism is achievable, which is a good and true message.  Action! Lots of it!  Relatively satisfying doomed love story and interesting female character. It's nice to see a different take on writing a woman's part in fantasy. And the whole first love thing is done so very very well.  The Cons:  Some of the characters come across just a bit too dramatically much. Kvothe's servant/companion whatever he is was just sort of annoying after a while.  Seems like there is more editing that could have been done.  Buy the book. This author has a great career in front of him.
B00079FUI6|5.0|adorei o site , recebi tudo lacrado confome o esperado e até mais rapido do que eu esperava... podem confiar o amazon é nota 10.
0553386794|2.0|Wanted to like it. Great cover nice premise. But the created world is overly complex, the writing was hard to follow (he jumps from character to character to character and not even in a way you can easily skip the characters you don't like) and a lot of unlikeable characters.<br />If you are looking for fiction which validates the view that the world is an awful place, full of awful things that happen, and good people are doomed to horrible fates, you would probably like this very much.
0756404738|5.0|An excellent follow-on to the first book in this series, The Wise Man's Fear follows Quothe as he continues in life at the University and his travels when he is forced to leave for a short period of time.  I literally could not put the book down until I was finished, and it took a little while to read because of the book's (well-deserved) length.    I can't wait for Book 3!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|is this the complete season 6? why does it say it only has 1 disc and 42 minutes? Is this an error cause I don't want to order it and then finding out it has only one disc let's hope its an error the amazon people should fix this mistake

0316069884|3.0|The early part of the book comes off as a jumbled mess. It's only in the middle that it hits its stride as different voices are given a forum as distinct chapters. Foer comes in at the end to try to wrap it all up and that part is a little more cohesive than his beginning.<br /><br />People can see/read the abuses of factory farming if they want to; it and information about it have been around long enough. So the book isn't telling us much new in that regard. What it does offer is the perspective of someone doing self-inquiry to try to cement their own philosophy and position on the matter and that's what made me buy the book. Unfortunately, his final assessment seems to be a foregone conclusion right from the beginning. There's very little in the book that entertains the pro-meat perspective, so it ended up being unsatisfying to me.<br /><br />That said, it does offer a fresh voice on the topic and if it makes people think about the topic for today, then great. For me, I finally decided to give vegetarianism a try, but even that was a foregone conclusion before I bought the book.
B003UESJF6|3.0|Megamind was one of many big-budget animated films of 2010 that stayed away from the funny animals or princess tales common to cartoons.  This one was more of a spoof of the superman saga as embodied in the Smallville TV series.  Instead of just one hereo fleeing a doomed planet to come to Earth, we have his counterpart, Megamind, who just happens to crash land inside a prison compound.  So his story is very different from the hero.  And of course there is his jealousy, need for approval, and his henchmen, which includes a fish.  All in all, a very Will Ferrell movie, probably Ferrell's last attempt at an animated film.  The movie is not bad, but parts of it remind me of The Incredibles, especially the villian that Megamind creates for himself bears a canny resemblance to Buddy Pine.  Overall, an OK watch.
B004H83IG4|3.0|As this was a major motion picture release, with considerable star power, I'm surprised there are so few reviews written here. Be that as it may this is a good show. It's an interesting story, based on an unsolved case, and the film makers are pointing fingers.    Here's the scoop. Ryan Gosling plays the stoner son of a prominent New York family who owns a lot of sleazy property in mid-town Manhattan. He meets a girl (Dunst) who is \\"not one of them\\" and they marry. He's not into the family business but is drawn back in and does low level collecting of money from their various nefarious property owners. She wants a kid. He doesn't. He's unbalanced due to witnessing the suicide of his mom as a child. Next thing you know, Dunst is Missing (dead) and he does his best to disappear.    This is a good movie. Not great. But it has so much going for it it reads well. First off are the performances. With Gosling, Dunst and Langella as the main three characters, the acting is great. Kristen Wiig is good but her role is very small. Phillip Baker Hall does his usual great character part. All the secondary characters hold their own as well. As the movie spans the years from 1971 to (I believe) 2008, great attention is payed to sets, wardrobe, hair styles, music, etc. It's a very interesting story as the producers/writer/director are saying how things went down even though the case has never formally been solved.    Gosling's character is not right in the head. You get hints of this throughout the movie, but in one scene, where he goes over the edge is truly unnerving. Dunst plays a Vermont girl who likes her new life but realizes things are going south. Seeing her as an innocent who takes up smoking and cocaine is interesting. Langella plays the blue-blood snob to the hilt.    As I mentioned, This has a lot going for it. It might not be the best movie in circulation, but it's well worth the time I spent on it.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite movies and I like it too!  It was a great price on Amazon.
B003UESJHO|4.0|Very well done movie with great performances by Christian Bale, Melissa Leo and Mark Walhberg.  Amy Adams does a good job playing a very different character than her usual roles.  Based on a true story....had to be true because no one could make up the family dynamics in this complicated group of people.
0060254920|5.0|I bought this book to read to my daughter because this is one of my favorite childhood books.  I wanted an older copy because the older copies are more durable and higher quality than most new books.  Amazon also has great prices.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I really love this soundtrack.  Every song is interesting and worth listening to again and again, which is pretty unusual for recent soundtracks.  I knew after seeing the movie that I had to get the soundtrack, and it dos not disappoint.  The music is beautifully rendered, emotionally moving, and positive.  Though I really like all the songs, my favorite is Forbidden Friendship, which I can listen to forever and never tire of it.  For those of you who have seen the movie, this is the song that plays during the scene between Hiccup and Toothless in the clearing (with the fish sharing, drawing in the dirt, and their first \\"friendly\\" touch).  I also agree with the reviewer who said you will get things done to this music (I say this as a college student - it is excellent study music).

B004TTMYQG|5.0|When I looked at the details and it specified that it is not optimized for Android 3.0, I was very skeptical but I like to test things on my Xoom anyway.  It actually looks and works beautifully and kind of shocked me at how smoothly it flowed and how quickly I figured out the unique but excellent navigation.  Definitely an app to watch, and I can't wait tto see it when it IS optimized for Honeycomb.
0743277708|5.0|*****SPOILER*****<br /><br />I'm going to get to the meat and potatoes of discussing this book in a moment, but I want to share with you the circumstances under which I first read Watership Down. I didn't read it as a child and that's too bad for me. Three years ago, after a particularly nasty ice storm, I slipped in a parking lot late at night  and lost consciousness. When I came to, I was in bad shape, but I drove home, took some Tylenol and went to bed (bad idea, but it's what I did to avoid the bankrupting cost of American health care). I even got up the next day and went to work, though I couldn't hear and I could barely walk. I figured it would pass.<br /><br />It didn't pass. My boss sent me to the hospital and it was a good thing she did. A cat scan revealed I had cracked my skull and bruised my brain. For three days I was under close observation and throwing up pretty much all the time. The doctor told me and a far more distraught Mrs. Ninja (then girlfriend Ninja) that we would have to wait and see when the swelling stopped how much of my cognitive function would remain. It's a terrible thing to sit and wait to find out if the thoughts you're thinking are the last clear thoughts you're ever going to have.<br /><br />I assure you, if I had been up to it, I would have spent that time finishing the novel I was working on as to die, or worse, go vegetable with an unfinished manuscript is a great fear of mine. But I wasn't up to it, so I read instead. Oh, I told my girlfriend and my family I loved them and comforted them as much as I could, but I was there for three days and that's a long time to go without a book. Mrs. Ninja understood and she bought me a copy of Watership Down.<br /><br />As I read Watership Down, I knew it was perhaps the last book I would ever be able to read, and I was okay with it. It would have been a great book to go out on. I'll stop with the melodrama as it came out all right. My balance has never been the same and I have some slight hearing loss, but all things considered, I got off quite lucky. I even finished that silly manuscript I was working on and have since written a better one and as you know from reading this blog, I have read many fine books since.<br /><br />But never before had the power of a great book been made clearer to me. Richard Adams took me out of that place and away from my worries, which were considerable. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but he did. I forgot about the nurses and the doctors and all the dreadful possible outcomes I was facing and was transported to the world of Hazel and Fiver and Bigwig and the wonderful rabbits of Watership Down. I forgot my own concerns and focused on my concern for those brave rabbits and their struggle.<br /><br />For those three anxious days, I was not at the hospital. I was in England in a warren. Never before had I so badly needed to be swept away and Watership Down did that for me. And in my more cynical moments when I'm convinced no one reads anymore and we writers are a relic unaware that our time has passed, I remember that experience and know that literature is as important and powerful as it ever was. I don't care that most Americans watch reality television instead of reading (well, I do, but what can be done?). I need great books in my life and as you're reading this blog (possibly while watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta), I can't be the only one.<br /><br />I almost don't want to tell you about Watership Down. It's an amazing experience that every reader should have at least once and if I tell you about it before hand, it may diminish it somewhat. How some readers feel about Lord of the Rings (I never did care much for all the eating and singing those hobbits did), how my mother felt about Gone With the Wind, how Stephen King fans feel about The Dark Tower (which contains multiple references to the work of Richard Adams)--that's how I feel about Watership Down. I love it as much as I love Batman, and if you readthe blog regularly, you know that's a lot:) So I'll repeat: if you haven't read Watership Down, stop reading this review and go read it. For those of you who have read it, I have a job to do and it's time for me to get to it:<br /><br />Watership Down is the story of a group of misfit rabbits who leave their warren when they learn, courtesy of a psychic revelation, that their home will soon be destroyed. Fiver is the high-strung rabbit who has the revelation and he has many more before the novel is done, all of them useful. And why not? Humans have these intuitive revelations all the time. Don't believe me? Then why is it that airline reservation cancelations consistently go up ahead of a crash? I myself have had a few odd moments that caused me to alter my path and as a result, I avoided catastrophe (didn't happen when I was walking in that parking lot, though). These odd moments are the subject of another, kookier post, but I'll bet many of you Esteemed Readers, if you're honest, could tell me stories of having similar moments of intuition.<br /><br />Fiver convinces his buddy Hazel that they need to get out of town. First, the two try to convince their chief rabbit that the sky is falling. They are not taken seriously, of course, and in the end only a few rabbits high-tail it out of there, all of them boys--which turns out to be a real problem later. The rabbits rough it for a bit, attempt to join another warren, visit another, and eventually decide to start their own. But, of course, if their warren is going to last more than the current generation, our heroes are going to need some girls. The second half of the novel is some dude rabbits on a quest to get some chicks--what tale could be more universal than that?<br /><br />And that's the plot of Watership Down. Our protagonists have a clear goal and it's one readers will relate to: they are on a quest for a sustainable life where they can be free of death and harm. There is considerable opposition on all sides. After all, these are rabbits and there are farmers and foxes and trains and birds on all sides--everybody wants to kill these poor rabbits. At times, the oppositions seems insurmountable and that is the key to what makes Watership Down so very readable. Incredible opposition facing scrappy heroes that will do anything to achieve their universal goal. Write that formula down. If you want to have a hope of writing a novel with even a fraction of the longevity of Watership Down, and I do, I do--that's how it's done.<br /><br />Adams never lets up on these rabbits. They are always being chased or imprisoned or otherwise threatened and I assure you the pages will turn themselves. Thug life? Try Bunny life. This is my favorite thing about Watership Down: it is first and foremost a good story well crafted. Adams gives us lovable characters we can relate to and then shoves them in harm's way repeatedly. This probably isn't what makes Watership Down a classic, and in a moment I'm going to talk about theme and metaphor and all that other stuff your English teacher lives for. But notice, all of that is secondary and readers only invest time considering it because their primary need for a good story has first been met.<br /><br />The thing about Adams' rabbits is that they are truly rabbits. These aren't Disney characters who drive in cars, or watch television. They are rabbits and their world is the world of a rabbit. Their concerns are food, shelter, mating, and avoiding harm--which are the primary concerns of humans, no matter how much we like to otherwise trump up the importance of our actions. Every simile Adams employs is a simile from nature. Here's one of my favorites:<br /><br />He pretended to go back, but suddenly turned, rushed upon the shadows and plunged into the nearest hole faster than a raindrop into the ground.<br /><br />Adams would never write \\"he leaped into the hole like a car whipping into a garage,\\" partly because that's a terrible simile, but mostly because rabbits have no knowledge of cars or garages. The rabbits' thinking is entirely grounded in their world, and therefore the narration is as well. The rabbits have names like Blackberry, Dandelion, Cowslip, and even Prince Rainbow. You won't ever encounter a rabbit in Watership Down named Milkshake, or Lucky Penny, or Toilet Paper (too bad).<br /><br />The one conceit of Watership Down is that Adams' rabbits, though rabbits in every other respect, have the ability to think, reason, and communicate like humans. To be fair, given that they have this ability, it's a wonder they haven't developed air conditioned warrens or rabbit cars to drive into rabbit garages--but I'm making too much of this. After all, it's just a story, and if the rabbits were not human-like in their reasoning, we would not find them relatable characters over such a long novel. Humans are deeply narcissistic and we want to read about humans even when we're reading about rabbits.<br /><br />The difference then is that Adams' rabbits think and reason in rabbit terms. For example:<br /><br />The kind of ideas that have become natural to many male human beings in thinking of females--ideas of protection, fidelity, romantic love and so on--are, of course, unknown to rabbits, although rabbits certainly do form exclusive attachments much more frequently than most people realize. However, they are not romantic and it came naturally to Hazel and Holly to consider the two Nuthanger does simply as breeding stock for the warren. This was what they had risked their lives for.<br /><br />Don't worry. The female rabbits think of themselves this way also and they're cool with it. Before you start shouting about sexism, Esteemed Reader, two things: 1. These are rabbits, dude, not people, so chill 2. Although the first half of the book is boy heavy, there are some very strong-willed girl rabbits in the second half every bit as capable as the boys at many things, and better than them at other things (such as cooking and cleaning--I kid, I kid, and Mrs. Ninja just smacked me in the back of the head, which forced me to remind her of my gravely serious brain injury).<br /><br />All right. This is clearly the longest review ever, so I want to talk about three more things and then we'll call it a day. First, although it is perhaps unfortunate that the rabbits have done away with romantic love, it opens up the possibility of greater love. The rabbits love and fight for each other. They do not want does for themselves alone, though they will fight over them if there are not enough to go around. They want the does for the good of the warren. Everything the rabbits do they do for each other and they are stronger for it. Their warren reminds me of a hive in Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, and I yearn for this sort of community in humanity.<br /><br />Second, the main theme of Watership Down is a stroke of genius. The real story here is of the contrast between the different warrens the rabbits visit. In each instance, we are presented differently constructed communities, their strengths, and their weaknesses. What sets our heroes apart is the manner in which they will construct their community differently than these flawed societies. I will not speculate that these warrens are really metaphors for some known human society. Some may think that the final, mean and nasty warren the rabbits visit is a rabbit stand in for Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia, but I don't. I think the different warrens are simply communities of rabbits with qualities similar to the worst human societies. Oddly, there is no capitalism-gone-mad society of rabbits, perhaps because rabbits are far too clever to ever take serious the silly writings of Ayn Rand.<br /><br />For me, the most interesting warren is the second the rabbits visit. The rabbits of this warren are eager for more rabbits to join because they are living a lie. They live in a nice garden with plenty of fresh veggies and free from predators because they are protected by a human farmer. The catch is that the farmer buries wire snares all around because he is also farming rabbits. The rabbits of this warren accept that a few of them will die every year so that the rest can live in utopia (paging Lois Lowry), and they are eager to welcome new rabbits because the more rabbits there are, the better the odds on not getting snared. Here is what the prophet Fiver has to say about these rabbits:<br /><br />Don't you see? The farmer only sets so many snares at a time, and if one rabbit dies, the others will live that much longer. You suggested that Hazel should tell them our adventures, Blackberry, but it didn't go down well, did it? Who wants to hear about brave deeds when he's ashamed of his own, and who likes an open, honest tale from someone he's deceiving? Do you want me to go on? I tell you, every single thing that's happened fits like a bee in a foxglove. And kill them, you say, and help ourselves to the great burrow? We shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! Help ourselves to misery and death!<br /><br />Third, I must comment on the ending, though I'll try not to spoil it. In the final act, Adams hits us with a Deus Ex Machina, which we know from dutifully reading our Aristotle is a major no-no. A key rabbit character is saved at the last minute by a human stepping in to help out. She is a god descending on the battlefield at the last second to make everything all right. This is this sort of shenanigan that ruins lesser works, but Adams gets away with it because his god from the machine does not resolve all of the conflict or even the most pressing conflict. Also, the poor rabbits go through so much hell for most of the novel, that in this particular instance the reader is likely to be okay with our hero getting one free lunch.<br /><br />I lied! There's a fourth thing, and then I really am done: Watership Down is an honest book, which is probably why it's been banned so often. I hope to one day write a book so effective it gets banned:) I said before that these rabbits are not Disney characters. Their world is real, and the real world is often a nasty, violent place, especially for rabbits. Adams is not willfully nasty, but he tells the truth and as always, the truth is somewhat unpleasant. For this reason, Watership Down is probably not appropriate for very young readers (although, neither is the world). However, Watership Down started life as a story Richard Adams told to his two young daughters on a long drive and I can't imagine the violence, or even the implied rape in this story, is any worse than what children have been exposed to already and certainly no worse than what they will be exposed to as they grow up.<br /><br />Whew. This may be my longest review ever and it is done. Make sure you come back on Thursday when Richard Adams, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, is going to be here to face the 7 Questions. And come again on Saturday for an interview with a surprise literary agent. And now, as always I leave you with a few of my most favorite passages from one of my most favorite books, Watership Down:<br /><br />They climbed not over but through the sun-red grass, among the awakened insect movement and the light ablaze. The grass undulated about them. They peered over anthills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle.<br /><br />\\"It all comes from men,\\" said Holly. \\"All other elil do what they have to do and Frith moves them as he moves us. They live on earth and they need food. Men will never rest till they've spoiled the earth and destroyed the animals. But I'd better go on with this tale of mine.\\"<br /><br />Hazel's anxiety and the reason for it were soon known to all the rabbits and there was not one who did not realize what they were up against. There was nothing very startling in what he had said. He was simply the one--as a Chief Rabbit ought to be--through whom a strong feeling, latent throughout the warren, had come to the surface.<br /><br />\\"Well, I can't quite make out,\\" answered Bigwig. \\"But if I understand him properly--and I'm not at all sure that I do--he says that where he comes from there are thousands of his kind--more than we can possibly imagine.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Rourke (intentionally) underacts, Tomei acts, Wood overacts. When these actors are riffing, this film is a winner.<br /><br />There are flaws: the movie never makes up its mind if its' a nostalgic lookback at one of America's oldest and craziest professions and at those who continue the tradition - and those who continue because they are convinced they can do no other work and be successful. Another lost opportunity to make this movie Oscar-bound: by not setting up a believable relationship between the Wrestler and The Stripper (MT), both well past their prime (about 12 years too old to be doing what they do for a buck). The relationship would be very real as both are performers, both are equally concerned about \\"image\\" and both do choreographed steps for the public.<br /><br />So we get a typical drama involving a feminist survivor and the proverbial guy who just doesn't get it.<br /><br />It must be noted that Rourke and Tomei obviously researched their roles, and this goes a long, long way. Tomei's sensuality snaking around that pole is close to unbelievable, suggesting that she is engaged to make it look right.<br /><br />Don't want to give away the very predictable ending...but Sly Stallone should have been called in as a consultant for thye climactic contest in the squared circle. In Rocky I we walk up the aisle exhausted but inspired - I joined my first gym later that year - Stallone worked us up viscerally *and* intellectually.<br /><br />IT's laudable that the matches are beautifully realized...and going back to the inevitable Rocky reference, they are far more credible than the roundhouse riots in the '76 film.<br /><br />[Viewers may recall another Asbury Park, New Jersey shoot with Rourke in 1987, the title of which escapes me, but which involves a boxer's sustaining in the club scene and his activities with low characters, bent on taking advantage of his *youthfullness*].

B0040JHWKS|4.0|The songs on this CD didn't make it onto Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" albums in the late '70s.  He was so prolific at the time that he didn't have room for everything he was doing.  And he was such an exacting, pain-in-the-butt recording artist that he was never satisfied with a version, style or take of his song.  These are outtakes from that period, when Springsteen dragged his band into the recording studio week after week, trying to produce perfection.     The strength of the album is that it's very cool to hear The Boss experimenting with different styles, from rockabilly to the emerging punk sound of NYC at the time he was recording. There's also versions of familiar songs, with the well-known tune but totally different lyrics, as well as the opposite of familiar lyrics set to a totally different tune.  Springsteen was experimenting with those varities during his live performances at the time, but these studio versions give a clearer sense of what he was doing than do the live bootlegs that many of us have collected.    The weakness is that the outtakes truly aren't as good as the songs on \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Darkness.\\"  This album is better as archival history than as music to listen to and enjoy.

B0046W1692|2.0|I love this band, and have fervently bought each album as they're released.  Sadly though, this record is a huge disappointment.  The writing is fine, but the songs are just so bland and uninteresting!  I remember the excitement I felt upon hearing Revolucion de Amor for the first time (my first hotly anticipated Mana album since I purchased the ones before after they'd been out for a while).  I got a similar feeling with Amar es Combatir.  But Drama y Luz sounds like the band just didn't really care.  The only memorable songs on this album are \\"Lluvia al Corazon\\" and \\"El Dragon\\"...the rest of the songs just seem to meld into one another with no distinction.  Hopefully this is just a blip on an otherwise flawless catalog.

I wish I read this book before having children, things would have been different for my own children. Here in Hawaii we have a mixing pot of cultures, generations and so forth. everything you can think of is here in Hawaii. but how do you compete with what happens outside your home? Professor Chuas bravery is truly admirable. She stood up to not to a way of parenting here in the west, she stood up to a countrys way of thinking. She ignored the outside western way of parenting. Amazing. I wish I had the courage to do so myself.     With all the negative remarks and comments about how she raised her chidlren, i think its crazy. Her girls her well acomplished and what she instilled in them the most.....is priceless.    Read this book with an open mind. Then look around you and examine your own understandings and morals. You will see that Professor Chua is on the right track.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|This was a free rental at redbox.<br />Where the wrestler at least had a sense of a theme, reality at odds with the fantasy, and decent back up characters, Black swan is about as one dimensional and un-involving as it gets.<br />The movie shows the limitations of the director who is unable to convey any real world experience or value to the film. As seen in the fountain and the wrestler, he focuses on anguish and simply dwells on it for the whole movie, a real one note wonder.<br />Its basically a distorted perverted fairy tale with no real sense of reality. This type of story is best left to supermarket novels and comic books. To devote an entire movie to what is at best a sketch is pointless and grotesque. The story line is scant and relies heavily on cgi trickery and spends way too much time just following the anguished frequently masturbating Porty around. How many ways can you film her crotch being grabbed? Is that even interesting?<br /><br />While Its obvious the movie is all about her, Portman is pretty bad in the role, she's just not interesting enough to sustain that type of film. Personally I think Portman is completely insulated overrated spoiled brat of an actress. Her overwrought constantly anguished overly twitchy acting gets old very fast. The dancing, what there was of it, is pretty weak and not worth watching. Its also obvious that Portman only dances in some close ups and is not very good at all. The final dance scene in which she is supposedly perfect is not even shown, only little tightly edited bits in a very underwhelming finale of this soiled undergarment of a movie.

I have personally read this book eight times, and each time I learn something new.  With each new client we go thru it again.  I cannot imagine anyone not liking this book or finding it helpful..with the exception of course being,  those that live via their ego.      In all my years of coaching not once has a client not gained enormously from this book or ever complained about having to read it.  It is not a one-time read.  If you truly want to change your life.  Change how you view and are viewed...if you truly want to and dare to be different...this is it.      I also have the book on Cd....Mr. Tolle is the next best thing to meditation.  My only suggestion is this...you MUST be honest with yourself...you must deal with things that perhaps you'd rather forget or not acknowledge at all.      Come clean with this book.  Become the person you are truly meant to be.       Its funny..but as I read some of the reviews I could hear the ego's freaking out.  I wish there were 10 stars.

B0021L8V0M|1.0|First of all, the plot is set in motion by some Russian fed claiming in CIA offices that Angelina Jolie's character is a Russian sleeper.  Um, why?  Of course this sets in motion lots of gun fire, running around, car chases, etc.  But for plot - why?  Why did this guy say that she is a spy?  It serves him no purpose.  If he hadn't, his goals would have been reached in oh about 5 minutes.  Of course then the movie would have been 5 minutes, too.  Or maybe not made at all, which probably would have been best.  But that's the point - the whole premise makes no sense.      Personal pet peeve - movies about Russia and Eastern Europe made without even a rudimentary google search.  Liev Schrieber disappoints here - he is a Russian speaker and should have picked up some of the more ridiculous errors.  Like, for example, the fact that people who died in the Soviet Union in 1982 did not have massive Orthodox crosses on their graves.  It was a Communist state, there were no crosses!  There is not a single original headstone in all of Russia from 1982 with a cross.  This is pretty elementary.  Secondly, Angelina's Russian name is Chenkov.  Um, that's a man.  Not a \\"can be male, can be female name.\\"  Chenkov, and any other -ov is a man, always, with zero exceptions.  Some Russians abroad anglicize their names so that the men and women of a family all have one surname, but in speech and always in reference to self they would use the feminine name.  So, Angelina Jolie was playing a man.  Some Russian big shot with the KGB had a massive ring with the KGB emblem on it.  What????  The KGB is not a high school or a football team, no one wore that kind of insignia publically.  And certainly no one kissed the ring - this is supposed to be Russia, not Sicily.  all in all, a completely idiotic movie.  Angelina Jolie is married to some dorky looking scientist, she beats up and kills hundreds of trained secret agents, kicking her little toothpick legs (while keeping hair perfect), and thereis no plot.     Super disappointing!  Because I like her, love Liev, and liked the idea and previews.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I get it...you didn't like the book, but to give away the ending??  Some of your criticisms are valid but it is wrong, totally wrong, to give away the ending of a book, especially a mystery/drama.  I've read every Mickey Haller book and this one had me on the edge of my seat.  The courtroom proceedings and general legal strategy were, to me, the most interesting part of the book.  Mind you, I'm in Europe on holiday (rare!) and read this each night after VERY long days of touring...one night until 3 A.M.!  It's fiction and I usually give fiction writers a bit more Â«poetic licenseÂ».  Loved this book!  So it cost more on Kindle?  So what?  Buy the hard cover or go to the library.  Don't justify your zero stars as an excuse that this is the only forum.  Complain to the publisher since most of us can read, too, and know that.  Not fair to Connelly.

The Kindle Edition of Do the Work is currently free on Amazon.com till May 20th.    I got to read this book free as part of the BzzAgent program. It was delivered directly to my Kindle. I read it in one sitting! I have several 20 something employees who have a sense of entitlement that my 38 year old brain just does not comprehend.  I feel like this book was written so that I could hand out copies to each of them! At the slightest sign of issue or challenge they will just back down and say something isn't  possible. Trust me I will be giving each of them a copy of Pressfield's book!
0143036556|5.0|I was greatly impressed by Diamond's research on this topic.  He has done thorough and exhausting research on many societal and country collapses.  To me two stand out:  The cutting of trees to extinction on Easter Island (Chapter 2, Twilight at Easter) and the contrast in Chapter 11 between The Dominican Republic and Haiti. If anyone doubts that Haiti would be in much better position to recover economically from the recent earthquake if they had not practically obliterated their forests, I believe they would lose their doubts and help fund the few NGO's now struggling with reforestation projects in Haiti.

B000PHNHMQ|5.0|I've been a Porter Cable fan for quite some time; I have their 15 gauge, 16 gauge, and both of their 18 gauge nailers. (More about that in a moment) I haven't had any problems with any one of them. I did woodworking for a living for a while and have been an avid woodworker throughout the years. I am installing new sophits around the house. I'm using PVC board. In order to join the pieces together in order to have boards wide enough I am butt jointing the board edges, and using a backing strip with PVC glue and 1 1/4\\" brad nails to hold it until the glue sets up.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that I am using both my Porter Cable BN200A which is comparable to the Makita AF505 in every way. They take 18 gauge nails ranging from size 5/8\\" to 2\\" and weigh as far as feel goes the same. (I tried looking up the exact weight of these and was unable to get an accurate weight published anywhere on the PC's) So comparing the two, they both felt like they weighed the same. On the other hand Porter Cable also has an 18 gauge nailer in a lighter version; which I have model number BN125A which has been replaced with the BN138. This little beauty is an 18 gauge nailer but only uses nails in the range of 5/8\\" to 1 3/8\\". You may be asking why buy the slightly smaller one with a lesser range when you can have the granddaddy for about 20 to 40 dollars more? The answer is that BN138 weighs considerably less than the PC and this Makita. None of these are what you would call heavy, but if you are using them all day long, even a couple of pounds can make a difference. So for fifty nine smackeroos I decided to get the small lighter weight one as well.<br /><br />So why am I going on about the Porter Cables in the middle of the Makita review? Because there really isn't a lot to say about it. The aluminum nail housing is easy to use and well built. It fires a nail the same exact way the Porter Cable does. On the attractive scale the Makita is top of the heap. They both have the directional blower vent on the top. The noise they make when driving a nail is the same. The Makita predecessor was the AF501 and has since been replaced with this AF505. Makita does not have a lighter weight more limited range nailer equivalent to the PCBN138.<br /><br />If I had to get critical of the Makita and this is a minor gripe is that they should include at least a small pack of nails in the case. I wanted to be sure to use the right nails, and it was a challenge finding the information to verify that. As it turned out the Porter Cable nails readily available at the big box store fit it, as well as the Hitachi and others. Keeping the gun oiled and making sure the nails are installed in the right direction is key to keeping the gun working properly. You see some reviews slamming the tool, and they may be right, but then again all it takes is one load of nails in the gun upside down, and when that hammer comes down to fire the nail, and it is met with the pointy tip side instead of the flat head side, and then the nail is driven into something with the flat head side trying to make its entry in the work piece, what that scenario you have the hammer hits the sharp part of the nail, and it dances the nail off to one side which forces the nail down the shaft scoring the walls all the way down. That is an ouch. Do that a few times and the gun is not going to work properly any more. So keep it oiled, use the right nails and be sure to place them in the gun in the right direction. If you want to avoid oil stains in your natural finish project, fine only a few nails into a piece of scrap when first oiling it and it won't give you oil residues after that. Also do not soak the thing with oil, only a couple of drops in the air hose intake fitting is all it takes; do it at least daily.<br /><br />The case it comes with is superb. It is well designed and a great way of protecting your unit. They also include a small bottle of oil with a sealed top that you have to use a pin to create a hole. The safety glasses included in the case is a nice touch as well. It already comes with an air nipple too, the one that is common to the building industry.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because it is well built, drives nails beautifully right out of the case, aesthetically pleasing to look at, has a good feel to it, and is relatively light weight with its aluminum housing. With all 18 gauge brad nailers there are always a couple of reviews with someone who has a broken unit, but in both the Makita and PC there are an overwhelming number of 5 star reviews. If I had to do it over, I am leaning toward the Makita because of its good looks. I know that sounds ridiculous but they seem to match up in every other way, so the looks department is the only thing that separates the two and hands down the Makita is nicer looking. In addition, and I know the prices change all of the time, but the Makita is now twenty dollars cheaper than the PC.ses included in the case is a nice touch as well.

B004FN7ZOC|4.0|This album is definitely a welcome relief to the current scenario in the music industry. Do not expect anything new from this album.Amon sticks to what they do best and there is nothing wrong about it.  They have also a song out there that can be related to the current world today and doesnt talk about Norse mythology for a change.  Great album.     The only downside is that the lyrics are not really inspiring for some songs. But I am not going to stay away from this because of that.
0515149489|4.0|I've been a Roberts fan for years and she never lets me down.  I agree with other reviewers that she has written another winner.  However, I must admit I was rather stunned at the amount of four letter words in this book.  It's as if she has saved up all her inner frustrations and consolidated as many f-words, etc. as possible into this one work.  I realize that swearing seems to be the \\"in thing\\" with a lot of people, but to have all the characters spewing forth seems somewhat overly much. I just hope she has gotten said language out of her system and can tone it down a little.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|As a Kentucky native I worked on a thoroughbred farm in Lexington in 1975-76, where I had the pleasure of seeing Secretariat at stud at nearby Claiborne Farm. Even from a distance, out to pasture, Big Red's form, carriage, and spirit were clearly unique, distinguishing him from any other horse I'd ever seen. I was also privileged to attend one of his breeding sessions, but about that I'll only say he was just as regally impressive in the breeding shed as on the track.     The movie is a finely crafted and historically accurate dramatization of the horse, his human family, and the racing history and legacy they made together. Diane Lane and John Malkovich are superb in the lead roles of feisty feminist owner Penny Chenery Tweedy and eccentric iconoclast trainer Lucien Lauren. The stellar ensemble cast surrounding them lifts the intensity and quality of individual and collective performance to hoof- and heart-pounding perfection. From editing, music, and cinematography to lighting, direction, and writing, every technical, artistic, and production aspect of the movie coalesces to deliver a first-rate film that in my opinion drills the bullseye of every mark of a classic. Together with its equally impressive precursor SEABISCUIT, SECRETARIAT should be featured at every Derby party leading up to the feature race at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday afternoon of every May, every year, everywhere.     Finally, one can't help but cheer and applaud the stable of colts who played Big Red himself: mainly Trolley Boy, a 6-year-old from Kentucky, and Longshot Max, a 7-year-old from Oklahoma, together with a number of racing doubles. Kudos to veteran horse wrangler Rusty Hendrickson, whose deft handling of these magnificent thoroughbreds vividly captured Secretariat's spirit, demeanor, and intelligence.     If you haven't seen it - just do it. I'd give it 10 stars if that were an option.
0439023513|1.0|From Account Owner's Daughter: I LOVED the first two books, read them very quickly. They were interesting, well-written and I really didn't mind hearing the story through the main character (Katniss).  This book basically.. sucked. I was not impressed, Katniss spent the book moaning, whining and walking around in some daze that was totally unrelatable. Peeta isn't himself, he too becomes quite unrecognisble and unlikeable.   Later, something happens that makes the entire series fairly redundant (you'll know it when you read it).  The love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta just sort've ends like this. No mention until the last few pages where Katniss says 'ohhh btw.. this is the guy I ended up with'. So disappointing.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I bought this Rode VideoMic Pro Compact Shotgun microphone to go with my Panasonic TM900 camcorder since I travel a lot shooting interviews etc. I needed something that was light and compact in keeping with the scale of the TM900. I had very bad experiences with the Sennheiser MKE300 - wow has that company gone downhill. The Sennheiser had a constant hum and static and I couldn't get enough volume out of it.    I have the Rode Videomic which is good but is too big for the TM900 and I've found it unwieldy for traveling (somehow its Z shape and those rubber bands don't give me a lot of confidence).     The Videomic Pro however is almost a perfect match for the TM900. It fits well into the bracket and there's no problem with fitting the plug into the camera's mic socket (which is set at an angle). I also fitted a larger ring wide angle adapter(the EXII HD7X46)and this does not interfere with the mic.    The audio from the mic is great - it's quite sensitive but reducing to -10DB is generally adequate for normal interview situations - relatively quiet room, one subject facing camera and mic. Setting the internal recording level to 0 seems to do the trick. For quiet voices you can up the mic to 0db or +20db. I have not had occasion to use the latter yet.    The mic also has a high pass filter (HPF) which cuts rumble. I am not sure if this cuts wind sound significantly but will try that later.     The mic does not seem to pick up motor noise from my camera but then I don't do a lot of zooming when I'm filming (and when I have, the mic hasn't picked it up). Like my other Rode mic, it is also suspended on \\"rubber bands\\" but this time only two (and they give you spares). The rubber bands can detach quite easily so it's something to be aware of.     I like the inclusion of a LED light to tell you that the mic is on and also to tell you if the battery is ok or not.    I did NOT like the difficulty of inserting the battery. You have to futz around with the front cover which latches onto a groove under the actual barrel of the (foam covered) mic itself and then push up to latch the bottom. The diagram in the instruction book conveniently omits the actual mic! I guess it's always difficult the first time and maybe I'll get used to it. Anyway it's lucky that one good battery will last for around 70 hours (at least that's what Rode claims) so I hope I don't have to change the battery a lot.    Also for this price it would have been nice to get a case of some sort but no such luck. Anyway I use small Pelicans or soft foam bags for packing.    I haven't tried them yet but this mic can also be fitted to a boom, and there is a pistol grip for it. The bottom has a screw thread so you can put it on a stand but you will need an extension cord to reach the camera as the cord that is attached to the mic cannot be removed and is short.    The mic weighs 0.18 lb (86 g) and its dimensions are 1.69\\"x6.02\\"x3.74\\".    Conclusion: if you need a small and light mic for a similarly scaled camcorder, this is a great purchase. I'm very satisfied with it and it does a good job.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|My husband loves biographical movies. He was delighted that I got him this Collector´s Edition because Disc #2 comes with interesting information of how the movie was made. Even though the graphics have been remastered a little bit, the film keeps its originality. Stay away from the Blu-ray edition. I bought that one previously and it is awful.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|FEMME FATALE is the seventh studio album by Britney Spears and took two years to write and record.<br /><br />Her label [Jive] decided to make FEMME FATALE a closely themed album, formed around the sound and feelings of clubs. Musically the tracks are heavily influenced by European electronic music rather American ones, so it sounds fresh and a bit different to Britney's American fanbase in comparison to their usual club tracks [whilst to our ears some of the tracks will bring other songs to our minds. I like the deja-vu effect of using vaguely familiar beats, but it's not new to her European fanbase].<br /><br />The executive producers and chief song writers are Dr Luke and Max Martin [he's responsible for Baby One More Time]. The list of individual track writers and producers include the likes of Ammo, Billboard, Benny Blanco, Bloodshy & Avant, Darkchild, Dream Machine, Fraser T. Smith, JMIKE, Henrik Jonback, Magnus, Oligee, Sandy Vee, Shellback, Stargate and Will.I.am.<br /><br />A common problem with all dance/pop albums is that the similar styles used for the tracks means that everything seems to flow together too well at times; and the main issue that people will have with FEMME FATALE is that this issue - and the fact that this is a album with a rather limited theme - means that there's just not much in the way of variety in the tracks, so an in depth track by track breakdown isn't really necessary for this review: The pace and depth of the music is more or less the same throughout the album and the lyrical content of the songs is either in the theme of dancing and music or men and hook-ups, and that's it from beginning to end.<br /><br />Having said that there are a few exceptions on here, to separate the tracks musically from the strong club overtones found on the majority of the tracks; 'How I Roll', 'Drop Dead Beautiful', 'Big Fat Bass' and 'Down n Up' lean strongly towards R&B. 'Don't Keep Me Waiting' has rockier overtones, whilst the music used for the tracks 'Criminal' and 'Selfish' is lighter and the lyrics are arguably a bit more poppy then everything else here, but still has the same R&B undertones like the tracks on Britney's 'In The Zone' album had.<br /><br />Britney herself claimed that FEMME FATALE has a few mid-tempo tracks that could be counted as ballads* - well they must have not made the final cut, because the album's slowest track is 'He About To Lose Me' and that again is the same R&B/pop hybrid that her 'In The Zone' album focused on. 'Criminal' and 'Selfish' are in the mid range, but no-one would view those as ballads.<br /><br />So far there have been two singles taken from FEMME FATALE; 'Hold It Against Me' (which went to #1 in 13 countries) and 'Till The World Ends' [you can vote for your favourite track to be the third single over on YouTube].<br /><br />I really liked 'Hold It Against Me' at first as it was different to Britney's traditional faux R&B/pop releases, but her record label made a big mistake by following it up with a second single that has the same lyrical content, so the second single was guaranteed not to receive as much attention. And although it hasn't been as successful I do prefer 'Till The World Ends': The music is darker and grittier then single one and the song is lyrically stronger then any of her singles for the last few years; It may be a basic dance-in-a-club number, but the sexual suggestions are there and are subtle enough that it's not cheesy, roll your eyes or lewd. Best of all? There is some autotune here - especially in the bridge - but much less than there is on other tracks.<br /><br />My favourite track is 'I Wanna Go' - if it gets released as a single I'd be interested in buying any remixes. The producers also use what sounds like a recording of someone whistling to accompany the music in the bridge, which hooks me in.<br /><br />For me the other standouts are:<br /><br />'Inside Out' stands out to me as it's a little bit grittier to the other tracks and the lyrics [she's trying to break up with someone, but ends up begging him for one final, ahem, happy time session] sound so lost and defeated - which is quite an achievement since she's singing someone else's song.<br /><br />The Cheeky, playful bridge to 'How I Roll' is stuck in my head. Surely the writers knew what they were doing when they used \\"kitty cat\\" shortly after the word 'Posse'? Either way it's stuck in my head and I have to be careful not to warble out the incorrect lyrics whilst buying bread at Sainsburys...<br /><br />'Drop Dead Beautiful' - I have no idea who Sabi is, but she sounds just like Ke$ha. Britney's voice is altered and stretched with different vocal effects on this track the most, but this and the rent-a-rapper combine to make this one of my guilty pleasures and most listened to tracks. Britney even does a spot of faux rapping in the bridge.<br /><br />I adore the intro to 'Seal It With A Kiss'; The music takes the song to another level, though I like the lyrics too - she's starting a relationship and is trying to keep it hidden. Hidden from the press?<br /><br />'Trouble For Me' is similar to the next track [Criminal] as the lyrics are about being attracted to some who you know is no good for you, but unlike the next track the music is heavy and has a heavy beat - it sorts of gives you a sense of being in a smoky club and seeing someone yourself.<br /><br />'Criminal' has mid-range music that is a throwback to Britney's 'In The Zone era and it can definitely be described as R&B, with no strong electro overtones. The falling-for-a-bad-boy-I-know-I-shouldn't fits in with her ex and almost comes of as being personal to her. This is very radio friendly and I think it would be a strong single as it sounds different to the previous two from this album.<br /><br />'Down N Up' is another dance-in-a-club track, but the music and catchy chorus are both infectious. It contains a sample from something that is on the tip of my tongue - so maddening trying to remember what.<br />[Update: Truecolours09 reminded me that the sample is from Inner City 'Good Life]<br /><br />'He About To Lose Me' is a immediate standout as the music to it is the only track not to have dance/eltro overtones and it has the most natural vocals. Listening to the song properly reveals that the lyrics are strong too - she's bored of her dead-end relationship and is about to end it and go of with someone else she meets at a club. I don't know why this track is only a bonus one and isn't on the tracklist for her regular edition of the U.S. album; it could have been a hit and been huge on the airwaves. What a waste.<br /><br />'Selfish' is sort of a dance version of the previous track. Britney is intending to think of herself and pick up someone to take back home, but they'll be doing what she wants to do for her pleasure.<br /><br />This isn't to say I don't like the other tracks - I do like everything on here and can warble [at least] a few lines to everything else on offer here, it's just that the above tracks hooked me in straightaway and the above mentioned tracks are the ones that I've listened to most often and have added to various playlists on my Ipod.<br /><br />There is only one track on the album that I would class as a filler and that is the Will.I.am featured 'Big Fat Bass', and this isn't pierce-my-ears-with-a-knitting-needle awful and I don't skip it, even though it tends to irritate me. I like the music to it, but Will.I.am doesn't add much to the song and I find the highly repetitive lyrics annoying. Observe; I can be the treble baby, you can be the bass, you can be the bass, you can be the bass. Repeat about a hundred times - and the bad thing is that I'm not exaggerating by much [I suspect that Will.I.am gave her an BEP album outtake].<br /><br />I didn't know what my final rating would be until I'd finished writing my review. On one hand I love dancy, electro music and after listening to the album over and over [it was leaked online at the beginning of March] I still don't skip over any of the tracks, but on the other hand this is Britney's most impersonal album as the songs could be sung by anyone and she hasn't added anything of her own.<br /><br />Plus, the order of the tracklist places several songs with similar lyrics next to each other which is never a good idea as everything flows into one big jumble. The chosen theme doesn't help this any as it limits what you can actually write and sing about; Which isn't to bad when you just want nice, upbeat music to get ready for going out to, but it has all been done thousands of times.<br /><br />Although I do enjoy FEMME FATALE for what it is, for some reason I'm left with a can't-put-my-finger-on-it feeling that something is missing from the album, so let's write down any niggles and see:<br /><br />A) Britney herself has not co-wrote any of the tracks which is very disappointing. She was never known as a gifted wordsmith ['Everytime' was her peak], but even her Blackout album which was wrote and recorded at the height of what is commonly known as her 'pink wig' crazy days period featured two songs that she wrote.<br /><br />B) I've always wondered about the now commonplace use of autotune and constant miming. These annoyances only started being a staple with Britney Spears albums following her marriages, children, divorces, breakdown and Blackout album. Yes, vocal effects do tie in nicely with the lively electro synths, but whilst she may never be mistaken for Mariah Carey, Britney does have a pleasant voice with a distinctive purr to it, so I find it frustrating and lazy that she and her label use these fail-safe tactics when she is capable of live performances. If she is not actually yet at the point where she feels able to preform again, then [I mean this in the nicest way possible] maybe she shouldn't be releasing new music.<br /><br />C) Also frustrating; It's a little known fact that Britney can play the piano, so again I wonder why she doesn't put this additional musical talent to good use. The chords in past single 'Everytime' and promotional-only single 'Someday (I'll Understand)' were wrote by Britney, and the instruments used in the studios were also played by her. My point is that it's a wasted opportunity for stamping some personal creativity onto her albums not to incorporate some of these skills in her work.<br /><br />I suppose the main thing that bothers me here is the fact that FEMME FATALE doesn't have any real personality to it. Every single track is catchy, slickly produced and strong enough to be used as a single release, but nothing screams \\"this is Britney Spears\\".<br /><br />Despite the lack of the X factor for me, I still view FEMME FATALE as a very solid album and I think it's her strongest one to date. In fact I'd describe it as a near-perfect mix of my other favourite releases of Britneys: FEMME FATALE has the lyrical blend of her pop/R&B album 'In The Zone', paired with the grittiness of the electro music from her 'Blackout' album. If you enjoyed either of those albums you'll love this as much as I do.'He About To Lose Me' is a immediate standout as the music to it is the only track not to have dance/eltro overtones and it has the most natural vocals.

B001HN69AY|4.0|First, I have always loved Terry Gilliam as a director, animator and human Being. His humor is unique, his visual style thrilling to say the least. His fights for artistic integrity are now legendery (Book: The Battle for Brazil). He took out a full page ad in Variety in 1984  when Universal head mogul and NON art film fan Sid Sheinberg could not issue a release of Gilliam's 142 minute version of Brazil,  \\" Sid Sheinberg, When are you going to release my movie, Brazil, Terry Gilliam.\\" (this is for real folks, Gilliam pissed off the SUITS who had no idea what his movie was about.) Sid Sheinbetrg went on to complain Brazil had no audience and was too cerebral for the 'average' film goer. Nice thinking Sid. He went on to finance and co-produce two of the WORST films of all-time, the insufferable remake of the Tv series, McHale's Navy , and Sugar and Spice (about cheerleaders who rob a bank) both below one star efforts. His future releases were almost as bad as executive producer. He and Gilliam parted on the worst of terms. Sheinberg in his anger released an 'edited\\" version of Brazil with a 'happy\\" ending that made absoluletly no sense, except to SID, who pissed off Gilliam, and his fans. The CRITERIAN collection of BRAZIL on DVD offers Sid's version along with Gilliams 142 minute version. Sid, the businessman, retired from MCA several years ago having kept them 'in the black\\" and is regarded as a business maven. But his lack of understanding and enthusiasm for an \\"art house\\" film as he called Brazil leads one to wonder why he was EVER in the motion picture business. Well, there I said the EVIL word-BUSINESS. That is ALL a film was to SID-a product to get consumers into a theater. Sid's world view did not encompass self-righteous intellectual twits such as Gilliam.     I mention the above because DR PARNASSUS brings back the visual style reminiscent of Brazil and is co-written by Brazil writer Charles McKeon so there are similarities. This is a very visually appealingfilm (and this is a FILM, not a movie). Unfortunately, his lead actor died at a most inopportune moment, approximately 2/3rds through the film. Some are speculating Gilliam had the script rewritten and INTENDED for three other actors, Depp, Law, and Farrell to replace Ledger. Is anyone sure of this? I know Depp filled in immediately as he is a long-time friend of Gilliam, but I am not sure Gilliam intended for Depp to depart to be replaced by Farrell. Is there conversation of this on the DVD?     This ia good film, it is more personal and less worldly than Brazil. It is more ambitious than some of Gilliam's more recent films and it has some fine acting from the entire cast. Plummer was expected to be great, Tom Waits, you never know, but he was superb. The newcomer (at least I am not familiar with her work) Lily Cole is also outstanding. Ledger and the subsequent versions of Tony also shine. It is the literal meaning and layers of the films subtext that I am not convinced on two viewings are made apparantely clear. With Gilliam, that is partially intended,. so I take it as it is. Four stars, five is someone can sum up the entire films true meaning but I think Gilliam INTENDS for the viewer to make his own personal determinations. One last word, this is not an entirely original thematic or visual style. Just refer to George pal's 1964 great fantasy 'The 7 faces of Dr. Lau,\\" and you will see this film is almost an homage in style. (but certainly not content).  P.S.  I was HOPING for a CAMEO from ex-Python TERRY JONES as the script seemed perfect for JONES, as a Parnassus crowd spectator disguised as a buxom middle-aged hen,   but that was not to be.
B004G600A4|5.0|I was actually not intending to see this movie until a friend of mine told me how great it was...so I relented and bought it on amazon's prebuy.  I'm sooooooooooooo glad I did!  This movie has a fantastic storyline, was cast perfectly, the music is awesome, it's so funny at some parts I laughed out loud, and the animation is unreal (her hair and dress were mesmerizing that they did such a good job).  I can't find anything wrong with it, except that I wished it could go on and on!  :)  Even my husband would rate it as a new favorite.  This is one movie that we don't mind watching over and over and OVER again with our 2-year-old :)
B004NSULHM|2.0|You only have to listen to early albums to hear how far this one falls short. It's not bad. I'm not sure they could make a bad album. But it's totally forgettable. Radiohead had such a distinctive sound that maintaining the sound has taken precedence over venturing into new areas. Thanks for the memories, guys. It would be great to look to the future.

B00475AYJQ|1.0|Like everyone else, loved the first book, waiting patiently for the 2nd, even \\"preordered\\" it.  Get this big giant tome in the mail (ugh) and start reading it.  In the forward, Pat goes on about how all his friends read and re-read and he edited and re-edited over and over and over again, one suspects, almost anally, to get it \\"just right\\".  This activity, I think, turned the book from a live thing into a dead thing.  I'm so upset I spent that money, and I have this giant book lurking on my bed table staring at me and I can't bear to look at it.  I can't even bring myself to resell it on Amazon.  I will just donate it to my fav library and try to \\"let it go\\".  Extreme disappointment.

1935251740|5.0|This is an extraordinary book for individuals with the intellectual skills required to analyze Dr. Lanza's and Dr. Berman's theories, in a logical and open fashion.  I would strongly urge you to first read the book Quantum Enigma by the physicists, Bruce Rosenblum Phd and Fred Kuttner Phd, PRIOR to reading Biocentrism, as it will give you a grounded NO-nonsense description of the \\"quantum strangeness\\" in physics that Dr. Lanza and Dr. Berman are discribing in their book. I especially want to complement Dr. Lanza for his courage in sharing the \\"emotionally difficult\\" stories from his personal life. Both Dr. Lanza and Dr. Berman are highly respected scientists which lends great credabilty to their theories expounded in Biocentrism
B00336G7HI|3.0|I ordered this particular battery as a backup for a DSC-HX1 camera, as Sony's 800-number sales person suggested this was, indeed, the replacement for the original battery...\\"with 15% more capacity.\\"  Apparently that extra 15% makes it just a tad too big for the battery slot in the camera.  I returned this to amazon (very nice process, I must say) and ordered the correct battery.<br /><br />The battery is probably fine for a camcorder, since it doesn't fit into a specific slot, just hangs on the back of the unit.

B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Despite my impatience to see Jonas Kaufmann move into the great Wagner roles, I realise that to rush that process could be fatal to one of the few very great voices singing today and I am delighted by his evident intention to keep his voice still light and flexible enough to sing Mozart, even at this stage of his career. While I do not find that he has the sweetness and \\"ping\\" ideal for Puccini, he is very fine in Verdi and the movement into verismo is not too great a leap. Kaufmann is now forty; his powerful, smoky voice is now presumably at its peak, and while it will never have the juicy resonance of Corelli he is a superb vocal actor who throws himself into his characterisations and utterly convinces the listener of the sincerity with which he inhabits his roles. There is a plaintive as well as a heroic quality to his singing; he has virtually eliminated the glottal, \\"gulping\\" tic - presumably injected for emotive effect - which was beginning to infect his vocal production and he now sings \\"straight\\", relying on tonal colouring and superb control of dynamics. The top B in his \\"Come un bel d&igrave; di maggio\\" is appropriately climactic; he then moves straight into a deeply affecting account of that wonderfully melancholy aria \\"&Egrave; la solita storia\\", using a mesmeric half voice. It is that combination of baritonal heft and restrained delicacy which he can command that makes his voice so moving; he can scale his voice right down to express tenderness then deliver thrilling top A's and B's. It is such a pleasure to hear a singer begin so many arias with due attention to dynamics and subtlety rather than go straight for the \\"can belto shock and awe\\" attack. Thus \\"Dai campi\\" builds properly to the climactic \\"a meditar\\" and is all the better for the contrast Kaufmann engineers between it and the meditative, almost tentative, opening phrases. Similarly, \\"Giunto sul passo estremo\\" is a genuine psychological portrait; I love the way Kaufmann gives the best possible advocacy to Boito's oft-derided music which I so enjoy. He even shows his command of the fabled \\"messa di voce\\" (producing a smooth, swelling crescendo and then a diminuendo on one note) - a bel canto technique almost lost amongst modern singers.<br /><br />The opening track is a surprise: a virtually unknown aria from Zandonai's \\"Giulietta e Romeo\\", a choice typical of a novel, artfully structured programme designed to provide maximum pleasure without recourse to too many old chestnuts - although I suppose no verismo recital would be complete without \\"Vesti la giubba\\", especially when it is delivered as it is here with such passion and artistry. Another novelty is an aria from Ponchielli's \\"I Lituani\\"; not especially original as music, perhaps, but a pleasure to hear. I am also delighted to see Kaufmann's inclusion of Refice's exquisite song \\"Ombra di nube\\", which was made into an immortal gramophone classic by the great Claudia Muzio in one of my favourite recordings. Kaufmann cannot erase memories of her vulnerable, otherworldly poise, but he sings that lovely music with real Innigkeit and actually adopts a \\"new\\" voice of incomparable tenderness for such a large instrument. With \\"Cielo e mar\\" we are back on more familiar Ponchielli territory, and once again Kaufmann rethinks the aria to make it a lesson in restrained, poetic power rather than the usual bombastic bawl. One gem follows another and I amazed by the judicious admixture of intelligence and passion that Kaufmann brings to all the music he sings here. The generous recital concludes with a real belter: the final duet from \\"Andrea Ch&eacute;nier\\", when the lovers declare their undying devotion as they are trundled off to the guillotine. Kaufmann and guest soprano Eva-Marie Westbroek cannot rival Corelli and Stella, or Gigli and Caniglia for that matter, for sheer animal abandon, but it's still a thrilling ride.<br /><br />Pappano's accompaniments are simply superb: great, throbbing waves of sound from thereinvigorated Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia.<br /><br />There are still, perhaps, individual performances of certain arias which I favour over Kaufmann's interpretations here but as a recital disc taken as a whole, it is hard to think of another superior in vocal brilliance, interpretative depth and mature artistry. Kaufmann's voice is virtually - and uncannily at times - indistinguishable from Vickers', who was also criticised for lacking Italianit&agrave; but still carried the day by dint of conviction and sheer force of personality. But I also think that stylistically Kaufmann is just right for this music even if the vocal make-up lacks that Italianate squillo. He just gets better and better.<br /><br />P.S. Contrary to the official Amazon product description, there is no excerpt from \\"Le Villi\\" here - in fact there is no Puccini at all.ademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia.

031261246X|4.0|I'd give this book a solid 3.5 (if I could)    This book has been one of the most technically accurate cyber thrillers I have read.  Much to spite what other \\"security experts\\" might say, the fictional portrayal Mark outlines is not far from the reality of our nations internet security infrastructure.  Mark's experience in this matter makes the story even more gripping in that sense.  I literally stopped reading at one point and hunted for malware on an older computer I have.  Not very many books have ever caused a similar response.    But equally amazing is that Mark makes these technical realities approachable and understandable for even basic computer users.  He makes concepts such as viruses, trojans, and other types of cyber attacks easy to understand.  For those reasons alone this book is worth your time to read, but the book is more than just that.    Mark creates a variety of characters, each relatable to various life circumstances.  I found myself genuinely caring about many of the main characters- which made the final sections of the book very gripping.   The story itself was enjoyable and cohesive.  Additionally, the short chapters of this book made it very easy to keep by the nightstand.  Easy to pick up and put down in short bursts.    I'd have given this book a higher rating, but some things did stand in the way of that.  Though definitely not systemic-- some sentences were awkward to read and hard to grasp.  This was not a major issue, but it was a detractor for me.  I'd say the biggest thing which bothered me was the l33t speak by the main characters in IRC.  While this was awkward to read, it more importantly it felt out of place for the characters themselves.  The two individuals represent themselves as incredibly professional and thoughtful individuals.  Their chat transcripts however looked like early teenagers.  I did not have as much an issue with it when the more youthful hackers wrote that way-- though still awkward to read.    All and all Ithought this was a well done book.  The fact that it's Mark's first makes me hopeful for a second.  I would recommend it to anyone who'd enjoy a fun read with very rich technical content behind it.  Though not as strong in other places, if you enjoy Neal Stephenson and his books you'd likely enjoy this one as well.    * Ironically, as I finished this review one of the computers in the other room rebooted and said, \\"No hard disk available\\"...
B001DD63UO|5.0|I really like this CD.  Boy was Pink mad when she wrote all those songs.  I actually got this Cd for 1 song - \\"Glitter In the Air\\"  gawd is it beautiful.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|At first let me state that I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I loved the film.  However, it looks like they cut corners on the special effects.  There are numerous scenes where it looks like the cgi isn't composited properly.  The colors don't resolve very well on the screen and it looks like the copy is muddy or murky.  I'm told it plays like this in the theater as well so it's not the dvd copy, which I thought at first, but for some reason they skimped on the cgi.  Which seems odd.  It plays like a cheap b-movie on late night television.  What a shame.  Hopefully they've fixed this in part 2.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|I know a lot of people don't like the way the series ended. But I thought it was actually pretty good. I know there are lots of loose ends, but not everything in life can be tied up, can it? I recommend this to anyone who likes the show. Of course, the DVD itself is complete and functions exactly as you'd expect.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|What got me into the whole LOST series was the reaction from the series finale. From the things people liked about it to what people hated about it, I wanted to start watching it, so I could make my own opinion.  What many people made theories and speculations on week after week were the mysteries of the mythology on the island and many weren't satisfied with the conclusion because their own questions weren't answered.  I personally understood and loved the ending, gave a whole meaning to the series of redemption that the island gave the characters, a second chance to become a better person, and live with purpose in your life.  It all depends on what you like, you didn't like the finale? Fine.  But it's not a reason to write off the series all together.
0064407667|5.0|This series is a pleasure to read, the characters are likable and you can sympathize with them (their parents are dead).<br />Also, reading this I learned a lot of new words I didn't even know existed.<br />Keep in mind, the theme in the book gets pretty dark at times.

Unless you want to look at this car with a magnifier, or you're really into 1:24 scale trains and want a great piece to add to your collection, this isn't the car for you.  Diamond Select makes a 1:15 scale set of cars, which is right around 11 inches.  They are much more expensive, but it will look a lot better on display.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Bought these to replace my hdmi when the connection to my roku player stopped working. They are a snug fit and display hd beautifully. These component cables are video only, so you do have to have a optical cable or rca plugs for sound.
B004MKM8L8|4.0|There is not much to add to the movie itself as one can get ample reviews anywhere. So my comments is on this blu-ray disc. The picture is highly detailed, and the surround sound is amazing. The disc has some deleted scenes and a feature on the score compsition. But its pretty basic. If you want the whole works, look for other richer editions. This is good for the casual collector.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is what an app should be. This was the easiest install and functional app I've seen to date. I only had to install and it worked. No tedious setup of parameters, accounts, etc. This gives me the information I need to get a handle on my days. I have many meetings and appointments and all is revealed in meaningful ways. I use the \\"Show text\\" view on the calendar and I have a full screen widget agenda on one of my screens. Excellent app. Highly recommended.

B001UV4XI8|3.0|Digital copy did not work. It offered a software \\"update\\" and disappeared. Next time I ran it, there were no choices left. Digital copy has always sucked. Why can't they get it right? The movie was very good. Nice quality on Blu-ray. If you are thinking of shelling out for the 3-disc set, the DVD version also comes with it. This makes the Digital Copy even more worthless.  The special features disc is Blu-ray, however is a major disappointment. It is not labled at all. I tried it in different players before I discovered it was Blu-ray. There is only about one-half hour of extras on this disc. There are no extras on the DVD. Very sad indeed.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|The fit is great with a bare iPhone.  It seems like a very good bargain - have only worked with it for one day.  It feels like a good, strong spring that clamps the width of the phone and an adjustable slider for the length.  Thickness seems like it would make a good fit with thicker phones.    Works great with Apps that use Time Lapse and Slow Shutter.    It won't stand up when used vertically, like one of the example photos.  It keeps falling over.  It comes with a good enough tripod for horizontal shots, but like someone else wrote, the tripod is easily replaced with whatever favorite you want that uses this standard screw size.    All in all, a very good buy.
B004G6009K|5.0|The blu-ray version is stunning to watch. The plot is good, the characters are nuanced and interesting, and I'd highly recommend this movie.

Her mother pushed her to dance and be a prima ballerina because that was what she wanted for herself when she was younger and Natalie basically cracked under the pressure.  it disturbed me but didn't really entertain me.  I left the theater feeling like I ate the appetizer but not the main course and was still hungry.  It moved dreadfully slow at times but was the kind of movie you stayed in to see what happened.  Too artsy for me I guess.
0385738757|5.0|The Scorch Trials is the second in The Maze Runner series but just so much better than the first book!  It's not even close.  I was bored with parts of The Maze Runner, but this book is all action from page 1 to the last!!  Some new characters appear, but mostly the same main characters that were in The Maze Runner.  I really enjoyed this book--done in a day and a half.  It is hard to put down!  I was a bit confused by the ending, but there is one more book to come in this series.  If you read the first book, you will love this one, but read them in order.  I can't wait to see how all this ends!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Until Business Calendar, I have never been fully satisfied with any of the calendar apps on Android, and I've tried many. They all seem to be either fast but overly-simplified and lacking features, or feature-full, resource hogs and slow, slow, slow.  I finally had resigned myself to using the default HTC Calendar app with its horrible date selection dials copied from iOS, and the inability to change the calendar an appointment belongs to once it has been created. Coming from the world of datebk5 on Palm and Pocket Informant on Windows Mobile, this seemed to me to be less than satisfactory.   Business Calendar changes all that by combining speed with a powerful feature set. Despite its (IMHO) slightly strange name and branding, the Amazon offer and the positive reviews convinced me to give it a go. And I'm glad I did. Definitely would pay full price for this app. It's totally worth it.

0316056863|3.0|I usually ignore celebrity's books, mostly because the celebrity in question is someone unsuited to writing and is known for something else entirely. The only exceptions I can think of are Steve Martin and Woody Allen who have both written funny, clever books and Tina Fey follows this tradition by being an accomplished comedy writer and performer. Plus I'm a big fan of 30 Rock and have enjoyed her recent rise to fame through her impersonation of Sarah Palin and film roles like \\"Date Night\\" and \\"Baby Mama\\". So I had to pick up her book when it came out recently as I thought the essays would be hysterical and clever, and some of them were, but the memoir parts were less interesting.<br /><br />What I realised when reading \\"Bossypants\\" was that I'm not actually that interested in Tina Fey. Sure I wanted to read about her work, but her personal life? It's not that interesting. Besides a horrific incident involving a stranger and a knife when she was a child (an incident she refuses to elaborate upon), she had a normal childhood and her struggles in adolescence and young adulthood mirror her character Liz Lemon's very closely. She basically is Liz Lemon. Except now Tina Fey is a lot more balanced and has a family she adores.<br /><br />Her honeymoon, her daughter, her parents, her in-laws, random thoughts on motherhood and womanhood - they were ok, but to be honest I was bored. Maybe that has something to do with me being a dude. Maybe not. The book is sharply written but lacks the content to hold my attention, and while Fey can tell a story well, the characters in the stories never seem real, they only contain one well defined character - Fey herself.<br /><br />The interesting parts in the book were what I expected - behind the scenes at 30 Rock and the Sarah Palin blitz. The interesting thing about the 30 Rock section was that it focused mostly on the writers, most of whom I'd never heard of, but Fey highlights her writing staff and puts forward their best contributions to the show. Some very funny stuff was showcased. Also we get a Photostat copy of Seth Myers' original script from the first Sarah Palin/Hillary Clinton parody.<br /><br />There were some definite highlights in the book but overall you'd have to be a rabid fan to like everything in the book. For the more casual fan like me, I'd say skip to the 30 Rock/Sarah Palin sections for an interesting read as the rest doesn't hold up to the same interest level.very funny stuff was showcased.

B00004YTZE|5.0|This record, which had a muddy sound back then, has aged surprisingly well. The punch in songs such as Chinese Rocks or Get Off The Phone is surprising. Having seen Thunders live, this is a rather good su of what he sounded like, even quite late in his time with various backing groups. He has had enormous influence on what is to be considered New York rock with his sloppy approach: see for example the Strokes who unfortunately do not have the punch.
0375836675|4.0|Nineteen-year-old Ed Kennedy is an underachieving, underage cab driver. He lives in a shack in the bad part of town with his eat-anything dog The Doorman. He has a bitter mother who swears and criticizes him every chance she can get, and a pack of friends with just as many issues. Ed's also hopelessly in love with his best friend Audrey, who loves no one yet goes from boyfriend to boyfriend. Then there's Marv, proud of his beater car yet is always going on about his thousands while scrimping and penny pinching. Happily unemployed, all Ritchie seems to need for his happiness are their weekly poker games. Ed's life is pretty routine and uninspired until the day he and his friends are at the bank, and he unwittingly stops a robbery. Then the ace arrives with clues to the first mission. The cards keep Ed busy driving around town, finding addresses and visiting people in need of something which Ed himself must define and deliver. He's the messenger, the only one who cares, and diamonds, clubs, spades and hearts later he's still wondering who's sending the cards, and why.    Reading a book by Markus Zusak is a unique reading experience. It's been a few years since I read The Book Thief, and I'd forgotten how uncannily precise he is with words. If you are to read his books for only one reason it would be for his writing alone. Not one word is wasted, and the sharpness of his phrases can literally be cutting. Because Ed is chosen to help those who are beaten, poor, sad, and lonely in his missions, I was struck many times by both the words and the hurt. The words he chooses are simple but the way he uses them is profound. Quite suddenly tears wanted to spill or a smile would burst out of me, the emotion dealt was so high. Sometimes it's the spaces between passages or between words. Zusak is masterful at imbuing words and phrases with meaning through spacing and line changes. You could almost open the book and quote any passage, but here are a few that stuck out:        \\"Whenher hands reached out and poured the tea, it was as if she also poured something into me while I sat there sweating in my cab. It was like she held a string and pulled on it just slightly to open me up. She got in, put a piece of herself inside me, and left again.\\"        \\"Believe it or not - it takes a lot of love to hate you like this.      Everything has its purpose.\\"        \\"Sometimes people are beautiful.      Not in looks.      Not in what they say      Just in what they are.\\"    Strikingly beautiful, eh? With that kind of writing and the humorous and action-packed first chapter I knew I was a goner. But beyond the writing, Ed and his friends are hilarious in the chemistry between them and their shared, shameless lack of ambition. I loved them all and wanted the best for them and the people Ed is called to save. Without taking away from the literary qualities of The Book Thief, which deserves all the praise it receives, I honestly enjoyed I Am the Messenger more. A couple of scenes towards the end left me shaking my head, but otherwise I Am the Messenger is a creative, quirky, outstanding YA novel that will make you laugh, cry and think as only the best books do.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It was great up until the 2.0.4 update and now it won't play anything it only force closes. I hope this gets resolved soon.
B004FOA84A|3.0|this game has great graphics and is fun to play but force closes more than it opens. i hope that this issue gets fixed in an update soon as i really would like to finish the game. i also am giving this 3 stars because i think it would be more fun with a hidden object aspect added in rather than the puzzles only that is currently has.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It's a good app,  but there is a couple of problems,  seems to buffer to much,  and while listening to a local station,  get error, after less than a minute of playing.  saying stream over.  Good app,  but needs some work.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I liked playing this game. Some puzzles were a little challenging, but most were pretty easy to figure out if you've played this type of game before. Got a few force closes,on my Evo and even though I solved the last puzzle (yes, I'm sure I solved it) nothing happened. Still, it was fun. Took me about 45 minutes to play. Glad it was free.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I still prefer jorte to this but its a solid choice for something better than the stock calendar.  Plus 2 words.
0670022411|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  No it is not the next Shakespeare novel but it was well written, engaging and had a good plot.  I think it could be setting up of a series but is a wonderful stand alone book.  It allowed you to reach your own conclusions without handing them to you every 5 minutes.  The character were well developed and true to form.  The dash of history was interesting and helped round out the book.  I passed this book on to others who have enjoyed it also.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|the blu-ray version of \\" summer wars\\" is awsome! great story line! greate anime! if you like stuff from hio miyazaki or the girl who lept through time or tokyo godfathers, paprika then you will love this!
B0000640VO|5.0|Many films are called \\"quirky\\" but few of them live up to the honor. THIS is a quirky wonderful sumptuous lovely film that leaves me unable to do a just review in this limited space. Audrey Tatou is a darling, the cast of characters is divine, the opening is great fun, and although the story might be somewhat predictable it's so much fun to go there that the predictability is a bonus (no surprise sad endings). The only down side is that I can't find another movie to follow it up. Watch and enjoy!
0143105566|5.0|The late Graham Greene (1904-1991) surely is in the top-3 list of best writers not to have won the Noble Prize for Literature.   In 2008, Irish author Colm Tóibín wrote a helpful Introduction to this new edition of Graham Greene's 1978 masterpiece in the awesome Penguin Classics series. He put a number of issues in perspective, confirming that Graham Greene (GG) had a boring, eventless intelligence career during and after WW II, and of his use of lots of autobiographic material in this book.   This spy novel offers no major violence, nor the use of advanced technology or weaponry. Readers pining for brutal action may find it boring, like some of John Le Carré (JLC)'s books. But GG and JLC converge and differ in their treatment of espionage practitioners: Both favor what Americans call HUMINT (human intelligence) over technology as the prime source of intelligence gathering. Both are quite candid and flippant about the importance of class in intelligence circles. But where JLC roots out moles, GG's main protagonist Maurice Castle ís one.   He is a 62-year old veteran in espionage, fully aware of bugged rooms and telephones and all the tricks of his trade. As a British diplomat he fled South Africa around 1970. Ever since, he has worked in London as a lowly intelligence officer. Until a security probe about leaks from his section coincides with the visit of the SA security man who prompted his flight...   Plot-wise and in terms the of quality of writing, \\"The Human Factor\\" remains an absolute stunner, full of fear, doubt, loneliness and subterfuge. Great plot, great atmosphere and superlative writing.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I will not get quite as lengthy as other posts, however, I will say that this sequel was an intense, exciting and magical novel. I was completely riveted and I believe the different levels of storyline was brilliant. I read another persons review about it being messy. I don't agree at all. It was coherent, it was extremely detailed and thought provoking. A lot of the parts of the book reflected on an early section of the story and if you missed the connection then it is easy to get lost. However, if you are looking for hidden meanings and pieces to a larger puzzle then you will not be disappointed. I am already waiting for the next book with impatient anticipation... but will probably read them both all over again. Kvothe has become one of my most favorite characters.

0879309210|5.0|I've been playing guitar for about 8 years now,ever since I was 14 years old.I am self taught, and because of that I never really learned how to maintain good care for my guitars. I never understood why my guitar was doing this and why this was breaking,I just blamed the manufacturer. Until I bought this book I learned so much,and realized it was not the manufacturer's fault,it was mine. Through this book I learned how to properly put on strings,set-up my guitar,clean my guitar,change pick-ups,etc.<br /><br />I 100% recommend this book,its just a handy tool that all guitarist and bassist should have in order to have their guitars in tip-top shape.<br /><br />PS. I got the 2 day shipping,and got the book one day earlier,isn't that great?Amazon did a great job with S&H.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|you probably know the basic plot of the movie.  A writer rents a remote cabin in the woods to write her novel.  Several local gas station workers learn of her location and surprise her one night, brutually raping her.<br /><br />I was interested in seeing how effective the movie would be post-rape scene.  It was well done.  Jennifer's \\"revenge\\" scenes on the thugs that raped her were scary and effective.  It was good to see \\"justice being served\\".<br /><br />I didn't see the original film, so I can't compare this film to the first one.  This is not so much a horror film as it is a tense, violent film about revenge.

030746363X|5.0|The 4 hour body is a great book.  The slow carb diet is easy and uncomplicated.  It really works if you stick to the plan and don't eat too many of the domino foods.  And, it stopped all my cravings for SUGAR and CARBS.  The cheat days work too.  You really can eat 5,000 to 6,000 calories on your cheat day and lose the weight gain in a couple of days.  The diet works if you follow the diet exactly.  It isn't hard to stick to either.  It is well balanced so you don't have cravings and if you do, you can eat it on your cheat day.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|i noticed in reading some of these reviews that most people did not get how the main character's (portman) breakdown parallels the swan lake story. the acting was superb, but i thought after a few viewings that the story was too simple, there wasn't enough to it. for people who like psychological movies the final denouement is a sort of let down. it is a bit hard to believe someone so shy and easy going and even fragile could really make it in the ballet world. i recommend renting this movie, it is definitely worth watching too bad the story is so weak.
142314189X|4.0|Even if you haven't read it, I'm sure you heard of it. Whether you hear it from a family member or a co-worker or you just saw the movie. (Which wasn't that good by the way) Now it's time for me to get started.<br /><br />Percy Jackson & the Olympians is a solid, five part series. It brings Greek myths and gods to life, and shows you the unique way of Greek life. The myths and stuff definitely entertain you.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief (2005) Is the first in the series. It's 375 pages of mixed action, mystery, and adventure. It blends those beautifully. Percy Jackson (The series main character) has to test his limits in the end of this one by fighting a god! The Lightning Thief starts off the five part series. All in all, it's a solid first book.<br /><br />The Sea of Monsters (2006) Is much shorter than it's predecessor, being 279 pages it is actually the shortest in the series. The sequel to The Lightning Thief introduces several more characters such as Tyson. They also have to find old ones.... This one ends on a cliffhanger that will change the main characters lives, forever!<br /><br />The Titan's Curse (2007) Is the third adventure in the series. It has 312 pages in it, so it was longer than the second novel.  It resolves the second book's cliffhanger. It introduces two new half bloods and Thalia makes a decision in the end that changes her life forever. In this book, sadly, two of the characters doesn't make it to the end.... alive.<br /><br />The Battle of the Labyrinth (2008) The fourth novel in the series is packed with 361 pages of action. In this one Percy and his friends travel into Daedalus's Labyrinth to stop an army from destroying their beloved Camp Half Blood. Along the way Grover gets closer to discovering were Pan (The nature god) is. Percy also has to stop the Titan lord Kronos (The series's antagonist) from coming back to life. This one also ends on a cliffhanger, and sets up the storyline for the fifth, and final novel.<br /><br />The LastOlympian (2009) Is 381 pages of pure battle! It's very warlike as Percy has to stop the Titan Lord Kronos from making it to Olympus, and destroying it. The hard part: The Gods aren't there to help them. In this stunning fifth and final novel, the half bloods try to save the gods from being destroyed, and try to prevent the reign of the Titans. In the end, the true hero is revealed. The one that saves Olympus. But in order to save the Gods, the hero must sacrifice his life. This one may make you cry in the end.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this book series was pretty good. Rick Riordan (The author) also released a book not covered in my review entitled: Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Demigod Files. It contains three short stories and interviews with characters.<br /><br />In short, this is a really good book series.
B002ZG981E|5.0|i just love this movie soooo much. it is a very intricate complex movie with so many different layers and a new discovery every time i watch it. saw it in the theater it was beautiful. bought the bluray it is beautiful also. everything about this movie is perfect: the acting, the story, the music and the cinematography.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Before you go ahead and start criticizing this movie, you have to realize something: This is a adaptation of a book, so of COURSE the books gonna be better, and it ALWAYS is. I don't think I have watched a single adaptation of a book that has been BETTER than the book.  I mean, yeah they could've done A LOT better, but remember, they have to change the storyline from the book so you don't know what's gonna happen. But maybe they stayed CLOSER to the actual storyline.  They kinda messed it up if they are going to make Sequels (Which they are) and I have a couple reasons why.  1. They made Hades the bad guy instead of Kronos.   2. Luke died or something...     I was disappointed that they left out the fight with Ares. That was one of my favorite parts of the book. Maybe next time they will actually READ the book so they know what to do.  But, knowing Hollywood, they will probably mess it up.
6304712499|3.0|The special effects were so-so, this was a movie that could really have used a lot of CGI help.  But, John Leguzamo's performance saved this bland outing.  His hilarious low brow humor, perverse, obnoxious, evil clown was just terrific.  His performance made this bland production watchable. Very few actors can save a movie, the only other one I can think of is Gary Oldman, he's terrific also. Like I said John stole this picture.
B002EWD0I6|4.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is an entertaining period piece with a balance of subtle humor, deft characterizations, and personal drama.  The characters sell the stories, which typically involve the small details of life in the small farming community of Lark Rise and the larger town of Candleford.  The cast is excellent, the sets are lush (if unrealistic), and overall it is a fun glimpse of changing times.  Well worth viewing.

B002ZG99QS|3.0|The highlight of Tron: Legacy (2010) is the soundtrack by Daft Punk.  It's the main reason to watch this movie, in my opinion.  This movie's visually stunning special effects take center stage.  The movie can be hard to follow at first, but I think multiple viewings will help if you didn't fully understand the story the first time around.  This movie is a sequel to the original Tron (1982).  Both movies have state-of-the-art special effects for the time periods they were released.<br /><br />Usually one can expect wooden acting in a high tech science fiction movie of this type, but the acting, though a little wooden at times, is not bad overall.  Jeff Bridges was made to look much younger (through computer enhancement) in this movie than he actually is.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good movie that I recommend.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I struggle finding words to describe the listening experience received from this work of art. Every album Foo Fighters have released has been extraordinary, each passing its predecessor in some way (with the exception of One by One, which the band even expressed frustration toward). After Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace surfaced, I quickly concluded the impossibility of outdoing that album. Once again, I was proved wrong.<br /><br />All of these songs pass into a new realm of songwriting for these guys - several intertwined melodic guitars, roaring drums (Taylor really showcases his drumming). Nate FINALLY begins getting a little off the chart on bass, moving the lines up and down. And do I even have to comment on Grohl's vocals? I didn't think so.<br /><br />I have had this disc in my vehicle ever since the day I received it via mail, and I drive A LOT. I've undoubtedly listened through it a minimum of 25 times, and I still find something new every listen.<br /><br />This is a must for any rock n' roll music listener. GET THIS DAMN ALBUM!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a handy tool. Its well designed, compact, well made and does a good job at general knife sharpening (both straight and serrated edges). It would work on anything you throw at it if its not too heavy duty. Anyone who hikes, camps, fishes, hunts, ect needs one of these. It is very easy to use and is overall a great product. Buy one or even two and you wont regret it!
1400052181|5.0|After reading Little Bee (that's for another review), I made a conscious choice to no longer read books by White authors speaking in Black voices...but I'm a sucker for hype. I picked up this book in Costco because I kept seeing it everywhere. I appreciate that in the beginning the author states that she will write people (particularly Deborah Lacks)in their own voice because it's authentic to them. I was sometimes annoyed at the simpleness in Deborah's words, but knowing people from Baltimore and that Deborah only had an 8th grade education, I could accept that it was her voice. This book was compelling and fascinating to me due to the careful attention to detail, and that the story rings true yet is told in an evenhanded manner. I absolutely believe a man calling himself \\"Dr. Sir..\\" tried to swindle the Lacks. I absolutely believe Dr. Gey didn't think he needed consent for Henrietta's cells. I absolutely believe Deborah's elementary understanding of science and genetics. At the conclusion of the the book, I was not left swayed on way or the other about right vs. wrong, rather I was left questioning what I believe should be ethical. A good book makes you think and this book did that.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|This is something I never really saw in any of the reviews I read before purchasing this.  And I guess if you are running, you might not run into this issue ever.  But, if you do multi-sport training and fitness, the placement of the buttons on the right side of the bezel (not the bezel itself - which is another issue well documented) are in the way.  For instance - doing P90X or just push ups, yoga, etc..if you bend your wrist back (as you do during a pushup) the hard buttons will get pressed - this will stop the timer of your workout, or unlock the faulty bezel (which locks and unlocks when you push both buttons on the right side) - I think Garmin figured this out, as some of the newer models have a more squared off, less protruding button that seems like it would be less prone to this issue.  The HRM feature works really well, although occasionally I'll get a dropped reading (may need to tighten the strap), and the GPS, as you would expect from Garmin, has worked flawless.  I dont dive into the advanced features as much, but I do upload all of my data to Garmin Connect, which is great - but I wish they'd let you customize some of the categories - instead of assuming they have them all covered - because they dont.  Overall, a great HRM with a couple of big problems with how I use it.  If you're a runner - besides the flakey bezel - you'll likely love it!
B002ZG997M|1.0|For starters, this film has an excessive amount of product placement in it.  Yes, you read that right.  They use brand name objects for advertisement in a film about the apocalypse.  From Ipod to Dr. Dre Beats headphones, there's plenty of shots of how long lasting these items last in the event of human downfall.<br /><br />This brings me to my next point.  What causes this apocalyptic period is completely ignored and is only hinted at throughout the film.  They ignore the setting and causes yet the setting itself is trite and unoriginal.  However, they do hint at what causes this era, but this leads to by far the greatest flaw of this garbage film.<br /><br />The film has such an obvious religious message of Christianity and that by turning away from God and the Bible our society may fall apart in such a fashion as presented in the film.  Spoiler alert: Eli is looking for someone to deliver the Bible to preserve it and feels it can help reestablish society.  Did I need a spoiler alert for that though?  It's so obvious he's referring to the Bible.  Anyway, Eli is meant to be some righteous, god-fearing man, yet he completely contradicts the teachings of his precious Bible.  In the opening scene, he allows a woman to be gang raped because his secrecy and mission is a greater good.  There's no way in hell that Jesus would do something like this nor advocate his actions.  Jesus' ethics were not utilitarian.  Eli's actions are.  The film and the Hughes brothers think they're being subtle and coy with this religious message but it's beyond obvious and feels like they're trying to beat you over the head with their message.  Even then, it seems like they don't know their religion well enough.  They take a more Old Testament route with Eli's character, as well ignore that ethics themselves don't come from God, they misplace and overestimate the value of the Bible to society.  The film just comes off as nearly having an evangelical Christian taint I felt.<br /><br />Denzel's performance is one of the worst in his career as well.  He's a great actor, but maybe it was due to the Hughes brothers' direction (more likely).  It's completely one-note, dull, and plain unlikable.<br /><br />The final major flaw (nearly tied for the worst attribute of the film) is its ending.  They give us another horrible twist that rivals M. Night Shymalan for how bad it is.  It turns out all along Eli is blind!  Oooh!  >_>  As if the film couldn't get any worse, they made Eli blind simply to shock us into wondering how he could've done all the cool (ie crappy) action moves and how he memorized/interpreted the Bible (I think he had a copy in braile) for nothing more than a plot device that seemed only to please fans of The Village or Unbreakable.<br /><br />The ONE positive of this film is Gary Oldman.  The guy is a chameleon and always knows how to make a character come alive.  He makes you really hate and somehow love his character because he's brilliantly devious.  This is due in part to the Hughes brothers too as much as I hate to say it.  They made a character who knows what the Bible can do to people and how it can be used to control the masses.  This was the best thing the film had going for it.<br /><br />I didn't even scratch the surface though on other poor aspects like the action sequences, its Waterworld-like set and costume design (who seriously rips off Waterworld for anything??), the terrible character Milas Kunis has (who takes Eli's reigns after Eli dies at the end for no important reason other than to make simple people feel sad), and its unfitting soundtrack.<br /><br />Seriously, this film is horrible.the worst in his career as well.

B002ZG9800|5.0|I Love You, Phillip Morris is the directorial debut of screenwriters John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, who are best known for penning the screenplay to Bad Santa. This film is based on a true story and a book by Steve McVicker that details the exploits of conman Steven Jay Russell. This film is a great example of the idea that truth is stranger than fiction, as many of Steven's cons are outlandish and seemingly exaggerated. Some have rejected the film due to the implausibility of it. If the events here were fictional, it would work against the film. The film opens with \\"This really happened...It really did\\" and despite how over-the-top and unbelievable much of the film seems, it sticks remarkably close to the facts and makes the proceedings even more fascinating.    Jim Carrey plays Steven Jay Russell, who finds out at a young age that he's adopted. Steven goes on to become a small-town police officer with a wife (Leslie Mann) and a young daughter. Quitting the force and moving from Georgia to Texas, Steven decides to come out as gay after a car accident and leaves his wife to move to Florida and live his life the way he wants. Not long after, Steven ends up in prison where he meets Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor) and falls in love. I don't want to reveal any more of the plot, because it unfolds in some surprising and hysterical ways.     The screenplay by Requa and Ficarra is terrific, finding a perfect balance of exaggerated humor and genuine emotion. The love story between Steven and Phillip is handled remarkably well for this type of film and is actually rather poignant despite being played for laughs. The two also show skill as directors of both comedy and drama. The film is funny, but it has well-played and effective dramatic elements that never get too heavy. Finding the right tone to tell a complicated story like this isn't easy, but they found exactly how to do it and have succeeded admirably. Nick Urata's simple, but memorable score compliments the tone of thefilm perfectly. Furthermore, even when dealing with the absurdity of everything they bring a remarkable truthfulness to the story. Steven's wife Debbie is shown to be a sweet, but extremely religious woman, yet they never allow her to become a caricature and show her to be supportive of Steven even after he reveals his sexual orientation to her.     I Love You, Phillip Morris is not a typical laugh-a-minute Carrey film, but good comedy is not about how much you laugh but about achieving a particular comedic tone, maintaining it, and seeing it through successfully. I assure you that this film does that quite well. It's one of Carrey's best films and, while it's not immediately apparent, it's one of Carrey's most intricate and eclectic performances in how it achieves a perfect balance of over-the-top comedic energy and grounded pathos. McGregor plays Phillip in a way that makes no secret of his homosexuality due to the voice and mannerisms, yet he's not playing a gay stereotype. It's a sensitive, believable performance that is also intensely likable. Quite simply, the two leads give much better performances than necessary for this type of film.    There's an unsung hero in this film that I've noticed is largely unmentioned by reviewers of this film and that is Cleavon, played by newcomer Michael Mandel. I found Cleavon, a black inmate whose \\"word is his [expletive] bond,\\" to be one of the funniest people in the film. He doesn't have a large role and his funniest scene with his funniest lines occurs offscreen. Despite this, he had me in stitches. I want to see this guy pop up in more films. I Love You, Phillip Morris was delayed endlessly before finally receiving a very limited release. Does it tackle subject matter typical of what's played in mainstream theatres? No, but considering it's so much better, in so many ways, from many blockbuster Hollywood comedies that are simple cash-ins, it's a travesty this film wasn't given the chance for a wider audience.     GRADE:A-
B0006GANOQ|4.0|Keanu Reeves is as wooden as the desk my keyboard rests on, and he has about as much range as a slug on an ice cube, but in the case of SPEED I could not possibly care less.  Paired with the feisty, super cute Sandra Bullock, and pitted against Dennis Hopper, who is as good as it gets as an uber villain, Keanu is surprisingly palatable (if not totally forgettable) in SPEED, one of the best high octane action films on the planet.<br /><br />Yes, we're all familiar with the plot:  when SWAT cop Jack Traven (Reeves) and his partner, Harry (Jeff Daniels), foil a terrorist/ransom plot at an LA high rise, maniacal villain Howard Payne (Hopper) reacts worse than the proverbial woman scorned.  He rigs a city transport bus with explosives, then activates the bomb once it's in motion; if the bus ever slows below 50 mph, it's curtains for those unfortunates on board.  Of course, good ol' Jack delivers himself for the rescue (via a commandeered convertible, of course) and, aided by Bullock's bewildered character, who takes over when the bus driver is shot, this ADD thriller really starts to move.  Is all of it over the top, with most of Reeves's action sequences in the cartoon realm?  And is the ending so silly and disbelieving the viewer is chuckling at the zaniness?  Absolutely, but who cares?  SPEED is a white knuckler thriller that will have you turning somersaults from your couch.  If you haven't seen SPEED, you're way overdue for a grand roller coaster ride.  Just make sure your heart meds are on hand.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" is the final book in the Hunger Games Trilogy, and I thought the conclusion was a bit disappointing after the buildup in the first two books.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was with Katniss' character where I felt she betrayed her true motivation.  There is a crucial scene near the end of the book, which I will not spoil here, where it feels like she completely betrays her reason for fighting in the 74th Hunger Games, and her reason for ultimately becoming the Mockingjay for the rebellion.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the way the love triangle between Katniss, Gale, and Peeta is resolved in this book because it seems almost a non-issue for a big part of book of 3.  When it us finally resolved, it seemed a bit hurried and artificial to me.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the series, and I thought the first book was the best.

030726999X|5.0|What else can be said, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest, is a great book. I brings the series to a very comfortable end. I say this because, if your ordering this book you know how the other two end.  Steig Larsson did a wonderful job taking us through to the conclusion.<br /><br />As far as the product. the book was in perfect condition. I could not have asked for a better deal.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I love this movie!  I think that the way that John Smith is portrayed by Mel Gibson makes him a great character.  I also enjoy how Pocahontas wants peace between the Indians and the English Settlers.  I think that if Disney can make movies based on Mulan and Pocahontas's stories, they can do Sacajawea, Thomas Edison and other real historical heroes and heroines!

B004KPX4W2|1.0|OK Movie as it didn't cost me anything as it was a promotional gift. I picked the HD version thinking I would get great picture & audio similar to our satellite PPV's and was very disappointed. They still have allot of bugs to fix with streaming internet movies before I would consider purchasing any. I have all high end equipment and enjoy using it's abilities as it intended to be used. It is recommended that you have a 10MB connection to take advantage of the higher quality audio & video and the fasted available in my area is 6MB that I have. I'm not sure having and or paying for the 10MB would make since as there are many ways to watch PPV movies that offer much better quality & $$$ value.

0307477479|3.0|I agree with many reviewers here that Jennifer Egan's, \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad\\", wasn't Pulitzer-worthy (the last time I agreed with the Pulitzer for Fiction was when Richard Russo got it for \\"Empire Falls\\") and I agree that the Power Point chapter was lame, but I didn't loath the novel as much as many did.<br /><br />I enjoy the structure of related short stories or vignettes and the time-shifting. It's worked well in many books and movies (\\"Crash\\" comes to mind). It gives us insight into characters from various points of view; through other characters and at different times in their lives.<br /><br />But it was the last chapter, set in the near future, that really intrigued me. Egan's future was believable, thought-provoking and defensible based on present trends. Loved the concept of babies being \\"pointers\\", and I was also very amused at the list of words that would be archaic.<br /><br />While it wasn't my favorite book of the year, I'm glad I read it and it was certainly worth the price of the paperback.
1416972242|5.0|The City of Ashes is the second book in The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare, and follows City of Bone. Once again Clare draws you into the Shadow World as we follow the continuing story of Jace, Clary, Simon, Alex, Isabelle, Magnus Bane, and a few others. Now that the Clave and everyone else officially know that Valentine is NOT dead and is indeed back and wreaking havoc on the world they are trying to figure out what to do and how to stop him. Valentine already has one of the 3 Mortal Instruments--the Mortal Cup--and no one knows that he is going to do with it. Is he going to go after the Mortal Sword and the Mirror (no one is sure where it is anyway)? Or is he going to content himself with creating a Shadowhunter army from mundane children (never mind that many of them will die in the process) and wait until they are older to attack? Will he try to re-claim his children? There are so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Also throw into the mix that Jace is now struggling with his identity after finding out he isn't Jace Wayland after all. He is Jonathan (Jace) Morgenstern, Valentine's son and Clary's brother, and his loyalties to his adoptive family and the Clave are now being held in question. He might even be put on trial just because they can't catch his father! What are Jace and Clary going to do?<br /><br />Needless to say, the book keeps you guessing and in suspense the whole time. By the end of the book you have more questions than you have answers but it is the perfect set-up for it's sequel, City of Glass. If you love fantasy and fiction you will love the Mortal Instruments Series. The City of Ashes is a strong sequel that stands on it's own two feet and keeps the story line interesting. I strongly recommend City of Ashes to anyone who enjoys Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Charlie Bone, or other fantasy fiction series.

0439023513|5.0|It's always hard when a series you really enjoy comes to an end.  I LOVED the first two books and could not wait to see how the author could bring this story to a satisfying conclusion.  I was not disappointed.  Katniss must learn to accept her place in the world and what she represents through her courage, determination and instincts for survival.  For me, a sign of a good book is when I find myself emotionally involved... and I found myself frustrated and angry over everything that was happening -- everyone had ulterior motives and you could never really know who to trust.  While I was sad about the way certain parts of the story ended, it is understandable given that Collins does not shy away from the violence and the haunting aftereffects of the experience of the Hunger Games.  I only wish there was more of Peeta, who was missing for the first third of the book.  While Gale was probably better suited for the old, pre-Hunger Games version of Katniss, Peeta is one of the few who could really understand how and why Katniss changed and they had a better chance of coping together than Haymitch ever had.

B001GCUO5W|5.0|What makes films like SHUTTER ISLAND so exceptional is that perfect blend of subject matter, imagery, music, settings.  The combination of all these different elements makes these films memorable and sets them apart from the films you see and forget about almost immediately.  SHUTTER ISLAND, like THE SHINING, APOCALYPSE NOW, THE GHOST WRITER, THE GODFATHER, AMADEUS, THE EXORCIST, EYES WIDE SHUT, 2001, VERTIGO, to name only a few, keep haunting you afterward, and I think this is because they have, above all, atmosphere.  A strong premise, great acting, unique sets, compelling image and sound, but in particular an original approach by cleverly combining all the tools of the craft to create that strong atmosphere makes these films so much more.  Take, for instance, the use of music in SHUTTER ISLAND.  It's brilliant.  Every time I listen to the soundtrack now (just take the menacing Penderecki piece - Passacaglia) I want to see the film again.  This isn't always the case, and when it happens I know it's a film that may only get better with more viewings, even though you know how it ends.  Take, also, the sets:  the use of the madhouse, the island, the lighthouse.  Again, Scorsese has created something special by paying attention to every detail (weather - the storm!), and made the sort of film you escape into for a couple of hours and which afterwards feels like a memory of something you truly experienced, whether scary, blissful, exhilarating, disturbing.  I think this is because these films grab you not only on a conscious level but also on the subconscious one. Splendidly executed!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|My kids are utterly delighted to have this film.  It is full of puns, pokes fun at modern living from a kids' perspective, has strange characters with great voices, and is visually spectacular.  The film is about a bee, Barry, who wants something more than just accepting a job in the hive and working himself to death.  He goes out seeking adventure, only to have a near-death experience during which he befriends a human, breaking bee law by letting her know he can talk.  His parents, much as in The Graduate, want him to choose a job, until he goes on a crusade to end human exploitation of bees for honey.  To fight, he sues the multi-national food group that owns the bees, but upon winning realises has upset the ecological balance when the bees stop working with all the honey they get back.  In the end, after a strange adventure, he sets things right.<br /><br />If this sounds rather, well, inane, it is.  This is one of those films that adults can play and that delight kids, but doesn't have much of a level that adults can enjoy, like we can for the muppets.  At least for me, this was a film I could tolerate but would never put on myself.  I am glad my kids enjoy it and wish I did as well.<br /><br />Recommended as a good kids' movie.

It is truly character driven and is written with such loving care for the fate of the characters that this book is nearly impossible to put down.

0307477479|4.0|Music as a metaphor for the ebb and flow of life is a fairly common strategy in literature. But rarely is it employed with such hipness and fun as it is in Jennifer Egan's 2011 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel A Visit From The Goon Squad. To drive home this music-as-metaphor notion, near the end of the novel, a character explains: \\"Hey Dad, there's a partial silence at the of 'Fly Like An Eagle,' with a sort of rushing sound in the background that I think is supposed to be the wind, or maybe time rushing past!\\"<br /><br />In fact, the passage of time is the real rub in this series of 13 interconnected stories featuring several recurring characters. \\"'Time's a goon, right? You gonna let that goon push you around?'\\" an aging music producer named Bennie tells an aging guitarist who is hesitant to play a show. Bennie, who owns a record label, and his assistant, Sasha, are really the two main characters. The novel goes back and forth in time explaining both their successes and failures. Sasha is a kleptomaniac with a checkered past -- as a teenager, she'd run away with (you guessed it!) a musician, and supported herself by stealing, among other socially frowned-upon activities, in Naples. And Bennie struggles to come to terms with middle age and a failed marriage.<br /><br />The crescendo and diminuendo of Bennie and Sasha's lives, mixed with those of several related characters, is what makes up the meat of the book. As time marches on, and mistakes are made, are the characters able to redeem themselves? And if so, how? And if so, is that redemption authentic?<br /><br />The characters' quests for authenticity, whether real or not, is another one of the more fascinating themes of the novel -- an appropriate theme for a novel about the music business, don't you think? One of the stories chronicles Bennie's high school days (from the perspective of a female friend named Rhea who happens to have a crush on him) in the late '70s in San Francisco. Bennie and his friends -- mostly from upper class families  -- fancy themselves punks, but Rhea acknowledges that even with the green hair and dog collars, nothing is real until they leave their parents' houses and join the real world. Another story deals with a PR specialist who tries to rebuild a murderous general's reputation by hooking him up with a famous actress. And finally, the last story has a blogger (though in a futuristic way -- because it's the year 2021) paying other bloggers to write nice things about a musician desperately in need of a big break.<br /><br />Egan tells these stories in different voices and with different methods -- one of my favorites is a faux magazine article, the tone of which bears more than a passing resemblance to a David Foster Wallace piece. There's also a story told in shapes that resemble PowerPoint slides -- that story itself isn't as interesting as many of the others, but the form and ingenuity is, and this is where the music-as-metaphor theme is driven home in that the character Lincoln is obsessed with pause in classic rock songs.<br /><br />This is a novel (four stars from me) much deserving of its Pulitzer  -- and on a related note, it's awesome reading a Pulitzer-winner that's not a stuffy, too-literary trudge.

B003VANOFY|5.0|About a year ago I purchased Logitech G35, after looking at wireless headphones vs 7.1 surround sound vs others, and couldnt find a headset that incorporated everything. Then out came these bad boys. The G930's are literally everything the G35 is, but wireless, with more software features, a tad bit more comfortable, and (somehow) lighter as well. Build quality is solid, I don't feel like I will break them from normal use, or the occasional drop. Haven't run them long enough to comment on battery life. Range is great, I can walk out my dorm room, down the hallway, around a couple corners and it sounds perfect save for a few crackling/digital noise interruptions. But since everything in here is either concrete or steel, it went farther than I expected.   On shipping speed, lets just say this. I ordered these 10pm-ish one night, selected free two day shipping (yay prime!) and they got here at 9:22 the next morning. Couldn't be more happier with amazon OR with these headphones.

0307477479|4.0|I picked up A Visit from the Goon Squad about 6 months ago and it sat in my bag literally crossing several continents before I picked it up and started reading it a few days after it won the Pulitzer.  How glad I am that I took the plunge.  The book is really in my opinion a set of connected short stories as opposed to a full blown novel.  All of the stories connect with one another in a very loose way through two characters--Bennie Salazar an old music industry guy, and Sasha--his assistant.  You are introduced to 20 or more characters who play a role in their lives somehow.  If you were looking for a description I would have to say \\"raw\\" best fits.  It is simply a description of characters at their rawest moments. Great language. Great dialogue. Totally understand why it was named a NY Times Notable Book of 2010.
B0002F1CO6|5.0|This is different from most Ayreon projects in that it is not a rock-opera format. There is no story nor is there any characters per'se. There is an over-lying arc or theme in that a person takes a journey through the past in a sort of reincarnation generator, hop-scotching back in time, awakening in whatever body they occupied back then, and as luck would have it, they are usually involved in a bit of eventful history. There are different singers involved in each song and each song is its own stand-alone entity, independant of the other songs, so this is indeed more of a theme album, not so much a concept or opera as there is no dialog or narative, THANK GOODNESS! I have yet to appreciate Lucassen's operas, and this is after giving attempts at three different projects. Both discs are this way and all the better for it IMO.     I agree, The Flight of The Migrator is a bit sketchy as far as the writing and performances go, but there are some good songs to hear. Bruce Dickanson's turn in The Black Hole sort of predicts the direction Iron Maiden was headed their last few albums and Russel Allen's Dawn Of A Million Souls is a keeper as well. This is the album of blistering guitar solos and keyboard bombast one might expect from Lucassen. Albeit, one might walk away from this album not remembering any specific song as save for the few I mentioned, this material is a tad cliched.    The first disc however, The Dream Sequencer, is a genre defying gem, though some might put a few off since the guitar pyrotechnics is a subdued. The keys are more emphasized here, but then again, they're tastfully done. Much of this album comes across as sort of new-age metal, where what guitar that is there is an accessory and the emphasis is on mood and atmosphere ala older Floyd. Imagine an Andreas Vollenweider album with David Gilmour playing lead guitar. A testament to Lucassen's talent as a producer/arranger, each of these songs plays to the strengths of the singers - none of these performances would be out of place on the individual's own projects. The same can't be said of disc 2, where the vocals either don't fit, or aren't up to the task of the material.     The Dream Sequencer is an album I manage to play at least once a month. I just never get tired of it. Song-craft definitely took precendence over performance on this one and it shows in the quality of the songs. While the theme of the album explains the songs in a way, there is no storyline to reconcile and that to me is also a good thing. A collection of great songs and performances triumphs over concept any old day. A truely unique effort. This album makes me wish that Lucassen would branch out and take his talents into the world of new-age or fusion jazz.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Simply put every adult in the free world should watch this.  The film provides a clear and easily understood description of WHO, WHAT and HOW the world's economy was driven off a cliff.  The greed is maddening, the acts of pure self interest revolting and the lack of any substantive action from those in government who are there to protect and serve will cause you to say 'what are they doing about it and answer yourself nothing'

B00081912E|5.0|This movie is one of those you have to watch late at night with a ton of soda and snacks and friends. It's butt-gusting (sorry, gut-busting) humor and a delivery of cheesy lines in a way only Jim Carrey could pull off. It's not a movie for everybody, though-there are many who will dismiss it as ridiculous. But hey, Jim won a Golden Globe for this performance: give it a shot!
B00164GDA0|5.0|I'm sure I,m not alone in my opinion of this movie, but it is just a very realistic portrayal of what life would/ could be like back in the day it was set in. Back then a day was not spent on the couch playing video games or on the computer gaming or surfing the internet. 4 boys doing what they did wouldn't be unusual at all, except for finding a body! I dont mind watching this movie every once in a while because it is so good!
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|I'll start off by saying that this album is a BIG improvement from Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip.  Those two albums were disappointing mostly because Brian's voice didn't sound very good AND there was too much repitition in the songs.  On Black Ice, Brian's voice has miraculously improved, and makes a huge difference in the enjoyment of the songs.  It seems like he had throat surgery or something, because he sounds the same as he did in the mid-80's.    If you were disappointed in Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, and gave up on these guys, I urge you to give 'em another shot with Black Ice.  That's what i did, and I'm so glad I did!

I am very happy I did because not only are there some good illustrations on basic wire wrap techniques , but there are also some imstructions on basic beading patterns such as peyote stitch.   I find that the combination of beaded beads and wire can be quite striking in a design.   Many of the designs in the book can also easily be changed or brought up a level with just a few minor changes if needed.   Overall this is a very useful addition to my library which I do not regret having purchased.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have had this player for a month now. The shipping by the seller and communication was top notch.  The Good:  Once received I filled a 4 gig SDHC card. Once done I put it in the player and plugged it into the car. The user interface was simple and easy to figure out. There is a Soundfly youtube video that will run you through the functions. A+  Setting it to a channel is easy by first running through your area radio channels and finding one that does not have to many overlaps or that is quiet. Once you find that all you have to do is change the transmitter of the Soundfly to that channel. Select, hit play and your off.  This transmitter is pretty strong and so far I have not had any channels interrupt it while I have been playing it.  The reception of this unit through your radio is not CD quality but if you have a few settings on your radio it is easy to add a bit of bass and treble to bring the music back to life.  Hooking it up direct if you have a aux input would be even better. The quality this way is very good.  The unit remembers the song or track you had it off when you turned it off. It does not stay at the same spot but it does start the track at the beginning once you power it back up.  I really love the unit. It does what I need it to do. The remote is great but I find it not needed so much for me. The plug in for the unit is right in front of my hand so it is just as easy for me to advance a track directly from the units face controls.  In the past I have used other units that transmit to a radio and none have every worked as well as this unit has. It is durable and feels really good. It comes with everything I needed to hook it up to any situation I am in. I loved the fact that they included all the patch cords. Ty for that Satechi.   Playing the unit with this card has been a breeze. You can set your card up with folders and it will advance by folder. A+  Setting it to random it will quickly play all your songs and keep them well mixed.  The face will also scroll your songs information so you know what is playing.  It is not a big unit and I was scared it would not fit my lighter location. The swivel on the unit and the depth it plugs in was well planned. I was so happy that all I had to do to make it fit and see the face was to adjust the swivel and rotate the angle a bit. A+   All in all I would rate the unit very high and a best buy for anyone needing to play MP3's in a car without that ability.  The unit is portable enough it will move from one car to another in a flash.     The bad:  The only thing I have had to get use to is turning it off when I shut down the car. My plug in stays hot so the unit has to be manually shut down.   This unit does not have a dedicated power button. It is a shared function button. You have to hold the button for several seconds to get it to turn on or turn off.   I would have loved a dedicated button. It would make it so much faster and convenient.  Other than the power button I have no complaints and have had no problems with the unit. It does exactly what I wanted it to do.    Conclusion:  There are allot of other units like this available. Many of them for allot less money. Even though this was a more expensive unit. I would say this unit is a winner if you expect it to work well for you and you don't mind the quality being a bit less than CD quality.  If you are looking to use this in the transmitter mode and expect perfect CD quality then you need to spend a bunch more money and change out your system or buy a factory aux. unit. That will cost you many times more than this unit.    Extra:  I have had 2 follow up mails from the customer service just asking if the unit is working well and if I am enjoying it.   If they do that for each sale I would expect they will stand behind there equipment. A++ for the follow up.
1423113381|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  It is different then Percy Jackson but just as well written.  Sadie kept taking the Lords name in vane and that bothered me.  If you think this is swearing, that might be something to consider.  I don't like kids to do this.  Other than this one thing, I loved the book.

0061928356|4.0|I loved this story of cross cultures, adoption, long term marriage, coming of age and the choices women make which effect future generations. I did not give it 5 stars only because there were some minor flaws. Some events towards the end seemed repetitive despite pertaining to different characters, but I couldn't stop reading it and highly recommend it.<br />Imagine the juxtaposition of the worst levels of poverty in India, in the early 1980,s as a married woman gives birth to a daughter, the gender no one wants or can afford. That birth is the basis for the rest of the story: what happens to that little girl and how her world is completely transformed when she is adopted by 2 well off doctors in affluent 1980's America! Will Asha, the baby, yearn to discover her roots? Will she fit into modern day America? (Her father is actually Indian, himself, but came to America as a young student.) Will her mother feel she can't relate to this child who looks so different from herself? As the mother of 2 Chinese girls, I could not always relate to the mother in this story, as my children are simply my children.<br />I found the book fascinating, especially the chapters that take place in India, both in the poorest strata of India\\"s society AND their wealthiest strata. The Indian culture is so foreign to me, and to Asha but she learns to embrace it and to love both her worlds when she travels to India as a correspondent for the Times as a young woman. I could smell the food and hear the sounds of it's busy streets.<br />The ending left me guessing, a bit, which I find annoying, but I still loved this book.
B00454U1NS|5.0|This is a great collection of songs.  I am not your typical Pink fan but her songs are upbeat and you can understand every word.  In the morning on the way to work, I crank up this CD and it wakes me up and puts me in a good mood.  (Not for kids, though!)
0790734060|5.0|Over 20 years after first seeing Amadeus, the only things I remembered vividly were Mozart's burial in a pauper's mass grave; the fact that the composer Salieri had been an envious, bitter enemy of Mozart; and the obscure detail that Mozart's wife had always affectionately called him \\"Volfy.\\"  Mozart's personality, with his scatalogical sense of humor, had put me off the movie to a large extent on first viewing it.     Lately, I came across an old VHS of Amadeus and decided to watch it again just to refresh my memory and to see if I'd have a different reaction to it now in 2011.  It turns out that I seem to have been through some changes such that I now like the movie and think it's great!  I still react against the vulgar aspects of Mozart's personality, but, at the same time, I can now overlook them or even laugh with him sometimes.  (Well, I also like that horse that he does.  And it's more merry than foul.)  I now feel affection for Mozart as portrayed in the movie, especially in the later part of his life.     There are over 400 reviews here on Amazon.  I haven't read all of them but I'm sure there's little information I can add about the movie or about the technical quality of the various remakes of it, but I will offer a few personal responses.      I can't refrain from seconding every reviewer who praises the movie visually.  It's a literally \\"fantastic\\" spectacle and apparently very authentic in its reproduction of the Viennese world of Mozart's day, notably in the theatre scenes.  The beauty of Mozart's music wonderfully permeates the scenic beauty of the story throughout, making this movie pleasurable to watch and especially to listen to.     This time around, I found myself drawn above all into Mozart's deathbed scene which fascinated me for several reasons.  The process of music writing between Mozart and Salieri was very interesting, and I wondered if that would have been a true picture of how any music could have been written collaboratively.  Further, this scene contained an exchange that pulled on my heartstrings.  Moved by Salieri's apparent kindness, Mozart feels remorse for having cruelly mocked Salieri and apologizes to him quite sincerely, asking him to \\"Forgive me.\\"  If only the plea for forgiveness might have reached its desired end and been accepted, and if only amends might have been made between the two enemies before it was too late.  But, the viewer knows that the kindly facade of Salieri is false, masking deceit.  No mutual amity can come about.  The truly penitent, guileless, and candid plea of forgiveness from Mozart is being offered to a confirmed Snake.  I felt sad for Mozart who received false friendship, but even more for Salieri, whose enmity remained so totally impervious to sweetness.      Another poignant exchange occurs in this scene when Mozart tells Salieri about how to write the music for the \\"Consigned to Flames of Woe\\" and then the \\"real Fire\\" part of  the requiem.  Mozart asks, \\"Do you believe in it?\\"  Salieri asks, \\"What?\\"  Mozart replies, \\"Fire that never dies, burning you forever?\\"  \\"Oh Yes,\\" replies Salieri emphatically.  \\"Possible,\\" concedes Mozart and immediately falls back into absorption in the all-consuming music!  Considering the enormity of Salieri's transgressions, his emphatic Yes is very ironic.  I find Mozart's greater interest in the Music than in Hell to be fairly delightful, but also seriously remiss given the gravity of the situation.   The exchange occurs in the few hours before Mozart will be consigned to the lime-strewn grave.  As Mozart directs his music but languishes mortally deeper into the \\"Voca me\\" section of the requiem, Constanza hurries homeward in response to the urgent feelings drawing her back to Vienna where she will have only a few moments with her dying husband, and Mozart will have only a last, smiling glimpse of his little son.  (I feel an \\"Oh, Thank You\\" to the story-maker for these parting blessings.)    One of the religious themes of thislargely religious story (or some might say irreligious) interested me most in my recent viewing of it.  There's a lot of attention given to the concept of God's \\"favor\\" and who deserves to get it.  The story is a first person narrative by Salieri as he makes his impenitent \\"confession\\" to a priest, telling him how he turned against God for not answering his prayers in which he bargained with God, asking to be made a musical genius.  He relates how he even burned his crucifix (a big one) and vowed to thwart the success of God's favor toward Mozart, whom he felt to be less deserving than himself.  The depth of Salieri's envy is murderous as Salieri carries out a plan to deliberately cause the death of Mozart by forcing him to write the requiem Mass for his father who holds exceptional psychological menace for Mozart, enough so that the process of writing the requiem will kill him.    In the concluding scene of the movie, Salieri says that he speaks for all Mediocrities, and designates the priest a Mediocrity too. \\"I am the patron saint of Mediocrities,\\" he declares.  Salieri then goes forth in his wheelchair, blessing with the sign of the cross the insane residents in the mad-house hospital where he himself enjoys a special room, sweets for breakfast, and overall singular favor as a resident.  Over and above his blessings (of whatever variety), a disembodied echo of the loony laughter of Mozart rings out in the corridor of the asylum.  The way I interpret it, Mozart has the last word in the story, the last LAUGH, and it sounds, as always, so characteristically like an IDIOT'S laugh!      Well, so, I think about the fact that God placed the genius gift of sublimely beautiful music---music that was \\"the Voice of God\\"---in the mind of a man whose personality seemed irreverent and rudely, crudely earthy in demeanor.  There's irony, too, in the fact that Mozart's middle name, Amadeus, means \\"He loves God.\\"  (And notice how the author has pointedly entitled his story AMADEUS.)  Bawdy and foul-minded though Mozart is reported to have been in real life, and although it seems unlikely in terms of this story that Mozart did consciously love God to a great extent, God inexplicably favored him with that gift of genius.  Nevertheless, there were other ways in which Mozart seemed less than blessed.  All mysterious gifts and circumstances to ponder.  Within the framework of this fictionalized and speculative history about the death of Mozart, I wouldn't venture to think about the fate of Salieri's soul, but I hope that Mozart's soul was somehow, in some way, eventually consigned to everlasting Music.
0316069353|5.0|This is a wonderful book. For those of you who have given a dishonest review because of the price, your sense of entitlement is astonishing.
B00011CZRE|5.0|This was a movie I have been looking for for some time. I was happy that it was available and at a very good price. I think this movie is on the bloody side but it still is one of the best psychological thrillers/ horrors i have seen!!
B0000AKCLS|5.0|this is a landmark performance and album.  Joe is an incredible musician, who plays the blues with great emotion, feeling and passion. I played professionally with many great artists.  This guy knocks it out of the park.  Dynamics, color, texture, and down right gritty blues guitar, this album has it all.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|Like going from Cup-o-Noodles to Mac-n-Cheese. App still in early stages- needs features. Not scrollable cumbersome. Other calendar apps easier to use. Color scheme also unimpressive- no transparency. Really glad it was only free... will see how updates improve.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Thus is a nice calendar app that can display multiple Google calendars, but I prefer the free Jorte calendar app and its task display.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game sometimes force-closes on start up (Droid X) and there are a few bugs in the game itself, but I never encountered one that was really bad or prevented me from playing further.  The gameplay was fun and I think unique for an Android game. It didn't take me long to beat- maybe an hour, but i wasn't expecting much more. The puzzles are very well designed and not at all repetitive. The graphics and music are high quality. The storyline is very brief- not a major part of the game. Overall,  I highly recommend this game. It exceeded my expectations after reading some of the other reviews. It is totally worth $0.99.
B004G600A4|5.0|What can I say? I love this movie! The music is great, the dialog is witty and the expressions that the characters make are hilarious. A great family movie.
0307739961|5.0|This was a great read and I am sad that Larson left us waaay tooo soon. The three series of books tells me that a great mind was at hand.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter told me about this book, and at first I set it aside.  Once I started reading it, however, I could not put it down.  The characters were incredible, and the futuristic world was described beautifully.  What if this actual happened?  That would be terrifying!  I hear it is being made into a movie, which would be perfect!  I think you have a HUGE seller on your hands, Ms. Collins.  Terrific writer! 5 Star!!
B004SBX112|2.0|App was great but can't install Easter update. Causes appstore to force close on Samsung Fascinate. Looks like many others are having the same problem.
0441013597|5.0|Dune is an epic and seminal work of science fiction. Any true fan of the genre has to read this book to see how it should be done. The depth of the world, the plots within plots, creative characters and systems, etc. The story of Paul Atreides is well-chronicled so I won't go over the plot, but if you have never read this amazing book I encourage you to do so. This, along with Lord of the Rings and Stranger in a Stranger Land are among my favorite books of all time.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|OK, so there are well over a thousand reviews here, most 5 stars, so many are so detailed that I'll just try to be brief. The book is amazing. A medieval fantasy told from multiple view points by characters who are extremely well developed and filled with realistic human foibles. No one is perfect, no one is always right, and the good guys don't always come out on top. The characters are so incredibly written, and yet you soon realize that they are simply the medium through which this story is being told, and it is the STORY that is the main character. Don't get too attached to anyone, 'cause you never know what might happen.<br /><br />This book (bk 1) takes place in a medieval world that used to have magic and mythical creatures in it, but no longer does. However, what you begin to see as the series continues, is that the magic is beginning to return and what it brings with it. The plot and subplots are filled with intrigue. The characters are calculating and manipulative. Every time you finish reading about one character, you just wish you could skip ahead and see what happens to them, but then you start the next section and you want to keep going with that one instead! This is no cookie cutter fantasy book. It is NOT predictable. I'm so glad I found it late in the series, because I love reading a series with back to back books and I would have dreaded waiting three years between books! The latest book (A Dance with Dragons) is due out July 12, 2011. An amazing series, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of fantasy!<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire Series:<br /><br />  o A Game of Thrones, Bantam Books, 1996<br />  o A Clash of Kings, Bantam Books, 1999<br />  o A Storm of Swords, Bantam Books, 2000<br />  o A Feast for Crows, Bantam Books, 2005<br />  o A Dance with Dragons, Bantam Books - July 12, 2011<br />  o The Winds of Winter, forthcoming/Bantam Books<br />  o A Dream of Spring, forthcoming/Bantam Books
B001LF347E|5.0|Video is of good quality and it is a joy to watch this charming and different look at Merlin, the young man.  We look forward to upcoming seasons.
B001WCN23W|5.0|I guess I should count my lucky stars I am not an audiophile or musician. I listen to music on my iPod (with the original cheap earbuds), in my car with the speakers it came with, or on my $100 Sony boombox. Okay, stop cringing!<br />So all I know is I like, love, adore, salivate over the Stones and have seen them many times in concert. I am listening to the remastered Sticky Fingers recording as I write this. I've owned this album as an LP, a tape and now the CD (along with a multitude of other Stones albums).<br />Unfortunately, I don't recall how Keith sounded on the LP version of an album or if Mick Taylor was better than Ronnie Wood or if the studio version of a particular song was better than the live version.<br />Excuse me a minute while I listen to Wild Horses.<br />Okay, I'm back. I am an artist/writer so I am more of a visual person than an audio expert. The sound can be somewhat harsh on the remastered albums but that is not a problem for me.<br />All I know is sometimes I like it LOUD and sometimes I like it as background music. But it's all good. So if you are in the same situation as I am, I recommend you buy the remastered CDs if you need to add certain albums to your collection. I am upgrading from tapes and all those LPs I sold when my record player broke.<br />But if you are a musician or audiophile, I can't speak for you...
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app works great! I needed something to keep my shopping lists and other notes. I love the checklist function for a shopping or to-do list. I've been using it for over a month with no problems.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've tried a few radio apps from the market &amp; TuneIn has the best selection of local stations &amp; quality feeds yet. Highly recommended.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|This movie tries to hide a political propaganda under the thriller action movie theme. Really left a bad taste in my mind.

B004GHNHVW|2.0|I really, really want to love everything Paul Simon does, but in truth Bridge Over Troubled Water and Graceland are all I am ever going to need.  This one is about knee high to those.  I will be giving it away.
0345528581|4.0|This book has some great exercises you can perform using body weight as resistance.  I have started to incorperate some of them into my workouts.  It's all about muscle confusion.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Computer animated films from the past 10 or so years have either been super hits based on a terrific storyline and creativity, or have suffered wannabeitis, wanting to be like the best but falling short bigtime. For every Finding Nemo theres at least 3 movies like A Shark's tale. For every Shrek, theres an Unhappily Ever After. Rio is a rare film that falls in the middle, with it being decidedly predominant on the better side of the animation equation.     The reason the film works is due in large part to the overall fun aspect of Carnivale in Rio and the strong bond of loyalty Blu has for his owner. Sure its storybook friendship, but here that's ok. There is also that awkwardness of environment background theme going on for blu that clearly borrows from Madagascar, but it's not a beat the joke to death kind of thing. At all the right moments, Blu is simply out of his element making for some cleverly done moments and only on occasion does it get slapsticky, which makes for great surprise laughs you didn't expect.     Visually, the movie is a dream to behold. If you have ever wanted to go to Rio, this film will make you want it even more, something that's a pretty lofty acheivement for a kids animated film.     What is unfortunate is the over-urban feel at times with characters taking on R & B personas (not surprising since they are voiced by R & B stars) but I am of the mind that a movie doen't have to include a smattering of bad R & B song or lifestyle reminders either hinting at or dead on delivered in an animated film to make it seem more cool. The film succeeds enough in that department on its own merit due to the enormously creative team who put it together. Overall, this urbanization seems misplaced in just about any animated film, yet we are seeing more and more of it sneaking into films where it clearly doesn't belong. I for one, dont go to a movie to hear what I already am surrounded by at all turns on the radio and tv. Movies are supposed to be an escape,a quality becoming more and more left behind each year in ALL films.     Still, that one shortcoming aside, Rio is a visually delightful film that does it's best to tell a simple but engaging story that never beats you over the head with 'overkill' moments, especially at the finale. Sometimes, pure fun is all you need, and Rio has plenty of that. Overall: 4.5 out of 5
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is awesome! !! i can't believe it's here and free.Seriously,  Google should make this default calendar and have developer retire in the Tropics. Or better yet develope more apps for Google and stay rich. Yup, it's that good.
0307405095|5.0|I saw Martha make the tomatoe & zucchini tart on the today show.  I tried it and it is excellent.  So, I bought the book to try the other recipes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am so pleased that they added the sharing tabs. This version is the best yet! The options available are very handy and I find myself using this way more than I expected.
B00466HN6S|4.0|With films like Yogi Bear, Alvin & The Chipmunks, Scooby Doo, Marmaduke and worst of all Garfield littering the cinescape with dreadful dreck involving live action people and computer animated cartoon animals, I wasn't exactly jumping for joy when I saw the trailers for Hop. In place of a nonsensical farce filled with more rubbish than a fleet of garbage trucks, in Hop we are treated to a whimsical tale with positive messages and loads of good old fashioned fantasy style fun. Anyone who grew up watching Rankin Bass holiday specials on TV will appreciate the classic themes beautifully updated for the modern day in Hop. Usually it works to advantage, occasionally it falls short.     The visual landscape and the animation of the characters is startlingly realitic and very quickly has you feeling you're just watching a regular movie where animals really do talk and there really is a secret lair of the easter bunny.    Like some other reviewers noted, there is a definite Willy Wonka meets christmas with Santa theme going here, and that's what really works. Visiting the people of the world only once a year and mastermminding the secrecy of the operation, many times the characters seem bogged down with non-information about the world inhabited by people, and thats just classic comedy perfection.      There are some weak points scattered about, but somehow, overall in the scheme of the movie, they are momentary and forgotten immediately as EB, our main character, immediately after a shortcoming does something else heartwarming to endear you to him and his situation.     When I emerged from the theater, I felt as though I saw a very substantial film, quite a task in an animated holiday kids movie, and one that involves Easter, a holiday not usually covered by cinema in terms of kids fare. What holiday can they take on next? I really don't care as long as the result is of the high quality that Hop exhits throughout. If you want a live action animated movie with real substance, hop on over and see Hop.

B004FOA84A|4.0|Very enjoyable, but super short. easy to beat in one sitting. worth 99&cent; nonetheless. looking forward to more like this.
B004LP601S|5.0|As a long time lover of Panic! at the Disco, I can honestly say that i had high expectations. Ever since their first album I've loved their music and style. But, I must admit, when I heard they lost their main lyricist Ryan Ross I was nervous to hear what their new songs would sound like and if they would have that same spunk I originally fell in love with. And it did! Brendon and Spencer are not only very talented musicians, but they can also write music very well. This album comes with a variety of sounds; they have their slow, heartfelt songs, like Always, their up-beat almost techno songs, like Let's Kill Tonight, and more. I also like how Fever was very different from Pretty. Odd., but this album almost combines the two different sounds into one. Vices & Virtues exceeded my expectations and I would full heartedly recommend this album to anyone who likes music that makes you wanna get up and dance! BUY IT :)
B002GTZSZU|5.0|This edition of Amadeus, the Director's Cut, is excellent. The video picture quality is first rate.  The sound is magnificent.  The additional movie footage was expertly selected, and enhanced the development of the story and its characters.  It was a pleasure to watch this Blu-Ray version of an already incredable movie.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Quite honestly, I was satisfied with the stock calendar app that came on my phone.  I tried this app out simply because it was the freebie app of the day.  Now, I don't think I could possibly ever go back.  This is the first app I've ever seen that absolutely blows away anything else of it's kind.      I have not tested the Exchange functionality yet, as I don't really use it, but with Gmail calendars it works wonders.  I have my personal calendar, my wife's calendar, and a couple other local event calendars that I normally like to have visible.  Somedays it can get extremely jumbled on the default app, and even on a full size monitor on a PC.  Somehow, everything on this app is easily readable.  I'm guessing that the guys who made this are wizards.  I'm absolutely amazed by the improvements that these guys have put into something as simple as a calendar app.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Every song is epic.  Bruce's voice is amazing, and the musicians are top-notch.  Great lyrics, technical, interesting music compositions.
B0030Y10QQ|4.0|Is anyone else having issues with the DVD?  I have tried 4 different DVD players, and it will not play on any of them.  From an old one to a new 3D one, I just purchased!  It plays fine on my laptop!  My nothing on DVD players!  Any help out there?  I want to see it on the big screen!
B004TTMYQG|2.0|The application itself is good, but the widget leaves much to be desired (which for me is the most important thing). Agenda widget (free on app market) is better and more customizable.
B004I4H8PO|1.0|Like others who have posted reviews here, I opened my package today, purchased from Amazon, to find that two of the discs had slid from their pockets into the cardboard sleeve. It took quite a while to dig them both out and the sleeve is slightly torn already.<br /><br />This is unbelievable. A 10-year old could figure out the the discs will not stay in slots that really are not pockets at all. Somewhere at Polydor there is a brainless quality manager who ought to be fired, and an over ambitious art director who shouldn't pitch what can't be properly made.<br /><br />The discs, of course, have glue on them from sliding around. So, while this set might sound great, I wouldn't know because I have adhesive residue on my discs.<br /><br />I want a new box set, one that is properly assembled, and I want it right now. Thankfully, I can get a replacement immediately from Amazon, but what are the odds it will be acceptable? The blame for this falls to Universal/Polydor, the cheapskates who created this mess, and Amazon has to back up what they sell. This is an expensive package, sold on their merits of its lavish design as much as the music, and like so many other collector's sets lately, it's been shabbily and hastily put together and Amazon customers are, once again, ripped off by the record label.
B000063DFN|4.0|Not my favorite of theirs overall, but still incredible and worth buying.  If you are an Iron Maiden fan, you need this.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I agree with some of the others in the brevity of the game. It goes by quickly if you think outside of the box. Then you finished and left feeling unsatisfied. My tip to the dev: make it huge, but have the subsequent &quot;levels&quot; download from the cloud that way there doesn't need to be such a large file.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I must say this is one of the best calendars I've used. Easily replaces the stock calendar and better yet, the widget is amazing. This is a must have application if you keep your life organized on your phone.
0399230033|5.0|We have the board book version at our house.  It is a simple book with few words- Gives you a great chance to tell the story yourself and lets toddlers learn to make up a story by looking at the pictures.  When the zoo keeper gets in bed and the gorilla climbs in with my 2 year old daughter and I are barely able to contain our laughter!  I wasn't sure about this book the first time I read it but my daughter would continue to choose it time and time again.  She was very quickly able to tell the story and has had much fun getting more elaborate as she gets older and her vocabulary grows.  We buy this for all of our friends having babies and hope they have as much fun as we have with it!

B002OG5GT8|3.0|If you do have thirsty headphones, i would just buck up and get the e7, sounds better and you can use it as a dac so you can bypass your sound card off your computer. And the battery on that beast lasts 80 Hours?! I bought this and i used it once, put it back in the box, and have intent to sell it.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I have been using Jorte as my main calendar application for couple of years now. I decided to give this one a try since it was free for a day. Its good bit not as good as jorte.  Can't customize background or opacity.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|After installing this I promptly removed the other calendars on my phone (Jorte and Calengoo). The widgets are clean and the add event function is a perfect compromise between simple and robust. I like how you can move the dates viewed on the widget without opening the application. Only thing I could suggest to make it better is a scrollable widget as others have mentioned. Worth every penny for sure! If this helps you be on time for one single important event you got your moneys worth!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|As an overall impression of Patrick's second in this series, I would have to say, it's brilliant.  It was like revisiting an old friend...who made new and interesting fiends.  But once again, I'm curious to know, \\"Who is Bast!?\\"  Like when Atlas Shrugged was popular, everyone was asking, \\"Who is John Galt!?\\"  Years later, I still cannot answer that question.  Will it be the same with Bast?  Does anyone else feel this way?  Summing up, I loved the book!  I will admit, reluctantly, that a couple of parts dragged, but then it took off like a rocket to space and I was captured page after page. Anxiously waiting the 3rd book :))
B004G600A4|4.0|This is a nice movie to see with the family. Kids liked it. Entertaining, funny, good story. Not Disney's best, but worth buying, esp. if you are collecting Disney.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I love this calendar!  It is tons better than the one that came preinstalled on my droid x. In particular I like that it shows bars representing meeting times and lengths even in month view, so I can decide if a particular week is too hectic for a meeting that might run over. I don't like to schedule meetings for new projects on days that I have a lot of meetings with only a short time in between them because these types of meetings tend to run over frequently. Looking at the graphical representations of times and lengths in the month view doesn't give exact times of the meetings, but in one glance tells if it is &quot;one of those days&quot; or weeks and this feature alone is worth getting this calendar. I also like the ability to combine multiple calendars, so I can have my personal social calendar times displayed on my phone without putting that info on my work calendar. Do I really want our scheduler to know I'm meeting a recruiter for lunch?  This is a well thought out ap and fits my tastes almost perfectly.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Everyone always compares The Pacific to Band of Brothers and it's hard not to because BOB was almost perfect. Although this series does not measure up, that does not mean it is not good. The battle scenes are intense, gripping, and just overall well done. I learned a lot about the pacific theatre and have a new found appreciation for those soldiers. It's just a shame that the directors were unable to really get you invested in the men/characters. To be honest, I didn't even know the main characters' names until quite awhile into the series and even now I couldn't tell you anyone other than Leckey, Sledge, and Basilone. Honestly, Sledge was the only likable person in the series in my opinion. Joe Mazello was hands down the star of the series and should be proud of his portrayal of Sledge. I would have been happy if they would have just followed him throughout the entire series. I also appreciated the story continuing as Sledge returned home and struggled to adjust.  I actually think they could have put more of that in the story and taken out the other men they followed. It's definitely worth watching and you will enjoy it; however, it's not a purchase and not one I will watch over and over like BOB.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I give this a 4 out of 5 because the movies great enough to be 5 stars, but the lack of bonus features on the DVD takes off a star. However, I would buy this over the 2-disc edition because the bonus features on that are nothing spectacular. Great movie, though!
1423113381|2.0|I picked up this book because I had the Percy Jackson books and \\"The Lost Hero\\" and thought that they were very interesting, exciting and fairly well-written reads and figured this one would be as well.  I was sadly very disapointed by this new series of Rick Riodan's.  Repeatedly throughout the book I found myself saying: \\"is this for real?!\\".  After all who on earth says that cheese is the fifth element or that Elvis of all people is a magician.  I mean, seriously, what was he thinking when he was writing this?!  At least it kept me slightly interested while I drudged through it and I did, after all, finish it, which says something for its entertainment value.  I have yet to decide whether I'll read the rest of them, but if I do it won't be my own copy (These books aren't worth a cent!), I'll probably rent it from the library or borrow it from a friend.  A word of advice to anyone planning to read this sorry excuse for a book: If you're looking for something to read after Percy Jackson, go for \\"The Lost Hero\\" instead.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have a 4 yr old and a 2 yr old Andy they completely loved it.  They even say through the flick at the theater.  Now they watch it almost once a day.  When they are not watching it they are playing it by putting a blanket on their head and pretending its Repunzel's hair.   I recommend it to anyone with kids.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a really nice radio app for android. I love the interface however I'd really like a widget since tunewiki has one and it makes it very convenient to stop and start the music.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|By far the best, and most objective description of the financial crisis. Very crisp, very moving, very shocking - exposes all market participants for their unethical business practices that have continued for so long, and still continue, destroying the common man. Many accurate and important facts. Fantastic interviews of the crooks!    EVERY HUMAN BEING should see this movie, since the affects of this crisis affect ALL of us. Show it to your friends, family, students, co-workers, everyone.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|awesome amd easy to use.  was comfortable with it in just a few minutes.  thanks for the app Amazon.  i look forward to using it.  it definitely showed the difference in what you get for free vs paying for a good app.
1936041685|5.0|When one opens G.K. Chesterton's book Orthodoxy, beware - you might just feel like you have been run over by a speeding semi-truck, that is how hard, fast, and powerful this particular book will hit home. Each page overflows with a river of masterful brilliance that can almost overwhelm you as you take in the abundance of truth and impeccably good sense that Chesterton has fattened up his masterpiece book with. If you are unfamiliar with G.K. Chesterton and have never read any of his works before, be forewarned, he is far from being the easiest author to read. That being said, I highly recommend anyone and everyone to check out this masterpiece. I assure you that you will find yourself feeling as if your eyes have been opened for the very first time, and you will be wishing that there were contemporary writers of today that were more like him in their brilliance, personality, and ability - simply put, his genius is unparalleled. Although he has been dead since the 1930's, his work is just as relevant now as it was back then - when compared to popular authors of today, he stands as an intellectual juggernaut towering over everyone else. Simply put, Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton serves as one of the all time greatest works of Christian apologetics, and Chesterton himself remains to this very day, arguably the greatest Christian apologist of all time (yes, even ahead of C.S. Lewis). I would also recommend reading his book 'Heretics' which was published before Orthodoxy is its companion. Another book I would recommend is his far more famous work 'The Everlasting Man' which is arguably the greatest work ever in Christian apologetics.
B004132HZS|5.0|I am a Sherlock buff from long ago! I love this new version and find it action filled modern day Sherlock very entertaining. I can't wait to see more episodes.
B004MDLXUW|1.0|Regardless of the writing itself, which seems to be ok, this version of the book has so many typos and mistakes throughout the book that it was constantly distracting and irritating. I'd find another version or buy the book in hardcopy rather than tolerate this poorly transcribed version.
B00008EPM5|4.0|Very well composed and sang album. Doubt there's any other one better from CSN. Hopelessly Hopping is from another planet!!!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I love this app! I have been using the beta version for about 6 months and finally found a calendar app that syncs with google and has a nice interface. like the feature that allows you to swipe across days in a month to select them and zoom in.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Installed this app because I wasn't happy with the Calendar app that came with my phone.  Unfortunately it caused all sorts of problems: other apps slowed down, the battery drained quicker, and for some reason i wasn't receiving calls and couldn't make calls (screen went black when i tried to dial).  Had to uninstall.
B00000JQFL|5.0|EArth Wind and Fire is one of the best bands that has ever existed on this planet; glad i ordered this product.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Having read several reviews by others (mostly glowing), I too believe that this film should be seen by everyone in this country. It is not perfect, but it succeeds in showing how people made fortunes by selling us out. A perfect example of a total abuse of power based on pure greed, and all perfectly legal.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|So, I was pretty skeptical of this app until it showed up for free in the Amazon appstore.  I gave it a shot at the nice round price of $0.00.  I haven't spent anything over $3 on any apps because I can't imagine that they are truly worth it.  I will say after using this app at the price of $0, I would definitely pay $5 for it.  The views and widget options are pretty endless and I really like the pinch to zoom and slide to view days functions.  Great work Mikado.  The only thing I wished it had was custom colorizers on the 4x1 widget.  all around though, pretty awesome.
B002GHHHKQ|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and give Jodie Foster a AAA rating.  I am always open to possibilities of \\"What Might Be\\".
0671027344|4.0|Chobsky has succeeded in creating a character with a voice that is all his own. It sems completely reasonable to say that this 'is' the diary of a thoughtful youth. The diction and tone of this work are very authentic. However, the draw back here is that the writing is very plain. The best moments of 'Wallflower' are those where we can relate the struggles of the narrator to our own life. There are few places where the work produces actual poetry, where teh writing itself is something profound. This makes the work mroe real, but perhaps less memorable. In any case, there is little to stop this from solidifying its position as this generation's coming-of-age novel.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This film is a favorite of mine as well as my grandchildren.  Have watched over and over.  You almost have to watch several times as there are so many classic lines.  I still laugh out loud and I am sure many people can relate to relatives coming to visit for the holidays. I loved the first movie Vacation but this one is my favorite.......
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I used the free version of this app for a long time. It's always worked great. I was happy to upgrade to the pro version and I also have it on my iPad. Well worth the price. The pro version lets you record cached audio, so you can record an ebrake right after you hear it and play it for your wife later like she really cares.  I'm running an AT&amp;T Nexus One, used this with CM7 and stock gingerbread.
B002M9FY94|5.0|This disc arrived today, a day ahead of the<br />earliest \\"estimate\\". I am impressed with the<br />service..The remaster is very good. \\"Lightning<br />in the Sky\\" with Alex on vocals is full of punch.<br />Brings back some positive memories....<br />Breadmanwalking....
B004TTMYQG|2.0|just an expensive version of Google free calendar.  have to have different accounts for different calendars instead of letting you divide out the one calendar you have.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins three book series begins with The Hunger Games.  This is a book that you never want to put down after you begin reading it.  Something like this could actually happen to the United States in the future.  It's labeled a Young Adult book but I'm way older than that and I loved it.  I've heard they are making a movie about this series and it will be good if done correctly.  The lead character, Katniss, is a wonderful, strong female for young girls to model themselves after.  It's good to see females in roles like this.  Great series and I'm currently reading book #2 and will promptly read #3.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Simple, cheap effective solution for a very compact, fit in your pocket (or purse) tripod for iPhones.  Works perfectly!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I work in Pennsylvania and I listen to my favorite radio stations from Milwaukee, WI.  I have streamed radio in the car without buffering for over an hour.  It works like a charm on WiFi or on my 3G network.
B003ZSH606|5.0|I'm an avid fan of Jamiroquai and \\"Rock Dust Light Star\\" doesn't disappoint. Several of the songs have the usual, contemporary, funky rhythms for which the group is well-known. However, some songs seem more rock-influenced as opposed to acid jazz. It's a great album!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I've tried to use it multiple times. Wi-Fi or 3G/4G on T-Mobile network in Chicago with the G2x. 30% of times it works well, the rest it stutters or just plainly doesn't load the stream. Also, it force closed 4 out of every 10 times used it. It might be my phone or the network, but I doubt it, since XiiaLive works almost flawless (there's your alternative). I downloaded it while it was free here, on Amazon (talking about TuneIn Radio Pro) and I'm happy I didn't pay a dime on it - still it's pretty frustrating for it to work so sub-par for me as it has such good results (the majority).  Well, all I can do is wait for the day when XiiaLive will be the free app of the day.....Amazon, can you hear me?
0790729709|5.0|THE BODYGUARD    THIS IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE.  THE MORE I WATCH IT THE MORE MORE I APPRECIATE EVERY ASPECT OF THIS FILM.  WHITNEY'S ACTING DEBUT PROVED THAT SHE IS REALLY A COMPLETED, WELL-ROUNDED ARTIST, COUPLED WITH HER AMAZING VOCAL ABILITY - SHE IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME STAR.    I WILL ALWAYS TREASURE THIS FILM.
B0007939NO|5.0|A truly lovely film - You must see it, if for no other reason to witness the luminescent Cyd Charisse in one of her greatest roles.  If you consider yourself a romantic and respond to music and dance, you are in for a treat.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|This is a great collection of the Bon Jovi favorites, all in one place.  Kind of like Slippery When Wet with perks.  Worth every penny!!
1416550534|5.0|The story is told from Grace's perspective as she is very old in a nursing home.  It goes back and forth from her present life and her past.  The book beautifully captures the period of the mid 1900s through the first world war and after in England.  Grace is enthralled by the three children of the family she works for, David, Hannah and Emmeline and it follows from there.  The characters are very real and the descriptions of the rooms, the food, the clothing, all bring you into this period in this house.  The lives of Grace, Hannah, Emmeline and David's friend, Robbie, all become very intertwined and move toward a tragic ending for some of them.  I would love to know a bit more about Grace's life after the \\"event\\" but this was only dealt with in general descriptions.  I thought the writing was perfect for this type of story and it was a very engrossing, emotionally moving novel.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|It's a nice calendar, but the lack of support for exchange calendars makes &quot;business calendar&quot; a misnomer. Businesses use exchange.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|I adored this film.  It was realistic without being overly sappy and simplistic.  And I do worry about kids today that are trying to get into college because the competition has become fierce.  I remember reading an editorial in the NY Times by a Harvard alumni who conducted student interviews for college entrance.  The editorial was titled something like \\"Another 4.0 Student Who Won't Get Into Harvard.\\"  He then went on to lament how many complex extracurricular activities, interests, and volunteering a student had to engage in aside from having a 4.0 grade average, top SAT scores, AP courses, etc. these days.  He compared it to his days when the volcano demonstration at a science fair was enough extra sauce needed to spice your college entrance application.    The world has become complex, fast moving and incredibly competitive.  No wonder so many kids today are caving under pressure and not being given the chance to really explore who they are and what they are TRULY interested in.  I want my son to watch this.  He just graduated college, but not without it taking its mental toll.    The film brought me lots of smiles and a few tears as well.  Well done.  So well done.
B002GYS1FO|2.0|I just love \\"how do you like me now\\" on the Kia commercial.  Very disappointed in it on the CD.  It's only about 30 seconds of lyric and 10 minutes of techno (seems like an hour).  Never would have purchased it I had known that.  Not knowing about \\"The Heavy\\" and their music, guess this was partly my fault.  The other tracks are ok, but seems that their speciality is \\"techno\\" and not singing itself.  Wish I could find \\"How do you like me now\\" with more lyric somewhere.
1595141715|5.0|I have two \\"tapes\\" left and I am in love with this book!  I'll update this when I finish it.    Edit April 30th 2011: I finished the book last night and loved it. I read some other reviews where people were saying that the book is risky to read because it may \\"trigger\\" and while it may do that to some who are about to fall, I think this book does a better job at showing how missed Hannah Baker was and how her death really effected those she left behind; which a lot of people contemplating suicide never think of or think they will not be missed.  I feel this book has several great messages, another being, \\"What you do makes an impact on other people, so think carefully about how you treat others.\\"   I am a nineteen year old female.
0262731541|5.0|This is the best book I've seen concerning the physics of cycling.  It includes a brief history, the biophysics of the human \\"motor\\", and a thorough coverage of each aspect of the physics of the bicycle.
B00021HBGS|5.0|I recently purchased this for my 16 month old. He loves playing with them. They stick well to the tub and came in bright colors. The netted bag is nice to store them in. Good product!
0439023521|5.0|This book is a page turner from the very start. I don't think I have ever read a book so fast! I would say it Combines a bit of George Orwells 1982 and Steven King's Running Man. If you enjoyed those then you will love this! I have already read the second book Catching Fire (equally as great) and am waiting for the last book in the series, The Mockingjay!  I also hear there is a Hunger Games movie due out next summer. I can only hope they do it justice....Unlike what they did to the Running Man movie! Terrible!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I won't give any spoilers but this the second movie of four to be made, re-making the mid 1990s number one anime Neon Genesis Evangelion was worth the wait.  Those of us in the USA have been waiting patiently for two years, since it's Japanese release, for it to be doubed in English and released in the states.  It was well worth the wait! Doubed using most of the original US cast, and the imagery shown utilizing the latest in technology, breaths new life into the story.  It it truly spectacular! As for the storyline, it continues to parallel the original story up to a point then you realize the Angels are more spectacular and more powerful.  This adds more action to the full feature movie, not to mention the music.  Yes, I must comment about the music.  Even though I am a member of an orchestra, I feel everyone who sees the movie would agree that the powerful music written and conducted by Shiro Sagisu, is not over the top but adds to he drama and the spectacle of 60 foot tall giant bio-robots.  Also, the storyline has been expanded and we get a better understanding of the characters...call it character development...  Finally, for all the fans that waited for this release, there is an alternate audio track of commentary by the US cast and a second disk in the case that has 40 minutes of extras showing things like the technology behind the movie.  Also there is a 20 page guidebook.  The book is full of information to help those new to Evangelion to quickly catch up and understand this movie better (this anime is known for it's complex storyline combined with sporadic religious imagery).  This second movie of the four movie series ends leaving the viewer wanting more and wets the appetite for the next movie: Evangelion: Q The Quickening.
B004G6009U|5.0|Even our 20 month old granddaughter enjoyed this movie.  Also the 2 disc set allowed us to play it other than on a blue-ray.

0307595862|5.0|Harry Hole is a Norwegian detective especially trained in catching serial killers.  He spent some time in Quantico learning these skills but serial killers are very rare in Norway.  It just so happens that right now there is a serial killer loose in Norway.  He's been active for over fifteen years and his emblem is a snowman.  Whenever he kills someone, he leaves a snowman in their yard.  He has been nicknamed `The Snowman\\" by the Nowegian police force and this has been picked up by the civilian population.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo has created an unremitting page-tuner in The Snowman.  It was hard for me to come up for air.  The writing excels, the pace is adrenaline pumping, and the clues take roundabouts throughout the book.  The translator, Don Bartlett, is excellent.  The writing is smooth, readable, and I would never have guessed that this book had been translated.<br /><br />Harry Hole, like many police officers, is tortured by demons.  He struggles with alcoholism, is still in love with his ex-wife, is the bad boy of his department and is afraid of the dark.  At home, his walls are torn down because of a mold problem so he doesn't  even have a comfortable place to rest.<br /><br />The Snowman is attracted to women with children.  He does not target men or single women unless they are getting too close to finding out his identity.  Harry Hole gathers a team of four and together they seek out this serial killer who uses a sadistic means to kill his victims.  Sometimes he will even behead them and put their head on top of the snowman.<br /><br />Harry and his team travel from Bergen to Oslo in search of this monster and they keep thinking that they have found him, only to realize that they have been tricked and he is still at large.  The Snowman is smart, always one step ahead of them and Harry has a feeling that he is being watched  and that the Snowman is someone he knows  -  someone in his personal or professional circle.<br /><br />The Snowman doesn't ever leave any clues.  The crime scenes are immaculate, there is no DNA nor are there any fiber traces.  The cuts are clean and immaculate.  Sometimes, there is not even a body to be found which drives Harry to the brink.<br /><br />I've read many police procedurals and hardcore mysteries but this is the best one I've ever read except maybe for Deon Myer or Lawrence Block.  They are each excellent in their own way as Nesbo is in his.  There is not one part that lets up interest.  Once picked up, the reader is bound to the book like super glue.<br /><br />I was amazed to learn that Jo Nesbo, author extraordinaire is also a musician, songwriter, and economist.  He published his first Harry Hole book in 1997 \\"and it was an instant hit, winning the Glass Key Award for the best Nordic crime novel (an accolade shared with Henning Mankell and Steig Larson).

0061989142|5.0|This book is fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially a young girl growing up and looking for some tips on how to become a stylish young woman. On the other hand, I am 28 and I got a lot out of this as well. Even someone who is not a fan of Lauren's television forays would still enjoy this book. She has some great ideas, some ways of looking at things that you may not have thought of, and even though a lot of the items shown in the book are 'designer' and not affordable for everyone, the actual tips and advice are very realistic and accessible. Can not say enough about this glossy, well set out, fun book. So cute!!
0439023513|3.0|I was severely disappointed with this book. The start of the series was very good and drew me in, wanting more. The second wasn't that bad, but wasn't as good as the first one. But this one... wasn't all that good. It wasn't entirely bad, but overall, I didn't enjoy it. Katniss started becoming a Mary Sue towards the end, which disappointed me since in the others she wasn't one. The whole writing itself just felt as though Suzanne Collins didn't care. Like it didn't matter to her one way or another what happened to her novel. If I can tell that in a book, it doesn't make me want to read on or even care about the book. It's like why bother reading when the writer herself doesn't even want to write it.<br />The ending wasn't very good at all. Part of it was with Prim - not so much what happened to her, but that it was never really touched on in detail about it. I read it several times because I didn't understand what it was saying. I didn't realize what happened to Prim. Anytime that happens with a character or any point in a story where a reader can't tell what's going on with something is not good. There shouldn't be any confusion on things. It should flow smoothly. This didn't. Not only that, but the whole Peeta/Gale thing was a disappointment. I'm not saying I don't agree with the choice of who she chooses, but it's how the characters were handled, even more at the end. It was either they suddenly are with Katniss even though there was still an uncertainty a chapter beforehand or they just left and went into another district, not even caring about Katniss even though they were in love with her through the entire series.<br />It became clich&eacute;d as well and just ended badly. It wasn't a good way to end the series or a novel. I didn't care for it at all. As a reader I was disappointed in it. As a writer myself, I was ashamed to say I liked the series.<br />I understand what happened with Katniss in the end - that she was mentally unstable - but I don't think it was written as well as it could have been or as good as the others.ll as it could have been or as good as the others.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|Adgend Widget is by far better and more customizable, even for the free version. But this one is good for those that just what little setup.
0439023521|4.0|I was a little iffy about this book because of how popular it started becoming and I'm usually against books that well known. However, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book. Suzanne writes it in a way that's so addictive that I find myself being drawn into the book and I have to finish it, no matter how late it is. It's a page turner for sure, which can be a bad thing since I want to finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />Though things did become a bit graphic at times, it was all very detailed and very beautifully written. I find myself becoming one with Katniss and seeing how she feels, sees and thinks. Suzanne writes Katniss as if she is a real person and not a character in a book. I feel as though I know Katniss inside and out. I feel as though I'm connected to Katniss, which I love. I hate it when I don't feel any connections at all to the characters or they're flat characters. While Katniss is amazing at certain things, she also has flaws, which ground her as a character.<br /><br />The story itself is wonderful. The only bad thing is that it's very similar to Battle Royale. However, I think Suzanne Collins takes a nice unique twist to things. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone.

B004PV3M5A|3.0|Although this album is nice to listen to, there is absolutely nothing unique about it.  I would describe the sound as a listless insipidity that is clearly a mixture of ideas borrowed from other artists.  This isn't necessarily an issue except that there is a conspicuous lack of passion anywhere on this album... even on songs that call for it (like \\"Even In Dreams\\").  Although it's fine background music for now, I imagine that I will quickly become tired of it.

1843118262|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3E07HAOVUXSB0]]<br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This book is seriously needed by the Construction Bar! The authors, father and daughter team Roger and Camilla ter Haar, have produced an essential statement of practice for both the academic and the practical elements of what we need to tell the clients in a construction case- what can I get? This is especially relevant where we are negotiating a settlement which can crop up quite frequently in this specialist area of law, often when the case is part heard because of the way the evidence has gone. The case law citations, the detailed index and the academic comment are great bonuses for this essential reference book for chambers.<br /><br />The book starts well with a description of what we do at the Construction Bar- in general we cover building, engineering and technology projects with particular reference to standard forms of contract although most disputes arise out of or in respect of construction projects. The term is quite loose today as it covers a number of linked substantive law areas and the remedies available in them.<br /><br />There are a number of books on the market covering the thorny issue of remedies for torts and breach of contract which are so intermingled in reality as to need the rigorous analysis demanded by the courts when remedies in these areas are sought.<br /><br />That is where `ter Haar on Remedies' comes into its own.  There are 25 chapters covering all the main areas: rectification, rescission, quantum meruit, termination, frustration, measure of damages, the `black hole' cases, loss of profits and overheads, `global' claims, costs and interest, set off, injunctions, specific performance, declarations, limitation and dispute resolution.<br /><br />It is worth looking at the last chapter on ADR in particular because there are some very handy hints on how the courts may well be viewing the timetable of proceedings in the future.  It may well be that when there is a new edition of this work (as they surely must be!) that chapter 25 will be expanded as ADR itself expands.<br /><br />The authors have made out a great case for handling the issue of remedies with intelligent use of authorities although, as they say, it is not designed to cover or include a whole range of problems in commercial construction projects, but to give us an identification of the areas that are likely to be of interest when running a case- they do just that and `ter Haar' has an important place in the chambers library in both the contract and the tort sections.when there is a new edition of this work (as they surely must be!) that chapter 25 will be expanded as ADR itself expands.

B004NSULHM|2.0|This album is a casualty of the loudness wars.  The music is fine, but the volume compression is beyond ridiculous.  I love Radiohead and own all their albums, but this one is not worthwhile.  The over-leveled sound is painfully awful, and I would gladly return it.  Very disappointing, and not recommended.    I suggest you compare the percentage of 5 star ratings for King of Limbs with those of other Radiohead albums.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Well, i cannot tell you how excited i was to get this screwdriver!!! i've only been watching Doctor Who for 3 months, but i am an avid Whovian and have recruited several people to this community of Doctor fans!!! I watched countless reviews of this toy, i borrowed my girlfriend's 11th Doctor sonic, and  i was prepared. or so i thought...this item has exceeded all expectations!!! it looks just like the one from the show with only minor and rather insignificant differences! it's beautifully made with no ugly product labels stamped into the plastic, which immediately impressed me even before  i knew what a sonic screwdriver was! the weight is nice; its not heavy, but not quite so light that i fear to break it! i've sadly dropped it several times, but it has had no damage done, so it's durable for sure! (though i would NEVER advise someone to go throwing it around  :P ) the light is really bright, i use it often. the UV nib was dry, so i dipped it in water and it worked fine. only problem i have with the product is that the UV nib was crooked, so i never use it because i'm funky like that. the sound quality is great, and yes, there are 2 sounds: the traditional buzz, and  a higher pitched buzz with a kind of gurgle (it's in the show, i checked -> season 1), and though the 11th Doctor's is louder this one is loud enough for sure! a lot of people say it's outrageously huge, but it's the same mold as the show prop, so the size is perfect, nuff said! i keep this thing with me EVERYWHERE i go: school, church, the grocery store, the toilet, EVERYWHERE, and  i have never had so much fun from a toy in my life! great look, great feel, all in all a fantastic and fun product! i highly recommend it  ;)  by the by, i'm a 17 year old guy reviewing this on my Mom's account. just thought you should know!!!  ALLONS-Y!!!
0061373877|5.0|This review refers to the audio version of this novel.<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable fantasy, sort of a twisted modern Dickens tale of London and it's underground inhabitants. It's chock full of villains of the vilest sort, angels, ne'er do wells, good folks, strange creatures, and amongst it all is our confounded, out of his element everyman, Richard Mayhew.<br /><br />This is the first novel I have read by Gaiman, and he does not disappoint.<br /><br />I would like to comment on the quality of the narration. I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and some narrators are better than others. When the book started, and I heard the words \\"read by the author\\" I groaned. I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman does a wonderful job. In fact, I would say he is one of the best narrators I have ever heard. Whether this is because he is reading his own story, or because he just has a genuine knack for it I don't know. He makes the characters come alive, and I find the story is a joy to listen to.<br /><br />This is a fun read, plain and simple. If you like fantasy, and listen to audiobooks, get this one.
0470913029|5.0|This book and eating plan has been THE best and most common sense approach to health I have ever seen.  I have done about everything out there, including some plans offered by the Dr.'s Eades who ENDORSE this book and plan.  I have been moderately successful with other plans, but managed to put on about 30 lbs., in 1 year!  I lost over 15 lbs in 2 weeks literally without even trying.  It was not difficult and I did not do strenuous exercise, just walking my dog 3 times a day about 1/4 mile each time.  Now that I am more than 1/2 way to my goal, I WILL start exercising with a purpose and I am confident that the rest will come off rather quickly and easily.  This was an easy plan for me to adopt as I was already consuming a lot of protein and veggies.  What I had to get use to was eating a little more and making it HIGH quality - THAT made ALL the difference; the quality, grass fed beef versus corn fed, free range chicken, etc. Please read the book, it is very easy to read and understand. I recommended this plan and book to my ex husband who works out 7 days a week and he lost 8 lbs in 7 days and he wasn't trying to lose as much as get firmer - it is working. Oh, did I mention that I am on 2 different BP meds? but even with just 1/2 my weight gone, my BP has gone down to 113/70 - with NO medications.  I do not recommend anyone stop taking medications until they discuss with their doctor, but that will definitely be the topic of conversation at my next appointment.  Stop messing around!  Get the book and get HEALTHY!!!  -MB
B000V86OKG|5.0|I found myself needing something to watch while working out on my bowflex treadclimber, and found that Dexter was the correct length to watch.  I was very pleased with the second season which I bought second hand and can't wait until I find out what comes next.  A few more days of workouts and I will move on to season 3.  The videos came just in time and in great condition.  I can't wait to see what our serial killer has up his sleeve next!  Who doesn't love a serial killer who targets bad guys?
B004TTMYQG|4.0|However, it would be nice to be able to customize colors and have option to show monthly view from Sunday to Saturday instead of just Monday to Sunday.   Overall, great stock calendar replacement!

B003VNKNDW|5.0|Transfer Speed is fast. This flash drive is also durable.. I carry it in my pocket all day, and haven't had any hassles.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love this app. I use it to shop all the time. It's layout is fairly simple and basic but gets the job done. It's very convenient when I see something that I want or need. One feature that I would like to see is an option to share a product with a friend via SMS, Email or possibly social network site.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|The main cast of characters are a bunch of Old Farts like myself. Their having fun in a movie that has it's share of good scenes, as well as improbable events, was certainly an entertaining way to pass an evening as compred to some nights when there is ABSOLUTLEY nothing on TV worth using up electricity;     74 year Old Fart from Southington,Ohio
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I downloaded many calendar apps before this one, and deleted them all.  Nothing would properly sync to my google calendar.  This works perfectly, has awesome widget options, and reminds me of iCal on my mac (which I totally miss).  Definitely get this!
0143038419|2.0|Overall I was disappointed in Eat Pray Love, I had heard so much about it before I read it. I wanted to love it and I tried hard to relate to Elizabeth (the author) but I just didn't. I don't know if my expectations of the book were too high before I started reading it, but I wanted to fall in love with this book and for it to be one of those books that I just could not put down. Instead, I found myself struggling to finish it.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Love this app. Tried 5 or 6 different ones until I ran into this. Works great with google and the display option are very nice and well thought out. A definate winner.
B004529NLG|3.0|I really enjoyed and i never thought this movie would be good but it was and i got this movie for my wife because she loves dancing so she loved but i like its its good.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the year, and by far, the best performance by an actress in years. Natalie Portman is an actress to be reckoned with. Well worth the purchase.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|I have to say it was not not great for 3D because it was not all in 3D it had to highlight its 3D in some few scenes but the story of this movie i really like and its technology too. so i say dont get to watch it in 3D but get because its a good movie.
B00275EHJG|4.0|Pixar continues to outdo itself. This movie is for all ages.Fun, but with subtle thoughts about transitions and growing up. A great movie.
B001I0T92Q|2.0|I ordered the item initially for my psp, together with 2 8gb microsd card, but unfortunately, they delivered the wrong product. Instead of the dual slot adapter, I got a thumb drive instead. But because I live all the way in Malaysia, I couldn't be bothered to inform them and exchange the product cause in order for that, I have to send it back to US, which will cost more, and they have to send it to my US address and I have to pay again to send it back to me. So, yeah. I couldn't get the product unfortunately for me.     ):
B00466H3DG|5.0|One of the best romance/relationship movies ever made. Artsy yet real with special effects that compliment the dreamlike mood the movie sets. Watch with that special someone, or by yourself. A feel good movie to get over the complications of love. Watched it probably 50 times or so. Now the Blu Ray makes it even more enjoyable.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|This is a great app, it's simple enough but very useful. It allows you to make lists and sync them to a cloud service. This app is specially useful if you have android and iOS devices because, as mention above, everything is on the cloud. The only thing that they need to address is to have a widget or for it show that you have a task due today with out having to get into the app.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|much better visual representation of your appointments and additional calendars.  im using the samsung fascinate and this app blows the stock calendar away!
B004TTMYQG|3.0|The app appears to be quite functional and it has at least one killer feature : changing the calendar view with the pinch to zoom gesture.<br /><br />But all that is defeated by its ugly UI. It jut doesn't feel polished.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I was surprised at how well it could identify songs.  Got this when it was on the free app of the day.  It's nice and I use it every now and then.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z is an epic novel built in a new structure. In many ways it is a masterpiece, and it even has its literature value. The story is told from various viewpoint, and tough it has the United States in focus, the rest of the world is not forgotten. I recommend it to everybody
B000JVSUS4|2.0|I have the biggest dvd collection n i already own this movie on dvd but since i bought a new 3d tv with a new bluray 3d home theater system i been buying alot of my favorite movies on bluray only if it has DTS surround sound n this bluray says it has it but it doesnt..Its just plain old dolby d n thats y i gave it the rating that i did
0783240287|5.0|For anyone looking for a bible story that both adults and children can relate to, this is it.  The story is well known, but what makes this special is the telling.  It's adapted from the broadway musical, with a lot of singing.  The songs are all in different styles so they're fun to identify.  Donny Osmond shows how versatile and talented he really is.   The role of the narrator is performed excellently by Maria Friedman. The special features include showing how the musical evolved to the story in the movie and how it is still performed live in schools across the country.  This is worth every penny.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|The free version got me through the first round of the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs, so I decided it was worth the purchase. I use TuneIn on my Evo a lot and it's been very stable. It works great over both 3G and Wi-Fi. The only thing I have against it is the sometimes quirky navigation.
1595141715|5.0|Th1rteen R3asons Why was one of the best books I read all year.  It's a great story about how our actions impact other people which is why I think it would be a good book for high school aged kids to read.  The story is about a girl named Hannah and why she committed suicide.  How this story is told, through the use of cassette tapes to the narrator of the story, is one of the most creative ways I think I have ever seen a book be written.  This is a very deep book and i would recommend it to anyone going through depression or bullying.  I honestly wish I had read this in high school, I think it would have helped me deal with life as a young adult.  Th1rteen R3asons Why keeps it real with believable characters who draw you into their lives.  It was a page turner that I couldn't put down.  I started reading and couldn't stop until I finished the book! It moved me and made me think - this is definitely a book worth reading.
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram opens with two powerful paragraphs that contain more intrigue, more promise, more power than any two paragraphs I have ever read... so I hesitated to turn the very first page - I was certain that nothing could follow such an opening. I was blown away.  I cried, I laughed and my view of the world expanded.  If this is not a true story, it still feels true.  So much description and research.  The writing is so unbelievable, so powerful that I cannot even begin to tell you how this effected me.  I will get stuck on a single sentence and just be thrilled with its beauty.  STICK WITH IT.  You may feel like it is too long.  It is not.  Every part has meaning and every part balances out the rest of the book.    Read it and give it away.  Please Mr. Roberts can you write a little faster, we need more.
B003ELOQCA|2.0|FIRST of all I LOVE U2 and have for many years!!! I wish they would get different production on their videos. I agree with other reviewers that there's TOO MANY FAST EDITS!!! TOO MANY QUICK CAMERA SHOTS!!!     I LOVE watching concerts...every aspect of them...the interaction of the band, the music, how they interact with the crowds, the musicianship of each member...etc...    When Editors do all the FAST/FRANTIC/QUICK/SHORT edits...it takes AWAY from the video experience.     This obviously was an AMAZING & INCREDIBLE show from one of the greatest live bands ever. U2 can rock a stadium and have the whole crowd into the show like no other band.     That's why it hurts to say that their last couple of DVDs (including the one from Chicago) have too many 'jerky' and frantic edits.     The 4 guys of U2 and their music are EXCITING ENOUGH without all the dizzying edits.     ...that's why I was so disappointed in this DVD. I'm going to keep it b/c I love U2, but I hope they change their future concerts to something more enjoyable to watch.     I wish they could even do another camera angles or alternative edits feature, so you could choose if you wanted... or maybe they could reissue with a 'director's cut' ...LOL.     This is a DVD concert that could have been done SO MUCH BETTER.
0470638842|5.0|A very good book for those new(er) to the social media strategy space and looking to get a solid foundation on which to build their strategy. It's very easy to understand, take away, and act upon the principles that Qualman puts forth. It has a lot of fun and very diverse examples and anecdotes, which really help the reader to see how social media strategy has been executed successfully - or, on the other hand, how a company might have misread or missed an opportunity to embrace the conversation with their customers. And on top of taking huge strides in understanding the impact of social media and how to leverage it, I really enjoyed reading this book - I was excited to pick it up everyday. It has definitely changed the way I look at even my own interactions in the social media sphere and with companies I engage with.
0380804557|5.0|This is really an excellent book.<br /><br />I fell in love with the movie back when it first came out, and only recently realized that it had been a novel first.  I knew Niel Gaiman had created the story, but knowing him mainly for his graphic novels had thought it was that to begin with.  Well, for my book club someone recommended this (since we watch film adaptations of books and then read the book they were based on), and I am loving it.  There is so much rich detail, and funny character flaws in the cast of the story, and it is such a fun read.  It really catches you up and carries you along, as a great story does.
B000GCFO08|5.0|Silent Hill is one of my all time favorite movies. I've never played the game, but I still understand the story line and enjoy watching the movie. This movie not only scares you, it also makes you think (which I like). I definitely recommend this movie to adults. I wouldn't recommend letting children watch it.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I was not prepared to like this CD. As I grow older I have less patience with music that strays far from my preference for indie rock and r&b-influenced songs. However, this collection is so charming and the lyrics and beats so constantly inventive, that it has won me over.     If you've been waiting for an album of songs to sink your teeth into from one of the Great American Pop troubadours, your wait is over. You may be tempted to dismiss this CD as sentimental because of it's lyrical content (What, another 'Christmas' song?), as well as it's low key, mellow performances. However, beneath the surface shimmer, you have some of the most resonant images in song Simon has ever produced, enough at times to send chills down your spine. Produced with a group of really talented musicians whose love for music informs the whole CD from beginning to end.    So paddle over to your Outbox, and get this, for sure. I guarantee after a few listens, you'll be hooked. My favorite tracks:   01. Getting Ready for Christmas Day  02. The Afterlife...oh, &$#*, the whole *$%& CD is great! :)
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is the best calendar app. I like it even better than the one on my ipod. It is so easy to learn and import from Google. I love the month view. I believe with this app I will finally be able to ditch my paper calendar for good! The only thing I don't like is the eye on the widget.
0765326353|5.0|Others have explained it in detail far better then i could.  I will simply say if you have enjoyed any of Sandersons previous works or just enjoy fantasy in general you WILL love this book.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I think this book is like \\"the emperor's new clothes\\"... No one wants to say that they don't get it! Just because a book wins awards, doesn't mean that you have to like it. I was constantly trying to figure out where in time I was reading about. I didn't really care about any of the characters, either. Finally called it quits at about 90 per cent of the way through.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|This is an awesome great customization...syncs well would like to have more variety with colors but other than that caint ask for too much more
1936719010|5.0|I purchased the audio version from Audible.com.  It's great.  The author himself reads it and does a fantastic job.  Very engaging!    I had not read the War of Art (it's on order now).  I ideas were fresh to me.  I listened twice.    The audio is about one hour and twenty minutes.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great game that is clean for all ands trust me some of the clues are a doozy!  My only complaint is Way Too Short if you spend more than a buck! Enjoy!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Best calendar on android. The developer is very hand on. I was apart if the beta and he kept improving it until it was prefects
B00361DR4Q|5.0|Siempre pensé que la Traviata de Placido Domingo y Mirella Freni era estupenda.  Pero ahora, con esta versión, veo que no.  Cada una tiene sus excelencias.  Esta, con la Alta Definicion tanto de imagen como de sonido del BluRay, Simplemente está en un nivel superior.  Ampliamente recomendable.  A un precio al alcance de cualquiera.  En un formato tradicional. Tal como la obra fue pensada por sus autores. Ojalá aparezcan titulos similares de las operas de Wagner (Tal como Wagner las penso), y no las que estan actualmente en el mercado que, por tratar de \\"\\"Modernizarlas\\"\\", las echan a perder.  Altamente apreciados son los cortos ejemplos de otras obras que vienen como anexo.    MUY BUEN BLURAY
0743454537|5.0|When it comes to twists in a storyline, it doesn't get much better than this, as there are two major turning points.  The first twist concerns young Anna's motives behind her law suit; the second concerns her fate.  But the basic concern throughout it all is the controversial issue of Anna's entire existence.      For a child who was practically man-made to match her sister's genetic makeup, Anna seemed to have a natural purpose for being on this earth, a purpose that couldn't be denied and one she admirably fulfilled.  Born to save her leukemia-stricken sister who was in need of a bone marrow transplant, thirteen-year-old Anna spent her life in her sister's shadow until the day she needed to step forward.    Like loving and caring sisters, most parents would do anything in their power to save a seriously ill child.  That's a natural - but at what point do they stop to let nature take its course?  Picoult fully explores this question, yet the weight of an ethical debate plays a far second to an emotionally engrossing storyline.    For a plagued family, consisting of a fire-fighting, astronomy buff dad who is suddenly at odds with his wife, a strong-willed but stubbornly determined attorney mom, a seriously troubled older brother, and two sisters bonded for life as they hovered over the shadow of death, there were enough factors ripping at the seams of their interwoven fabric, that could have ripped them beyond repair.  But for a younger sister fighting to make her own medical decisions, Anna was the one who had the power to mend them all by sewing inseparable family bonds.
B004XWLN20|5.0|NOTE- This is NOT a review of the box set. It is a review of the series in general.<br /><br />Smallville has managed to last 10 years. One whole decade. I have never really been a fan of the Superman movies. I personally prefer Spiderman over Superman. But Smallville is a whole new story. I decided to give Smallville a try last year (2010). I watched seasons 1-9 online in about 4 months. I couldn't take my eyes off it! I fell in love with the storylines. I am very glad I got into the show in time to enjoy the final season with all the Smallville fans while it airs.<br /><br />I personally don't know how I feel about purchasing huge box sets such as this one due to warranty reasons. I purchased LOST The Complete Collection the day it was released and for the first 20 days I was able to replace the damaged disks for free. Now I am stuck with some damage disks and the only way for me to replace them is to buy a whole new seperate SEASON that the disk is from.<br /><br />I am hoping that the Smallville Complete Series Box Set has a good warranty.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Business Calendar is for people who are serious about their calendars. Using it to schedule a time when you're in a pinch is infinitely faster than the stock calendar, and its agenda widget is far more useful and clearly laid out. Zooming into units of time is especially well-designed and thought out.    Unfortunately, the app is a little rough around the edges. A lot of it is, well, ugly -- especially the create event window, with its badly designed drawables, scattered layout, and inelegant feel. The widget, while useful, doesn't scroll on the many launchers that support Sense-style scrolling. Tapping on elements inside the calendar can require unrealistically precise fingers for the tiny clicking areas.    While a great tool and an especially welcome free app of the day, Business Calendar has a little way to go in terms of polish and design to justify the price.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This is a very good app. Tons of stations and categorized nicely. The search option works great as well. I haven't listened to pandora since. I would love to see a widget for it, however, as well as the sound turning off when the headphone jack is removed.

B004FOA84A|1.0|Unfortunately, while this game looks cool, it wouldn't play on my Samsung Intercept. After the massively long and slow download, I tried to open the app, and it would just force close before even opening. At least it was the free app of the day so I wasn't out any money!
B004KSQN7C|5.0|You read over and over again, from fans, critics (who are harsh let me remind you) have described this as her best work to date.  For those who dont believe this and you are entitled to your opinion, I suggest you give a second or third chance to let this CD grow on you...There is a reason why its done so well...Now Britney cant go back and do the same type of sound as she did from her early days, she has changed and her music has as well.  I would too compare this to BLACKOUT but this is much more grown up.  Now Bionic  vs. femme fatale....now the record sales for both CD speaks for itself and that should answer your question.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I just finished reading Jane Eyre and I decided due to the reviews for this film on Amazon and IMDB to watch the 2006 version.  I was not disappointed.  It didn't stray to far from the book although there were a few differences and the performances are amazing.  Ruth Wilson's performance as Jane Eyre is spot on.  She is exactly as I imagined her to be and Toby Stephens as Rochester:  what is there not to like?  He is exactly how I pictured Rochester to be: rude, gruff, tender, gentle, humorous, etc.  He gave the role lots of depth as well as Ruth did with Jane.  I saw some clips of some of the other adaptions on Youtube and I didn't see the chemistry and passion that exists in this film.  Overall, a very good film and worth watching again and again :).
B003VIW8DK|1.0|Bryan Ferry is one of my heroes, of course. Few if any 1970s lps by anybody are more thrillingly, impossibly just \\"Virginia Plain\\" GREAT than the first five Roxy Music albums. Ferry designed the incomparble sumptuos covers, wrote all the lyrics, and initally claimed entire credit for the music. After the second album (FOR YOUR PLEASURE, Roxy's undisputed masterpiece -- from the cover art to every syllable, and every sonic second of meticulously paced head-spinning euphoria), Bryan Ferry famously fired Brian Eno after a US tour warming up for Uriah Heep -- made even more unbeareable to him by hardcore fans pressing against the stage chanting \\"Eno! Eno! Eno!\\" Best thing that every happened to Eno, who pursued his then-uncommercial solo albums with stellar Roxy co-conspirators Manzanera and Mackay, et al. Eno's phenomenal place in music history is almost too much more reputably established than anyone thought possible in 1975. Generously, he has ever since maintained that STRANDED: THE THIRD ROXY MUSIC ALBUM, the first album released after his expulsion was the band's finest hour.  Then there are the Bryan Ferry albums. THESE FOOLISH THINGS, ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER PLACE, LET'S STICK TOGETHER, THE BRIDE STRIPPED BARE and so on. Almost always with one standout track on par with Roxy Music, but in each and every instance an ill-advised surfeit of lackluster lounge tunes sans the Roxy magic and built around an admirably ambitious but flawed conceit that he was Frank Sinatra.  As Lester Bangs famously wrote, \\"He'd bomb at a supper club in Hamtramck, but who could feel sorry for him?\\"  Don't get me wrong -- I like the guy, and almost always there's at least one good track on each solo album. Just not Dylanesque (compare with \\"Hard Rain\\" on his first release). And OLYMPIA? Four, five times I listened to OLYMPIA, aching for just one stellar track. But folks, it just ain't there.   Don't let the cheaply exploitive pseudo-Roxy cover fool you. This album is but an empty husk, unredeemable.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|It look me a while to figure out that Android does NOT search calendar entries.  It was almost too odd to believe.    So, for me, this is very nice because it has Search built-in (no special procedures to get it working) and handles all the native Google Calendar layers.  And I have a dozen or so Google calendars I use and live with.    Very similar to the native Android calendar, but better.  No learning curve.  I installed it and was using it immediately.  Other replacement calendar apps are much more complicated.    Very pleased!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|best application that I have seen in the marketplace. I was wanting something that would fill an entire page and give me an agenda like view of what I have going on in the week! keep up the hard work developing business apps! job well done

B004LI21KY|1.0|the picture on this DVD is beyond horrible. i'm shocked that they would even attempt to sell something this flawed. on most of it you haven't a clue what it is your watching.   mark lombardi  reno
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This App works great on the Xoom with Honeycomb. My favorite Calendar App until now was Calendar Pad Pro, but I like this one better. It also is great on my EVO.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Loved this production? Saw it in DC back in the late 80s on the rotating stage...was great then. This Jean Valjean was even better that the original.  Definitely a treat for the whole family..if you have young to early teens you can skip the 1 chapter that shows Fonteen(sp?) going down the sad road to prostitution but it doesnt detract from the whole experience.    Kids in school chorus/drama will flip out over how good the music is. It really is unforgettable....24601!!!
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I bought this product was a very good product I have brought a iPad screen television and his performance was excellent and I would recommend purchase
0743243153|4.0|Obviously, our parents were the two most significant human beings to guide and shape our opinions, prejudices, learning, and adoption of our worldview or outlook toward the universe.  Peck makes that clear, as he details the impact his dad had on him.  Depending upon where we went to school, which schools we attended, our religious training, whether in church or catechism or whatever, we learned from those who taught us as we grew up.      One of several individuals that have had an impact upon my thinking is M. Scott Peck--author of The Road Less Traveled.  His book's success speaks for itself.     After reading it I followed up with several of his books published afterwards including People of a Lie.  Peck was a Christian psychologist/minister/writer.  I don't know how he got tagged as being a scientist.  He defined his own place in life, not really fitting into the mainstream.  It was his thinking out of the box that attracted me to him. He is dead right when he says that as thinking creatures one stops \\"growing\\" when he or she doesn't challenge daily about everything they believe and perceive in the universe.      Peck wrote The Road Less Traveled in his late 20's and had one of those unique experiences to be able to find a publisher and publishing it.  It became an overnight success.  I enjoyed this book because he seemed to understand the human condition and wrote honestly of the struggle of good versus evil.  He believed evil existed in the universe.    By the time he had written his 5th book titled Searching for Stones, I had begun to split ways with him.  I read it shortly after it was published in 1996.  In 2007 I was spending time doing what I do fairly often--reflecting back over my past life and asking myself why I think the way I think and why I believe what I believe.  I was reviewing books, teachers, individuals, experiences, and events in life that have made me the personal mental construct that I am with my world view, habits, religious beliefs, and thoughts that make me the mental construct I am.  While doing this I recognized that Scott Peck had a significant impact upon my thinking at a point in time.  My brother and I had shared quotes from his books through the years.  Both of us admired his writings.  But, a question lingered in my mind as to why I moved on to other writers and his impact upon me at a point in time had diminished.  I got on Amazon.com and reviewed all of his books.  I knew that at one time I had read of an angelic appearance, as he described it.  He had called it a \\"spirit of mirth\\".       In the early 80's he had spent time with individuals who were, according to Peck, demon possessed.  One evening he was \\"accosted by a good spirit.\\"  He wordlessly asked \\"what kind of spirit it was.\\"  He speaks of waging a battle with the spirit as to whether he would let it in.  Upon doing so, He described how he was consumed with delirious laughter.    I found a reread of it to be very sad.  In it he detailed a great deal of his inner thoughts and thinking.  While reading it I dawned upon me why I had begun to set Peck's books aside in 1997 and no longer viewed him as mentor.  I no longer saw him as a teacher and mentor.  I saw him as a struggling human soul making his way through life just like all the rest of us, trying to make sense of life's experiences, who and what we are, God, religion, and purpose and meaning of life.  I believe that God uses individuals in our lives as we make our journey.  Peck's words were not written in vain.  He reached out to others attempting to help and assist them think for themselves and understand life and its mysteries.  He ended the Road Less Traveled by stating that the purpose of human existence was to become God.  By the time he wrote Searching for Stones in 1996, he said:  \\"As I reread The Road Less Traveled almost twenty years after I wrote it, I am still struck by the truth that was given me.  I am also struck by a gird of glib quality to its certainty.  Iam not as certain about many things as I used to be.\\"    It is this kind of honesty that was characteristic of Peck.  Stone's is laced with his humanity.  He exposes himself as a human being struggling with life and its meaning and mysteries just like all of us are.  It is almost as if when he grew older he realized that he walked on water at a point in time in his life.  Now, he was looking down, and found himself sinking.  I really didn't need to hear about his struggles with sex, his having sexual relations with his patients, his estrangement from his adult children, or his unfaithfulness to his wife.  I felt I saw some of the ego that creeps into the lives of most people who become \\"celebrities\\" and are fawned upon by the public.  As Bill Clinton said, \\"I did it because I could.\\"  But perhaps, I did need to read about Scott Peck's personal life.    And perhaps Scott felt a need in his life to expose his humanity to his readers and admirers, somewhat the way Paul and Peter did when they threw off their clothes and ran naked into the crowds to show they were human beings among human beings.  I just know that after I finished reading Stone's a second time, Peck ceased to be a mentor of importance in my life.  I saw him as one to pray for and a \\"brother\\" rather than a teacher at this point in my life.   I put him in a category that he had placed all his mentors in life.  He speaks of \\"having lost all his mentors in life\\" before he died in 2005.  Scott was one of my mentors at one time.  I keep his books on my shelf.  When I pick them up again to read them I see myself along the path in the journey of life, and my mind can easily drift back to what I was internally feeling and thinking when I first picked up his books to read them.  They help me recall the thinking that has laid the brick and mortar of my mental construct.  Peck will timelessly have a lot to offer anyone searching for meaning to life.
0316069353|5.0|Favorite line from the book ~ \\"I was thinking of going to Matthew McConaughey with this. He'd be excellent. But who do YOU think could play you?\\" -- A producer asking Mickey Haller<br /><br />The criminal cases may have dried up, but there is no shortage of legal work for Mickey Haller. With the economy the way it is, handling foreclosure cases is where the business is these days. Although he has no shortage of clients, they aren't the clients he would like to have. His heart still belongs in criminal law. But you have to work with what you have. The one good thing is, in traveling from client to client, he works out of his favorite office - the back of his Lincoln.<br /><br />Lisa Trammel used to have it all: the beautiful home, the devoted husband, and the darling child. Now she is at her wits end. Her husband has left her, she is a single mother supporting her young son, and she is about to lose her beautiful house to foreclosure. She firmly believes that something is amiss and hires Mickey Haller to save her house, hoping he will find some sort of loop-hole, manipulation, or illegal action that can stop this insane action. In her anger, despair, and frustration Lisa starts a group to fight against the injustices of foreclosures. She pushes things a bit to far and ends up with a restraining order against her, barring her from going within one hundred feet of the bank that holds her mortgage.<br /><br />Mitchell Bonderant is in charge of the mortgage department and deals with foreclosures on a daily basis. He certainly has his hands full, with thousands of people defaulting on their mortgages and facing the loss of their homes. But he also has his own demons to face, holes he has dug for himself that he needs to get out of quickly. Lisa Trammel is not the only one who has issue with Mitchell.<br />Then Mitchell is found dead in the parking garage of the bank, his head bashed in, and his briefcase open. Is this a random robbery/murder or has Mitchell crossed the wrong person? When eye-witness reports put Lisa within a block of the bank, she is soon arrested for his murder. She vehemently denies her innocence. However, there is some definitive evidence of her guilt and some circumstantial. The question is how reliable is any of it?  Now Mickey goes from foreclosure lawyer to defense lawyer, returning him to the place he loves almost as much as the backseat of his Lincoln - the courtroom.<br /><br />Mickey quickly puts his team to work: Cisco, the hard-hitting, investigator, Lorna, an ex and extremely efficient secretary, and Bullocks, his fresh-out-of-law-school associate. Together they work to wade through all of the evidence in an all-out effort to clear their client. It's not an easy battle though. Mickey is up again a tough-as-nails prosecutor, an annoying, \\"manager-type\\" that seems to weasel his way into Lisa's life and the case, and an every-growing mountain of evidence against his client. And there is nothing that will stand in his way from providing his client with the best defense possible, not even the threats, or the beat-down he takes.<br /><br /> Step by step, Mickey and his team work through the evidence. Disputing virtually everything the prosecution brings to the table taking us all the way to the stunning, didn't-see-that-coming conclusion. Michael Connelly deals with an issue that is on the forefront of everyone's mine today - foreclosures. With the economy struggling, this is something that millions of people are dealing with. He does a great job of explaining things in such a simple manner, that even those not completely familiar with how the process works will be able to understand. It's great to see the struggles that Mickey continues to have in his relationships with his exes, the growth that Bullock shows as the new associate, and to have Mickey return to the back seat of his Lincoln. The Fifth Witness has more twists and turns than a Halloween maze. Michael Connellly will take you for a ride you will never forget.
B003Y5H5KQ|2.0|I will keep this review short, but must disagree with many of the other reviews of this film that praise its artistry.<br />The premise is interesting and original-a girl is being raised by her father in a cabin deep in the arctic woods, and has not encountered the outside world yet, even though she is now 16. Her father has trained her in a vast array of survival skills, including hunting wild game with a bow and arrow, and impressive martial arts. She is strong, fearless, very tough. The time comes to let her experience the real world, and through a series of plot devices, she is carried by helicopter to Europe, where she  immediately encounters all kinds of people who want her to be killed. At this point i found the film to be alternately ridiculous or boring. The reasons why people want her dead are unclear. The main antagonist Marissa, played by Cate Blanchett, pursues her all over the countryside and we don't ever really know why. She enlists various henchmen along the way to help her, and MUCH screen time is used having Hanna running away from danger. Gratuitous violence abounds, with good guys and bad guys alike getting brutally murdered. The various plot turns seem irrelevant and do not hold together well as a story. Although this film appears to be attempting to create the suspense and intricacy of the Bourne Identity series, I think it fails and relies far too heavily on violence and the \\"action\\" of having Hanna in constant motion as she flees her pursuers.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is one of the best apps that Amazon has provided.  I would have to think twice before dropping $5 but this is a very good calendar replacement.  Well done Business Calendar developers and Amazon for making this available as one of the daily free apps.  Works on Xoom table and Evo phone.
B00005K3NR|5.0|A great deal has been written about Carrie because it is such a classic piece of psychological horror. I watched it many years ago with my sister and parents, and that particular viewing has become a piece of family legend. Sissy Spacek stars in this Stephen King book-turned-film, and she is perfect as the ostrasized and oppressed high school student fighting to be accepted. The underlying story of bullying by her peers is a relevant topic today, and the film creates a sharp portrait of the emotional torment Carrie endures by her mean spirited classmates. It is also the ultimate revenge fantasy, and I won't be a spoiler by telling any more details. If you are squeamish or easily rattled, think twice about seeing this movie.<br />  My family and I sat on the couch with our two cats to watch the film, and made the mistake of relaxing and letting our guard down after much of the mayhem in the movie had subsided. That's all I wish to say-if you enjoy a good fright, settle in comfortably with someone you like, try and relax, and be prepared for anything.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|You can pretty much recognize a Studio Ghibli production when you see it. Kind of think of an Anime version of Walt Disney. I happen to like them after reading more about them --they won't license an English release of their product.<br /><br />Taken from Wikipedia:<br /><br />\\"The company is well-known for its strict \\"no-edits\\" policy in licensing their films abroad. This was a result of the dubbing of Miyazaki's Nausica&auml; of the Valley of Wind when the film was released in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. The film was heavily edited and Americanized, with significant portions cut and the plot rewritten. The \\"no cuts\\" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein suggested editing Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. In response, a Studio Ghibli producer sent an authentic katana with a simple message: \\"No cuts\\".[4]\\"<br /><br />I mentioned it because you can rest assured when watching this one, that you are getting the original dialog and plot without any Americanizing. This is important to me because I respect the difference in culture and want a dub to stay as true as possible to the original.I didn't watch this and come away thinking \\"Hunh?\\" because the edits didn't make sense.<br /><br />What I will say is this. I loved this film. More than enough of these reviews will rehash the plot, so I won't do that. The setting in Oz really isn't the centerpiece of the story. It's important, but you get the feeling that you could take these characters and put them in any sort of crisis and it wouldn't matter. This film is more about the strength of family and love. I felt like the writers took a Kenji and put him into their lives to allow us to see just a small part of what can make family so great. Here you're watching from Kenji's point of view, and watching him come into his own. By just being around a family he grows out of his shyness somewhat, develops confidence in himself and learns the importance of love and how it can literally move mountains. All of this because he found a place in a family who accepted him with open arms.<br /><br />This film has some genuine heart and by the end of it, my palms were sweaty and I was grinning ear to ear. I won't lie --I teared up at a few parts because it did a good job of reminding me what it can be like to lose someone important to your family, and how in times like those, we are the angels of each other's lives. Family can save you, and it also can tear you apart if you let it, and that almost happened. The characters were all wonderful and funny and quirky in the ways that make me think of my own family and I wouldn't hesitate to show this film to anyone else. There's no fan service in this film but there are a few jibes about sex --but nothing you wouldn't hear in your own home unless you're some kind of UBER prude or something.<br /><br />My daughter and I really enjoyed this together and I hope we can see other films as good as this one.because he found a place in a family who accepted him with open arms.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Bryan Cranston as Walter White has won three consective Emmy awards for his leading role on AMC's \\"Breaking Bad,\\" and with good reason. Cranston's unwaveringly realistic portrayal of an ordinary High School chemistry teacher turned rogue meth dealer would make anyone take notice. He plays an incredibly intelligent chemist, who, through a series of events, gets \\"stuck\\" teaching high school kids rather than moving on to bigger and better things. This all changes, however, when Walt is diagnosed with terminal cancer and decides that in order to pay for his incredibly expensive chemotherapy, he's going to use his chemistry skills to produce unprecedentedly pure methamphetamine. He reconnects with a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who has drug world connections, and the misadventures that ensue keep you absolutely at the edge of your seat. After just the gripping opening scene of episode one, I knew this show was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. It's hard to not watch an entire season in one sitting because of the show's outstanding cinemetography, extraordinary direction, out-of-this world acting by all actors involved (Dean Norris is a perfect addition as Hank, Walt's good-guy bad-guy DEA Agent brother-in-law) and phenomenal writing and storylines. This show is definitely for adults only; graphic sex scenes and rated R-type violence riddle each episode, but those who are old enough to watch it are lucky. In my opinion, this is hands-down the best show on television. Addicting, well-thought out TV gold. -Sagel Friendsmith
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Far more functional than the calendar app that came with my phone, and, just as importantly, far faster!  Overall very well-designed. Uses the phone's sync software, so doesn't work around the phone's problems with Facebook calendar sync (appointments an hour late, duplicated birthdays). But well worth using for all the other features.....
B004TTMYQG|5.0|It's very intuitive.  Not much more to say. Worth the money. And, you can coordinate multiple accounts. Would be even better with Reqall.
B004LFO0ME|5.0|Trust me on this Wiz is a great artiest. B4 this i thought Black and Yellow was the only good song he produce but man i was wrong. All the songs on the album sound sick! The lyrics n the beats actually mean something not bs like other rappers these day who just pump it up with bass(cough cough...soulja boy). My suggestion on this album:Black n yellow, roll up, wake up, that good, just listen to them all:)
B000X2H8G4|2.0|The amplifier does amplify.  The problem is that it amplifies the forced air coming out of the vents and every other noise in the room along with the TV.  With conversations it does seem better but the other room noises once again add noise to the conversation.
B004SKIPXW|1.0|Besides the fact that this was one of the worst 3D movies I've ever seen, it was the worst Nick Cage movie I've ever seen!! Totally pointless story. I'm normally not bothered by nudity and violence in a film, if there's a point!!! Don't waste your time!
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Great app...It has all the features that I've been lookin 4 with the exception of unable to add birthdays from contacts which would be a great asset for this app other then that this calendar it is 1 of the best  if not thee best .  great job
B004TTMYQG|1.0|its great and all. but it lacks exchange support: specifically push exchange.  my company cannot wait for a periodic update they need my appointments now and I need theirs now.  when you add an appointment here it can take hours before your work calendar is updated on exchange.
B004G6009U|1.0|I purchased this movie a while ago and just recently opened it. I was surprised to find out that it wouldn't play in my Vizio Blu-ray player. I tried several times, but it would actually lock up my player. I sent it back and was quickly sent a replacement. I tried that one on two different blu-ray players and the same thing happened. i went to the internet and found out that a lot of people are having the same problem with this movie. I think it is crazy that Disney would put out a movie that doesn't play on most people's Vizio and Samsung blu-ray players. All Disney suggests is that you update the firmware on your machine. Well mine says it is updated, yet I still can't play the movie. So, I will return this one too and just purchase the regular version which does play. But, I really wanted the blu-ray version.
B00005QXDD|5.0|The song \\"Tribute\\" tells a story of how Jack and Kyle saved their souls from the bowels of the underworld by singing \\"the greatest song in the world.\\"  However when they tried to remember it later...well they couldn't.  So they wrote this song to commemorate the awesomeness of that song!  Seriously, it is a rockin' tune that tells a very funny stroy and yet you can still move to.  Jack Black = pure genius!
B004X4R49Y|1.0|This was a perfectly confected  wedding gift.  However, one must have some sense of decency when having the stage, when having the ear or attention of a great number of people.  Some sense of  what one should portray as good, evil, or as 'okay'.   And the more artful one is, the greater the shame when bad is portrayed as good. The British royal family was portrayed as a cuddly bunch of 'okay' folks with the impediments of wealth and, occasionally, stuttering.  Subject matter matters.  To do a story about a member of this group of people in any light other than dark and brooding, is disingenuous.  However, power can and often does create its own mystique, and its own legend.  This film, along with the upcoming wedding,  is rated RG, for rational guidance suggested.
0441013597|3.0|So I finished. Its like a lot of those Shakespearean things, where there's court intrigue and all that jazz. The fight at the end, I was thinking that he ripped off Hamlet, and I was waiting for Fointenbras to walk across the stage.<br /><br />I figured out that the difference between fantasy and SciFi while reading the novel. Fantasy is Magic + An imagined Medieval Europe, SciFi is Space + Technology + Magic. SciFi that is overly reliant on the magical aspect somewhat loses me when there's all sorts of possibilities with technology. That's where Asimov lost me in the Foundation Trilogy. I was able to accept the plausibility of the concept of Psychohistory, but once he introduced the character of \\"The Mule\\", I was lost as a reader. Herbert does the same thing here: \\"Spice\\" can make you see the future; Paul and his family are Magic! Can you have it both ways?<br /><br />That said, things finally picked up. In my copy, I realized it was on page 411 of 474 in my copy. Things are moving along, a climactic battle is in the works...it happens, but between the chapters. Did that really happen? That said though, it ends in such a way that does feed consumption of the next book. You want to, HAVE TO, know what happens next. It's just not that important for me.<br /><br />It took too long to build interest for me. There were points where I was wondering about the world Herbert built, its possibility in terms of geography and geology and the biology of the place. there were other points where I was analyzing the structural elements of the novel, thinking about narrative voice and scene selection. Not that those are unimportant parts of considering a novel, but if your reader's thinking about them on the first read-through, there's something missing. Unfortunately, that's hard to pin down.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I was in pretty poor shape before I got pregnant.  I was too tired to work out the first 11 weeks, but at 11 weeks I started doing this DVD and it was enough of a workout to make me A) sweat (a lot) and B) SORE!  I started doing this 2-3 times a week...by the time it started to get \\"easy\\" for me, my belly started growing and it was getting to be a real workout again.  I am not 27 weeks and do it about once a week.  I will probably start using it more often when it gets a little hotter and I can no longer go on walks outside.      There are some issues with the sound during the DVD so I gave it four stars (it can be a bit hard to hear, but once you've done it a few times you really don't need ti hear it).      I have not tried the partner workout portion of this DVD.
B004G600A4|4.0|We love this movie! The DVD is great, but there aren't any bonus features other than commentary on the making of the movie.
B00005ASGG|5.0|Great movie, fun characters, great message (Right wins out with courage).<br /><br />Lee Marvin almost stole the movie!<br /><br />If you love the Duke - add it to your collection.<br /><br />(Personally, I don't care if the Duke read the Hollywood phone book out loud - it would still be a GREAT movie.)
0061726826|2.0|The idea of love being a disease in the future is what caught my eye for this book. Unfortunately I did not read the reviews. As many others have already noted (now that I have read the reviews, don't you just love hindsight?) there are some serious flaws in this book. The potential for a great story was there, but this book was a disappointment. Why you ask? Here are just a few reasons:    1)There was nothing special about the characters.  2)The love between Lena and Alex felt unreal and shallow.  3)Lots and lots of filler. In other words, you could easily skip pages in this book and not miss out on the story line.  4) The ending. I hate being left with the \\"that is just not right\\" feeling at the end of a story.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|Product description:  This giraffe toy has four \\"feet\\" -- one plush black and white foot, one red plastic ring with smaller black and white rings on it, one red flat textured plastic, and one small round mirror with a black and white rim. The feet dangle from the plush body, the belly of which also has a black and white pattern. The head and body are plush, but the neck is floppy. A wide velcro-closed loop is attached to the head for attaching to other things.  Review:  I have a 6 month old son, and I'm beginning to notice the short timespan many toys are developmentally appropriate for babies. They just grow and learn so fast! This toy is an exception to that rule. We got this as a Christmas present when he was 2 months old, and at first, he mostly just liked to watch it as we dangled it above him. It caught his interest very well, though -- we would just hold it and twist it gently, and because the neck is floppy, the toys would just dangle and swing around -- worked like a charm at stopping a few fussy fits.   We then hung it from the bars of his activity mat, and he really loved batting at it -- the big black and white foot was the best (my husband called it the \\"hypno-foot\\" because of the black and white swirl and circle design -- and it hypnotized the baby.) Once he was old enough, he really liked grabbing onto the ring \\"foot\\". Now he is teething, and the red flat plastic foot and the mirror foot are great things to chew on. He has outgrown the activity mat somewhat, but likes playing with the giraffe while sitting or during tummy time. I have a feeling he hasn't found the end to it's uses yet!  Very few toys can hold the interest of a 2,3,4,5, and 6 month old (and likely beyond). The fact that this has a nice large velcro loop for attaching to things also means that you can attach it wherever without having to worry about using the plastic ring things -- it can wrap around a carrier handle or a crib rail just as well (which are hard to attach things to with the rings).  Love this way more than the Lamaze giraffe we also have (he has never been too interested in that one) -- so if you're going for a giraffe toy, get this one instead!  UPDATE -- my son is now 11 months old, and loves having the giraffe attached to the bar across his car seat. It worked as a great distraction on some long trips. I think he'll be disappointed when we move him to the next size up car seat and we have no where to hang it!
B001ECDVYK|4.0|This movie is a four star fun fest from the 90's but this blu ray is cut rate with no extras at all , however the picture looks much better than on the truly awful<br />echo bridge blu ray from the states. However alliance could have done a better job on this; only they didn't.  The blu ray is less than four stars but many blus have used; just like this one; the best print around with no cleanup. Unfortunately this fun flick wasn't given the top treatment. however it's not a bad as lets say halloween h20 looks on blu ray.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|As much press as Springsteen gets, I still feel much of his talent and genius goes unnoticed. This box set  is a glimpse into some of that genius. The guy tortured himself till he found his perfect voice for each and every song, something  that would never happen into today's commercial music.    He seemingly was afraid to release hit potential songs for fear he would be forever connected to those songs. I still think he's connected to Born To Run anyway, but I loved hearing studio versions of songs like The Promise, Fire, Because The Night,   and some songs rarely heard like Talk To Me and It's a Shame.    The documentary cd was a real treat to see.  The black and white footage of Springsteen and The Band, when they all had hair  and were skinny...lol       And I thought releasing the notebook was a brilliant marketing angle, as there is no way for people to illegally copy a notebook, aside from photocopying it, which is not the same. I think it's a lesson in music marketing for today's age.    The concert cd's were fantastic as nobody performs live like Springsteen, be it 1978 or today, just phenomenal!    Needless to say this is a must have for Springsteen fans and well worth the 90 some odd bucks, buy and enjoy!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is such an improvement over the default calendars that it feels like Android 5.0. Great work by the devs. Worth every cent
B004N66XYE|5.0|Not being familiar with the original series this was based on, I had no idea what to expect from BBC's remake of Upstairs/Downstairs - even so, that did not prevent me from being so completely surprised as to the depth with which I would enjoy it. This turned out to be a wonderfully done period drama that, instead of choosing to romanticize the era, took it on headlong and approached such topics as the evolving political scene and how it directly affected the lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place with depth, while still being tactful. In other words, the story did not deflate from the inclusion of such a sensitive topic, rather, gave the series a more believable dimension.<br /><br />Another thing I was impressed by was how there was not a single extraneous character, how all the different story lines came together so artfully. In particular, Adrian Scarborough's portrayal of Warwick Pritchard, the Butler, was absolutely delightful - he stole every scene he was in and I found myself disappointed that Pritchard didn't have more time on screen. If I wasn't hopelessly enamoured with Upstairs/Downstairs already, his stepping in to deliver Lady Agnes' baby would have sealed the deal for me.<br /><br />I will say that this did suffer a bit from the time constraints. Three hour long episodes were not really enough, and there were instances where elements of the plot felt rushed - even a little choppy - although that could very well be from PBS' habit of cutting out several minutes worth of often pivotal scenes when UK programs air on Masterpiece. Overall, however, despite my complaints about the length, it was inspiring, enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in British drama.
B004G6009K|5.0|Ill refrain from talking about how good this movie is because there's enough good reviews about Tangled out there.    The price offered by Amazon is very reasonable compared to here in Australia and I've also received this product from Amazon way before expected and way before the release here.    What more do you want?
0515142247|3.0|Disregarding the outrageous premises in this book, it is a decent read.  But once again, Child has committed another blaring error.  He goes on a long rant about the physics of a bullet in flight.  Unfortunately, he doesnt seem to understand basic laws of physics.  The speed of a bullet fired horizontally doesnt affect the time it takes to hit the ground. If you fire a bullet horizontally from 5 ft high at 1,000 ft per sec and drop one from your hand from 5 ft up at the same time, they will both hit the ground at the same time. Other than that, its a decent action novel.
0316056863|4.0|This is a pretty funny book that's a lot more than just the backstage gossip that celebrities offer up as humor on late-night talk shows. Tina really makes herself vulnerable, and she has a wild imagination and a gift with metaphors and images. You actually feel bad for her when she isn't treated well by some fan or coworker. You can really sense the hurt. At the same time, there's never an insult that Tina can't turn into a comic moment. She takes herself wonderfully unseriously. It's a quick read and a mood brightener.

B001V9LPWQ|2.0|I have not ordered this item.  I will not order this item. I almost did, until I took a second look at the price.  This item is so overpriced, that it will not become a part of my Disney collection.  I can't believe Disney would charge this much for a Blu-ray disc.  I give the movie 5 stars, but the packaging and cost bring it down to a 2.  Sorry Disney.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|This movie is very excellent, if you happen to be a Final Fantasy fan. The thrill of character cameos is underwhelming if you don't know the characters from Final Fantasy VII. However, it's not too hard to follow if you're unfamiliar with the cast----it just takes away the fan service aspect of the film. It's very well-made and entertaining from start to finish. The only downfall is its dependency on the game's story, which a lot of people may not know.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is just what you need so you can play with friends. There is not much I can say. Long lasting, good quality, and easy to use.
B00138CXFS|5.0|I bought this LP version shortly after it was released.  My favorite cut from the entire album is Embryonic Journey. Two guitars in one of the finest and most beautiful \\"Classical/Rock\\" pieces EVER recorded!  The sound quality on the CD is what was the standard for Rock music of the era.  Nothing special.  But if you want some of Airplan's eariest work, this is the one to get.  I also like Plastic Fantastic Lover...FUNNY!
B00499K9E0|4.0|Got better as it went along.  Beginning was hard to follow...Sherlock spoke so quickly I could barely understand what he was saying.  And the person in charge of casting should have picked dissimilar looking men when he/she cast Dr. Watson and the police detective.  Other than that, it was quite fun and very interesting.  Look forward to seeing another.
0895260131|2.0|I had serious problems with this book. I don't like how he attacks arabs for raiding and then justifies the crusaders. This is why Arabs think real Christians are warmongers when in fact we are not. He gives Christians a bad name by making it look like its bad for Arabs to kill whoever but the Crusaders could kill whoever they want. What happened to thou shalt not murder? love thy neighbor as thyself?<br />I myself do not like Islam, sorry. I just don't and thus I don't practice it. But I also don't think that the way Mr. Spencer wrote this book did anything for those who profess Christianity. So for you Muslims out there who think that this book reflects pure Christian thought, think again. Christians don't kill Muslims. They love and pray for them. The Crusaders were not Christians, they were religionists.<br /><br />Anywho, I did like how Mr. Spencer compared and contrasted Jesus and Muhammad. Gave me a nice point of reference. I also kind of liked how he wrote a little of the history of Muhammad's life, however I think I would rather read it from a history book or something, or some kind of a commentary. I chose to buy this book because it was short, almost like a magazine, and I am kind of lazy. :) But oh well. Not what I hoped for. I was still reading Spencer's online journals until they became excessively overwhelming.
B0040QYROK|5.0|Fritz Lang's epic Metropolis was the inspiration for such influential films as Blade Runner. The city has a cold metallic look that was mimicked by basically every dystopian future film after this and the dark smoky environments of the underworld were a definite influence on any film that establishes a gritty atmosphere with bleak, dirty streets. The plot centers around Freder Frederson, the son of Jon Frederson who is the overlord of Metropolis. Frederson is awakened from his idyllic existence by the woman Maria and he discovers the suffering and joy of the working man who his father tyrannically works around the clock like machines. I will not give away the rest of the plot here, but it combines drama, comedy, action and romance into one really entertaining films. Definitely purchase this if your fan of good sci-fi, or just a movie fan in general.
0060523808|5.0|Legendary CEO Louis V. Gerstner Jr. pulled off the turnaround of the century by bringing IBM back from near bankruptcy. He completely remade IBM, a monumental task considering its size, its hallowed traditions and mission, its strong corporate culture, and the remarkable challenges it faced in a rapidly evolving marketplace. He details the steps he took to resurrect IBM and restore its legendary leadership position, and he explains why he chose a bold, risky path to strengthen and unify the iconic company when astute observers believed it had become an irrelevant corporate relic. Gerstner says that even though he wasn't an author, he decided not to use a ghostwriter. Be glad he stuck with his own voice. getAbstract finds that he has written a superior business book: analytical, well organized, focused and methodical - a work of masterful storytelling in straight-shooter prose. Current and aspiring CEOs can learn from Gerstner's war stories and from his visionary leadership. This may be an ironic twist, considering Gerstner's famous quote that IBM didn't need vision - it needed superior strategizing and marketplace performance. As it turns out, he supplied all that and vision, too.

B000000OQF|5.0|I think I am ready to call this one as the best hard rock album ever.  It's that good.  I remember buying this on cassette as a kid; it was one of the first I ever bought, if not the first.  Not sure whatever happened to that cassette but I now have this on CD, as should anyone who listens to rock.  There is no filler on this record whatsoever.  The vibe jumps off the speakers into your body with an electricity that makes you feel you're in front of the stage circa '87, rubbing elbows with the dissident dregs fresh off the streets of L.A.    There are no bands these days that even come close to this type of vibe, licks, or writing.  The attitude of this record just slaps you right in the face.  It holds up as well in 2011 as it did the day it was released.  If anything, I have much MORE appreciation for it now, realizing how mind-blowing the whole thing is.  You can just feel the intensity coming from all of the band members listening to this.  And of course, it features one of the greatest lead guitarists ever, showing his prowess like a ferocious lion.    If you were around when this came out, a lot of the songs are sure to bring you a wave of nostalgia as well.  They might even if you weren't around back then.  Everyone has heard the singles from Appetite a hundred times or more but let me tell ya, they don't ever seem to get old and they sound a lot better off the CD even than on the radio.  To sum up, I would consider this basically the untouchable reigning masterpiece of hard rock and I don't think anyone could ever top it.    Axl sums up the overall attitude of this record very well at the end of Out Ta Get Me when he says, \\"So you can suck me-- Take that one to heart!\\"    P.S. This recording was played with a lot of soul that no one plays like anymore.  I also did want to mention that I almost always buy original recordings as opposed to remastered.  There is a lot of info on why out there, if you want to read or watch videos about it.  Record companies today are engaged in what is being called \\"The Loudness War,\\" where they \\"re-master\\" older recordings to make them louder and bring out parts that were harder to hear before.  It sounds all well and dandy until you realize that doing this destroys the dynamics of the original recording-- it equalizes the volume of different segments of the recording so that the volume is louder but doesn't fluctuate as much.  So a part that was intended to be louder than the rest originally might come out really dulled out and doesn't have the original impact.  So anyway.  Just my little speech on that issue.
0307595579|5.0|I sent this to my cousin who loves to read and lives where they don't even have cell service. She had not read these yet and I wanted to share. When she picked them up and brought them home she was so thrilled she called me right away and said the package was so beautiful and cloth bound books in different colors plus a bonus book about Stieg Larsson. What a great gift. I want a set for myself... Its so nice to pick a gift that makes someone so happy. And wait until she reads the books she will even be more thrilled. Great offer Amazon thanks...
1594202842|5.0|I am no parent. I am a university student who heard about Amy Chua's book on the Colbert Report. Initially, I didn't care about buying the book, but as I watched the interview and listened to what Chua had to say, my interest in the book really picked up.    I am a self-taught trombonist of eleven years, and I really wish I could have had someone pushing me to do my best. In middle school, I was told that I played at a university level, but because of the fact that I didn't have access to professional tutoring, I ceased to improve. My point is that I don't think there is anything wrong with strict parenting. Sometimes it is necessary to try to inculcate virtues into children that won't learn them on their own.     Chua's book offers an insight into a different style of parenting that does not suggest the \\"everyone's a winner\\" attitude. I don't think this parenting style is for everyone, but I certainly think it is interesting to think about, and Chua gives an EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING READ. I read it twice.
B00007ELEL|1.0|I just didn't get it. Not funny at all, ridiculous plot, and a waste of good actors.  Bridges is annoying in his cheech and chong role. Goodman is equally annoying, and all he does is curse the whole time. I cant find one good thing to say about this movie.  I kept waiting for something, but it never happened. Absolute waste of 2 hours. The most perplexing part is all the good reviews it has gotten. HOW? and WHY?   DO not waste your time!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Wanted to see what all the HD/BluRay fuss was about. It's true, you can see the pores on Ripley's face. It's kinda cool. Cool commentaries. Not sure if I care about the last three that much...although resurrection isn't too bad (what's up with the white baby's nose - hard to take seriously - all kind of off track).     Basically bought this to get my fav Aliens on BluRay, turns out. Probably still a good buy. Remarkably non-crap packaging of the discs. Nice little booklet with slots.
0439023513|5.0|****SPOILERS******<br /><br />I have become a fanatic of The Hunger Games series.  After I read the first book, I made myself read three in between before I read Catching Fire.  Then I waited three more books to read Mockingjay.  Then, when I was reading Mockingjay, I was constantly sad because the series was almost over.  I love The Hunger Games, but there are many things that I wish had played out differently in the novel.<br /><br />First I'll start with the positives:<br /><br />Collins really knows how to pull at the heart strings.  Peeta coming back hijacked was awful. I had often compared him to someone in my life, and then when Peeta no longer loved Katniss I realized that the metaphor remained. When Finnick died, I had to tell myself \\"don't cry, don't cry\\" as he was one of my favorite characters.  He added humor and surprisingly a little wisdom to the story.  Then Prim of course was a terrible death.<br />I loved the line \\"You love me. Real or not real?\\" and then \\"But there are worse games to play.\\" Usually, I like the endings of a book in general, but the final line doesn't round out the book.  I finished Mockingjay about 4 hours ago and I keep thinking and rethinking those words.  Both the ending of the story and the Epilogue were killer.<br /><br />Now the long negatives...<br /><br />The deaths were too many.  I know (as has been already stated) Collins was trying to portray the true violence and bloodiness of war.  But, at some point enough is enough. There are so many deaths in the book, that the ones that do matter become overlooked. I understand that Katniss is strong, but when over half of the people you love die, isn't there a breaking point? It bothers me that she only shed a tear (although that was not explicitly stated) over Prim. Really, the deaths of her beloved should've \\"sunk in\\" way before hand.<br /><br />Katniss' weakness. She never really faced her problems. She went into a corner and sympathized with herself. Multiple times. Also, at these points when Katniss is in her own world, I find the book becomes muddled and confusing.  It's a tough thing to do, writing a book in 1st person of somebody losing it, but Collins needed to do that without losing the reader.<br /><br />And finally, the ending.  Yes, I said I liked the words. However, the general picture disappointed me immensely. Since Book 1 I was waiting to see who Katniss chose, contemplating the options. I was always a solid Peeta-fan, but Gale truly loved her and I was waiting to see how Collins played it out without really ruining their friendship.  Honestly, Collins didn't even solve the issue. Gale went away and was \\"probably kissing someone else's lips.\\" This I find sickening, because I honestly don't think anybody gets over someone that fast. Also, she describes Gale as being bloody, destroying, violent. In fact, he was tender. Kissing her bruises, always having her back. The fact that Gale's fault, thinking of humans as prey, was summed up to be his whole self, bothers me. Then of course there is Peeta. She never really lets us know if he returns to his old self. Obviously, he never will be entirely the same, but what I wanted to know is did he fall in love with her all over again, or did he remember his past feelings for her. Was it the old Peeta, the boy with the bread, she married? Or the one who was struggling not to kill her? I feel that Peeta, my Peeta, was lost forever, and there was no mention of it.<br /><br />Everybody I know says they loved The Hunger Games and Mockingjay, but were bored by Catching Fire. I honestly find Mockingjay far more boring in the standpoint that a)half of the time Katniss is having an emotional breakdown b)the deaths lose significance and c)the outcome of her killing Coin and marrying Peeta was very predictable. It obviously had to happen, and the excitement for me was seeing HOW it happened. But Collins didn't do that. She made Katniss kill Coin in a very muddled and confusing state, and summed upher life with Peeta in 3 pages.<br /><br />Still, it's left me thinking. Mockingjay has made an imprint on my mind, and regardless of whether or not you like the book, there's something to be said in that.ockingjay has made an imprint on my mind, and regardless of whether or not you like the book, there's something to be said in that.

I use to use the standard android calender to manage my school and work schedule, but I hated not being able to easily view my friends schedule. Not only does this app allow this, but the widgit is so boss.  Favorite app, by far.
0316113506|5.0|Without going into my own personal history and divulging too much of personal information, I will say that this book was interesting from the beginning until its end.  I know, a book about the brain seems to be fated toward boredom, but not in this case.<br /><br />Not everyone who reads, knows about the brain.  If you are not a medical student of any type, you would have no reason to know about neurons, axons, dendrites etc.  You would not know about neurotransmitters or synaptic clefts.  This book explains it in such a way that it is vivid, real and understandable.  It also puts into focus how the brain works in activity and without.<br /><br />I disagree with those who have said this book is repetitive.  There have been many studies on the brain-especially in children, yet our schools still operate the same way and so does our society.  Until this book, that message was missed on me (a former brain injury patient as a child).  I now realize what we've missed out on and the opportunities that we have lost because we have missed the fundamental importance of what Dr. Ratey is saying here.  I appreciate the examples of studies and their findings as well as the stories about the lives that have changed.  If one school can make such a small change that made the difference so they were able to outpace all other students in the world, all of our children deserve that!  Did you know about Naperville Central?  I sure didn't!  In fact, a number of my friends home school and I've forwarded this information to them and we will see how well their kids do after they implement something in their homes.<br /><br />I have recently returned to school and found myself having difficulty with something I am already doing.  Anatomy and Physiology is such a part of my job that it makes no sense that I am failing practicals whereas I had never failed anything before (even since returning to school 3 years ago).  To me, the answers lie within what Dr. Ratey is saying here and I'm more appreciative for this information that I can possibly verbalize.formation that I can possibly verbalize.

0786939532|5.0|Anyone who's played DnD or enjoys Tolkien won't be disappointed with this series, featuring the Drow (dark) Elf named \\"Drizzt\\".  This opening to a lengthy series is par for the high quality of writing that is consistent through all 22 books, most of which are available on the Kindle.<br /><br />DnD geeks won't be disappointed - taking place in the Forgotten Realms universe, the series covers most of the charted world, and a majority of the monsters and races in the DnD rule books.  Salvatore has an excellent feel for the DnD world and gives equal time to action and character development.

It has some nice extra features as well, my daughter loves the deleted scenes and the feild journal that asks all kinds of questions about the movie and what you learned about Fairies.  You don't have to have watched the first two movies to follow anything.
1595141715|2.0|I just read this book because I am a school counselor, and I discovered that several students at our school were reading this book. I was worried about the content and possible messages the book is sending. I realize that there is a potentially good message in this book: \\"What you do makes an impact on other people, so think carefully about how you treat others.\\" I completely agree with this message. Unfortunately, I think the dangerous messages in this book are more frequent. The characters in the book were constantly wondering, \\"If I had done something differently, would Hannah still be alive?\\" This dialogue could communicate to teenagers that if they do or say the wrong thing, they might cause someone to commit suicide. This is too heavy a burden for anyone to carry. A person who chooses to end his or her own life is responsible for that choice. If someone hurts me, they are responsible for their hurtful actions, but they are not responsible for how I deal with my pain. Furthermore, adolescents already tend to have a false perspective on life that this book perpetuates: \\"If others are causing me problems, my problems won't be fixed until those people change.\\" This is a message of hopelessness because we can't change others; we can only grieve the hurts we experience. Hannah's character chose to get revenge and take her life instead of taking the risk of telling someone exactly how she was doing. She is not a good model of how to handle the trials of adolescent life. If you are an adult wondering if your teenager should read this book, I personally (and professionally) do not see many benefits from reading this book, but I did get several potentially dangerous messages from it (aside from the sexual content, which I would also be wary of).
B002C6K7N0|3.0|Let me say this first. Megadeth is my soul band. I enjoyed ALL the albums(including Risk, yes!), but this one is just less melodic and harsher to my ears than any of the previous albums. I appreciated Megadeth because of the melodic influence that you don't find in other thrash bands.<br />It's a good album, the lyrics are awesome but the melody is missing. I'll never stop loving Megadeth but I must admit...after listening to this album, I really think Friedman should have stayed.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Secretariat is a good movie about an amazing horse.  I remember watching him win the triple crown back in 1973, but until now I didn't know the story.<br /><br />Frankly, I went into this movie with quite low expectations.  I do not really consider myself to be a great critic of movies, but I do watch a lot of movies, and I know what I like.  And I like this one!<br /><br />How do I know that I like it?  First of all, I don't recall looking at my watch once during the viewing.  Secondly, I caught myself smiling to myself many times as the film progressed.  Third, after I finished watching this film the first time, my wife wanted to watch the second half again (she had fallen asleep), so I watched it again with her...and I finished it again, even though she fell asleep again.  (Don't think badly of her...she gets up EARLY and runs, so she tends to fall asleep, even during movies that she really likes).  I also found myself smiling and enjoying the show the second time, just like I did the first time.<br /><br />There's no need for to me to tell you the story of the film, that's for the film to show, but I found that this is a genuine feel-good film, even amidst the interpersonal challenges faced by the horse's owner and her family.  It was not an easy road to the Triple Crown, but it is a road worth riding.<br /><br />The acting was quite good, though there were a few weak moments here and there.  I have to admit that I really liked John Malkovich's character...hats and all.  I also liked the jockey quite a bit.<br /><br />I can tell you that if you like this film you will also almost certainly like [[ASIN:B0031RAOVY Hachi: A Dog's Tale]], [[ASIN:B00005JMCN Seabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)]], and [[ASIN:B000E0OBMY Dreamer - Inspired By a True Story (Widescreen Edition)]].<br /><br />I don't know if you are like me, but I actually tend to like some films that have a degree of sentimentality in them, and Secretariat has a good dose of that.<br /><br />5 stars for the whole family!

The dvd holders are made of very very cheap plastic and are held together with packaging tape. the only saving grace that rates the 2ND star is that i love this series and i can get the entire 7 seasons in 1 package.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I am currently playing two MMO's (WoW and Rift).  I play one FPS which is Left for Dead 2.  I have not used this Gameboard with LFD2 but I do not except any problems.  This is the first Gameboard type device I have used.     I bought this Gameboard due to the amount of repeated key spamming in both WoW and Rift.  What a pain.  In Rift certain characters require multiple macros in which... yes, you have to spam (1111111 yes! time to hit that 2 for my special 2. 1111111.. you get the idea).  I was also running out of reasonably located keys to assign on my keyboard, so it was time to try a Gameboard.    When I first got the Gameboard I had no real troubles in setting it up.  I did not read the documentation and pretty much watched the tutorial and played around with things until I got them to work.  When I first starting using it, I will be honest... I hated it.  Make note that there are no keys above the WASD (specifically the W key) as you find on a normal keyboard.  So if you are used to using 1,2,3,4,5,6 for various abilities in game this omission will torture you for a couple of weeks.  At least it did me.  I paid far too much to give up so I trudged on.  It took me about three weeks to get comfortable with the Gameboard, your mileage may vary.  I first started using it for doing quests.. moving my character around and playing with various key assignments (while getting used to the keys).  I found myself reverting back to my regular keyboard when PVP'ing.  I knew there was no way I was going to try it in my FPS game until I was completely comfortable with it.    I am happy to say that there is no way I would give this Gameboard up now.  I am very comfortable with using it.  Instead of spamming the 1,2,3, etc keys I simply hold them down due to the built in ability to \\"repeat a key\\".  Certain macros such as self buffing now with a press of a single key target me then my pet and delivers the correct buffs(the Gameboard allows you to record macros, complete with delays in between key presses for those annoying global cool downs).  Instead of worrying about the keys that I used to use above my WASD I primarily use the keys keys to the right and left of the WASD on the game board while keeping my fingers on the WASD more often (achieved by assigning any type of key press to a single button such a CTRL-1 being assigned to say key G13).  For multiple characters you can set up multiple profiles (The M keys, I believe there are like 4?, You could also create another Game profile if you need more.. IE. Rift2)  For Rift, this is a must since the varying macros/keys needed for each toon seems to be dramatic.    The LCD screen is not simply cool but I would completely miss it if I didn't have it.  You can display various third party programs and in other games you do not need a third party program it simply supports the game you are playing (IE. WoW).  For me, I use Teamspeak in Rift.  I can see who is talking.. latency etc.  In WoW I use Vent.. same features since both programs support the LCD.  I use Advanced Combat Tracker for Rift and when tracking my DPS in groups I pop it up on the LCD.. it's sweet. Out of the box you can use it to view RSS feeds, see the music you are playing.. countdown (count up) timers.. Etc.. I could go on, but the LCD to me is now a must have.  It allows me to not have to hook up a second monitor.    Pros:    Ease of set up: Without pouring through documentation or long hours of playing around I believe I had it set up for Rift in about an hour.  Obviously it takes time for each game and where you want certain key presses/macros to be on the Gameboard but outside of that, easy.    Programmable:  Very flexible with many options to choose from. You can change the colors of the keyboard for each profile as well.  Nice visual reminder of what profile you are using or if you are on the right profile for the game you are playing.    Comfort:  Wont slide around on your desk.  Lays solid.  The WASD keys have a concave dip to them which allows you to find your normal hand position without having to look.  The tilt to the Gameboard also keeps your wrist comfortable.  The \\"ramp\\" on the Gameboard is very comfortable as well, the material used is a nice addition.  The keys have a pleasant feel to them.  I don't care for the keys that are around the joystick portion or for that matter they way the joystick feels but the rest is ok by me.      LCD:  As mentioned above, it's icing on the cake for me.  I am surprised how many third party programs support it. If they support the G15 they also support this G13.    Construction:  This thing feels like it is meant to take abuse.  It certainly doesn't seem to be cheaply made.    Performance: I haven't had any issues with the Gameboard after many hours of gaming and using various functions of the Gameboard.    Price:  I thought the price was high for what I considered at the time a \\"would be nice to have\\" but now, I believe the price is spot on for a quality product.  It seems so many items now-a-days are made cheap and you can tell, but not this bad boy.    Cons: There was a recent hardware/software update that added the ability to lock your profile.  Before the Gameboard simply selected your profile when you started the game.  Now, I find myself scrolling on the LCD and locking my game in.  Minor annoyance and it could be me not looking for a way to leave it on \\"auto\\"? I continue to refuse to read the documentation so this is on me of course.    Learning curve:  Another minor ding.. This will vary by person but with the keys missing above WASD I would be willing to bet most gamers will hate this Gameboard at first.    Joystick: This may be a personal thing but I find it to be sluggish when trying to use it to move your character.  That is unacceptable in an FPS or when MMO PVP'ing.  I use the joystick to view my character and to escape whatever screen is open. The buttons around the joystick open up the map and view my inventory.  Works nice and I turned this in to a positive.  I love using the joystick and its buttons to perform character functions.    Final thoughts:  I don't think you can go wrong with this Gameboard.  I also believe the hardest part to get used to is lack of the keys above WASD but once you do get used to it you wont care and if you are like me, you prefer not to remove your hand to use the old 1,2,3,4... and like not having them.  You will have to be willing to spend the time to get used to it which can be frustrating but with it in the end.  LCD.. Again, SWEEEET addition.  Another interesting note is now when I try to use my regular keyboard for gaming I feel cramped--as if my fingers are much too close together, I have all but given up on using the regular keyboard now.  Now that I am dexterous with my Gameboard (I am one of those FPS players that jumps all over/around/atop of things in my MMOS due to being twitchy), I am looking forward to rolling players in my FPS' with this bad boy.  I will have to report back.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I'm not quite the purist that many reviewers on this site have shown themselves to be. In fact, for the most part, I actually enjoy many of the revisions that they made to the special edition of the original Star Wars. I just don't quite understand why you would rather see the Vaseline smudge underneath the land cruiser--and hey, the snowspeeder isn't translucent anymore. And who doesn't laugh at the beefed up audio of the storm trooper whacking his head in the background of the control room shot?  Be that as it may, it remains pretty clear that as soon as Lucas got his hands on modern special effects, his creativity and production value plummeted dramatically. That's why I won't be buying episodes 1-3.  But I almost bought this special edition set anyway. What stopped me? You threw reminders of your horrible movies into my classic movies. I do not want to see Jar Jar, I do not want to see Hayden Christensen. And a young Hayden Christensen at that. And even if it wasn't Hayden... old Yoda, old Obi Wan, and young Anikan?? It doesn't even make sense. And messing with the actor under the helmet to make him look more like Hayden? He's old and disfigured--does he really have to look anything like him in the first place? If Lucas would just remove Hayden and Jar Jar from the special edition of episodes 4-6 (and the whole Han vs. Greedo debacle), I would buy it.

B002FGU41C|4.0|I have been purchasing and wearing Teva sandals for over ten years. They are well made and durable. I have never yet had one fall apart. That's an important reason why I keep using them and I do use them for at least 300 days out of the year. A major annoyance with many cheaper brands is that they break which can be quite annoying when one is out and about with only one usable shoe. My only quarm is that they cannot be resoled.

0525951652|1.0|WOw, begining of the book was interseting. BUt when we met the horribly stereotyped police & girl being abused I was apalled at how unreal and contrived the story seemed.  When the lower classes are well educated & well spoken I was shocked. When the characters have sex I was bored.  Overall I don't think I can finish this tedious novel. There are a few inaccuracies that can be forgiven, but they still remove your attention from the plot.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|i didnt know how many stars to give this.  The free version gets 5 stars, but since this review is about the paid version, it needs to stand on its own and it only gets 3 stars.  tThis version seems to lose presets often and if you are listening to the radio and get a text, aything longer then hello, the system freezes on buffering and never fully buffers and needs to be restarted.  Sometimes a simple restart works, othertimes the phone needs to reboot.  Never had these problems on the free version... Also, to the developer, an excellent upgrade for this would be a timer that would automatically start recording a program.
B004G6009U|5.0|I had never heard or seen this animated film being advertised, except for when Jon Hamm came on the Conan show, and did a plug for this trailer. Just the one scene had me laughing out loud, and I was convinced I wanted to buy this movie. I am 30, but still love Disney animated films, and was glad I added this to my collection of Disney movies. Everyone already wrote what I wanted to say, but  the animation was superb, characters were very likable (especially Rapunzel, and the horse - hilarious), and I just liked the fact that disney finally made a movie of this classic story. I'm surprised they took so long, actually. A very enjoyable movie!

0756404738|2.0|First, I liked the first book and coudn't wait for the second.  What a let down.  Questions never answered (unless I missed the answers):  Who exactly was Bast?  How did he and Kvothe get together?  Where did \\"Reshi\\" come from? And why the interminable pages about Falurian?  I could go on, but why.    And most of all where did that ending come from?  If I knew Ademre finger language I'd say--\\"most disturbing\\".
B0041KKYEM|1.0|After all of the trailers and other reviews, I didn't expect a movie that steadily looked more and more predictable: the movie about the ballet impresario who consumes ballerinas. I didn't expect a movie about a major art institution that, behind the curtain, seems on the verge of bankruptcy, conducting its preparations for a performance in a toilet. I didn't expect a ballet company that looked like it had spent three years training in Ethiopia. I could not get more than 20 minutes into this movie before I turned it off and found something else to do. I hope that someone involved in producing this film garnered some sort of benefit from it; that would be swell. I would have preferred a bit more imagination.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book is designed to coach you through a project (a book, a new business venture, a diet, acquisition of physical fitness, the recovery from a broken heart) from conception to finished product. The author explains the concept of Resistance.<br />\\"Resistance is a repelling force. It's negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.\\"<br />This is a quick and easy read. You will probably want to read the entire book and then go back and really think about how you can apply this stuff to your own life. I now understand why I get stuck on many of my creative projects.

B004LFO0ME|5.0|I have been listening to Wiz since the release of his first studio album, \\"Show and Prove\\", in 2006. I purchased the two studio albums following \\"Show and Prove\\" (\\"Deal or No Deal\\" & obviously \\"Rolling Papers\\") and listened to every official mixtape of his after \\"Prince of the City 2.\\"  I have done my very best to listen to every single of his that isn't on any albums or mixtapes.  I know Wiz Khalifa's music inside and out.  I am proud to say that Wiz is essentially the only reason I still listen to rap music, and 75% of the time, it's Wiz I'm listening to.    \\"Rolling Papers\\" represents an almost perfected formula that Wiz has established for constructing an album that is a mix of catchy beats and fun lyrics that deal with what he's all about instead of shooting people, beating women, and/or just being a \\"gangster\\" idiot in general.  I listen to every song on this album regularly, and I don't know about you, but I can't even come up with a HANDFUL of other rap albums that I can do that with.  Usually, I'm thrilled with an album where maybe half of the songs are awesome.    For those of you who complain that Wiz is \\"commercial\\" now, grow up, and stop being so selfish.  Sure, songs like \\"No Sleep\\" are a little too Pop even for me, but I still enjoy songs like it once in a while.  Besides, he can't cater to every single fan's personal wishes for every single track.  He's doing what he's been saying he was going to do since day one - become rich and famous through his music.  Congratulations, Wiz, because you've done it.  I sincerely hope there's plenty of years to come for us to appreciate and just simply enjoy listening to your music.    Oh yeah, and one other thing - T.G.O.D.

B001LA3JWY|5.0|A reportage tracking and tracing the lives and experiences of six survivors of the Hiroshima atom bomb attack of 1945.<br />  From the first mysterious white flash,Hersey tells-in a detached style that make the horrors more personal and real to the reader-the bemusement of what had caused the cataclysmic destruction (a cluster bomb? Magnesium being showered down and igniting when in contact with electricity? Petrol sprayed and ignited?)the burns and wounds-Tanimoto pulling a burned woman from the river and her skin comes from her arms like gloves from a hand;not easy to forget-the strange illnesses and-finally-the rebuilding, as life goes on.<br /> In addition, Hersey visits Hiroshima 40 years on and looks at the lives his subjects led after the bomb;a struggle for understanding from a nation that regarded survivors as freaks;to try and put the whole thing into some context;to forget or-as with Kiyoshi Tanimoto-to use the horror as a warning to the world and as a focal point for peace.Tanimoto's story is perhaps the most revealing.He was-to a great extent, weather intended or not-very much exploited by the American media who took over his good idea;cynics would say certain individuals were using the moral question of the A bomb and Tanimoto's campaign for self agrandisement,and I'm one! There's also the painfully crass 'This is Your Life' appearance by Tanimoto.You wonder at the insensitivity of 'welcoming' an unsuspecting guest of such a horror with a 'countdown' to when the bomb hit Hiroshima as an introduction to the audience as to who the subject was, closely followed by, \\"And now a word from our sponsors\\" and a demo of how fantastic the sponsor's nail varnish is!This is perhaps a greater indignity to Tanimoto than the bomb itself.<br />  This is a vital piece of history, magnificently recorded.(Did Capote use this as a template for his equally brilliant 'In Cold Blood'?)I started reading this late in the evening and found myself reading late into the night to finish it-it is that good and 'unputdownable'.It is not a book you can lay to one side after a few pages and come back to-as I foolishly thought-so make a space in your day to read this entire.It will be a time you will never forget,and neither should the world.it is that good and 'unputdownable'.It is not a book you can lay to one side after a few pages and come back to-as I foolishly thought-so make a space in your day to read this entire.It will be a time you will never forget,and neither should the world.

B00280LYIC|3.0|I had heard so much about this series I really wanted to fall into the book like I did with the first Harry Potter book. Not so much. It's not that it was bad. I actually felt like there was a seedling of something really great in this book, but overall it was disjointed and all over the place. It made more sense when I found out the author was a grade school teacher and tested each chapter out on his students. Every chapter felt like a short story unto itself. They kind of pieced together, but really just felt like a book full of short stories. I get that he was probably trying to create a modern day Greek mythology book, which is often written like a series of short stories, but unfortunately it didn't translate that way. I'm giving it three stars instead of one or two because I did end up reading the entire series, and the author got better and better as the series went on. All the way up to the most recent installment, which was actually fantastic! So, if you can get through this first book, it really ends up being a great set of books.

0756405890|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  Everyone told me I would REALLY like this book.<br /><br />I don't, much.  In fact, I find it indescribably annoying.  It's not just the fact that the author doesn't know the difference between \\"lie\\" and \\"lay,\\" or \\"nauseous\\" and \\"nauseated,\\" or that he invariably spells \\"all right\\" as one word, \\"alright.\\"  And it's not just the fact that I don't much like the protagonist, who isn't despicable enough to be a real anti-hero.  It's more the fact that nothing actually happens, despite numerous chapters ending with statements like, \\"Little did I know that tragedy awaited the next morning.\\"  Reading The Name of the Wind (great title, though) is kind of like listening to an aged grandfather sitting on the porch in his rocking chair, fondly reminiscing about every minute detail of his life.  Not really an engaging story so much as a series of incidents that fail to build to any kind of climax.  500 pages into it and I'm still trying to figure out why I should care about any of it.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  I requested the second book in this series, The Wise Man's Fear, from the library before I decided I didn't like the first one, so I gave it a try.  It's way better, and I can see that the author was mainly using the first book as a set up for the rest of the series (or so it seems).  Still, I think 700 pages of set-up is excessive.<br /><br />And I stick with my opinion about the difference between \\"nauseous\\" and \\"nauseated.\\"
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I first read this book about six months ago and it has stuck with me since then.  As far as a dystopian novel goes, this one has a straightforward premise: boys sign up for a walk in which only the victor will survive.  It is highly publicized and attracts the attention of bystanders as the boys trudge through the storms and up and down mountains in their vain attempt at fame and fortune.  Throughout the walk we learn the story of our protagonist and the stories of the fellow walkers, giving explanations for why anyone would be willing to risk such a horrific death.<br /><br />Personally, I would not survive such an experience.  That is what I thought every time a boy was shot down for walking slower than the 4 mph speed.  I cringed at the idea and description of attempting to relieve yourself or even tie your shoe when every second wasted was precious.  Like all Stephen King novels, the ending is crazy.  But it is not enough to detract from the entire story.  Months later, I am still fascinated by the concept.  I loved this book.
B001P3SA94|5.0|excellent movie, just loved the music it was great, Beyonce did a great job and so did the rest of the actors.
0061726826|4.0|I wonder if my opinion on this book would be different if I hadn't read Matched before. It was very much written in the same type of style. Some of the content and thoughts of society were very similar as well. Perhaps it was the hype surrounding this book or that I had read so many RAVING reviews. Either way, it didn't quite make the mark for me.<br /><br />The story flows well, the author has a beautiful way with analogies and symbolism. Her writing style is very descriptive and flowery. At times I wanted to skip paragraphs just to find out what was going to happen next. It moved on the slower side but I think that is mostly because of the in depth descriptions of emotion and surroundings. I felt like it took a while to really get settled in and I became really tired of everything smelling like sweat and mold.<br /><br />The content was great. I loved the excerpts of their governments books at the beginning of each chapter. They really helped me understand the indoctrination that had allowed this society to exist. I am really interested to see where she goes with it as a trilogy. I thought the book easily could have just been a stand alone story. Yes, there were a few loose ends and curiosities looming in the end, but nothing that made me completely hooked and dying to see what happens next. I was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />As far as appropriateness for TEENAGERS.<br />There is a small amount of language in this book, nothing horrible. Certainly the topic of suicide and torture are discussed. If the infatuation in Twilight bothered you, this will too. I understand the intensity of love, but not all teenagers would be prepared for the extremity that the author takes it to. This book is listed as a Middle Grade, Grade 9-12, Young Adult. I would strongly encourage parents to go through this book before allowing your teenagers to read it, you know them best. Though there isn't anything completely inappropriate, there is a lot of soft touching, passionate kissing, and a bit of looking at each other naked. Because of the poetic writing style, it is very intimate.each other naked. Because of the poetic writing style, it is very intimate.

076115678X|4.0|Please be aware that for some reason Amazon has not created a new page for the updated second edition of this book, therefore any pre-December 2010 reviews will not take into account the improvements made in the updated version.<br /><br />I have both the first and second editions of this book. As a curly haired curl with straight-haired parents, it wasn't until I bought the first edition of this book that I had any idea how to properly care for my hair. The main features of Massey's method are not using sulfate-based shampoos or any products containing silicone, styling the hair by scrunching with non-drying gel after washing, and preferably towel and air-drying the hair, or at least attaching a diffuser to your hair dryer. There is more information than just that in the book, including recipes for home-made hair products and specifics for how to cut and colour curly hair, but that is the skeleton of her approach. Although the hair-cutting information is meant for stylists, when my hair was very long I used it to cut my own hair and gave myself the best haircut I've ever had. Since using her methods I get a lot more compliments on my hair.<br /><br />While the basics of the approach remain the same, the second edition of the book represents a significant increase in the amount of information shared. The book is about a centimeter taller and thirty pages longer and the formatting in the second edition (ex. smaller font and less empty space) means each page has more information. There is less silly \\"fluff\\" features (although some remains) and in a very helpful addition, a short 25 minute DVD means you can see the techniques demonstrated. The second edition has new information for curly haired men and children, and about grey hair. In addition to the introduction to Massey's haircutting technique, she provides guidelines for trimming your own hair, and at least two of the \\"curly girl\\" profiles explicitly discuss women acting as their own hairdresser. I suspected that since Massey now markets Devachan hair products, she might do a hard sell in the book and remove the homemade recipes. Instead she doesn't mention them a single time, and she has increased the number of recipes in the book. Most importantly, she has expanded her system of curl types from three (essentially waves, loose curls and tight curls) to seven different categories (S'wavy, Wavy, Cherub, Botticelli, Corkicelli, Corkscrew, and Fractal or Zizag) and has completely reworked the \\"African American hair\\" chapter from the first book (which revealed she had very little experience with black women's hair) to something much more satisfying. I would not recommend the first book to women of African origins with very tight curls, but I think this new edition definitely has a lot to offer.<br /><br />I also prefer the tone of the new edition. The first book was a strange combination of strident and goofy, and almost felt like a hair-centric polemic written for tween girls. Because everything was written in extremes -- like ALL wavy hair is like this and NO curly hair is -- I got extremely confused trying to fit myself into her hair-typing system. Many characteristics of my hair meant it was wavy, apparently, despite the fact that I had ringlets on my head and my hair curled even when cut down to be two inches long. I have since realized that few people fit exactly into one specific category of hair texture -- most curlies have multiple textures or tightness of curls over their head. It's worthwhile reading the descriptions of all of the hair types and trying techniques from each one to see what works for you -- although the seven category system makes it much easier to make sense of what's going on, and what to try first.<br /><br />My only real complaints about the new edition is that despite there being four specific hair care routines described in the book (one for Wavies, one for Botticelli, Corkicelli and Corkscrew, one for delicate Cherub curls and one for Fractal orZigzag) Massey made the questionable decision on the DVD to only demonstrate two of these routines. The DVD content includes sort of useless demonstrations for how to prepare simple hair-care recipes, and people talking about their hair. Given that I appear to be closest to the \\"Cherub\\" hair type, I would have loved to see the techniques described in the book - which I'm not sure I completely understand based on the text - demonstrated on video. This exclusion is sort of illustrative of a larger problem in the book that certain hair types strongly dominate in the pictures, hairstyles, and demonstrations - notably Botticelli, Corkicelli and Corkscrew. Although there is something for everyone, people with different hair types might be frustrated to not be more represented in the book. Similarly, folks who are not new to caring for curly hair might be frustrated that there isn't more information here - while this is great for beginners, there are lots of different techniques and perspectives which can be found on the Naturally Curly website, for example about dew points, hair porosity, hair care ingredients, and styling techniques like \\"plopping.\\"Zigzag) Massey made the questionable decision on the DVD to only demonstrate two of these routines.

Similarly, folks who are not new to caring for curly hair might be frustrated that there isn't more information here - while this is great for beginners, there are lots of different techniques and perspectives which can be found on the Naturally Curly website, for example about dew points, hair porosity, hair care ingredients, and styling techniques like \\"plopping.\\"
B001UV4XI8|2.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I\\" is being released on Blu-ray in plenty of time to capitalize on the final installment of the saga, due in theatres this July.  Warner Brothers decided to divide the last book of the series into two motion pictures to incorporate as much plot and as many characters from the novel as possible.      Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is the primary obstacle to the total control by Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) of both the wizard and human worlds.  Voldemort has sent an army of Death Eaters to find the young wizard.  Accompanied by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), Harry embarks on a journey that finds him crossing paths with many of the characters he's previously encountered at Hogwarts.    Director David Yates handles the action sequences effectively. The film starts with a terrific chase in which Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns many of Harry's closest friends into Potter clones to confuse the Death Eaters.  Another standout sequence is Harry and friends' infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.  Unfortunately, the film's pacing is sluggish and bogs down the proceedings considerably.     This installment is far different in tone from the first.  It is darker and downbeat, plodding and repetitious.  The special effects, as usual in a Potter film, are very good, but the magic isn't there.  Back are familiar characters Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).    The three-disc Combo Pack edition contains Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy versions of the movie.  The main extra is the opening scene of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II.\\"  There are also additional scenes and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.  The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Awesome tool to have for a quick rundown of your wifi. not only was i able to see all the networks near my house but i improved the connection a bit by switching to a channel not used by the majority of the people around me. Moto xoom and droid2.
B000FILW86|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Cheap Trick, and have since 1977 (yep!), when my brother turned me on to their music. That was basically at the start of it all - from second album In Color - and right before going big with Budokan.  I remember seeing them on their first big tour.<br /><br />I've enjoyed their music over the years, and have noted that some albums work better than others (as is normal with bands that exist over decades, and record dozens of albums). A friend - another old fan - highly recommend Rockford.  That, plus my girlfriend actually being from Rockford, made me want to get the album.  At that point, it was hard to find (a couple of years after release), so Amazon came in handy.  That built up the anticipation even more.<br /><br />After getting the disc and listening to it, my feelings were of disappointment and mediocrity.  I really wanted to like it, but the Trick seemed to only be going through the motions.  Yeah, it's obviously Cheap Trick, and has their characteristic sound, but the songs for the most part aren't memorable by any means, and aren't particularly satisfying. Some actually sound kinda dumb. I hate saying that, but it's the simple truth.  I've given it time, and repeated listens too, but that hasn't helped.<br /><br />The only good and worthy song - in my opinion - is the final track; the wonderful \\"Decaf\\".  It's funny because the name comes from the main chords in the song.  A witty little \\"trick\\" from Rick Nielson bag of fun.<br /><br />I recommend passing on this one, and going with \\"The Latest\\" which is really great!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Finally a movie where all the good guys die for a change.  It's actually quite shocking they murdered off so many people in this film.  I love it when the Nancy Reagan chandallier crashes down on Glenn Close's head.  There goes the first lady!  I love the aliens in this movie.  The special effects are actually pretty cool.  This is a dark comedy and you have to be a bit twisted to really enjoy this macabre massacure.
B00009TB5G|5.0|One word: perfect. Lots of extras. 30 extra minutes of scenes on the movie, and, each of them are truly relevant, make the experience richier. If you have only seen the theather's version, It's highly recommended to purchase this one.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|There's a reason why this movie prospered on home video: It works as an intimate story. It has a great, simple theme: That regardless of your circumstances, there's a way out. We make our own destiny.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004W9C6IY Thugs (screenplays)]]
0316056863|5.0|As one of the multitudes of people who love Tina Fey, I couldn't wait to read this book, and as usual in these cases I regretted reaching the end. But there it is. The book is like the woman--at least the one we know from television--outrageously funny, edgy, shocking but never atrocious, quirky, and super energetic. So smart, Tina Fey manages to write an autobiography that feels genuine, that lets you in on her childhood, marriage and in-laws, new motherhood, and, well, there's that hit show she produces on television--while at the same time being hilarious and full of whoppers. Literally, there's never a dull sentence, or one that doesn't end in some crazy surprise. You get to enjoy both the warm memoir experience and almost nonstop comedy at the same time.    Because good comedy always contains tragedy, Tina Fey really does convey pain: the awkwardness of coming of age and feeling like a geek; the exhaustion of working long days as a new mother; cruel personal emails from people who don't like her work. She handles all things either with humor (some of it very blunt) or with genuine warmth, which starts out feeling like a surprise until you realize that she really is a nice person, at least as revealed here. She writes sometimes quite frankly about her Republican parents and her country-folk in-laws (\\"I would like it explained to me in writing what's so great about apple butter\\"), and manages to be funny without ever ridiculing or belittling them. In fact, you come away realizing she respects and loves them.    In the delicious section about her SNL impersonation of Sarah Palin, Tina Fey recounts how careful she was to protect Palin from booing or other disrespect from the audience, both to avoid the appearance of setting up the governor and because of her basic decency. (She points out that comedy is much stronger when it is not political.) Still, she received hate mail for what she \\"did\\" to Palin. She writes, \\"I am not mean and Mrs. Palin is not fragile. To imply otherwise is a disservice to us both.\\"    The book provides a great inside look at how much work it is to put on a comedy show, and what obstacles women face in that male-dominated world--without once being tiresome or preachy, or running down any male. What she does do is persuade the reader that women are truly funny. Tina Fey frequently includes the word \\"exhausted\\" when she describes herself; so maybe one of her best gifts is to make humor look easy.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I've been a long time supporter and  user of the Android Addenda Widget. While this app may not have the display customization of AAW,  it's month-view agenda  easily makes up for that.
0300169787|5.0|This is a book that you can spend hours looking at.  The book is beautifully designed with a lenticular cover, moth print end papers, and huge color photos of McQueen's work.  It's also a lot bigger and heavier than I expected considering the very reasonable price.  The text is informative, and the pictures are sharp and clear so that you can really see the workmanship and details that went into the clothes.
0761536434|3.0|The Ultimate History of Video Games is ultimately a misleading title. While the book does do a good job at detailing the rise of the industry (mostly through Atari) it spends more time talking about the hardware of consoles, lawsuits, and internal arguments than the thing that actually makes video games so interesting: the games themselves. Worth reading for the first half, but left a lot to be desired.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Very polished, smooth and responsive. The ability to record stations for later playback later is probably one of the best features.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Google calendar.   I live by it.   I never thought anything would compare to it let alone surpass it,  but when this app was a &quot;today's free app&quot;,  I figured why not.   I absolutely love it.   I will be getting a new phone in a few months (upgrade from original Moto Droid)  and I will gladly spend the $4.99 in order to get this app again.   Highest recommendation!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moEQQOIWYDYNIE]]Just by listening to the songs \\"Miss The Misery\\", \\"Arlandria\\", and \\"Bridge Burning\\", you know the Foo Fighters are back, and this album is, in my humble opinion, their best by far. They also played the album straight in one shot at foofighters.tv. That shows that there was almost no studio enhancement at all, and it was really instruments and intensity alone. My album of the year so far.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I have a problem with authority and the male love interest, a vampire, really makes me mad. The main character, a 35 yr old historian, has rcv'd tenure at yale (yeah!?) and is a super powerful witch of all time but has no damn sense. Her vampire boyfriend (with wolf instincts, no less) is controlling and literally tells her to obey him... and she does. Oh, and when she is ready to sleep with him he tells her no. So they don't.<br /><br />The plot - an uber powerfull witch falls in love with a 1500 yr old vampire, he declares they are married, and think about having vampire/witch babies while trying to figure out why a book is so important.<br /><br />I swear the main character is asleep, eating, or drinking tea for at least half of the book.<br /><br />I promised myself that I wouldnt buy another book for 2 weeks if I splurged on this semi-expensive kindle edition so I am really angry that it was a complete waste. So if you'd like to borrow it just send me ur email and save yourself the waste.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I had issues with the novel, and I have similar issues with the film.<br /><br />The humanizing of Hannibal Lecter, for me, was a big mistake.  I liked the mystery that surrounded him, and the edgy compulsions that gave him such a sickeningly sinister underlining.  Sadly, `Hannibal' makes Lecter the victim and thus separates some of the fear and intrigue we feel for him.  Add to that mix the fact that the actual villain here is nowhere near as interesting or as viciously fear-inspiring as Lecter ever was and you have a complete downgrade from the Oscar winning `Silence of the Lambs'.<br /><br />Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors, for he has a boundless ability to stretch himself regardless of genre.  He actually creates some impeccable imagery, and he creates a tone that is all its own and remarkably effective in parts.  I agree that the `wild boar' sequences don't carry the weighty feeling of dread like they needed to, but I disagree that the final `dinner' sequence was a parody.  In fact, I found that scene to be the best in the film, and the delicious way that Scott played with the preposterous romanticizing of Clarice and Hannibal was downright flawless.<br /><br />I do admit that I walked into this with a hinge of preconceived irritation.  I always hate it when a series replaces a prominent character with another actor or actress, and so the fact that Foster wasn't returning in the role that won her the Oscar upset me.  That isn't to say I prefer her as an actress (as much as I love `The Silence of the Lambs' I have never understood Foster's Oscar win, and I prefer Julianne Moore as an actress an infinite amount) it's just the principle of the thing.  That said; both Moore and Hopkins sizzle when needed, and so I cannot complain about the acting.<br /><br />The film's overall construction and thematic impact leaves much to be desired though.  It all starts with the story, and this story needed a little more work.
B000GG4Y32|1.0|To all of you people who have raved about what a wonderful, endearing movie this is, which glorified a Communist dictatorship during the birth of the most ruthless, repressive, genocidal regimes in all of history: how would you feel if, instead of Warren Beatty glorifying the Communist revolution he had made a film glorifying the Third Reich and shown the Nazi leaders as idealistic and self-sacrificing? Another question, do any of you still have any doubts that Hollywood has been peddling Communist propaganda for the past half century? If so, let me direct you to films like Che, Cuba, The Front, The Motorcycle Diaries, just as a start. All of these limousine Communists make me sick.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Known for making very BIG films, Michael Bay isn't the first person you'd think of to direct an intimate film about the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Isn't that concept more appropriate for someone like Steven Spielberg?  And then, when watching `Pearl Harbor' you instantly understand that it is a Michael Bay film and you can see why the logic in him staying away from the project would have been good to heed.  `Pearl Harbor' has very big and very loud moments, and those moments usually go off without a hitch (for to say that Bay doesn't understand action would be a lie), but it is within the more intimate corners of the film that it completely falls apart.  I will not entirely knock Michael Bay, for I am one of the few cinephiles who actually thinks `Armageddon' was one of the best films of 1998 and would actually place it higher than the Oscar winning `Saving Private Ryan', which got almost everything outside of the direction WRONG.  That said, I cannot muster enough appreciation to negate the fact that `Pearl Harbor' fails miserably in doing what it attempts to do.  Maybe it's because none of the actors (who have all proven themselves capable before) turn in stale performances that draw no emotions from the audience, and maybe it's because `Pearl Harbor' loads on the familiar clich&eacute;s thicker than `Forrest Gump' did, and without the same amount of finessed execution.  Maybe it's because the film doesn't maintain focus and so it becomes wildly uneven in tone.  Maybe it's because all integrity of the situation is lost in a shameless attempt to create a Soap Opera.  Whatever it is, when all is said and done, `Pearl Harbor' is a forgettable spectacle; a film that throws a lot at you but fails to make anything stick.
0439023521|5.0|Amazon Book Review   The Hunger Games is a captivating action, love, hate novel. Suzanne Collins captures every aspect of Katniss Everdeen's predicament. Alone with the battle for love, Katniss faces twenty-three other boys and girls set on survival; the problem is they are all set out to kill her. This is one of those stories that make you sad, happy, angry, and afraid all in a matter of seconds; in other words a true page turner.    As I read through this book, I felt like of was in the Games alone with Katniss and Peeta; I could feel the sorrow Katniss felt for Rue, the respect they had for Fox-Face, and the pity they had for Thresh. As a teenager, I can relate to their internal struggle; maybe not the trying to kill each other aspect. Although, the internal battle Katniss has over choosing the right path in the games was easy for me to relate to the process of choosing a college. The fight that Katniss had in the beginning, about her feelings towards Peeta, was identical to my choice in whether or not to start a relationship before I left for college.    Overall, this book was amazing; I would recommend it to any age from fifteen and up. No matter you gender, nationality, hobbies; I bet you will like this book.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Great plot, characters and presentation.  Very relatable if you work in the corporate environment.  Funny, sarcastic, and crazy things are said and done to make you watch it again.  Prompted me to buy the second and third seasons.
B004HETR6S|4.0|Ok, so Dave's voice is shot.  That being said, this CD is a showcase for Doug Aldrich.  He is phenomenal. Remember the guitar solo in Rock'n'Roll?  You'll find it here.  This disc is full of tasty guitar licks too.  It takes me right back to the '80s. For me that's a good thing.
0807014273|5.0|To find this book at the exact time I was struggling to find a reason for my life, to me, was no coincidence.   This book, to use the cliche, changed my life. I came across it entirely by accident, looking for research material on Auschwitz.  Frankl's philosophy, and basis for logotherapy, that man must have a meaning to his life is basic to human existence. We are shaped by the past, but we must live for the future.  And I must comment on a previous review, you missed the point Frankl was making entirely, when telling the man who's wife had died about the reason for his experiencing pain. Try rereading that passage, and the entire book for that matter, because you are truly missing something that could change your life.
0891419195|5.0|I loved Band of Brothers, and eagerly looked forward to its companion mini-series, The Pacific.  But I found that fine follow-up presentation overshadowed by this riveting, absorbing, exceptionally well-written account of what it was like to fight as a Marine in the Pacific.  \\"Sledgehammer\\" authored, for me, an unforgettable book describing the hell of war from the perspective of soldiers mired in mud and constant rain, fighting for their lives and country, enduring an interminable battle for island territory.  Eugene Sledge brings you right to the battlefield, and shares the courage, bravery and incredible spirit of the Marines, page after fascinating page.  A very highly recommended book if you're interested in the Pacific theater of war.

B00001W9G0|5.0|In my humble opinion, this DVD represents the conflict of a lot of marriages - some of us grow apart, some of us grow stronger together.<br /><br />It really depends on how much two people are willing to comprimise their true values and morals due to their separate upbringings - either you choose to hang together - or not - you both can choose to make your lives complicated - together - or not!
030746363X|1.0|If your buying this to lose body fat...Don't. Buy and follow the Atkins diet. I did it for years and never felt better or regained weight. My  check ups were superb and my doctor was impressed.I stopped smoking on New Years so I decided to go off my astkins lifestyle for 3 months and pig out to substitute for my nicotine cravings. I gained 30# but knew I could take it off quickly.. I decided to follow his advice to the t because i was impressed by his claims..6 weeks and $400 dollars later none of his claims were true. I'm starting atkins tomorrow which is much more enjoyable and easier to follow. I guess anybody could write a book and get rich.

B000NOK06W|5.0|All of his great works are in here, and all are of great quality. I was left in awe to learn of all of his works, sadly I only learned after hearing his movie scores. He is so very much more, and this edition proves it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I loved this movie,and the way it reminded me that strength courage are a powerful thing when they come they come from the inside, no matter how big or small you may be.  Sometimes it takes a lot of work and commitment, but you can have that strength if you're willing to give it all you got.  I would  reccomend for age 10 and over,followed by a talk about how they can develop their inner strength.
0802473156|5.0|If you don't have this book, then you need to get it right now! I know that it's changing my life right now!
B004I4H8PO|2.0|My CDs/DVDs also had glue on them, ugh.   What a mess.   I am reviewing on this alone, don't really expect these kind of problems from a set that costs 100 bucks.   Quality control leaves something to be desired.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|It goes without saying that I am a huge fan of The Name of the Wind, so obviously I was excited about The Wise Man's fear. This one just never seemed to go any where. Rothfuss seems to beat the same crap into our heads every other chapter. It just seems childish. I feel as though the author talks down to me quite a bit. He did this in the first one a few times too. I am capable of understanding what having no money is like. You are not the only person in the world who is poor, get over it. It's like Rothfuss doesn't think that I am capable of understanding very simple things.     <contains some spoilers>    We get it he's poor. Seriously enough. We also understand he likes his lute quite a bit and he feels naked without it. Enough with Denna. I hope that dumb girl gets hit by a bus. The most amazing thing about this book is Denna's ability to show up whenever the story was getting good only to wreck it. Kvothe could be in some secret base on the moon and Denna would somehow be there, and neither of them would think anything of it. Then he would travel through a black hole into another dimension and he would run into Denna again. They would flirt and there would be yet ANOTHER description of her then ANOTHR and ANOTHER.     I thought Tempi was a cool character I was excited for us to learn more about him but as soon as anything came of him he was taken away never to be seen again. The whole ketan fighting thing was a little goofy. The names of these 'moves' were ridiculous. As Kvothe made Dances with A Blade of Grass In the Morning but kind of in the Afternoon on a Sunday, while having sex with everything that moves.     This whole story is starting to feel more and more like Harry Potter. Young boy who doesnt know who he is, bad man kills his parents, boy goes to school to learn how to kill the bad man, boy goes on adventures to better himself to kill the bad man, runs into the bad man, has a stupid love interest that is only there as filler and has no reason for being there. Not to say that's a bad thing, that Daniel Radcliff is so dreamy.    <end spoilers>    If you liked the first one you will probably read this one. It's not all bad. There's still plenty of cool stuff in here. Hopefully the third day will be better.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|You wont be sorry you read this one, I think for me its her best yet. Your emotions are challenged on so many levels its like a literary roller coaster ride. Eloquent & believable dialogue throughout an extremely convoluted journey of a woman in search of herself
B004DK5CW4|5.0|It was a great movie to watch at home with the family.  I wish I had seen it at the theatre.  I highly recommend for the entire family (and friends).
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The  movies have become separate from the books and, in the case of Harry Potter, I think there is just more to love.  HP and the Deathy Hallows, Part 1 has slowed down a bit to let you catch up with the characters. Being a \\"part 1\\" there is a lot more exposition than the last 4 films: These characters have grown up and changed, the audience needs to catch up with the Harry,Ronald, Hermoine trio before that final conflict.  The screenwriter, as always, did a marvelous job of capturing the feel of the book and compressing it into length of this film.    The dvd/blu-ray itself is just fine. It is a bit fun to be able to watch the movie with all the details and background added in and narrated by cast and crew (if you're interested).
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I am not sure why they even made this movie unless it was to rip off the fans. Literally, worst movie I have ever seen. Well, the Heartbreak Kid was a little worse. Seriously, if you love Sex and the City, don't bother with the movie.

B000002GXX|5.0|I was just entering my teen years when this album came out. Everyone I knew had a copy and I wore my vinyl down to crackles and pops. I replaced it with the CD and, 35 or so years later, still love this album as much as the first time I heard it. There are the hits, such as the title song One Of These Nights, Take It To The Limit and Lyin' Eyes. Journey Of The Sorcerer is an instrumental that has a unique Eagles sound. Too Many Hands has a funky beat with lyrics that mean more each time I listen and the closing song, I Wish You Peace, is a sweet ballad. A brilliant collection of songs by a band whose sound has endured the test of time.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This was for my niece.  The only thing I can say about it is that it was delivered very quickly, which was nice during holiday season.
