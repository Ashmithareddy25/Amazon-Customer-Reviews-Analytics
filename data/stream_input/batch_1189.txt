B001U7FW1O|5.0|Nice collection of songs and videos from this 80's band.  Highlight the great end of the compilation with the orchestral \\"All In One Day\\". Superb!  I miss some of their early works of post punk era with John Foxx like \\"Distant Smile\\" or Dangerous Rhythm\\"  Recommended album for an 80s music lover by the way.
B002OSY2T6|3.0|My 6 month old really does like this toy and it always grabs his attention. If you are looking for it to roll, it doesn't work on carpet...even the short stuff. It only works on our hardwood floors, which I don't really want my baby rolling around on since the floor is so, well, hard. I feel that it is good for tummy time but only for about maybe ten minutes, then baby gets bored. That's just our experience!
B003K07DUC|2.0|I was expecting much more from this movie. I guess I expected a lot of action similar to the Bourne movies in which Matt Damon has appeared, but I was sadly mistaken.   It is an ok movie, too political and not enough action.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Going in to see Thor, I wasn't expecting much. I mean how can they make a movie about Thor, he's way to bad ass for cinema. However after seeing Thor, I'm at a loss of words. It was amazing, I like how they made him an alien and not a GOD. Him being a GOD would have made it too cheesy I think. Acting was great, Chris Hemsworth was amazing as Thor and Natalie Portman is beautiful. Can't wait to see The Avengers and more Thor.

B003BKF696|5.0|New listener to this band (heard Mumford & Sons do a cover of The Nationals song, London).  Now a new fan, love all the songs on the CD, and the more I listen, the better I like it.  Amazing vocals.   Arrived as promised and on time.  Quick and easy purchase, no hassles.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This app is great. Graphics and game play is like the ipad, but it keeps freezing on my G2x. I can&apos;t finish level 3 without freezing.
B003E6K1VK|2.0|I really like the way the Fiio E7 looks, feels, integrates into my listening style which means i can strap it to my iphone or connect it to my computer.  These are about the only two sources i use to listen to music.<br /><br />The Fiio E7 drives my Denon ADH5000 headphones really well and boost the sound quality and volume.  I have to be careful because I will literally destroy my ear dums because I can drive them so loud without loosing any clarity which is due to the denons being great headphones and the amp giving them plenty of juice to destroy my ear drums.  I wish that Fiio had spent a little more effort in the build quality of the connection points.  They are all loose which means if the amp moves at all or the connector from your headphone moves, you music will cut in and out.  It gets tiring really fast...I wish they could fix this issue because I LOVE this amp.  If they could fix that issue I would be back in a heartbeat for another one.<br /><br />Returning it now back to amazon and their wonderful customer service.
0553801473|3.0|Other reviews have summed it up quite well so I won't get into detail. After reading this book I felt that it could have easily been combined with the previous book in the series to make one book at under 1000 pages which would have been more successful at keeping the plot moving at an adequate pace. The series really needs an editor who is willing to push back on GRRM's paunch.<br /><br />That said, I still couldn't put the book down. The writing is as engrossing as it is ultimately unsatisfying.
1416550550|4.0|The Forgotten Garden was a very good read. There was just a little too much back and forth from the years for me. But, it was a pretty well told story with mystery and love interwoven, so it was worth keeping up with the back and forth from the past to present.
0061990477|5.0|As a Catholic, this book about a priest who has a forbidden love affair with a woman he has known for almost all her life did give me pause about reading it, but I found the book to be one of the most enjoyable reads I've ever had.  I had a hard time putting the book down.  It also gives insight into the characters that the famed 1983 TV movie leaves out, especially about Meggie's early life.  I would recommend this book to a limited audience, as staunch Catholics would have big issues with a priest breaking his vows of celibacy, but those who could look past this breach would enjoy this book.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|It is hard and makes you think. Not just another game to pass the time. If you like Tower Defense games, you must try!
0545259088|2.0|Warning: I do have a some spoilers in this review. The first in this trilogy, Shiver, was a wonderful book. It can stand alone and not be part of a trilogy, and I recommend stopping there. Linger was a decent book for the middle of a trilogy, but Forever was a huge disappointment for me because what I consider the main issue was not resolved for the reader. The ending was not at all satisfying. I felt like the entire middle book was working up to a definite cure, a definite fix, (the entire reason for Cole, it seemed) and that continued in this book but it was all for nothing since the ending here was so completely up in the air. If you are reading reviews of all three books before reading the first one, I strongly recommend you read the first, Shiver, and skip Linger and Forever. I no longer trust this author and won't be reading any more of her books.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|works great on DROIDX.  It does have to reload if screen times out but that&apos;s a minor annoyance.  Just as much fun as it was on my Ipod.
B004LWZW2E|1.0|Wow, after reading all of the \\"This is the scariest movie I've ever seen\\" reviews, I decided to get this movie and after watching it, I can easily sum it up in one word: DISAPPOINTMENT!<br /><br />This movie is nothing more than an homage to the following movies: \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"The Amityville Horror\\" (1979), \\"Ghostbusters\\", and \\"Star Wars\\". Yes, you read it right-- STAR WARS!<br /><br />In a nutshell: People move into a new house, they think it's haunted, the move, new house seems haunted. Kiddo goes into a \\"coma\\", Darth Maul makes appearance, all hell breaks loose, call in the exorcist, seems it's not the house that's haunted after all.<br /><br />As others have stated, the first half of the movie is great, the second half completely destroys any positive strides that the first half made. I myself jumped a couple of times!<br /><br />I believe that if they had let out the two bumbling \\"Ghostbusters\\" that this movie might have had a chance.<br /><br />A message to George Lucas--hope your Darth Maul costume is still stored away, the 'bad guy' in this movie seems to be wearing it!<br /><br />By the way, I'm a life-long horror movie fan and this one isn't anywhere near as good as \\"The Exorcist\\". You're better off watching all of the movies that this one seems to be ripping off (listed above).
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Not even the acting GENIUS that is Gary Oldman could carry an entire film...he's tried this several times with bad scripts and ends up being the only light in a very dark tunnel.<br /><br />This movie could only be described by me as DULL.  The visuals were great...I loved the settings, even the music was suitable to the film...but everything else, the acting, characters, script, storyline...etc....well, it was DULL.  I was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />Other than the visual aspect, I can also say (on a positive note) that the movie was obviously geared toward a younger crowd and other than a few make out scenes with some physical contact, the movie seemed suitable as far as gore and fear factor.  I would think perhaps 15-16 and up as far as age suitability.<br /><br />This movie was so played up, I'm not sure that any but the finest film could have lived up to that sort of hype.
0553801473|5.0|Look, there are lots of jaded people leaving poopy reviews for A Dance with Dragons. That's their right. But George R.R. Martin has written five incredible books with some of the most engrossing, fascinating and despicable characters ever created. His villains are the vilest. His heros and heroines often get murdered. You grow to care about what happens next to a character and the character meets some foul end. Others persevere despite the fact they probably don't deserve to draw another breath.<br /><br />I strongly recommend you buy the whole series. You'll finish it and you'll care about the story. You'll care because it's a well crafted tale of magnificent scope and spellbinding detail. I have no idea what tool the guy is using to keep track of everything but that in and of itself must be a nightmare to manage. Martin must live in the dwarf's head and have a bird's eye view down into Cersei's oft exposed nether regions. This is certainly not The Hobbit. The Song of Ice and Fire contains a great deal of sexual content so it's for mature audiences although personally the slavery and constant murderous schemes should be more troubling than the lechery.<br /><br />Want engrossing characters? Got it. Want family feuds that end in mass murders and open war? Got it. Want undead zombie hordes threatening to overwhelm the realm? Got it! Martin has packed a little something in for everyone. If you like your high fantasy without any salubrious glossing over of the wretched realities of living under petty kings then A Song of Fire and Ice is a great series. Yes, Book Five fails to resolve many disputed issues. Yes, Book Five leaves the reader without a clear idea of who will rule in Westeros. That's fine, you'll want to buy Book Six. Worth every penny.
B003HC8ITI|4.0|While I saw the original 1951 animated film when I was a child, and had the LP that told the story in an abridged form during my younger years, I've never read the Lewis Carroll novels, nor do I really remember much from Walt Disney's original masterpiece. What I can attest to is how beautiful and entertaining Tim Burton's version was. I've read several reviews from those who did not care much about this film. Those who hated the deviation from the original story. Those who hated the deviation from the animated film. Those who thought it was another fantastical, yet watered down, version of Tim Burton's imagination. I suppose all of those opinions could be true. However, while I can understand how tired it is to continue seeing Depp in a lot of makeup and playing what appears to be the same character with a different voice in yet another Tim Burton movie, the fact is, this was a Disney feature film. It wasn't budgeted for Tim to go all \\"Tim Burton\\" on it. It needed to appeal to kids and adults alike, and this film greatly achieved that. Disney is using the most colorful and imaginative director to bring to life another Disney classic in order to achieve the same success as Pirates of the Caribbean. Adults and children alike are very familiar with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, so to have expected anything more than what was delivered was unrealistic. To go farther Tim Burtonesque would have resulted in a movie Disney would not have been able to market. To move further away from Tim Burton would have watered down what Tim is good at. The visuals, action and theatrics of Alice in Wonderland were the perfect mix of original story, contemporary taste and modern talents. No one else could have pulled this film off better.
0385342055|4.0|Although Shopaholic Takes Manhatten Is still my favorite in this series, this was a fast paced humerous story.  Minnie Brandon is a chip off the old block. Looking forward to the next book that is probley going to be based in LA.
B002BNKQDK|4.0|Well acted and possibly the best comic adaptation of recent years. At times however it feels like Snyder overused action sequences and gore too much. The overall message from the graphic novel was there, middle aged vigilantism, and at times kept the same brooding nature. Some scenes were altered for continuity and to make the story line look like it happened in a a matter of days. Changing the ending, though it may appear as heresy to the fans of the graphic novel, made the Watchmen acessable to a new audience while allowing for the Film to be shorter, The music adds to the moment and some of the montages are fantastic. The Film ignored many of the sub-plots and tiny relationships built up in Moore's work however if you look the relationships are there; they are just not as explicitly pointed out. All in all a very good translation only stopped from being truly fantastic by the insistence of fight sequences and gore that adds nothing to the plot and seem to be there just so those who wish to see violence do not get bored
B0012HCASA|4.0|I was a bit sad, but not surprised when this was canceled. Since the movie Terminator Salvation was due to be out, this show must have got put on the back burner, and subsequently cancelled. As far as I know, they were going to make season 3 but didn't due to lack of ratings. The stories and action sequences were on par, some even on par with an expensive movie flic.    I mainly watched this show for Summer Glau though, is that a bad thing?
B00005JM02|4.0|This is the only \\"feature film\\" or movie over 45 minutes that my daughter will sit through.  She loves everything about it and calls for Nemo and Dory even when the movie is over.
B00428LIXO|2.0|I purchased this for my son who is 10 Months and loves tools and banging on things. I thought that this would be a perfect toy, but he has shown very little interest in it. Placing my disappointment aside, the toy is well made and very durable, but the main feature of this toy fails to work half the time. When one hits the orange or green faces on the hammer head against a surface it causes the purple disk to spin. We can usually get 5 or 6 hits on the hammer before the gears lock up and it requires either spinning the disk manually or a lot of forcing to get the gears to release. Most children at 1 year old, do not have the dexterity to flip the hammer around in-between blows to keep the disk spinning. I believe this toy has missed its targeted age.

B0042RUMIW|5.0|I really would not call myself a huge Sting fan in the past even though I really liked \\"Ten Summoner's Tales\\" which I listened to often on cassette.  And to me Police was just another British rock group, some okay songs made popular and overplayed on the radio.   Looking for live popular rock concerts with orchestral background which I really love, I thought I would give this a try.  Man...am I glad I did!  This performance in my opinion puts Sting (if he wasn't already) among the very top of iconic musical performers and writers of our time.  Backed by superb arrangements and performed by The Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra along with Branford Marsalis and others were the perfect ingredients for a spectacular live performance.  Every song performed had a new flavor to it spiced with bits of jazz, classical, rock, and samba.  If you're thinking that you heard these songs all before and are tired of them, forget it.  Hearing them is like listening to them for the first time but only better, richer, and classier.  I am now an official HUGE Sting fan.  After hearing and seeing this live performance, you probably will be too. Enjoy!
B00457X7XQ|3.0|Zero Day had an interesting premise for a techie nerd like me: Saudi cyber-terrorists coordinating with Osama Bin Laden and a Russian programmer to take down critical computers.   The story starts with hospital patients dying, a nuclear power plant nearly melting down, and an airliner nearly crashing.  The sleuths are a group of underpaid American bureaucrats who face sexual tension while avoiding assassination as the clock counts down.  It reminded me of an episode of 24--cliched and you already know how the entire story will unfold, but you figure you might as well finish the episode.  By the end, just like the characters, I was left exhausted and wondering how I managed to spend so many hours with so little substance to show for my efforts.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|What a terrific movie. A really likeable central character, whose coming-of-age journey is paralleled by a manhunt across Europe (where she is being hunted), during which she starts to learn more about the world and comes to reject violence. But that's not to say that the action scenes aren't thrilling stuff, and really enhanced by the wonderful score from the Chemical Brothers, which fits every scene in the movie where it's used (a lot of the time there's no background music, but when there is, it really adds to it) like a glove. Superb cinematography and beautiful directorial touches add what it takes to make the movie more than a clever thriller and elevate it to the status of art.    Be warned that not all of the plot is spelled out for you like in a typical Hollywood flick, so if you're not used to paying attention to subtlety, you might feel lost in the plot. If that happens, forget the plot and you'll still enjoy the movie for all of the above reasons.    No movie, however brilliant, will be treasured unless we feel we can make an emotional connection to the characters. Fortunately, Hanna won't disappoint there. We identify with Hanna and root for her, sympathise with Eric; we feel at home with the English tourist family, we hate Marissa with childlike passion, and Isaacs is all of our dark repulsions and fears covered by the thinnest social veneer. Even the old clown reminds us of some old uncle, even for those of us who never had uncles...    Wish I could give it 7 stars out of 5, but I'll just have to settle for actually watching it again.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I play this kind of game pretty frequently, and this has some decent puzzles and gameplay is fairly straightforward.  I was a little frustrated to find that a) one puzzle pretty much led to the next -- not a ton of free will in this one; and b) that it only took me just over an hour of playing to reach the end.  That said, the creators have to make a buck, and I appreciated the effort. I just hope their next game in this category is a little more detailed and much longer.
0385736002|4.0|I purchased these books looking for something as good as Harry Potter, and I wasn't expecting much from these ones, but yes, they're good, for young readers and adults.  If you like fantasy, and magic, you will find these books amazing.  The characters, the plot, everything is really amusing. :)
0618001905|5.0|This is a book that was well written and researched. It is a battle of sorts between Leopold II who was skilled before his time in the manipulation of the press as well as politicians and countries and a handful of people trying to get the world to see and change the horror within the Congo.   Other than Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" this era has largely fallen beneath the radar yet it needs to be told.  A sincere recommendation for this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|what a great app! i love the availability of different versions of the Bible, the variety of reading plans, and the community insights!  good stuff...thanks LifeChurch!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Young kids (10 and younger) will love it. The younger the kids are, the more they'll love it. Older kids (10-14?) will probably still love/like it, but I suspect the older, the less they'll like it.<br /><br />Adults with `kid hearts' will also love it. Other adults (with kids) will like it. And a few may not like it. But if you have young kids, watch it with them. They'll thank you for it. If you don't have young kids, you probably won't go watch this movie,... but it's has some real funny parts.<br /><br />Then again, if you are an adult Smurf fan,... who knows!? Smurfs have been around for a long long time. Even before the animated TV-series. They are a comic strip creation by Belgian cartoonist Peyo, in the late 50'ies, apparently very popular in Europe, way before they were introduced to the US in the animated cartoon series. If you are older, and familiar with the Smurfs comic strips by Peyo, (perhaps when you were living in Europe as a kid ... ;-) ... ) you may simply appreciate and love/like how it was brought to life in this movie.<br /><br />Personally, I liked the movie. Not so much the mushy-mellow-moral scenes (thankfully just a few moments), but there are many funny Smurf scenes and lines. I had good laughs. And I think I never heard the kids laugh so much, and so hard! Not even with Cars2.<br /><br />Gargamel and his cat, Azrael, are the characters that I liked the most, ....because of the many funny situations they create. And in my opinion, the actor who played Gargamel, was just brilliant! Really really good.
0061537969|5.0|I adored this book and couldn't wait to tell everyone about my discovery.  I found it a hopeful story, despite the troubles faced by Denny, the main character.  I confess that, despite the hope for Denny and Enzo, I hated the in-laws and wished for them to succumb to a horrible ending (no spoiler here, sorry).   I cried and laughed all at this wonderful book.  Admittedly, I am a dog lover from childhood, which may help me love the book a bit more than a non-animal person.  My favorite parts of this novel were when Enzo speaks with the insight of a human about his challenges in being an animal. For example, when he says something like \\"if only I had a thumb.  The things I could do\\".  (Sorry, can't find the direct quote but that's the gist of what he said.)   I found it to be a sweet book all in all. That said, for full disclosure, I did lend this book to a friend who likes \\"happy books\\" and she found it to be too sad.   If you are someone who doesn't like to cry at a book, then perhaps you should listen to my friend over me.  However, I don't typically read \\"easy\\" books.  I prefer a book that makes me think, allows me to identify with or understand interesting characters from the book, all the while summoning me to feel emotions... happy or sad!
B004GYY714|5.0|sound quality is great. no issues as of yet. surprisingly easy on my atrix battery life. stations are very easy to find, great for those fringe stations that you like but have a hard time picking up over  the air. look forward to using it during football season to pick up radio broadcasts of  teams i cant get locally.
B001TAFCBC|5.0|The acting in this movie is brilliant. The characters are beyond lovable, and you really find yourself pulling for them. Yes it is a love story, but I'm a guy who is utterly disgusted with the same old story line rinsed washed and repeated in \\"romance\\" movies these days and I fell in love with it. If you're looking for a moving movie, I'd have to recommend this one. It has an interesting plot, and the actors seem like a real couple rather than just going through the motions of another script. I would recommend this to all but the most stubborn of meat heads. Also I got to watch it for free on Amazon Prime. How could it get better?
B0055CJ8T2|4.0|Kelly Rowland finally breaks through in a major way with her third album Here I Am.  Every artist can't/won't set the world on fire with their debut album.  With some it takes time to develop and carve out a niche.  I'm extremely happy that she got herself a bonafide R&B hit with Motivation.  Even though she has dabbled in the \\"european\\" sound for a few years now she finally gets back to making powerful R&B music that showcases her phenomenal voice.  Well almost....there are the obligatory David Guetta styled dance songs that it seems like every R&B album has these days but for the most part the album delivers.    When Kelly slows it down and gets down to business she is a force to be reckoned with.  Songs like Keep It Between Us, Motivation and Lay It On Me are sexy.  I'm Dat Chick is a Ciara styled 808 number that actually works quite well for Kelly Rowland.  The Commander (Urban Remix) is also well worth the time.  All in all Kelly Rowland shows that she has what it takes to be a successful solo artist.  I'd give this effort 3.5 stars because I just simply do not like those Euro dance songs.  However if you dig that kind of thing you will obviously rate this one a little higher.  Either way Kelly has come into her own and I look forward to hearing more of what she has to offer.
0316098329|5.0|Room is a very heartfelt story that you won't be able to put down until the very last word has been read. \\"Ma\\" was been kidnapped at the age of 19 and placed in an 11 by 11 foot shed by her capturer for seven years.  During this time, she has been repeatedly raped and produced a son, Jack, whom she was forced to deliver on her own.  Jack is now five years old at the opening of the story and has known no other world but that of \\"Room.\\" The intrigue of the story is enhanced in that it is told in the voice of five year old Jack.  Miss Donoghue does an excellent job of telling this story through Jack.  Amazingly, the horror of such a situation is painted as a wonderful home and environment by Jack, as he knows nothing else.  His mom keeps him on a regular schedule of meals, limits his TV and teaches him about the world outside of Room.  Jack believes his life is good - he has toys made out of egg crates and paper and is very happy having only \\"Ma\\" to share his days. A nightmare and atrocity of a situation is interestingly told in two points of view; one by Jack and one by Ma. I don't want to get too deeply into my review as I may start to give away the plot.  Suffice it to say, this is a book everyone should read.  I haven't been this engrossed in a book in a very long time.
0307346617|3.0|I really enjoyed the idea of the book and the style in which it was set up.  The storyline was definitely interesting, but i didn't find it written very well.  Every other page i found something that annoyed me, whether it be something cheesy or just plain dumb.  Some interviewees were unique, but i thought most blended together without any real distinction between them.  I feel like a different author could have made this book better.  Still a decent book that i would recommend to someone interested in the genre.
B004RQDQIQ|5.0|While this film has always been a bit of a bridesmaid, never a bride - I can say without reservation that it is the best Coen brothers film of all. From the lovely opening shot of ice swirling around a glass, you know you are in for something special and it never lets you down. The cast is first-rate, the visuals are superb (can't wait to see this in Blu-Ray) and the sound editing is among the best you will ever encounter. It takes several viewings to pick out some of the smaller nuances that really make this work special. Eddie Dane is one of the more memorable mob torpedos ever conceived and Albert Finney's Leo is a perfect fit. Then there is Gabriel Byrne's Tom - the one eye always looking off somewhere else...perhaps to the next plot twist?    Of course there is much much more to this fabulous film.    ** Just received the Blu-Ray version of this masterpeice ** They have done a beautiful job with this as they had expert cinematography to work with. The visuaals are rich and detailed and the sound is wonderful, s it should be with any Coen Brothers film. Bravo!
044654759X|1.0|There were really no surprises in this storyline.. abused wife on the run who starts a new life and the crazy ex catches up with her.  No twists, no turns and completely predictable.
0739375970|3.0|Particularly for the audio version, Roy Dotrice's choices in voices in turns can be passable to ridiculous to disgusting.  Daenarys bizarrely now sounds like a wizened woman on par with Carol Kane in \\"The Princess Bride.\\"  Some of the other voices are so burdened with vocal ornamentation in terms of accent and phlegm level as to make them indecipherable.  I don't think I could bear to listen to it again, so any chance for repeat listening is ruined.<br /><br />The writing is ponderous and suspense-killing, as by the time I got back to the characters I wanted to hear from, it was only to create more suspense, not relieve it.  My interest is entirely exhausted in the series.  There's entirely too much exposition and the creation of new characters to follow serve to make me less interested in investing in them and resenting them for stealing time from characters I used to care about, but now have given up on caring about.<br /><br />The audio needs to go back to the narrator of the fourth installment, John Lee.  Although John Lee tends to make some women sound like elderly gay males, it's preferable to making them sound like aged over-accented caricatures. The voice distracts from the story instead of enriching it.<br /><br />All characters have lost humanity and interest for me.  I don't have any faith the author will ever actually wrap up a story.  I think I'd die of old age, waiting for some sort of satisfaction worth slogging through boring exposition and unsympathetic characters.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I can't understand why the public did not like this film. I once read a review that said this movie was a disrespect to women I thought it was the opposite I felt it was empowering to women clambering for them to reconnect and realize the power they have over men and to those who see to control them but if you were to look at it in a broader scope in the end you will realizing its a story about hope and empowering those who may feel helpless at the hands of there captors.The SLOWMO KING is back and I loved every minute of it.The Ladies in this film were impressive the martial arts training they received paid off. Action scenes were flawless and breathtaking.Needles to say Zack Snider is a visual Genius every step of the way trust me he does not disappoint when it comes to the eye candy.Weapons,plain,beast and Samurais all in one film who could ask for more. I most definitely recommend this film hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The cover is working out well. I installed it on my husband's iPhone a few weeks ago and it's holding up great. His job involves working outside in the dirt at times. We figured some would get under the edges of this case, but so far it hasn't.<br /><br />The screen protector is working great, despite not reading the directions before it was installed.<br /><br />My only complaint is the circle design on the back -- I just don't care for it.<br /><br />For the price, this is a great basic case for the iPhone.<br /><br />Update: as of 1Sept., it's started turning yellow, so we retired it.
B005D63RQK|5.0|I begin each new season of Breaking Bad nervous that it will let me down.  I am nervous that the show will begin to stray from what made it good in the first place.  Once again, though, the show has stayed true to its characters, its tone, and its story.<br /><br />If you've followed the show up to this season, you will not be disappointed.  Now that I'm three episodes in, I have to say that each of the characters (the leads, Walt and Jesse, Walt's \\"boss\\" Gus, laywer Saul, wife Skyler, and his in-laws Hank and Marie) is a joy to watch.  My only disappointment is that I have seen too little of RJ Mitte in the role of Walt Jr.  Hopefully, we will see more of him as the season develops.<br /><br />If you've never watched the show, go back to the first season and give it a shot.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B004XGWPXC|4.0|It's hard for me to decide whether I liked this book or not. The author's ability to depict his character's emotions is uncanny and minute details are presented that will remind you of the kinds of thoughts and yearnings of your youth. One Day takes a look at the same day each year in the lives of two friends. Each year they have grown, sometimes in opposite directions, but they remain friends. Despite the brilliant writing, I have to say that the main male character, Dex, is completely horrid and unlikeable and it's hard to understand why anyone would remain friends with him (with potential for more) for more than 2 seconds, much less several decades.

B00005K9LN|3.0|British Steel was Judas Priest's first foray into the 80's, and it is a really good indicator of the sound of all the albums in the 80's up until their rebirth in 1990 with Painkiller.  Each decade has yielded a vastly different sounding Priest.  I would be apt to point out that the 70's remains their high water mark, but one can't deny that the 80's revealed a more \\"fun\\" version of the Judas Priest sound.  They became more adept at writing radio hits that were still viable enough to be enjoyed by their traditional fan base.  \\"Rapid Fire\\" is a catchy proto-speed metal track that opens the album perfectly and segues into \\"Metal Gods\\", a track that remains a metal anthem decades later.  The two radio hits \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"Breaking The Law\\" are great \\"hooks in the brain\\" type songs, even if they do become tedious soon after you become acquainted with them.  The real gems on this album for me are \\"United\\" and \\"The Rage\\".  The former is an extremely catchy arena rock anthem, and the latter is the most deliciously hard rocking bastard on the entire album.  When the dust settles one could not claim that this album is on equal footing with what Priest accomplished in the 70's, nor does it stand on equal footing with the best 80's offering (Defenders Of The Faith).  Instead it remains a great introduction to the band due to it's dual nature of radio ready anthems, and hard rocking tunes.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|The film begins as Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is about to jump off the balcony of his very expensive and tightly secured living quarters. He begins to describe what led him to this extreme situation. The audience returns to when Morra's life has reached the bottom.  Morra is a slacker trying to write a novel while drinking and being lazy. He loses his girlfriend, Lindy (Abbie Cornish), because she cannot take anymore of his behavior and laziness.   Morra was a former drug addict with an ex-wife who has a shady brother. Morra is vulnerable and willing to try anything, except self motivation, to improve his personal and professional life.   He takes a pill from his ex-brother-in-law. The drug allows one to access 100 percent of the brain. Now Morra can remember everything in his past from when he just glanced at documents to personal experiences.   He has the ability to comprehend information in a short period of time. With this new pill, life exceeds one's wildest dreams.   The pill is NZT, and it is to be taken once a day. Obviously, the drug is not FDA approved, so some very serious consequences happen from taking it.  Suddenly Morra, who does not know how to fight and is a mild mannered individual, becomes a person with exceptional mental powers. With his confidence and new found intellect, he begins to climb the ladder of success.  He completes his novel in four days. Before the pill he did not have one word written. The audience takes this trip with Morra as he runs the gauntlet of successes, and repercussions from the drug. Of course, along with taking the drug side effects begin to emerge.  Morra meets Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). Loon is a tough business man who is trying to negotiate a business deal with a large corporation. He sees the potential within Morra, so he begins to test his skills.   With all of the drugs people are taking today to sleep, wakeup, relieve pain, overcome depression, feel good, feel bad, and generally go through everyday activities, the pill Morra takes covers everything. However, do not get to excited, it has some very serious side effects.  Life always has its downside. Morra has problems with Russian bad guys, street gangs, and a mysterious lone assailant. Not to mention memory loss from the side effects of NZT.   The film is based on the book entitled The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn. It does have some very dark moments. One scene in particular demonstrates what a person will do in order to stay alive. Traveling in a dark field can be very dangerous. Not knowing what will happen next is an uncomfortable feeling.   However, for the audience it is entertaining and suspenseful. I recommend this film for anyone interested in watching an engaging and original story.   The audience takes the trip with Morra through some very precious moments. Lessons about drugs and how to handle success are dispersed throughout the film. With tense moments and a mystery waiting to be revealed the audience can take the journey without the side effects and consequences. Just enjoy the excursion without medication, but with a plot full of surprises and tense thrills.
0634060384|5.0|Stylistically speaking, this book definitely gets 5 stars from me.     With the contents, there are enough songs to warrant spending the asking price....I bought this because I'm learning jazz guitar, and it helps with comps, solos, and everything inbetween.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|It's true what you've heard, this headset is bound to break. I saw all the youtubes of people with their broken headsets and read all the reviews of customers saying this headset would break. Although, I figured they just didn't take proper care of their headset. That in fact is not the case. This headset is poorly structured, & the earpieces will snap over time due to the swivel action. Save your money for a better headset.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I'm impressed how well this little thing works.  It sharpened my serrated edge well and took care of the blade pretty quickly too.  Mine is going in the backpack I carry with me pretty much everywhere.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|What a box set. All the transfers look great. I had Superman The Movie, Superman II: The Donner Cut and Superman Returns on bluray before, but sold them and bought this box set for the extras and for the other 3 movies to be on bluray. WB outdid themselves here. I love every second of watching these movies in HD. Highly recommended.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun to play. I have not had any problems. It starts twice sometimes, but not it is really not an issue.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Speaking strictly about the original cd release.  I've heard bad things about the 2004 remixes.  Hopefully the 2011 Peace sells sounds good, but I haven't heard it yet.      This is the first of what could be considered Megadeth's classic lineup.  I got into them in 95, when this lineup was in, I guess, full swing.  They'd already released their best albums, this one, Countdown and Youthanasia.  Granted Cryptic writings wasen't too bad, but Risk was awful.  But let's not dwell.  This is probably their last thrash album, untilll Endgame maybe.  The guitars have a great sound, different from any other album I have.   Dave's vocals are solid, one of his best, and the rhythm seciton fills things in nicely.    Holy Wars 10/10 - The album opens with Holy Wars, with a great opening riff.  I tell you Marty Freedman nearly destroyed Megadeth, he did his best to, but he really added a lot on this one.  The song runs super fast for a while, before slowing down greatly for a while, then picks up speed again.  I kind of wish we'd gotten another fast verse like the opening one.  I love the hammerons in the opening riff.    Hanger 18 9/10 - Another up tempo song, not nearly as high speed as the first.  Lyrics are entertaining.  I wish there'd been a third verse.  Course there's the pointless \\"return to hanger\\" from 01, but let's not go there.  In this song we get lots of soloing.  The verses are solid, and the chorus while not much to it, fits its purpose nicely.  Then...  Let the shredding begin!!!  It's instrumental the rest of the way.   The instrumental part drags a little for me, but it's grown on me over the years.  I still wish there was a third verse though.  Would've bumped this song up to a perfect score.  Otherwise it's one of the most straight forward songs on here.    Take No Prisoners 8/10 - Fairly fast tempo song, really fast on some parts.  It's a decent thrasher.  Like the end.     Five Magics 9/10 - This one doesn't really follow a verse chorus approach, neitherdoes Holy wars or a lot of early Megadeth for that metter.  Pretty solid song though.  I love the evil voice that comes in later in the song.  Pretty slow intro that builds up to a faster song.  Really aren't any slow songs on the disc.  Kind of wish there'd been a chorus, the \\"five magics\\" part kind of was like one, but oh well.    Poison was the Cure 6/10 - I really don't remember much of this song when I'm not listening to the album.  The intro's ok, and I remember it towards the end of Five Magics, cause I know it's coming next, but unless I'm listening to the song, this one just doesn't really have much staying power with me.  It's a fast song, with frantic guitars, fast drums, and Dave rambling on about I don't know what.    Lucretia /10 - Love the laugh at the beginning, they'd use it again on Youthanasia's Victory.  This one's a slow one, for this album, more upper mid tempo.  This one's another that really doesn't stick with me.  It's decent, and I like it better than the last song.      Tornado Of Souls 9/10 - Another of my favorite songs on here.  This one's probably the most straight forward song on the album.I love the opening riff, not as much as the one on Holy wars, but still.  It's nice.  Yet another faster song.  The vocals and the guitars work well together.  I like the chorus.  It gives the song a hook, without being cheesy.      Dawn Patrol -infinity/10 - I HATE this track.  I don't understand why it was recorded.  Heck it sounds  unfinished, but My Creation, which although I don't have, I've heard would have been better.  Luckily in this day and age it's easy to just not put this on my computers or ipods and I'm good.  Makes the overall listening much better.    Rust In Peace 8/10 - This one's a decent way to end the album.  The Polaris part was kind of pointless, but not terrible either.  This one actually kind of had a groove to it.    My overall rankings of the songs may not have been too overly glowing, but there are five out of eight, don't count the crap that is dawn patrol, that I really like, and the other three aren't bad either.  This one gets a lot of its points, well for being a good solid album.  The songs all work together and are generally better played as a whole, rather than seperately, welll some you can do that with.  Ok technically all, but I like them better as a whole album.    If you're looking to get into Megadeth this would be a good place to start, or you could go with Youthanasia or Countdown to Extinction, which are a little more accessible.  Also while not my favorite, Peace sells is considered a Megadeth classic, but you wouldn't be going wrong to start here.  Course if you're already a Megadeth fan, then you already know of the greatnesss of this album.  I can't speak for the 04 remix.  I've heard mixed reviews, but if you can find the original, then you're fine with that.  It doesn't sound bad.  Maybe not quite as full of a sound as newer stuff, but it didn't desperately need a remaster.
0374530718|2.0|I will be perfectly honest: I read a whopping 10 pages of this book before dejectedly giving up. Having had a deep interest in philosophy and a not too shabby background in the subject (I've taken a class on Greek philosophy and covered existential and modern philosophy thoroughly in an English class), I was excited to discover a book covering all the major Western philosophers. Unfortunately, the philosophy itself is buried in a corny, children's \\"detective\\" story told in such an infuriatingly unsubtle and childish style as to render the book utterly unreadable. The protagonist, Sophie, is the most flat and irritating book character you will ever meet. Her personality doesn't have enough depth to make her a suitable protagonist for a book written for five-year-olds. Why Gaarder couldn't have written a straightforward introduction to philosophy without the useless and trite detective plot is the only deep question that the book left me pondering.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very responsive controls. Relaxing play but challenging enough to keep me interested. Nice graphics. As others have said...worth every one of the 99 pennies!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Unlike the Star Wars special editions, the remastered versions of the Star Trek Original Series is quite effective. It's not overdone and removes some of the cornier special effects. We finally get to see some of the ships the Enterprise faces in combat and the phaser beams actually look like beams. There aren't any CG aliens or new ships added, just touching up on the originals. I'm glad Paramount did this before releasing this series on DVD. It'll make the series more palatable to modern audiences.
B001HN694K|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Alice In Wonderland!Disney did an excellent job on it.I couldn't ever get into it until i played a game called Alice Madness Returns.I don't know why. but after that, I watched this movie.

B0038ZITIE|4.0|I haven't seen this film since I was girl but watched it again the other day for the first time in thirty years and thought it great fun! Yes, it's all a bit silly with trite dialogue, zero characterisation and a decidedly holey plot - but that's to miss the point. This is a movie to be enjoyed for its sheer exuberance not held up to detailed critical analysis.    So we have that fab Queen song (the rest of their soundtrack ain't bad either). A cast that lurches from the so-bad-they're-a-joy-to-watch (ie Sam J Jones and Melody Anderson) to some unexpectedly good (in a camp way) turns from actors who should really know better (Topol, Dalton & Blessed)... and what they hell was Max von Sydow doing in this? Had he upset Bergman that year? If so the Swede's loss is our gain as he's dastardly good as Ming. Then there are so oddly delicious roles - such as Klytus and General Kala. The look of the film is quasi art deco with a really gaudy use of colour that defies all expectation to work. There are some decent set-pieces (the football fight, attack on Rocket Ajax) and some naff special effects. There are also a handful of unexpected gags. The princess's pet, for instance, is called 'Fellini'!    One thing that took my by surprise - and which obviously I didn't pick up on as a kid - is how pervy it all is. There's definitely a kinky overtone to the movie: from Ming's 'orgasmatron' ring to Flash in his leather pants and the obvious sadistic joy of Klytus whipping Orla etc.    Finally, although this film was made in the wake of 'Star Wars' in the late 70s, I wonder if its real influence is 'The Wizard of Oz'. Beyond its bright colours, there are loads of references - such as the hourglass in the prison, the troops that look like flying-monkeys, Kala (the witch) melting at the end.     Like I say, this film is great fun. It may not be Bergman (to mention him again) but what would you rather watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon?

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was much better than I had hoped when I bought it.  I found myself continuing to read late into the evening, and looking forward to picking it up again to continue with the story.  I do like the differences in the vampire characteristics from those of other authors.  Being able to go out in the daylight is definately a major advantage.  And the premise of four species on our planet (humans, witches, vampires and daemons) adds an interesting twist.  I very much look forward to the next book.  Hope she's working on it now.

B0015DROBO|4.0|When told that I'd like this if I like mysteries, I thought great!  Well, not exactly my type of mystery but it did get my interest.  Don't usually like books/movies that make you read the next book but I do like this book that does lead you to the second.  Finished the second of the three and now reading the third. Takes a bit to get into the storyline but worth it!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|it's really too bad that this wasn't a hand drawn animation movie   but for the most part, it was really good! i absolutely loved it!   the smurfs were funny and loveable and the villain was exactly   how the cartoon villain was. the movie was great. i love the   idea of the smurfs leaving their world and entering our reality   world. this movie was perfect. everyone will love it!
0002247402|1.0|Two weeks after finishing reading a Dance with Dragons I feel completely unfulfilled.  Great writing, lovely descriptions, hints of interesting things to come but very little (and I mean very little) action.  Most of the limited action that does occur, occurs off-page and essentially the story arcs advance almost not at all. This is 1000 pages of extremely well written fluff.<br /><br />Hugely dissapointing!
B000002L7R|5.0|It is a very well-known fact that Prince Rogers Nelson is a musical genius. And yet, fans, in 1985, were quite surprised when he introduced this album to the world. While gravitating gracefully from his pre-Purple Rain success, Prince secretly went to work on his seventh studio album. In addition to choosing low-key publicity for this follow-up project, Mr. Nelson preferred to keep the entire album under wraps right up until the very first airing of the music video for &#34;Raspberry Beret.&#34; Mr. Purple Passion was clearly functioning on a new level with this album, not just personally, but in music as a whole. The ambiance of this album, with it's Middle Eastern inspired, neo-psychedelic abstraction, sees Prince further diversifying musically, adding orchestrations to his music, and presenting an overall Mediterranean feel. Ultimately, when &#34;Around the World in a Day&#34; made it's premier in April of '85, it shower down from the clouds in complete victory, going on to double platinum success. I own numerous albums by Prince (and the Revolution), so I will state—if you are looking for a replica of &#34;1999&#34; or &#34;Purple Rain,&#34; best better look elsewhere. Because what you have here is a palate of rarities, a culmination of Prince's genius; the pinnacle of an artist whose talent was unrivaled by all whom derived from the '80s Pop/R&B/Funk/New Wave era! Furthermore, If you're an eternal fan such as myself, then most likely you already own this album. If for some insane reason that you are in fact not a fan, then there's a good chance that you will miss your ticket to a day of true cultural enthrallment!<br /><br />Track listing for Around the World in a Day:<br /><br />1. Around the World in a Day (3:28)<br /><br />2. Paisley Park (4:42)<br /><br />3. Condition of the Heart (6:48)<br /><br />4. Raspberry Beret (3:32)<br /><br />5. Tambourine (2:47)<br /><br />6. America (3:42)<br /><br />7. Pop Life (3:43)<br /><br />8. The Ladder (5:29)<br /><br />9. Temptation (8:17)<br /><br />All caution was challenged head-on for this album, as evident by the incorporation of instruments such as the cello, the violin, the finger cymbals, the electric bass and the drums. Upon hearing the tribal opening for the first track &#34;Around the World in a Day,&#34; one might assume that Prince returned home from a long overdue vacation from the West Indies. The interlace of Chinese and Egyptian culture is heavily utilized. Next, the carnivalesque &#34;Paisley Park,&#34; which shares its name with Prince's recording complex Paisley Park Studios, and tells of a Utopian place one can go to escape the chaos of the world around them. The echo of the rock-guitar and the 3-point pounding beat leaves plenty of space for the occasional clinging finger cymbals. And what would a signature recording be without the glorious backing vocals provided by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman? Both artists' vocals radiate! Moving forward, making it's mellow entrance, the exquisite &#34;Condition of the Heart.&#34; I love every second of this beautiful ballad. Prince doesn't actually start singing until 2:38, thus leaving a great stretch of time to display definitive piano work. This track is one of Mr. Nelson's most flawless, effortless ballads, ever!<br /><br />Things get more upbeat with the affectionate aura of &#34;Raspberry Beret,&#34; which opens with a pattern of sharp hand claps, complete with a 1-3 countdown. Thereafter begins this global celebration of stringed instruments plucking and tuning from start to finish, including the clinging of arabesque finger cymbals, gentle strums of the harp, and a great deal of the violin, all tied together with a bouncy bottom-heavy, and might I add, very catchy, bassline. The music video for its time was pure genius, exhibiting an array of the human race, further reflecting the worldly branding of this album. In the video, Prince arrives to entertain his lady love and the commons. Styling from head to toe, Prince performs with grandeur perfection, while donning a 2-piece, cloud print, sky blue suit, a snug white ruffled frock, and sporting a short dark sleek hair-do. And we must not forget the appearance of his white &#34;Purple Rain&#34; guitar! The intro used for the album differs from the music video version (my favorite), and can be found on the &#34;Ultimate&#34; album in 12&#34; format! &#34;Tambourine&#34; has a distinctively form-fitting sound of 1985, particularly the percussion. The lyrics come across as sexually suggestive, but quickly dissolve due to the exhilaration of the up-beat rhythm. &#34;America,&#34; a song literally being torn apart by the opposing forces of Rock & Roll and Funk, brings about a hardcore resonance. The tempestuous patriarch presents his outlook on the hardships of this country, clamoring the truth with such serious meaning. The power-driven anthem explodes with an enraged rock-guitar, puttering percussion, and the tambourine, all collectively paving the way for this momentous occasion...entertaining the hearts of the caring and compassionate...far and wide...from seeeea toooo shiiiiiniiiiing seeeea!<br /><br />The rhythmic &#34;Pop Life&#34; slowly begins with a faded-in synth line and quickly releases smooth bass guitar and piano embellishments. The drum machine provides occasional handclaps, constructing more of a danceable beat. Aside from the female empowerment of Wendy and Lisa, Ms. Sheila E. makes a guest appearance on the drums. Prince sails the entire barrage with insight on the greed of '80s Pop Culture, taunting: &#34;What's the matter with your life? Is the poverty bringing you down? Is the mailman jerking you 'round? Did he put your million dollar check in someone else's box?&#34;...a message that, in my opinion, rings true in the millennial era! &#34;The Ladder&#34; is yet another lovely ballad entry and welcomes in the sensual vibrations of the saxophone. The beat mirrors a slow-tempo rhythm that is systematically sluggish, and everything is held together with a choir of all-star background vocals, including Susannah, Tai and, of course, the talented Wendy and Lisa. Lastly, the hot and heavy, pulsating &#34;Temptation,&#34; provided with the most insistently catchy sax line ever put on a Pop record. The heat rises to the extreme within a minute in, forcing the overall mood to implode, consequently igniting the passion in Princes' guttural screams! The end section to this song is securely intertwined with an unwinding piano and the audible struggle between love and lust. Every song listed succeeds its purpose; there's simply not one bad recording to be found here! ATWIAD is just a taste for those who are &#34;beginners&#34;, and will most likely leave you longing for his additional material, some of which can be found on several greatest hits compilations.<br /><br />This album depicts Mr. Purple Passion in his prime, exploring his talent in ways few could've predicted. In my humble opinion, this is one of Prince's greatests recordings! So what exactly is it that makes &#34;Around the World in a Day&#34; so pleasureful? What makes it the indisputable standout debut of ANY Prince album? Well, for me, I think it has a lot to do with the worldly resonance presented. You have to remember, this was the post We-Are-the-World era in music; an era when musicians were joining forces and singing for a heartfelt cause; an era when creating music was accomplished with true meaning! One might say this album was Prince's cultural contribution to the world at that time in history. Personally, I feel that Mr. Nelson had a purpose when developing the foundation for this masterpiece. The production was above and beyond anything that came before it. Every instrument used on this album was more polished than ever before, which is evident in every single note written and performed. Prince's fashionable entourage, The Revolution, had a huge influence on the aesthetic of this album as well, particularlyfrom the contribution of Bobby Z (whom I absolutely adore), Brownmark, Wendy Melvoin, Lisa Coleman and Matt &#34;Doctor&#34; Fink - all whom played a significant role in the worldwide success within the group!

0307477479|1.0|like a blank sheet of paper. Okay, maybe the book is more interesting than a blank sheet of paper, but I'm trying to make a point here! I'm about 1/3 of the way through and it's becoming increasingly difficult to finish. Nothing about the characters is memorable (thus far), the random storylines are not interesting... simply, I'd say this book is terribly boring. I would not recommend it. Despite this I'm going to try to plow through the next third, wish me luck!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Streaming from your cloud drive is very cool, and seems to work quickly over 3G connections. Unfortunately downloading from the cloud player to the local memory was non-functional. App only downloads to internal memory, and the media playing portion only plays media on external memory. Call to Amazon support only netted the advice: \\"try calling your carrier\\". Surprisingly enough Verizon doesn't employ anyone with an expertise in software written by Amazon, so I have a half-functional app. I supposed that would be worth 2.5 stars if it weren't for the support calls literally laughing me off the call.

0316077054|5.0|Why I read this: I absolutely LOVED the first one, so I had to read this one ASAP. Kami and Margaret are awesome!<br /><br />Plot: After the ending of the first book, Lena seems different and keeps changing as the book goes on - she starts distancing herself from Ethan and doing uncharacteristic things - like dressing more gothy and hanging out with the bad crowd. Also, she spends a lot more time with a dangerous looking guy on a motorcycle than with Ethan and cuts him off from what she is feeling inside. What Ethan must do is figure out how to help Lena without losing her. But does Lena want saving?<br /><br />The plot of the second book does not disappoint, there's danger and emotional ups and downs for both the characters and the reader. And this book brings you deeper into a different world, one which I wasn't sure we'd ever see them explore. It's definitely a journey and I cannot wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Characters: Ethan really is a great guy. You can tell by the way he thinks - it's much different from being inside a girl's head - that is certain. He's worried, but he keeps his distance even when Lena seems to be going off the deep end - he's respectful of her space and her decisions, but that doesn't mean he doesn't want to help. I really like that it's from his perspective and that the girl is the mystery, not the guy... it's nice to see how different a guy reacts to similar situations we see in other paranormal novels featuring the voice of a girl (aka Evermore, Evernight, etc...).<br /><br />I worry about Lena in this book, as Ethan does as well. She's definitely changing and there's something influencing that change. I really just love the mystery surrounding her in both this book and the first.<br /><br />Relatability: I think anyone can relate to this story, it's mainly about relationships and change along with some dealing with grief. I love the feel this book has and it's definitely great to have a good male viewpoint.<br /><br />Cover Commentary: I just love it - although my hubby was like haven't you read that? And I was like... no, the covers are just similar - and then I showed him the difference and he was like \\"oh, they changed the colors...\\" very perceptive.. lol. I do like them. Definitely a stand-out cover.y was like haven't you read that?

B00005N6KG|2.0|The sound quality on these headphones are not bad, but the way they fit irritates me. I have a normal sized head and they fit so loose you would swear they were made for not a human but perhaps a moose instead. I haven't had the full affect of the sounds because they barely tickle my ears. I bought these becase I don't really like ear buds, but I didn't want bulky head phones while exercising either. What a mistake. Next time I will go in to an actual store to purchase some headphones a bit more snug. Other than that they came in when they said they would and they were in the condition described. I love amazon, hate the headphones I bought. Oh and the return policies are horrid...
0061139378|5.0|I was surprised by how closely the movie followed this book, as I had seen the movie long before I picked up this book. It's a great short and spooky read that is perfect for Halloween coming up. Gaiman is a fabulous storyteller.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Definitely a book you do not want to miss. Appropriate for 4th grade and up.
0765324849|4.0|A great book telling of what happened in Rapture before the game Bioshock took place. I think the book pretty much proves that there will be no prequel game to Bioshock, but that's ok, because the book does a good job at filling in the details of how Rapture came to be. The book does try to incorporate many characters you may have heard on audio dairies, which is cool, as well as other characters you come across in the both Bioshock games. Things did speed up towards the end which is a bummer, but overall it was still a very entertaining read!
0439023513|5.0|Why I read this: Do you even have to ask?<br /><br />Plot: The last of the Hunger Games trilogy did not disappointment me in the least - besides it marking the end of a fantastic trilogy. Full of action and continued dystopian themes, I couldn't put this book down for long. I really like the way Collins wrapped up the series. The book played out in a way that will keep me thinking about the characters and world for a long time.<br /><br />Characters: The only thing I'm going to say - is someone I love dies and it really broke my heart. I'm also not quite certain that I like the way it ended for the characters, but that's all I'm going to say. I really like the way the characters develop in this book and I hope that many more people will discover this trilogy in the future, because it is an amazing set of books.<br /><br />Relatability: I liked that it stayed within the realm of dystopian - I was worried it would focus on a different theme too much and that it would lose the feel I so loved about the series. But, it didn't and I'm happy! :)<br /><br />Cover Commentary: Very fitting for the book. I love the symbolism and I think it will be a trilogy that is later taught as part of an English course curriculum.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|It goes into more detail than the movie (as most books do) and it makes the entire Fight Club experience texturally richer. I appreciate the story more (if possible) now that I have read the novel. Huge Chuck P. fan and this is one of his wittiest books I've read to date, hard to believe it was his first published. Read it.
142311339X|5.0|The short of it: An amazing new series by Rick Riordan, the first book takes you into the world of Percy Jackson, but from the point of view of a new male character - Jason. Full of action, adventure, and peril, this new series is one I'm looking forward to reading more of - and so are my students. Many of them groaned when I told them the next book would be out until this coming fall.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|What I like:  All components are very well built and the whole unit is compact.  Very reliable and easy to prime, but I can't say about cold weather starts just yet.  I will try to update this review when winter gets here.  You can leave the fuel inside the stove, and I pack a small book of matches inside the bowl so I have the whole package ready to go.  The flame last quite a while, enough for me to brown (slightly sear) a sliced can of spam.  The simmer lid works well and allows me to make rice without too much burned rice on the bottom.    Modifications I made:  I used a knife sharpening stone to round out the edges of clamping end of the \\"handle/tongs\\" so they won't scrape against the soft bowl and non-stick finish.    First, I recommend against using Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol as it will left a nasty ash that is difficult to clean and will stain anything it touches.  The fuels I have tried are 70% ethyl rubbing alcohol (in yellow labels) at RiteAid or most drug stores, or denatured alcohol you can get a WalMart or any hardware store.  With the denatured alcohol, I would dilute it very slightly (1 part water with 9 parts denatured alcohol) because pure denatured alcohol burns too high.  With the 70% ethyl rubbing alcohol, no diluting is needed.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I was coming from a Belkin NS2te - and I have to say - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  I ordered the Logitech G13 because I thought, Hey - if it's from Logitech it has to be better.  The G13 is a solid piece of hardware - everything looks and works great - but if you like the NS2te (which is now the Nostromo N52 from Razer) keep it.  The keys are little farther away from the palm rest and for me, with small hands, I found myself reaching.  Also the palm rest is flatter than the NS2te.  I use a Logitech G5 gaming mouse - you know, the one with the huge humped back - it fits my hand perfectly and gives me something to hold on to.  The NS2te has the same large rounded palm rest - the G13 does not.  Lastly, the joystick.  The G13 sports a \\"real\\" joystick, which can easily be used for walking and looking around.  The NS2te has a big fat stubby joystick - not great for directional purposes - but great for use as a push, pull, left and right button coded for other uses (I pull to jump, push to crouch, lean right, lean left).  Also - the G13 joystick is lower and farther away as positioned from my hand - the NS2te is right there - within thumbs reach (so to speak).<br /><br />All in all - the G13, like I said, is a great piece of hardware - but if you like your NS2te or Nostromo as much as I do - \\"don't fix it\\" :)
B004A8ZX2S|4.0|I admit, after having watched - several times now- the beautifully made \\"The Thin Red Line\\" with it's contemplations on life in a war zone ( the Pacific during World War 2)  from the soldiers in battle perspective, I am somewhat biased towards the works of Terence Malick. Therefore, I did attend my first screening of this latest film of his here in Adelaide, South Australia, some weeks ago with high expectations. And I wasn't disappointed. That said, the languid atmosphere and long periods of seemingly boring family inactivity in this film, can understandably lead to frustration and disinterest. It is however, a beautifully made film which weaves those moments in life that many of us will experience in our families, with an ever present awareness of our impermanence yet connection with life. The  20 minute segment on the creation of the universe and life , which is reaffirmed throughout the film, is perhaps a tad too long and I agree that the dinosaur depiction was unnecessary. Considering the overall effect of the film they are however minor flaws. This is a moving film that will require some of us to revisit again - as I did.  At the end of the first viewing, which I attended alone, a lady in front of me turned to me and asked what the film was about. I tried to explain to her what I thought it was about, conceding that some may not quite appreciate the film - which was fine - but that I had really liked it. For the my second viewing my wife attended with me, and though not perhaps quite as perplexed as the lady from the first viewing, was underwhelmed. And that apparently is how it's been taken in most places. The actual film soundtrack is amazingly moving and fits the whole timbre of the film. However, I believe the so called film soundtrack on sale is NOT the actual music as used in the movie. I hope this is not correct, or that an actual soundtrack can be released. Don't go and see this movie if you are wanting to see a logical story unfold. \\"The Tree Of Life\\"is not that, it is more like moments in life captured in the frame of a memories. It is an ambitious but very worthy look at life.
1594744769|4.0|It is a really interesting book and caught my attention from the start. It was no chore to read. I had it read in two days, easy. It's the first novel I've read that had pictures in it to navigate you through and really help you see the characters and places. I always look up pictures for my characters and places but I would never dream of putting them in with the story. Riggs was so good at pulling you into the story that I actually thought that what he was saying made sense and what if he was telling the truth and there were Wights and everything? Mind-boggling. :)

B000Q8QH0I|5.0|When I first stuck my first DVD copy of this film into my DVD player, I honestly wasn't expecting much. Many of the primary actors were people I was unfamiliar with or only peripherally aware of. The ones I was familiar with had a lot of 'hit-or-miss' stretches in their filmographies. And the director had made a couple flicks I thought were decent and another couple I didn't care for.    To be brutally honest, I bought it just because it was supposed to be noir-ish and because Kim Basinger is pretty easy on the eyes.    What played out in front of me onscreen turned out to be the most enjoyable film I had seen in years. Every aspect of the film just blew me away. Brilliant performances, sure-handed direction, incredible sets and production values... and a story that got me running out to buy every James Ellroy book I could find.    Within a month, I watched the film probably 6 or 7 times... partly to see if the impact was just a result of it exceeding my modest initial expectations and partly because I just kept thinking about it.    Now, years later, I still can't keep from raving about what a great film it is every time it comes up in conversation. If none of the primary cast or director Curtis Hanson had ever made another film, I'd still remember each and every one of them. Instead, it proved a springboard for the careers of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, brought Kim Basinger back into the limelight and reminded every die-hard movie fan why we still love the art form, regardless of how many block-buster sequels and how much formulaic schlock gets foisted upon us by Hollywood bean-counters.    Oh, and the Blu-Ray looks and sounds incredible, by the way. But you already knew that.    If I had to trim my movie collection down to a handful of \\"desert island discs\\" this would absolutely be one of them. No hesitation, no second thoughts. I cannot recommend this one highly enough.
1932100660|5.0|\\"The China Study\\" is an excellent book with a comprehensive study that is well documented.  This is one of the best scientifically based studies I have seen.  The data is consistent with all of the other well documented and scientically based studies I have seen as well.  The book presents a simple way to significantly reduce medical costs by simply implententing good nutritional practices.  It is a book everyone should read with an open mind.  It is also a good reference book.    I would highly recommend this book to everyone.
B0001906O0|5.0|As a musical Anglophile and a 1st-Gen \\"80's Alternative\\" fanatic, I've always been alternately intrigued and frustrated at the amount of material that so many British bands release that doesn't appear on any of their albums.     I've had the good fortune to live in the UK a couple of times, and it's a bonanza of singles and EPs chock full of stuff that never sees its way onto 'proper' albums every time I drop by the local record shop.     Unfortunately, my time away from the UK has me spending waaayyy too much money collecting these bits and pieces from my favorite bands, settling for (often poor-quality) bootlegs, or suffering without.    While \\"Join The Dots\\" may not contain every single nugget of Cure ephemera, it contains pretty much all the high points and is 90+% comprehensive. It's allowed me to put away 20+ maxi-singles, some 12\\" vinyl singles and a couple bootleg compilations and enjoy these songs the way they were meant to be... in crystal-clear sound and with all relevant credit and royalties going to the band.    I've scarfed up the similar \\"b-side\\" boxed sets from Siouxsie & The Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen and the Jesus & Mary Chain (and love them all)... but Join The Dots stands above the rest for its remarkable quality of content, and for sticking to the b-sides and not including any of the \\"hits\\" many of us aready own several times over.    Fan-frickin'-tastic.
0062060554|5.0|I am an avid mystery book reader. I rarely read books from unknown authors, however, I found this book to be very interesting and thought provokingly different. A first time novel for this author it's quite an accomplishment. Some mornings when I wake up, after having read this book, I imagine what it would be like to not be able to recognize myself in the mirror or the people who are around me, and relive that each day. Scary.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This movie is made on a very small budget and yet it is edited wonderfully. Josh has a sense of humor too, which is helpful in this dark subject. Okay, some slides are a bit fuzzy but that is unimportant when you consider the benefit of such shots verses no shots because they aren't perfect. Very well done. Very shocking. Very sad. I live in an area when they are wanting to drill and many of my neighbors have allegedly signed. I almost signed until one of my neighbors said she had a bad gut feeling and mentioned bad stories about fracking. I looked online and found lots of news articles confirming accidents and spills and water concerns. A day later I found this and I'm so glad I didn't sign - but concerned because I may be very likely in the close vicinity. Me and my husband and our baby. I never knew about possibilities like open storage ponds or evaporation misters for waste water or vented (contaminated) stem from the moist gas - all bad things for air pollution. Now you can see why the gas industry got an exception from not only the \\"clean water act\\" but the \\"clean air act\\". Very sad. Thank you Josh for speaking up!
B000U9X1UM|5.0|I love Tarantino, Kurt Russell and Rosario Dawson, so I could hardly go wrong-but the sheer intensity of QT's trademark weirdness and the stunning ending were awesome bonuses.

1932100660|5.0|Reading T Colin Campbell's comprehensive review of data collected throughout China was a turning point for me and my husband who suffered his second heart attack about six months ago.  Without any support from our cardiologist, we embarked on a diet that Colin Campbell and his cohort Dr. Esselstyn recommends in the 2010 documentary \\"Forks Over Knives\\".  \\"The China Study\\" explains how a whole foods plant-based diet correlates directly with good health.  Then it shows how health deteriorates as western processed food is added to the simple diet of Chinese rural people.  It is definitely worth reading along with Esselstyn's \\"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\\".
B001VNB54A|5.0|This series is fantastic, the attention to detail is superb. The directors felt they owed, the men who fought in the Pacific, a debt of gratitude to tell the story properly, and I believe they have with this series. The realism and cinematography of this series edges out that Band of Brothers. The story is adapted from, at least three books of the recounting of the events, by the men who were there. I highly recommend this series.
1936719010|4.0|A very useful little book, written to help get writers (and other sorts)  over the various blocks to their goal (blocks are all internal)  It was recommended by several folks including Guy Kawasaki.  Well written in a short punchy style, the book delivers on its promises.  If you want to write well, this will help.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The mic is great I love it I would give it a five star but the reason why I am giving it a three star is because the mic catches this buzzing sound when recording if it wasn't for that like I said then I would have given it a five star....it is a good mic for a starter

B004HO6I4W|4.0|Rio (Animation, Adventure, Comedy)<br />Directed by Carlos Saldanha<br />Starring the voices of Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway and George Lopez<br /><br />20th Century Fox   2011   96 min   Rated G   Released Aug 02, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Descriptive Audio Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy<br />Digital copy<br /><br />The Film 3.5/5<br /><br />After seeing a trailer for Rio, I wasn't expecting much when I finally sat down to watch the movie. The trailer consisted of animals shrieking or screaming and performing stupid moves such as dancing. I also dislike that every scene has to be punctuated with a blast from the subwoofer. I chose to watch your trailer and you're going to hold my attention for two minutes, so you don't have to blast noise at me to keep me watching. I'll decide whether something is interesting or dramatic by myself, thanks. That's becoming a huge annoyance.<br /><br />Anyway, let's get back to the movie.<br /><br />I love the way Rio opens. There are birds everywhere and they are happily dancing. The colors are very striking and I don't think I have ever seen a more colorful movie. Birds and other animals seem to cover most of the colors in the spectrum and the look of the movie is appealing throughout.<br /><br />Blu (Eisenberg) is a tiny young macaw and he's captured during the opening scene. We see him rescued by a girl named Linda (Leslie Mann), and he's completely happy as her pet for the next 15 years. The two share a bond and it's a heartwarming relationship. Their world is turned upside down when an ornithologist begs her to take Blu to Brazil as he's thought to be the last male of his species. Linda is reluctant, but eventually agrees.<br /><br />The two fly to Rio and Blu is introduced to Jewel (Hathaway), his prospective mate. Jewel is more concerned about escape and can't understand why Blu tolerates humans. The two are left overnight to begin their courtship, but a boy steals them and sells them to a gang which deals in rare birds.<br /><br />The remainder of the story shows what happens as Linda tries to find Blu. She initially rescued him before he learned how to fly and it becomes clear that he still hasn't discovered how it's done. Blu is aided by a variety of other birds as he attempts to find Linda. The gang enlists minions to find Blu and Jewel, resulting in a number of fights and chase scenes.<br /><br />Rio lacks the heart of Pixar movies, but it does have some redeeming qualities. The story is far from original and it's not difficult to guess the entire plot after a few minutes. Despite that, some of the scenes are quite charming. It's fast-paced and doesn't contain any dull moments. I imagine younger children being captivated by Blu's adventures and the color scheme and ever-present Brazilian music is more than enough to hold their attention.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story. Yes, I knew what was going to happen, but I found the characters quite likable. The animation becomes more detailed as the story progresses and some of the scenes contain incredible detail. The music is catchy and will be burned into your brain if you're not careful. This movie won't change your life, but it's an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />The most obvious thing about the picture quality is the excellent use of color. The transfer boasts a variety of appealing colors and will capture your attention. The backgrounds seem a little unfinished in the opening scenes, but that's a stylistic choice and not a fault of the presentation. Later scenes, such as those in the Carnaval, are full of detail. You can clearly make out feathers and hairs on the various animals, and some of the scenery looks spectacular. This is a feast for the eyes and shouldn't disappoint anyone.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix matches the excellent video quality. The opening scene hints at what is to come and features a pounding Brazilian beat with a multitude of birds singing and squawking.

0061537969|3.0|This is a very touching story about a relationship of a dog and his owner. It is written from the dogs perspective which, I thought, was a fun concept.     I fell in love with Enzo from the very beginning. He was a very unique and intelligent dog! He was very loyal to those he loved. He learned things by watching and listening to the people around him. He loved to watch t.v. and he learned many things from that also. There are so many times that he is frustrated because he could help out in different situations if only he could talk. Or if he had thumbs! The story of his life is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.     What I didn't care for was the metaphor of car racing as life's journey. While I understood the concept, I felt it was used a bit too much. I found myself skipping over some of it so I get back into the meat of the relationships. I also wasn't a bit fan of the reincarnation idea. It really took something away from the story for me personally. I kind of just rolled my eyes and moved on as best I could.    As a whole, I believe that most people will love this book. The story will grab you and keep you motivated to read! You will laugh and you will cry. You will find yourself angry and joyful. Enzo will touch your heart and you will not forget this story for a long time to come.
B004PGO25O|3.0|After having fallen into a rut on many fronts, I thought that this book would provide some pragmatic, relevant guides to get back on your feet. What I was hoping was a path to instilling habits of proper work ethos, a mind frame whose underlying firmness and repetition would imbue life long qualities of always being able to face a job, task or what have you with the right tact and resources so as to feel in control and accomplished rather than overwhelmed or incapable.    What I found was just scatterings of quotes which I hoped would lead onto fuller passages or practicum slash examples to illustrate not oft heard theories or wisdom. Not so. The book is lacking in terms of applicable ideas and amount of content. All that said, it does provide an ounce of motivation to get out there and attempt something. It has helped me break through whatever invisible barrier had me pinned hapless and hopeless. It's still a struggle at times but however small the impact, there was some. Although having paid for this book, as said earlier, there isn't enough content and really feels like you've walked over a precipice where there should be ground when you've reached the end.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This CPU is crazy fast right out of the box, it's dirt cheap, and the Stock cooler is actually alright - not very loud, and cools adequately.<br /><br />Now on to the fun - I have mine running at 4.8GHz (Your mileage will vary). Rock stable, all day long, in a workstation I use for hardcore 3D work. I got it to boot into Win7 at 5GHz but it would crash after about 4min of stress testing in AIDA64. Vcore is 1.475 and I'm using a Swiftech watercooler.<br /><br />The beauty of this CPU is in it's scaling which lets it run at a cool 1.6GHz when idle and instantly ramps up to full speed when needed and then back down again. I haven't overclocked since 2007 but this thing was so easy I couldn't resist.<br /><br />I bought this CPU from Amazon but returned it un-opened after I found the same thing for sale locally at Micro Center for $40 less...
B003ASLJRW|4.0|If you like Clint Eastwood and classic western movies then this movie is for you. The movie always leaves me wondering about \\"preacher's\\" past, and what brought him to the obscure mining town where the movie is based. There are some scenes in which Clint's buddies are pretty funny and entertaining, deviating a bit from the more serious plight of the miners. And then there is the interesting relationships that develop between Clint (Preacher), Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, and Sydney Penny.
0439023513|1.0|I really liked the first book in this series. The second book ended and I had to read the 3rd one right away. I finished the 3rd book and it made me hate all three. Luckily I finished all 3 within 3 days so I don't feel like I wasted a lot of time on them. The 3rd book was just depressing, and it drags on and on.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Ok...there are sort of 2 parts to this review: the subjective part (\\"this sucks\\" or \\"this rocks\\") which is usually smaller and not-so-qualified, and the comparison to previous Yes efforts that might make it more relevant to the average reader out there (\\"hmmm, he said it's more like 'Drama' than 'Talk' and I hated 'Drama').  Some folks don't seem to make that distinction much, merely pronouncing a work as \\"crap\\" or a \\"masterpiece\\" with little reasoning.     First off, to my decently-trained (though mostly self-trained) prog-proficient musical ears, \\"Fly from Here\\" sounds most like \\"Drama\\" from the Yes catalogue.  Not surprising to most reading this as it's a common theme in most of the reviews here.  Having a center-piece song that was partly written during the Drama-era by a large chunk of the Drama lineup and finally finished by almost that same lineup has (not surprisingly) led to a fairly Drama-ish sounding tune.  The fact that Trevor Horn (vocalist from the Drama lineup) produced \\"Fly from Here\\" (the entire CD, not just the big track) is kind of the final glob of hot wax in sealing the very-Drama-like final product.  Lastly, David Benoit (or is it Benoit David?), the \\"new guy on vox\\" replacement on this CD is kind of a vocal chameleon.  He sort of sounds like Jon Anderson in some parts and then like Trevor Horn in different parts of the CD as well as sounding like neither in a couple places.  And I first heard him singing for a band called \\"Mystery\\" where he frequently sounded like Dennis DeYoung (singer/keyboard guy from the classic Styx lineup) so go figure.  He has some flexible vocal chords.    And unlike many Yes-nut-purists who think \\"Close to the Edge\\" was something close to unworldly in its awesomeness (which I about 95% agree with) but \\"Drama\\" was bogus, I've always really liked \\"Drama\\".  Howe's legato guitar work on the disc was a big draw as well as Downes' adding some nice keyboard stylings and colors different from Wakeman.  Squire's bass on \\"Drama\\" was still very much sounding like Chris Squire's bass, and \\"Drama\\" was the disc that showed me how much Squire's voice shapes the overall sound of Yes' vocals.      So for me, the fact this disc reminds me of Drama is a good thing.      Production on this is very slick, and given Trevor Horn's track record as a producer, it isn't too surprising.  BUT...for me, it's a little too polished in places (that's one of those subjective assessments).  There's a LOT of padding synths and strummed acoustic guitar, which isn't a problem, but it's definitely not something I'm used to in a lot of Yes tunes.  Intricately picked, complicated solos and runs, and melodic execution on an acoustic guitar frequently have graced Yes albums, but just plain strumming, not so much.  And somewhat similar to my review of Asia \\"Phoenix\\", here's an album that also sounds like it came from the same guys from the same band, but understandably, a little less aggressively than in most of their old albums (including \\"Drama\\") because they ARE a little bit older and less aggressive.    It's a shame the core Yes guys aren't capable of writing and performing stuff on par with \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"Going for the One\\" (on par to my ear anyway), but as no one has learned how to escape growing older, changing, and dying (other than by dying young), it's something I've learned to live with.  For me this is an enjoyable album, albeit nothing fabulous.  To be honest, I've been getting into Glass Hammer's \\"If\\" which seems to have captured a much more \\"classic Yes\\" vibe than this disk, and it also has a Jon Anderson sound-alike vocalist (what is it with so many prog bands who are scared to just field an original sounding vocalist??).    Three and half stars with a roundup to four.
0545259088|3.0|THE FAERYS VIEW<br /><br />FIRST FEELINGS:<br /><br />I am a HUGE fan of Maggie Stiefvaters unique writing style that began the minute I discovered her Books of Faerie series. I've gobbled up every story she's written for various anthologies, etc... and have never been disappointed. The Wolves of Mercy Falls series was a bit different for me. I won't say that I'm disappointed-that's not the correct word, what I will say is that it didn't blow my Faery Wings back like most of her writing does. Shiver was absolutely fantastic and I couldn't wait to get my hands on Linger and in turn, Forever. With each succession of books I found myself getting a tad less interested and having a harder time getting through them when once upon a time I would tear through a M.S. book or story without stopping.<br /><br />FAERYS REVIEW<br /><br />I loved the characters in Forever and in true Maggie style, they were sharply defined and very much like real people, friends even-friends who have all the same hopes and dreams as some of our real life friends albeit some in a more otherworldly sense and they were just as flawed, too, again, giving them a sense of `realness'.<br />The varying points of view are one style of writing that many authors cannot pull off! Maggie does this with aplomb! Making it seem effortless and affording the reader a seamless transfer from one character to the next.<br /><br />The downside is that I had a really difficult time getting through the first half of the book. It felt sluggish and parts of it almost without purpose. I kept slogging along and I'm glad I did because the last half of the book is where the excitement starts.<br /><br />The last few chapters had me doing the wracking sob thing, I'll admit it. We say goodbye to well loved characters, challenging and anxiety provoking situations come up that had me biting my nails and there remains the tender love of Sam and Grace.<br /><br />The ending, in my opinion, did not bring me to a happy place and that's what I was hoping for after investing my time into this series. Many of my friends loved the ending and like all things, it is a matter of personal preference. I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil this for potential readers.<br /><br />In summary, Forever isn't on the top of my `must read' list but I'm also not sorry that I read it. That leaves me somewhere in the middle. The joy of reading Maggie's lyrical almost magical way of writing makes up for some of my disappointment in Forever and I will, as always, look forward to any work she has coming out in the future.hat I was hoping for after investing my time into this series.

B004JMZPJG|5.0|Fits perfectly for Nikon D5100 with the Kit lens 18 x 55mm.  Excellent finishing. Looks smart. The two side pouches hold the spare battery and battery charger. The inside pouch holds memory, remote, etc.     I reviewed many similar items, and user comments. I must say, there are some good reviews here.   To sum it up, I was looking for a trendy, yet that holds my camera safe, carry bag for my Nikon D5100. I got what i wanted.

1567184855|5.0|This book is fascinating, but you must first be open to the idea of reincarnation. Traditionally, European people scoff at this idea, being convinced that life is a result of randomness and nothing exists once our body dies. Of course this is but another belief, nothing more, yet it is so widespread that people (in Europe) usually take it for granted. Now, if you read M. Newton's book on the subject, you learn that souls anyway must forget everything about their spiritual existence upon incarnating. Hence, no need to argue.     So, this book is what happens once someone dies, and its soul goes back to the \\"spirit world / afterlife.\\" And then, how our next incarnation is planned. All of this has been collected over 30 years of hypnotizing people and asking them on the subject. Apparently, the author, a traditional hypnotherapist (and Phd psychologist) found about a client's past life by pure chance after asking a loosely worded question. And then, with his curiosity aroused he tried it again and again, until he got so much material as to have an outlook of what happens after our death and before reincarnating again.    Frankly, you must have had some personal experience letting you being convinced of past-lives, or have some strong religious belief (such as being Buddhist) to find interest in this book. But if you do, you really won't regret reading it. I am glad to have bought it myself, even if I now need to wait probably 30 years more to see if it is true or not (but I guess it is).
B00280LYIM|4.0|If you liked this book and this series, like I did, you should read the Lost Hero: which also includes Percy and his friends plus a bunch of new characters. It is about Roman myths, and is by the same authour.     The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles) is also a good choice if you enjoyed reading the Percy books. Red Pyramid is about Egyptian myths.
0307388719|3.0|Winston Churchill has for many years been a hero and an inspiration to me.  He was multi-dimensional: warrior, politician, gifted writer, orator, painter, and unconventional character.  In 1940, Britain was one of the world's preeminent powers (before the post-war ascendancy of the United States and the Soviet Union).  I had voraciously read Churchill's six-volume memoir of the Second World War and his History of the English-Speaking Peoples.  I have read numerous biographies such as The Last Lion, Churchill: A Study in Failure 1900-1939, and Franklin and Winston.  Now here is another biography, which from the onset provides fresh insights into Churchill's impact during the war, beginning with his appointment as wartime Prime Minister by the king during May 1940 - a warrior was needed!  British expeditionary forces were already in France striving to halt the German blitzkrieg through Belgium, and would soon find themselves being evacuated from Dunkirk.  Western Europe was reeling and facing impending defeat.<br /><br />Yet one man, with doubters all around him, refused to concede defeat.  By his steadfast courage, wit, and groundless optimism, Churchill infused the British people with an astonishing attitude of defiance.  After the fall of France, Britain stood alone against the Axis Powers.  Churchill went through excruciating moments during this time, as Max Hastings reveals that Churchill, as early as the summer of 1940, uttered his prophetic conviction that the United States would come to the aid of the Allies.  Hastings states that Churchill's \\"supreme achievement in 1940 was to mobilize Britain's warriors, to shame into silence its doubters, and to stir the passions of the nation.\\"  Hastings astutely writes: \\"As Churchill always recognized, modern war is waged partly on battlefields, and partly also on airwaves, front pages and in the hearts of men and women.\\"<br /><br />At the onset, Britain required both its Navy and its Royal Air Force (RAF) to prevent a German invasion.  The odds seemed slim, but strategic plans were put in place, and against all odds the pilots of the RAF, fighting with intrepid tenacity, won the Battle of Britain by the end of 1940, the first British victory of the war, which gave assurance to Americans that Britain would not fall.  Yet Britain would stand alone for nearly a year and a half before the Soviet Union battled the Germans in war, and more than two years before the U.S. joined with Britain to launch the invasion of North Africa during November of 1942; while one month earlier, Montgomery, with around 1,000 tanks (of which nearly half were from the U.S. - at last), proceeded to win Britain's first large-scale land victory against Germans, in Egypt at the Battle of El Alamein.<br /><br />Though I was born after WW II was over, I fought in Vietnam, and I certainly consider Churchill to be a magnificent wartime leader, deserving of tremendous praise.  Max Hastings has done credit to the man and the warrior.  Yes, another biography of Winston Churchill will do just fine.rman invasion.

0762434260|1.0|How hard would it be to marked wooden wands?  Dowels and spindles and half a dozen things LIKE wands are available at any hardware store at low prices.  One could fashion a pretty nice wand for less than what this junk costs.  Or buy a woooden porridge stirrer at a fancy kitchen store and tell your kid it's a wand.      Part of the genius of Rowling's world is how easy its artifacts (wands, cloaks, scarves, brooms) can be to produce in the real world -- actual magic aside, of course (wizards have to be born that way).  Unnecessarily cheap and fake-looking merchandise like this wand make me long for the days when Harry Potter only existed in books.

B004SGWYW4|5.0|Best anime that I have seen in years. It is only matched by Black Lagoon in epic scale. It has a lot of fan service shots but there is a lot of character development, and the anime style is gorgeous. Very colorful and graphic. Give this series at least 3 Episodes to get good and the storyline to set in, there is quite alot of setup introducing the characters. Cannot wait for season 2
0062059882|2.0|After reading the author's over-puffed introduction to the book where he states that his 10 year old book was so good that he decided to add more for this edition, I should have stopped there. The story had promise, but wanders all over the place and only about half of what is written actually contributes to the story. Most of it is just rambling crap. It's comical that author feels that just because his characters visit a few roadside attractions and travel to Las Vegas that he has \\"captured a sense of America\\". Really?..... I don't think so.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I don&apos;t know how anyone can say this is a good app as at its heart it&apos;s counterintuative. You open a Word file, and try to write on it. Oh wait, you can simply type no, you have to go to the menu button, click through to MORE and select Edit! WTF? Why do I need an edit button? I don&apos;t need that on a desktop so why do I need it on my phone? I should be able to click on the app and start typing. nope, doesn&apos;t work that way. Second if it has to use an edit button because of some assinine requirement of Android fine. At LEAST put it as the first selection of the menu. Its pretty much the only reason you buy this app! Sheesh it worked more like a document editor on old Palm Treo than it does on my new Evo! I mean c&apos;mon, really? So counter unintuative I actually uninstalled it even though I paid the money for it just out of irritation from using it! Download Evernote instead! it&apos;s hands down better and it ain&apos;t $15 bucks!
1594744769|4.0|I would first like to point out what a handsomely put together book this is. Ransom Riggs has incorporated a collection of anonymous vintage photographs to tell this neat young adult fantasy, and these strange, sometimes disturbing pictures help set the mood of dread and melancholy.    Teenage Floridian Jacob's grandfather has died, and while everyone else is convinced that it was from a wild dog attack, Jacob can't forget the monster he swears he saw in the woods that night. The humanoid with black eyes and a tentacled mouth still haunts his nightmares. In trying to come to terms with his grandfather's death, Jacob is led to a small Welsh island that has the bombed remains of an orphanage his grandfather may have lived in. This is how we come to know the Home for Peculiar Children.    The book is fun, and fits nicely with other books about boarding schools for children with special abilities, like the Harry Potter books or the X-Men comics, though this has a more paranormal taste to it. In its world-building, some of its use of a \\"secret history\\" comes across as silly (references to the Tunguska Event and Jefferey Dahmer were not needed), and some of the fantastic elements are contrived. Despite this, it's an imaginative, exciting tale with teenage characters who actually like they're in their teens (even those who've been the same age for decades).    The ending strongly suggests there will be a sequel. Let's hope!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|There's already 86 reviews up here, so the probability (or purpose) of anyone actually reading this is pretty slim, but I waited all this time to let the music settle in and see if my original thoughts changed with repeated listenings, so I figure I'll post my thoughts just for completion.  My first opinion has not changed. This is an excellent album. The music is superb, and yes, it is Yes. Everytime I listen to it, it grows on me more.  The only reason I give it a four and not a five star rating is because of what struck me from the very first listening. Chris Squire's bass is not putting forth the trademark sound that, for me, is the underpinning of Yes, no matter who else is doing what.  I don't know if it's been mixed to be softer or whether he played it at that tone, but the punch just doesn't ring. I miss it.  There's great bass track on the CD, so don't get me wrong. It just doesn't have, to me, that Chris Squire accent tone, and I wish it did. I think this album would have found not only the great satisfaction it has already found among the listening public, but would have taken it right over the top and absolutely blown people away.  I guess it's just the mix, because the whole CD just sounds too soft at the note edges, with the exception of Benoit David's voice, for which it is excellent. It is especially noticeable with Squire's sound, although the others also suffer from it.  Benoit David is right in place, and fills his role excellently. Sometimes his voice almost reminds me of early Greg Lake -- \\"Life on a Film Set\\" opening is somewhat Crimsonish -- and that's a liquid vocal that was and is always smooth.  Parts of the opening sound to \\"The Man You Always...\\" reminds me of Pete Townshend's work, but then it melds into Yes, so that's a nice combination.  But most of all, the songs remind me of Yes. Now there's a coincidence. Great album.

B004EPYZPI|4.0|As you've no doubt worked out from the slew of 4 to 5 star reviews this film has received - Brad Furman's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a superlative legal thriller very much in the vein of twisting John Grisham screen adaptations like \\"The Client\\" and \\"A Time To Kill\\".<br /><br />Adapted from Michael Connelly's book, the brilliant screenplay is written by John Romano - and it gets its hooks into you early and doesn't let go. It also helps that the entire cast is top notch - Francis Fisher plays the ruthlessly determined mum (of the accused), Bob Gunton (of The Shawshank Redemption) plays the defendant's family lawyer and employee of mum - a man who is all too willing to bend a few rules for his rich clients. Marisa Tomei plays Matt's long-suffering ex-wife and a prosecution lawyer in her own rite, William H. Macy plays Frank - Matt's equally long-suffering private detective partner and best friend. Josh Lucas plays the earnest but naïve prosecuting lawyer, Laurence Mason plays Earl - Matt's savvy chauffeur (he drives The Lincoln) while both John Leguizamo and Michael Pena are exceptional as Latino hustlers and hoods.<br /><br />But the film belongs to the two principal leads - Ryan Phillippe brilliantly portraying the accused - a convincing weeper on the stand who may indeed be innocent - or may be a an artic-cold slasher monster who needs to be put down like a rabid dog and not just put away. Add to this a central performance from the all-too-often underrated Matthew McConaughey shining like a diamond throughout (a sleazy lawyer forced to face up to his questionable legal tactics and outcomes) - and the whole thing feels like a really well-made movie - because that's exactly what it is (dialogue above).<br /><br />The BLU RAY print is immaculate throughout and accentuates the gritty sweatiness of so many scenes.<br /><br />It's not all genius of course, but \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is a hugely enjoyable watch - when such things seem to be in short supply these days.<br /><br />Put it high on your 'must watch' rental list...h' rental list...
B00005ATQ8|5.0|Very films of great novels have surpassed the original book in quality. I can think of one one--The French Liutenant's Woman\\" but I truly think Kubrick's writing of Lyndon captures the elegant sense of what life was like in the mid-eighteenth centure exactly the way Thakaray intended. As a setwork  at a secondary school work of English Literature in South Africa, we studied in great detail Thakaray's \\"The Adventures of Henry Esmond\\" which captures the very same society and the writing is pretty similar. Havjng studied that Esmond novel in great detail, and then saw the movie of Lyndon, I can with conviction say that Kubrick's take was accurate to the point of obsession in every detail. and in my opinion it EQUALS Thakaray's brilliant and compelling story, both book and film are equally moving, and Kubrick hones in on important pieces with much brilliant editing of plot and character.The pace while slow is easy to follow with flashbacks and is not static.  Portraying two homosexuals holding hands in a pool was photographed  naturally, without concern what the unworldly censors might think (this scene may have contributed to poor box office--the scene is crucial to the plot--but Americans are puritanical, even today (This explains the same luke warm, reaction to Kubrick's materpiece Eyes Wide Shut).One very special kudo to O'Neal who was excellent throughout and had a flawless Irish accent.=--certainly his greatest role. Though anti-hero. at the end one does feel compassion because in climbing the ladder  of success, he was following all the rules scrupulously and this proved his downfall.Like all humans he is flawed and his temper destroyed him. By the way the casting was simply superb, even the smallest roles and the credits note far fewer people than those employed in Avatar for instance. My favourite scene is Berensen who goes to her balcony bathed on incandescent burnished silvery moonlight and waits for this handsome stranger to take the bait of her seduction without one word said at the dinner table. The scene is exquisite and one feels the erotic heart beats of both players. The only words that describe it are monumental, epic, a moving painting.
0142004413|5.0|My Family & Other Animals was the very first book that made me laugh out aloud. My lifelong passion for humorous literature, adventure travel, wildlife and wild places was directly inspired by this marvelous work, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to every literate person on this planet. Indeed, I would have to say that Durrell has been the greatest influence on my own, far more modest literary career ... But don't let that put you off.<br />For what it is worth, my absolute favourite Durrell book is The Bafut Beagles, however your lifelong love affair with Gerald Durrell should definitely begin with My Family & Other Animals - it is a genuine treasure.

B00006YXOX|5.0|I waited several years to write this review, not knowing how I could articulate how much these symphonies have meant to me.  I never would have expected that the usually overblown style of Wagner could be used in such a devout way.  But more surprising to me was that his symphonies were often structured with the big picture--the whole symphony taken as a whole--in mind.  When listening to him, each movement feels part of something larger, for there is usually a climactic point in his symphonies, which was a totally new thing for me to experience.  I think that Bruckner's concept of a higher, spiritual purpose to music beyond classical formality, musical contrast, thematic development, or emotional expression has impacted me hugely.  It takes some getting used to his style--it's not dissonant, just more spread-out and unpredictable than Schubert, Schumann, or Mendelssohn (Beethoven is questionable)--but even so, there is so much to appreciate in what Bruckner did that the sometimes annoying detours in his movements hardly matter.  If there's only one movement you listen to, listen to the 2nd movement of the 7th symphony.  But if you want to experience him much more fully, listen to all of his symphonies.  This is the CD set I got and has excellent booklet notes.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|When I purchased this DVD I was certain it wasn't 3D but the picture quality was so blurry it makes me wonder. I know when I saw advertisments for the movie to come to the theater the colors were so bright and it looked like a great movie. Maybe it is digital and doesn't play well on an older DVD player. I don't know but I wasn't really happy about the viewing quality.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|Don't approach this movie looking for historical authenticity or judging Robert Wagner's American accent too critically.  If you guard those expectations, I think you'll enjoy it because it has a bit of something for everyone, including mystery/intrigue, action/adventure, ritual, and romance with a comedy of errors.  My favorite two things to watch on it are the betrayals by his enemy, the Black Knight, and the climax at the burning castle.  I think the fight sequence at the climax is quite well-done and as enjoyable as the Battle of Helm's Deep on the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings trilogy.

0553801473|4.0|Yes, I waited a looooong time for this book to come out. as a result I inhaled it on my first read. I will read it again after my daughter reads it. Understand that this book is Feast part 2, so the story is not advanced as much as we would have liked.  The first part of the book reads like a collection of short stories, little gems that can stand alone. I need to read it again because I suspect that \\"stuff\\" is happening that is subtle. Especially Tyrion's trip down the river.<br />There is a lot more super-natural goings on in this book than in the first four. Things pick up about 3/4 of the way in. GRRM never disapoints in his food discriptions and DwD serves up at least one memorable meal.<br />The Dany chapters can be frustrating, watching her make one mistake after another. However her story arc ends on a hopeful note.<br />The ending, well, yet another cliffhanger. Arrrrrg!<br />I am hopeful that the next book will not take 6 years. I'm not sure this will finish up in 2 more books it may take another book to make 8 in all.

B004FEJ3VY|5.0|This Prime is probably not the most accurate in the level of detail or proportions, but the quality is high. The glossy paint looks great and the plastic is sturdy. Some parts can pop off while transforming but they pop right back in. When changing into truck mode, some parts will take a bit of work to fit properly, and some areas don't seem to stay together as well as it could be. If you intend to get this for a kid, be prepared to be patient to show him/her the steps a few times; it's not extremely difficult but the instructions are in black and white and are not very helpful. If you are stuck look for reviews on Youtube; there are plenty of great videos.    Overall, highly recommended!

B0039PPW60|4.0|I've been using the X1204USB mixer for a few weeks now, and I must say I am extremely pleased with the product.  This has enough options/features that is certainly takes a bit of time to get a feel for everything this product has to offer.    Key items:  USB connectivity - The sound quality that comes across from the USB connection is superb.  I'm not sure why so many reviews talk about having a hard time setting this up (I do admit that I ignored the drivers that came with the mixer and got the latest drivers from the Behringer website).  There is a button controlling the USB feed into the main mix (the buttons controlling the USB signal flow are the red ones on the right, below the effects generator).  In my 'I don't want to read the manual haste', all I did was plug in the mixer, hooked up a guitar and the USB, once it connected to the PC, started playing the guitar and flipping switches until I got signal to come out on the PC.  If you want to hear playback from the PC back to the mixer while you are playing, make sure you select that signal feed in the monitor group (you have 3 options, Main Mix, Aux 3+4, and 2TR/USB).    Effects Generator:  good quality, I see this being used mostly for live performances in my case as you can layer in the same or better effects with you DAW and might as well record a clean signal so you can 'futz' with it later.  Even so, the reverb and chorus sound pretty solid.    Documentation:  This is one of the main reasons this didn't get 5 stars...  The documentation provided is lacking, but there is a comprehensive manual on the website.    Included Software:  Second reason this didn't get 5 stars.  The energyXT2.5 Compact Behringer Edition DAW that comes with the mixer is relatively useless.  By 'compact', they mean 'we will show you about 5% of what this can do, but continually recommend you drop the cash for the full version'.  If you aren't ready to drop for a high end DAW like Pro Tools, then stick with the open source Audacity (also included) and use the VST plug ins that come with the CD.      All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.  Amazon had it for about $40 cheaper that Guitar Center (and Prime eligible, which was key).  I 100% recommend a beginner using this item as their entry into digital recording, as well as a solid choice for any small group that wants to perform at the local bar.
1451629184|4.0|I finally got this book from Amazon about a week ago and I've been hesitant to read it due to all the graphic warnings.  To be blunt, the only readers who will have problems reading the graphic details in Jaycee's memoir are the people who have little-to-no experience reading about such accounts in other books.  I've read about similar experiences in other books and fanfiction and Jaycee writes about her terrible experiences in a brief but similar fashion.  In fact, what makes this book all the more compelling is that she doesn't have to be detailed (and why should she?)  You could basically fill in the holes yourself.    What you need to understand about this book is that it's a very personality-based book. If you're not interested in Jaycee the person (who she was and who she grew up to be), then I'm sorry that this is not the book you've been waiting for.  That will be a book written either in the future or never at all.  We'll never know.  Like many of you, I do have some unanswered questions after reading this, but that is not the basis of this book.  However, there were questions that did get answered (or at least I was able to figure them out) and I have a much better understanding about her story and of herself (past, present, future) than I ever did before.  The experiences aren't really the essence of the book but rather about Jaycee's personality which played a huge part in why she never escaped or sought help out of her captivity.  Again, these aren't detailed.  You have to REALLY put yourself in your shoes from when she was 11 years old and all of this stuff happened.  Whether you believe it or not chances are that many would've had the same mindset and make the same choices had we been in Jaycee's situation at the time.      As for the book, I can't believe the amount of ridiculous complaints on here about how she wrote this.  Maybe it's because that this is the first memoir/autobiography I've ever read possibly ever, but it's a really impressive bookand I was rather surprised she was able to get this written and published so quickly.  I thought it would be a whole decade before we would see a book like this.  And even though she said that she might tell more about her story in the future (when she has a better understanding of it), I learned a lot more about what happened to her in this book than all the mixed of up info the media has provided since the story came out in 2009.  She even corrected some of the media's errors about certain details.  As far as memoirs go, I know most of them are ghostwritten, so give her some credit.  She wrote the whole damn thing herself which is more than I can say for other media icons who could easily fabricate what they want their readers to read.  I was a Creative Writing major in college and believe me when I say that the courses didn't teach me a whole lot about writing than what I've learned through my own constant practice of writing the stuff I wanted to write.  I think it's a great start and I know in time, she'll get so much better at it and may one day become a professional.  Despite all the bad that the whole world knows happens to her, the book ends as a feel good story which is in essence the way good books should be.  So please buy and read this book if you haven't already.
1573228737|5.0|I finished reading Sarah Waters', elegant and engaging, second novel Affinity, a few nights ago, just before bed.  I'm surprised I didn't dream about it - with its' haunting, twisty plot, affairs of the heart, and learned descriptions of a women's prison in Victorian England.<br /><br />The story is spun in diary format by two narrators: a 30 year old spinster, Margaret, who is on the mend after a mental collapse caused by losing her beloved father, and the woman she loved (to her brother, no less); and Selina Dawes, a Spiritualist, imprisoned for harming a woman during a private sitting.<br /><br />What occurred during the sitting is unclear, due the nature of the accident, and the fuzzy recollections of those involved.  Selina's narration is secondary to Margaret's: we're given just a taste of what happened prior to her imprisonment.<br /><br />The women are on shaky ground, and I couldn't help but think I might be dealing with two unreliable narrators. It gave the story an even more uneasy air. Shivers!<br /><br />As part of her healing regiment, Margaret volunteers her time at the ever spooky Millbank prison, spending her time befriending the women residing there. The descriptions of the prison, and its prisoners are riveting. Sarah Waters writes with vivid, unforgettable detail, and she clearly does her homework.  One of the myriad reasons I love her books is her ability to tell a fabulous story within a richly described, often unfamiliar, landscape -- I get a great story, and a history lesson, without feeling like either is being forced upon me.<br /><br />Margaret is drawn to Selina, and so begins a romantic, feverish and magical story filled with the powers of loneliness and love, and the lengths we are willing to go to abolish the former and revel in the latter.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you like thought provoking, literary, mystery shrouded, historical fiction (no bodice ripping here).  If you're interested in Spiritualism, may I also suggest the wonderful : Selene of the Spirits by Melissa Pritchard, as well as Lily Dale: The True Story of the Town that Talks to the Dead, by Christine Wicker.issa Pritchard, as well as Lily Dale: The True Story of the Town that Talks to the Dead, by Christine Wicker.
B004LROMSO|3.0|**Spoilers Included**    I wrote a paper some years back on the Arthurian Legend... So when I heard about this series I was excited and immediately began watching. While I think much of the plot developed differently than that in the translations of the original stories I read, I was not disappointed in that aspect of the show. The parts of Merlin, and Morgan le Fay were executed with perfection. I actually saw Merlin as the dominant character over what is supposed to be Arthur. C'mon... The first person I think of when I hear the word chivalry is King Arthur. Instead, I get an overly whiny punk lusting after the wife of the man that saved his life?!?! Really?!? \\"whaaa... Im the king.. whaaaa.. why dont they do what I say?\\" I wish Sean Connery would show up and mushroom stamp that clown! I think the producers tried to put a \\"Smallville\\" twist on the Arthurian Legend with a little T&A on the side... Only problem is: they forgot the superman character! It kind of reminds me of when George Lucus casted Hayden Christianson as Anakin Skywalker, just too EMO!! KING ARTHUR WAS LEGENDARY FOR BEING HONORABLE! So far the best scene I can note of this Arthur is when Queen Igraine slaps the taste out of his mouth in episode 4.      There is still time for Stars to salvage this operation. First and foremost, Arthur.. call up Sean Connery,Clive Owen, or maybe even tried reading, and get the part right. Guenevere, stop being so loose, and put some clothes on!! Sir Hector, and King Lot: come back to life.. you died way too soon. Sir Kay, Morgan and Merlin: Dont change a thing! Gawain: Your character kinda contradicts it's self but it's okay! And what's with the Nun that is on the side of the villainous Morgan? Has Starz gone so PC and Liberal that they are forgetting that Arthur was one of the First British kings to be known for his Pious virtue? Why are they casting Christianity as evil, and this lust driven punk as the good guy?    Okay, I think I am done for now... Not a bad show, I will order it, and I hope it is continued. But, I sure hope that some changes are made before season 2. - MSO 3 AUG 2011
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I loved the books and have greatly enjoyed the films. This was a wonderful example of mixed media. The films get darker as they progress and captivate as well as the books.

Anyway, I've loved this magical expedition as an adult, and older adult yet, and will look forward to retracing the journey from time to time.

B001F0TM5I|4.0|The story was good in a campy 70s revenge movie type of way. A little far fetched but enjoyable. The acting & action was good.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling was a fantastic story in every way. The plot was exciting; the characters had depth; interactions never felt forced. I won't get into detail with all of that because many other reviewers already have. I mainly want to bring attention to one aspect that is getting mostly negative criticism: Katsa's aversion to marraige and motherhood. I happened to find this part of her personality refreshing. I don't have a problem with the idea of marraige, unlike Katsa, but I do share her opinion on children (definitely don't want 'em). I love that there is finally a strong character with non-traditional views for us readers with non-traditional views. I needed a character such as Katsa to come along and finally give me someone to relate to on that issue. Maybe these views are held by a minority, but I'm sure I'm not completely alone on this. We need characters on our side to, at least to mix it up, and now we have one.

B0024Y7H10|5.0|The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a great follow up to the Terminator novels.  I read all the terminator novels, including the spin-offs:  Rising Storm, Infiltrator, Future War, Terminator Dreams, Terminator Hunt, and the John Connor Chronicles.  I also read the original novels based on the movies.  The Sarah Connor Chronicles follows the spin off novels very closely, with a few character name alterations.  Catherine Weaver is based on Serena and Elisa.  Read the extended novels and you will see what I mean.  Great television series, great accuracy, great programming!  I am sorry to see it was canceled after 2 seasons.  Not enough appreciation.  I am sure the negative reviews were uninformed because the novels were not read, nor understood.  The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a supplement to the extended novels.  You have to read the novels to understand what is happening and why it is happening.
0141439688|4.0|SLIGHT SPOILERS<br /><br />So, Persuasion.  Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense.  This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages.  It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth.  But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen.  This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.<br /><br />Persuasion is it's own creature, however.  I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ.  Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:<br /><br />  \\"They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\\"<br /><br />Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit.  At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect.  That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm.  Her convolutions detract from it.<br /><br />This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation.  Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style.  Likewise, there has been no attempt to  regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon.  Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma.  Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough.  Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.<br /><br />While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes.  1.)  They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken.  2.)  They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know.  3.)  They should give manuscript variations, when applicable.  They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel.  My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book.  For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,<br /><br />  \\"The name of Anne Elliot,\\" said he, \\"has long had an interesting sound to me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\\"<br /><br />To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote:  \\"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\\"  This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence.  Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book.  Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition.  For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read.  She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others.  Oh that Mr. Elliot and his \\"Sunday travelling\\"--ought he not to be in church?  My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here.  Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors.  Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for.I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\\"  To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote:  \\"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\\"  This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence.

0553801473|1.0|Martin's ASOIAF displayed a distinctive, original style from the get-go, and before this series started to bog down in book 4, I was impressed as well by the author's vitality. Here was a writer who had \\"fire in the belly,\\" and I was happy to be carried along with the project.<br /><br />Unfortunately, book 5 is not a return to form, but rather a complete debacle. Am I saddened that this series is going nowhere? Yes. It all once seemed so promising. Am I saddened that Martin has apparently lost his enthusiasm for the whole project? Yes. Martin once seemed so inspired.<br /><br />However, I am more angered than saddened by this lackluster effort, because A Dance With Dragons strikes me not just as a bad book, but a DISHONEST one as well. This is why I give the book only one star. Martin doesn't really have a story to tell, but he decides to tell one anyway. He thus stalls for nearly a thousand pages, throwing in some important occurrences near the end that are vague or undeveloped enough as to mean possibly anything. His cliffhanger endings thus provide an uneventful and tedious book with a semblance of direction, while simultaneously buying Martin many more years to figure out where it is he wants to take the story. (A concrete example: what really happened at the wall? Obviously something important, but what exactly? Details are sketchy, and many plausible alternatives exist.  Hopefully in Winds of Winter we will learn what this plot advancement of ADWD actually entailed!!) Martin's readers do not deserve to be taken advantage of like this.<br /><br />A contributing factor to the demise of this series seems to be an unhealthy obsession with world building. Martin's world building has obviously enriched ASOIAF, but it has created plot problems, and it has also-especially in ADWD-been utilized as a way to fill space in the absence of plot development. And perhaps it has left Martin too exhausted to resolve the very problems that his ever expanding story has created. \\"My fantasy world is bigger than yours\\" is George RR Martin's response/retort to Tolkien, the fantasy Godfather that Martin wants to replace. (The insistence on RR in the name can hardly be coincidental.) Martin is not the only fantasy writer who has run into problems with the \\"more is better\\" philosophy, but his series does seem to be collapsing under its own weight. World building can lead to monumental art, but if taken to extremes it can also result in monumental folly. Martin's reach may have exceeded his grasp, and his ambition ironically may be responsible for his seeming inability to advance the story. What a convoluted mess ASOIAF has become!<br /><br />A related problem: Fantasy writers I have cherished (Tolkien, Lewis, LeGuin, Donaldson) have written works that provide nourishment to the reader. (Sort of like lembas bread on a long journey.) As ASOIAF slows down, Martin resorts to ever increasing doses of sex, sexual violence, torture, humiliation etc. to keep the reader interested. Such \\"adult\\" material has of course always been a distinctive aspect of ASOIAF, but it is becoming too pervasive and gratuitous. None of this is any worse than much of mainstream media entertainment, but I do think, sadly, that Martin's bleak medieval freakfest has become more enervating than fortifying.<br /><br />I don't think this series will ever be completed, at least not by Martin. Since it hardly seems salvageable,and since Martin doesn't seem to have his heart in it anymore, maybe this is for the best. Despite it all, though, I still am glad I read the first 3 of the series. Unfortunately, the song ended there. Martin in his 2011 incarnation is something much more depressing to think about.\\"My fantasy world is bigger than yours\\" is George RR Martin's response/retort to Tolkien, the fantasy Godfather that Martin wants to replace.

B003Y5H556|1.0|I mean where do I begin? A movie so bad Gary Oldman couldn't save it! First of the look of the film is pointless: it's too clean. People, in whatever time period the movie is based in, would not look so clean, neat or done up. There is no grittiness to the film -it looked like they were on sets thru the whole movie -very poor filming.<br /><br />The dialogue: well I can't write what I would really say because Amazon would kick it back, but the dialogue in this movie is cheesy with a capital \\"C\\". There is no point, no menace, no heart, no pulling you in.<br /><br />The language is modern English set in this time period -beyond retarded, with no accents (except Oldman's). It's like they're all speaking in perfect modern English, too clean, wearing nice clothes while 'fearing' a werewolf\\" -oooooh, yaaawwn... Even bad accents would have been preferable.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious -hands down. The word \\"wooden\\" is given an unjust definition when describing the acting in this movie. You know those awful movies that are on the SyFy channel? They have better acting than this piece of trash. This movie, pardon the awkward comparison, is like porn for teenage girls -hence the \\"Twilight\\" comparison (which I've never seen but have a younger sister who has). I half expected them to whip out an iphone & start texting or check their Facebook page, while waiting for their speaking part during the many pointless conversations.<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming about this movie other than Amanda Seyfried looks cute while she's not doing anything. An utter waste of time and money -luckily I rented it so I only wasted a few bucks. If you buy this, you're dedicated (or a teenage girl)! Catherine Hardwicke, who is the director, should be ashamed of making such tripe... (oh, and yes, I do know she directed the first \\"Twilight\\").

1439153663|5.0|This book was terrific.  I couldn't put it down.  A friend recommended this book to me.  I highly recommend this book, particularly for women.  I'm not quite sure men would enjoy it.
0553801473|4.0|The book is decent, not great, lots of reviews on that point. My point - prepare yourself for someone else to finish this series in about 15 years. In 2005, when book 4 came out, the news from Martin was that he had written a monster tomb of 1600 pages that he decided to be split into 2 books. He published the first half, covering roughly half the characters, and the other half was supposed to be right behind. Well either that was a lie or the last half was garbage and had to be rewritten because it was 6 more years before the \\"other half\\" of an already written book was published. And if it was true that Martin had completed 800 pages of this book six years ago, what exactly was he doing the last six years? (Note I don't begrudge him fame, fortune, or retirement)<br /><br />Martin is 62 and his devotion to this work has flagged badly. He is following the Robert Jordan model of plodding books but at a glacial one-every-five-years pace. If he manages volume six in the next six years, he will be 68. Does anyone think he will finish the planned final seventh volume another six years later at 74? Of course not.<br /><br />So read this one or start the series fresh if you have never read any, just don't expect to read a conclusion written by GRRM. And if the Wheel of Time series is any indication--perhaps the replacement offer will at least pick up the pace.<br /><br />My vote - GRRM should find a successor to finish the last two volumes in short order. Give him some plot line and editorial discretion and get these last two done.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is a great and up to date look at the modern publishing world. It will be facinating to look back on this in six months to a year to see how many of the predictions came true, but since they are all based on a strong knowledge of trends, my guess is the information will hold up well. Gaughran is never condescending and always friendly, while conveying a wealth of knowledge all collected in one easy to read ebook. Buy it, learn from it, and go forth and publish.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is meant for young adults, yes, but anyone that picks up this book and actually looks past their own literary haughtiness will be entranced and unable to do any other activity besides reading until the last page. This book is about a heroine named Katniss Everdeen, who voluntarily replaces her sister to participate in a slaughterhouse festivity called the Hunger Games, hosted by the evil central government that is much like the government imagined in George Orwell's 1984. In the Hunger Games, two contestants (called tributes) from each of the 12 districts in the fictitious country of Panem (existing on the site of what used to be North America) are chosen through a lottery, and entered into an arena where they cannot escape unless they kill each other until only one of them remains as the sole survivor. As you can imagine, much of the book is spent describing the intensity of the battles that ensue between the tributes. However, the parts that drew me the most were the personal moments between the characters, particularly between Cinna and Katniss. Yes, all the kisses between Peeta and Katniss make for good a teenage entertainment, but beyond that, the characters actually seem to possess a depth that is beyond what is normally entailed in a young adult book. In its literary worth, the book straddles somewhere between The Giver and 1984, but in its pace and fun, I would place it right along the lines of Twilight if not higher.

B004EPYZSK|3.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford lead the cast of this science fiction western action epic and despite the crazy mixing of film genres, it's a good movie. Daniel Craig established himself as one of the most dynamic action stars of this decade when he was cast as the new James Bond in Casino Royale. Craig brought a unique, rougher edge and dynamism to the Bond role and carries that edginess over to his role as Jake Lonergan. Lonergan is an amnesiac anti-hero trying to solve the mystery of his lost memory as well as get to the bottom of the strange device attached to his wrist. Harrison Ford, despite being well into his sixties, still kicks butt as Woodrow Dolarhyde, Civil War veteran turned ornery cattle rancher. Ford's performance is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's performance in The Unforgiven. That's to say Dolarhyde has lost a few steps over the years, but has fought many more battles than the younger Jake Lonergan played by Craig. Dolarhyde has his share of character flaws, and apparently so does Lonergan. Craig shares the spotlight quite well with Ford, who is a legendary Hollywood action star.<br /><br />Cowboys & Aliens` plot is summed up by its title. As I try and put into writing why cowboys are fighting aliens the silliness of it all becomes apparent, but more is the fool anyone going to a movie with the words cowboys and aliens in the title expecting the next Memento. The cliff notes, and spoiler free version is that a hostile alien race is kidnapping humans ahead of their planned, full scaled invasion of earth. The aliens possess vastly superior technology to the barely industrialized Americans of the latter half of the nineteenth century. This simple set up sets the stage for some great action and a few nice plot twists. The movie never gets too bogged down in character development. We get just enough of Jake Lonergan's past via flash back's so that we can see his character's evolution from anti-hero to plain hero. Lonergan's moral development is highlighted by the inclusion of the town preacher played by Clancy Brown, who makes clear early on that he's \\"seen good men do bad things and bad men do good things.\\"<br /><br />By film's end, you'll be treated to every type of action scene except a car chase. It threatens at times to be a bit much for any other movie without cowboys and aliens in the title. It's perfect summer movie fodder. It's great fun, with an uncomplicated plot, but simplicity works in its favor and it's greatly helped by the fact that it boasts two incredible talents in Craig and Ford. Recommended for anyone who wants to tune out and just enjoy a great action movie with a unique, if somewhat offbeat premise -- basically those of us who think a western would benefit from the presence of hostile extraterrestrials. In other words, those amongst us who like a little Cowboys with their aliens, or is that aliens with their cowboys? You get the idea.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.hero.

B005FJ7DOM|5.0|very good, kept me guessing and rooting for the main characters,   without giving too much away , the characters are very endearing and I was rooting for them through the whole thing and you really never knew who willget killed.   With a name like \\"StakeLand\\" it sounds like campy fun but it's a survival horror movie.  The subject matter is \\"Vampires\\" but it sort of follows zombie movie rules, if you are a fan of zombie movies, like me, this will give you a nice fix.  Like in most good zombie movies, the most dangerous threat isn't the monsters - it's the survivors who prey on the weak and deceive the good hearted.
0345529057|5.0|Great book quality.  I have not started to read them, but I hear it is exceptional.  Couple more chapters in another book and I'll get my start!  Thanks Amazon!
1416550534|5.0|I picked up this book after being engrossed in Morton's second novel, [[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]].    Again, I couldn't put this book down. This novel documents the memories of Grace, a woman in her late 90s, as she remembers events that happened in her life in the early 1900s... including the secrets she's been keeping for decades. In addition to an enthralling mystery to the end, this novel also gives an interesting glimpse into society before and during WWI, and how the war began to change everyone's way of life. For anyone who is a fan of the UK miniseries [[ASIN:B0047H7QD6 Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey  (Original UK Unedited Edition)]], you will definitely find this book an exciting glimpse into 1900 English society.    Don't waste any more time, pick up this book and read it!
0061726826|4.0|Delirium takes the notion of love and spins it on its head. Lena, unlike most girls her age, wants nothing to do with love. To her, love is a death sentence.. the downfall of a person. For Lena, her eighteenth birthday cannot come soon enough. And when that day comes, Lena believes that she will finally be able to breath a sigh of relief for she will be cured of the deadly disease. But when she meets Alex... Lena realizes that nothing will be the same.<br /><br />The tale begins slowly. The characters are introduced... back story given.. the usual stuff. And I have to admit, sadly, that I was not overly impressed. I wondered where was the author that I had fallen in love with in Before I Fall. I was in shock. Now, before you go thinking I hated the novel, I want to say that this is far from the truth. The truth is Delirium just took a while for me to warm up to. And really that warming up cycle didn't appear until the second half of the novel. For me, these halves were like night and day.<br /><br />In contrast to the beginning, the second half of Delirium is pure genius. It is a non-stop, action packed ball of awesomeness. Finally, here was the Lauren Oliver that I had been waiting so desperately for. In all honesty, I am at a loss words for this portion of the novel. And the ending.. my heart literally stopped beating. I read the last chapter.. stopped.. had to go back, read it again.. still did not believe that I had read it right and read it for the third time. It was an OH MY GOD moment of epic portions. I did not see this twist coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Delirium is a lovely dystopian read that I never in a million years would have thought would effect me so deeply. The world that Oliver creates flows beautifully from its pages. Encasing you in a world that is familiar yet different. With so many dystopian novels being released at the present time, you might think that they all just flow together, but with Delirium, you would be wrong.
1440503257|5.0|There are a LOT of recipes in this book.  What I like about it is that every recipe comes with an excerpt on where the dish can be found in the Harry Potter books.  Love the recipe for marshmallows and lemon drops!  I did find it a little difficult to find only desert dishes or entree meals... the recipes seem to be organized by book, or maybe in the order they appear.  I would have liked the recipes to have been split traditionally or organizing in some other way. And you will not find recipes for HP invented foods/drinks (ie: Butterbeer). But a very good place to find traditional English/Irish/Scottish meals named in the HP books!
0385738757|5.0|Shucks, if you thought The Maze Runner was fantastic, then you are surely in for a great treat with its sequel. The Scorch Trials starts up right where the previous novel left off. Thomas and his gang think that they are saved. But boy are they wrong. And WICKED has definitely topped themselves this time.<br /><br />One thing that I loved about The Maze Runner was the gore and shock-value that Dashner every so lovingly included. It is one of the main reasons why I adored that novel in the first place. And if you are like me, then you will be very pleased to see plenty of it in The Scorch Trials. From the very first beginning, Dashner holds nothing back. And I loved every second of the action.<br /><br />For the most part, I was very pleased with The Scorch Trials. Plenty of action and intrigue. But I cannot but feel like there is something missing. Something that would have made the novel go from pretty good to over the top amazing. I think part of my issue with the novel has to do with how much I really liked the previous novel. Everything so fresh and excited. And yes, readers will get that with this novel. It is just that in terms of the plot, I feel like nothing really new was presented. The characters are pretty much the same with little to no character growth. WICKED is still as confusing as ever. And parts of the novel, just made me want to pull out my hair because I want answers.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials is a great addition to the series... even though I feel like I am still at square one in figuring out the big picture. Yes, parts of this novel frustrated me beyond belief... but I think that is the beauty of the novel. The Scorch Trials will give readers very few answers, leave them with a lot more questions, and totally have them begging for more. I know I am.
0553801473|3.0|Long, sometimes boring, in many cases uneccesary. The story has always a lot of potential and the world is great, but it is a story that could be told in half the lenght. It  also misses a climax at the end, even the most climatic moment is kinda confusing and really not well described. I hope the editor will do a better Job in controlling GRRM or less and less people will read the final book.
0143114085|5.0|Little Face is a gripping tome full of twists and turns.  Sophie Hannah delivers another gem worthy of staying up well past our bedtimes to see what is to unfold.  She brilliantly keeps the reader engaged and guessing.  I LOVE THINKING-Ms. Hannah respects her readers' intellect and creates a magnificent puzzle to tantalize our neurons as if they were as impressionable and delighted as easily as our taste buds.  Bravo Chef Hannah-Bravo!

B004SB60OC|5.0|I recently \\"discovered\\" this talented young lady while listening to XM radio in my car. Having studied voice and played the lead in several musicals, I can recognize great talent when I hear it!!  The fact that she writes her own music, shows the breath of her talent. I look forward to many more great albums from her. 2 of her songs were used on the TV show \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\". Some of her melodies are downright \\"haunting\\"!!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|its good...has alot of songs...only problem is that u buy a song...and it skips..or sounds like crap... only happens once in a while.. but if I&apos;m spending my money I want good quality
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Michael Connelly's THE LINCOLN LAWYER is given a fitting screen translation and much of the credit goes to Matthew McConaughey.  In his best performance in years, Matthew's spirited personification of ace defender Mickey is the foundation of a labrynthine plot full of twists and turns, shady low-life and unexpected heroes.  The familiar LA background pulsates in new ways, achieving an almost surreal quality.  The supporting cast is superb:  Marisa Tomei as Mickey's ex is sultry but maternal too; William H. Macy shines as Mickey's friend and PI; Ryan Phillippe as the smarmy Louis Roulet; Michael Pena as the wrongly convicted murderer; John Leguizamo as the treacherous bail bondsman; Frances Fisher as Roulet's cool mama; Shea Wigham, the snitch; Bryan Cranston and Michaela Conlin's detectives and Josh Lucas' self-important prosecutor.  One of this year's strongest ensemble casts.  LINCOLN LAWYER moves well, holding your interest right to the last scene.  Ooops...forgot country singer Trace Adkins marvelous bit as a heavy-duty biker.  Fans of courtroom mysteries should love this movie!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|Amazing film, reminiscent of seeing Bourne for the first time. Editing, score, direction and performances combine to make this one of the best action movies I've seen.
B004UHF51S|5.0|Incredible, picturesque lyrics combined with flawless, melodic rhythms take you on a literary journey that you don't want to return from.  It makes your soul say \\"WOW\\"!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|The reviews got this one right!  I LOVE this!!!  It holds my belongings and my drinks.  Has a zippered compartment as well. I use it for my Baby Jogger City Mini and it works great.  It even stays on when I fold the stroller.  I didn't want to waste $30 on the cup holders that come with my stroller, but this is truly a universal model that will work well on any stroller.  It is high-quality and not cheaply made.
B00278U1W0|5.0|Clapton and Winwood in great form.  After I saw Eric Clapton live in Germany a couple of years ago, i was really disappointed by one of my favourite guitar heroes. He was so uninspired and just working off his concert, it was a shame and that concert tour got a lot of bad press.  Live from Madison Square Garden, however shows the performance i wish i had gotten for my money in Cologne.  Very nice audio and HD video. I will never go to see him live again, when i can have a better \\"live\\" concert experience at home for less money. I get all the pleasure of the music in perfect sound quality without all the hassles involved in travelling to and from a live concert.
0061122416|3.0|I know this book is a worldwide bestseller and has received praise of the highest kind from very distinguished and knowledgable people. Yet I found it extremely boring and difficult to read. The whole story sounded to me phony. The whole business about 'pursuing one's own legend' seemed to me simplistic. The 'wisdom' which emerged in the course of all the hero's wanderings seem to me little more than cliche. I could not understand how so many people went for this book. Here it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of its readers disagree with me completely.
B0036EH3X4|3.0|Over 5 seasons there has been a build up to the final climax, but i am still searching for it.  As much as the first 5 seasons left room for speculation and gave away the odd clue, the series finale is just a mess and does not live up to the first 5 seasons.  I could be more specific, but don´t  want to give away the ending.
1451629184|5.0|Wow! I must say this is one of the most heartbreaking, yet at the same time uplifting books that I have ever read. Like many of you I watched Jaycee's interview with Diane Sawyer and I was so impressed at what a strong, well spoken woman she turned out to be. The things she endured are almost too horrible to think of and I'm sure having to relive them all over again in writing was not an easy task. I found this book to be easy to read and EXTREMELY well written. I'm confused at several of the comments I've seen, saying things along the lines of the book lacking proper editing and not being easy to understand, i.e. that its confusing. Umm...of course it's confusing! How could any person in that experience ever be able to make any sense of it? She wrote it exactly as she experienced it. Jaycee herself says this in the Introduction, so it's a shame people simply overlooked or didn't read that part. Personally I feel the book was much more powerful in Jaycee's own style of writing, compared to a heavily edited version lacking any and all sense of her personality. I cannot recommend it enough. There are fairly graphic parts, but the purpose was not to sugarcoat her experiences as many(including I'm sure Phillip and Nancy) would have you do. She's being completely honest and telling the entire world exactly what was done to her. You can just tell she has such potential and is going to do so much good in the world. We're rooting for you Jaycee!
B002ZG9846|5.0|This parody of all the current superhero flicks is just a blast to watch.Excellent picture quality and a soundtrack that will work out your home cinema, subwoofers included.  For many of my friends, me and my wife included, the best action release in 2010.  Nicolas Cage in one of his better recent roles.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I accidentally bought this app because of amazons stupid one click buy policy. this game is so easy and im going to beat it out of spite
B0042JH05I|2.0|Sadly Phil Collins doesn´t play drums anymore, but vocals are definitively not his strongpoint.  Picture quality, as well as audio quality is very good, though.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I bought this mainly to listen to a Kindle on my truck speakers, which it does well, also used a flash drive to listen to music, great quality.  I have used it indoors, together with a Wagan 5 amp AC to 12V DC power adapter, great results. I listen to internet radio a lot, connected unit to desktop headphone socket, and radio receives good signal anywhere in house. Recently tuned into it on an mp3 player and had great reception whilst mowing both front and back yards.  I am thrilled with this unit, highly recommended.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|I am a big sci fi fan, but this so highly appraised production does not touch my strings.  Story is weak and foreseeable, i consider it more a political movie with aliens serving the purpose of more or less legal immigrants and their problems.  Also i am not a fan of the way the story is being told.  Biggest sci fi deception of the year  for me.
0451228375|5.0|I had read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and was anxious to read this one. It is not a sequel, so \\"Pillars..\\" does not have to be read before it. I did not see how I could enjoy this one as much as the first one, but I actually like it more! It is quite long, so I saved it for a trip when I would be waiting for flights and flying. The author does a great job in developing  characters, they are very believable and this period of history was terribly limiting for  people due to the church policies, men in power, as well as the position in life in which you were born and most could not escape. A era when life expectancy was short and human life was not of value.   I highly recommend it for those who are interested in this period of history.... which I was NOT until I read both books!
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Many hours of entertainment with both action and philosophic content.  The biggest sci fi series about mankind versus its creations will not disappoint you. Every so often the cylons will confront mankind with its own wrongdoings and weaknesses.  The audio and picture quality, as well as the detailed content of the boxes have been reviewed many times and there is nothing meaningful to be added.  This is coming close to my favourite sci fi saga Babylon 5 which is more about mankind and it´s interaction with alien races and their cultures.
0553213105|1.0|why does amazon sell books which classic are and are available everybody in usual  libraries or via internet?<br /> does amazon have not enough money to sell what is free?
0439023513|5.0|I'm not really sure why this book's reviews are so spread out-- I would have thought they would all be four or five star. I admit that it did go in a totally unexpected direction and there were some devistating character deaths, but that's what gets you hooked!! This book had me from the moment I opened it. Though not as straight forward as the first two, I enjoyed it almost equally as much. The one thing I did hate was that Peeta was absent for so long! :( But with good reason.<br /> I also thought the ending did give a lot of closure, and it wasn't the perfect happily-ever-after ending like some book have-- how could it be with all that Katniss and Peeta have been through? Very enjoyable, I laughed, I cried, I screamed, I wanted to rip the book in half. Collins has a wonderful gift for playing people's emotions through her writing.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone (and I have). It's a satisfying ending to the triolgy. Collins has done it again.
B000G03Q2S|3.0|Whether people want to admit it or not, the mono version is the canonical version of this album.  It is really the mono mix that needs to be in high resolution, not the stereo mix. The stereo mix is okay and it sounds pretty good in high resolution but it doesn't matter. The fact is that it is not the same album due to the number of concessions had to be made.<br /><br />Sorry, folks, the 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is a waste of space. I'm not thrilled with how the surround was used but it almost doesn't matter. When you turn up the volume, parts of it are downright abrasive. I don't know if the problem is in the mix, the mastering, or the Dolby Digital compression but I don't care. Pet Sounds should never be abrasive!<br /><br />I suppose we'll have to wait for the 50th Anniversary for this album to be released properly. Any release that does not have the original mono mix with the best sound quality possible is not worth the bother. We might as well stick with the earlier versions.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Ok, wow, what a shock, in a good way! I was so excited when I heard Incubus was coming out with a new cd. I was completely surprised when I heard it for the first time. At first, I didn't like the way they changed their sound. After listening to it a few more times, I fell in love with it and I'm loving it more and more each day. It is so different from all their other albums. I absolutly loved all their other albums, however, I love this one too. I like how every song doesn't sound the same and it's just nice and soothing. If you're a true Incubus fan, you'll love this new cd. Don't be discouraged when you first hear it. Take time to really listen to the music and you'll think it's beautiful too.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Didn&apos;t think the reviews were all real until I actually used this.. SO much better and more fun than the regular keyboard.. love the colors (using neon) and how it makes my typing faster. Love it!
B000FGGE68|5.0|Have loved this movie since the first time I saw it and knew I had to buy it. Disc was brand new and works perfectly! I've already watched it several dozen times. The character is amazing, Milla does a great job as Violet. So hoping to cosplay her for a con in the near future.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My 13-year old son, for whom I bought this movie, said this:    \\"I thought that this movie was great, but don't know how many of the cultural points non-Japanese would understand, so think that a lot of non-Japanese might think this movie to be strange.  I've never seen the movie as a non-Japanese, so I couldn't say for sure.\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this product to supplement my cardio training. I was looking for something that combined cardio and strength training.

0312370830|2.0|This is the David Mamet school of writing, everything over explained and repetitive.     While I may not have known the specifics of this incident, I am not surprised by it. The basic skeleton of the story is interesting but the characters telling it are not. Julia is too self-absorbed so overall, I was disappointed. Hopefully, the movie will condense it to realize the potential
B001F6TXME|5.0|I purchased an off brand version with an LCD screen before this one and the metal jacket came off and wouldn't stay on so I switched to this one and love it. I can plug it in with no issue i don't worry about the metal jacket coming off the plug the only downside is that this doesn't have a screen to tell you how many seconds the shutter has been open I love this one just for the fact that it works.
B004ZZLX5W|5.0|Destined to be a classic, The Suburbs gets a brilliant video treatment by Spike Jonze. Anyone who grew up in the 'burbs will certainly feel the intensity Jonze & Co have poured into the visuals of the film. Lost youth, conformity finding its way to individuality, brutal lessons that reveal (or suppress) growth... masterful. The two new tunes (one ftrg David Byrne!) add perfectly to an already flawless record. Pick it up. See them live. You can never go wrong with the genuine creativity and humility of Arcade Fire.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|The only time I've ever posted on here is to bash on Queensryche's \\"Dedicated to Chaos.\\"  To say that this CD puts the other to shame is an understatement.  Think about this:  First-week sales: Iconoclast - 7500; Dedicated to Chaos - 8000.  Queensryche is a mainstream band which had support from MTV and FM radio (and still does to some extent).  Symphony X is an underground band with no mass-media presence but a strong cult following.  Numbers speak for themselves.  I have nothing but pure respect for this band.  They always raise the bar with each album they put out.  I normally only buy standard editions of albums, but I had to buy the 2-disc special edition of Iconoclast to get the full experience.  I can not pick out a favorite song, they're all just too good.  Thank you Michael (all three), Russell and Jason.  You guys make music for the sake of making music.  The only other three bands that have inspired me as much as this band are Shadow Gallery, Devin Townsend Band/Project and Pain of Salvation, but I feel that all prog-metal bands have something to offer.  Don't get me wrong, I still love Queensryche, but they've put themselves in a tight spot - the mainstream audience have left them, and they've isolated the metal/true-rock fans.  They need to get their act together.  Anyways, thanks for letting me rant.  If you're on the fence, buy Iconoclast!
B000GH2YPG|4.0|I read this book when I was in my teens, and at that time I found it very suspenseful . . . even though I wondered how and why the young female hero from whose point of view we see the events unfold could be so naive. The naive-woman-in-peril genre doesn't thrill me. Nevertheless, I couldn't put this book down, and I liked the ending, which was a twist upon a twist and very well done. I have no idea what I would think of this book if I read it today, when its style is so passe. I'm glad to see that it's still in print, because it's a classic.
0143117009|5.0|I came back from Korea on April 1, 2011 with a dying dream to write a book about my experiences. I had little more than 30 pages of badly-edited journal entries that were all totally out of chronological order. Not only that, through the magic of \\"Copy and Paste\\" I had managed to intertwine up to four or five copies of the exact same stories within my journal entries. I had given up on trying to make sense of my small collections of stories and insignificant observations until one day I started reading a book called Collapse by Jared Diamond. I so enjoyed the section of the book describing the European Vikings' first contact with the local Inuit in the \\"Newly-Discovered\\" Greenland (as well as their irrational reluctance to eat fish and their unwillingness to adapt their survival strategies in the face of a social collapse), I decided I wanted to try and delay my own social collapse and try being a \\"writer.\\"<br /><br />Another factor that contributed to this book's completion was the fact that I was so much at odds with living in the same house as my mom's third husband, I barricaded myself into my room, leaving only four or five times a day to use the living room phone, go to the bathroom or to make myself a bowl of Cheerios. During the next four month's of my isolation from my life's problems I was forced to work on this book to avoid facing my other problems in life; my lack of job opportunities, my inability to get a girlfriend and my prolonged recovery from an expensive surgery.<br /><br />While completing my book (First Contact in Korea: A Native English Teacher's Guide to South Korea) I became intimately reacquainted with the frustrations of my American life (showing up six times to Chico Sports Club without being able to schedule a job interview) that contributed to my original departure for Korea a year and a half earlier. In the face of all adversity in life there are always opportunities; mainly the experience of working aboard, writing a book and receiving quality and affordable medical care from a country on the other side of the world.ffordable medical care from a country on the other side of the world.
1579126278|2.0|Yes, the ending was quite shocking... but not believable. There was no real motive provided..., it felt like a trick on the reader. I have found Christie's novels too far-fetched for me. I will stop reading her and stick to Dorothy Sayers, who paints wonderful pictures of the pop culture of 1920-1930's England.

B0036EH3WU|4.0|It took about three weeks for this boxset to reach me (in Romania), but it was mostly worth it. The packaging is nice and there are cool add-ons to the simple collection (bonus materials, collectibles etc). The packaging of the DVDs is in deed kind of improper, making them predisposed to scratching and dust. But the most anoying thing is the region coding. I actually have a Regaion 1 Playstation 3 that played DVDs and Blurays from region 1 without any issue so far. But it won't play these DVDs if its life depended on it.  I contacted Buena Vista and they just sent me to the distributor in my country. Which is a waste of time, since I didn't buy these in Europe, where btw we are region 2, and also the distributors are not the owners of the products and are not responsible for manufacturing products that are not even distributed in their area. Moreover the re-sellers don't have the knowledge and skills to provide techincal assistance for these types of situations.     Thank you Buena Vista and Disney! You truly suck ass!     Amazon on the other hand did their job right, and the product got to me in good conditions and pretty fast considering the distance.

My Dad was in the First Marine Division and was on Cape Gloucester as well as Pavuvu and Peleliu.  I never saw much about these campaigns so this series gave me more insight than before.  Some of the scenes are disturbing and graphic, but I suspect they are accurate.  All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book.      This is the first YA novel I've read since I was a YA, and it came highly recommended by friends and coworkers.  I was reluctant to read it initially, but it's wonderful.  Really a fantastic read, and I'd particularly recommend this book for long-distance travelers, etc.
0375842209|5.0|This book sat on my shelf because it was given to me and after reading the back, I was not sure if I would love it.  Someone else convinced me to read it so I gave it a shot.  At first, I wasn't too sure that I was going to enjoy it.  However, after reading a few chapters and understanding the narrator (very unique) and figuring out it wasn't going to be a childish book, I really got into it. There are so many reviews written on this explaining what the book is about and so on--the one review that helped me decide to try it (in addition to being encouraged from a cousin) was the person who wrote that it is too bad it is in youth fiction because a lot of people (adults) would enjoy this.  Honestly, I do not think this is something I would have enjoyed as youngster, but obviously it is very popular among young adults.  I am in my mid-30's and I really did enjoy it!
0312588887|5.0|I read this book many years ago and wanted to reread it again in today's climate and in light of the changes in women's opportunities today. Grandy was a very strong and successful woman for her time. It is the strength and perseverence by women like her that opened the opportunities for women today.
B004SQS9FA|3.0|I'll admit that I was more than a little disappointed with the quality and short length of TKOL.  I was actually waiting for them to release a second half to the album but none was to be had.  Although songs like Codex and Lotus Flower are great, the rest of the album have some seriously abstract artistry.  I can appreciate their creativity, but I like a little more punch between the more abstract.  This said, I recently heard their live performance of TKOL entitled, \\"From the Basement\\" and the album completely blossomed in my ears.  I found myself saying under my breath, \\"This is the way the album is supposed to sound!\\"  They also recorded \\"In Rainbows\\" and some other songs from their 2008 From the Basement performance.  My suggestion, get a pair of headphones and listen to both liver performances From the Basement...you will hear every little nuance in full glory.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I like gaming in Android and my favorite genre is tower defense.  I got GRave Defense HD as part of the Free App of the Day promotion.  This is a good game.  The graphics are very detailed even though this is only from a top down perspective.  Compared to my other games, I like this more than Robo Defense, but it comes behind games like Fieldrunners HD and Myth Defense.      The good parts are the long list of towers you can place and the severl levels that they can be upgraded.  For Robo Defense, you only get three towers and three upgrade levels.  Also GRave Defense gives you preset areas that you can place your towers along the route, so you have to be more strategic in placing your guns and cannons to get the maximum effect.    The game starts out easy to give you time to get used to the game.  But the higher levels are hard and the waves of enemies can overwhelm your defenses if you don't plan well.  In my opinion, this helps to give the game some depth for players who get bored easy.

Jaycee is one amazing woman who has overcome such unspeakable actions upon her over 18 years.  I admire her for her honesty and caring spirit and for not letting more of her life be stolen from her.  She does an amazing job telling her story.  Now my tears for her are joyful for the life that she will experience.

I was emotionally moved by this book like I have never been before. Its most horrifying and yet I could not put it down. At some point I kept telling myself this must be fiction. I can guarantee you that you will not put this book down.

0316066524|3.0|Potential readers should be warned:  Although Infinite Jest runs ~484,000 words, that evidently wasn't enough for author Wallace to provide readers with any resolution to his multiple, partially interlocking story-lines.  If that will bother you (as it did me and other readers), you probably shouldn't start this.  On the other hand its supporters will tell you \\"it's not the destination, it's the journey.\\"  And the novel is undeniably shot through with interesting characters, sub-plots, anecdotes and allusions.  At times I found it quite entertaining.  Hence the three-star rating.  Still, I have a strong 'classical' preference for Unity with my Variety, and that's just not what Wallace has on offer.<br /><br />What I mostly take away from reading this book is a portrait of the seriously disturbed, manic/depressive, substance-abusing, suicidal author.  This is, in other words, not a story at all...it's a chronicle of a man's mental condition as he attempts to write a story (ultimately failing).  Mr. Wallace committed suicide while in the depression end of his cycle; in his manic phase he penned Infinite Jest.  There is a constant pall-mall rush to his flow of run-on paragraphs, along with a literally compulsive listing of things and naming of irrelevant persons or events, that will drive many readers to \\"howling fantods\\".  More than that though:  His imaginings are so bizarre they more resemble the ravings of a person in delirium than genuinely creative outflow of a Nietzsche or Van Gogh. So much mutation, mutilation, addiction and insanity... so little beauty, wisdom or goodness.<br /><br />  Some  have promoted this book as funny, or a black comedy, or even \\"hilarious\\".  Not even!  Catch-22 and Dr. Strangelove (the movie) were black comedies, and they were hilarious.  Voltaire's Candide was at least amusing.  Infinite Jest virtually never tempted me to laugh or even smile.  Grimace sometimes, yes.<br /><br />  It's unfortunate, and a bad sign of our times, that some effete literary critics have hailed this style as \\"the next thing in fiction.\\" I'm convinced they're simply trying to be the first critic to have caught the New Wave.  This reminds me so much of the situation in modern art, the way pretentious critics contest with one another to identify some new trend or artist...while the art itself they're promoting is mostly just crap.  At any rate, 15 years since this book was published it doesn't appear that the David Foster Wallace style has caught on in any pervasive way. If it ever does, I'm through with contemporary fiction. Luckily there are enough good novels from past generations to keep me occupied the rest of my life.ics have hailed this style as \\"the next thing in fiction.\\" I'm convinced they're simply trying to be the first critic to have caught the New Wave.

0307474712|3.0|I felt like this book took FOREVER to get to the point. And saying that, I think I liked the book better BEFORE it got to the point. It's a little heavy in British Humor also. If you don't know a lot of \\"UK English\\", it most likely wont be that funny. Even saying that, it still wasn't that funny.  It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but I wouldn't read it again.   As far as writing goes, it was beautifully written, but I found the story to be rather boring.
076115678X|5.0|One afternoon as I was browsing the shelves in my local county library I suddenly saw the words, \\"Curly Girl\\" and I was intrigued enough to check it out and bring the book home.<br /><br />All my life I have battled, hated, and been ashamed of my *ugly* naturally curly hair. I am the only curly girl in a family of people with stick-straight hair. When I was a child, my mother always complained that my hair looked \\"like it was combed with an egg-beater.\\" I so wanted to feel long, swinging hair on my shoulders that I pinned scarves to my head. My mother always threatened that if I didn't take better care of my hair; i.e.,control its unruliness, she would cut it off. And just before my 3rd grade field trip to take a boat cruise in the harbor, that is exactly what she did! I was humiliated to discover that with the ocean's humidity I looked like a poodle! In my teens I slept on rollers as big as orange juice cans and even subjected my hair to a home-straightening kit, which ruined it and caused it to break off and thin. In my 20's I learned that if I kept my hair cut really short and used a big round brush to blow-dry it, my hair would be smoother. But the results never were exactly as I'd hoped and never lasted. Give me a rainstorm, fog, sweatiness, or too much handling, and it would all come undone. For years I wouldn't allow my husband to touch my hair for fear that my hair would revert to its natural state. (Not too romantic, heh?)<br /><br />About 15 years ago at my *staight-haired* sister's urging, I tried using a diffuser when blow-drying my hair. Unfortunately I knew nothing about technique. I was living in the Desert Southwest and was still dutifully shampooing my hair every morning to remove the ton of hair products I loaded onto it the previous day and then blow-dying it before I went to work. The result of my efforts with the diffuser was that my hair was dry and brittle and frizzy. When I would unexpectedly catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror or window Iwould think, \\"who's that!\\"<br /><br />Massey's book was a revelation from the beginning and I actually read it through in one sitting. The next day I followed her suggestions and was amazed at how much curl I actually had in my hair, even short. The 2nd day I read the labels on my haircare products and tossed out the ones with the drying ingredients, and even bravely disposed of my round styling brushes. Once I embraced my curliness, I decided that I really needed to grow it out some since without blow-drying, it looked really short! Each day my hair seemed to get shinier and by following the styling advice in Massey's book, my technique improved too. I haven't gotten a single negative comment or look from my friends and family. (Indeed, they are relieved that I am no longer so hair-crzed and dissatisfied with its appearance.) But best of all, I have come to terms with my curls and even discovered that I like the way they look and I am proud of them. I am so glad that I discovered \\"Curly Girl: the Handbook\\" that day in the library. I wish there had been a book like it years ago when I was really young. It has changed my life for the better.
B000002B35|5.0|Please don't give any credence to Rob O'Connor's Amazon.com Editorial review.  None.  Zip. Nada!  The man is obviously deaf, drunk, and devoid of the least bit of intellect and taste required to recognize good music, good audio engineering, and good production in general.  P¤U¤L¤S¤E was originally released in June of 95 and sold over 2 million copies in only one month.  It debuted in the number one position due to preorders and I purchased one of the original CD's when record stores still existed.  It was released in a box with a pulsing (blinking) red light on the spine and the two CD's were housed inside both covers of a book which slipped in and out of the case nicely.  A very nice production job on the marketing and if you can lay your hands on one of these now collectibles you will find the battery is easily replaceable and the album will still blink (unless someone let the battery sit inside and corrode horribly).  Mine actually lasted over three years without needing initial replacing!  I think it averages about 2 years on a new battery each time and it is still blinking away!  Ah  but you want to hear about the music!  I don't know what the latest CD release is housed in but I can tell you that even if the latest release is not \\"re-mastered\\" worry not.  PULSE was one of the best engineered live albums and one of the best 90's releases period!  The clarity, the definition, the balance of loudness (too many remasters end up bottoming out horribly), and the audience amplitude are all meticulously produced in order to give the listener a wonderful live-capture feeling (without the swell of audience drowning out the music) while keeping the virtuosity of Pink Floyd right up front and separated into gorgeous stereo definition.  Even on a surround system where you set your amplifier to \\"concert surround\\" settings, the stereo will translate beautifully into pseudo-surround.  Gilmour's guitar as always is one of, if not THE, greatest guitar sounds in the world and he stretches his studio solos out here without becoming repetitive and boring.  His notes snatch glimpses of glory and emote right up there on the Carlos Santana level.  The Floyd, even without Waters, are also, as usual, perfect!  Pink Floyd have always been known as perfectionists.  In the old days, they marked the floor up with little x's as designated places to stand whether you were the saxophonist, a backup singer, or David yourself, and God-forbid you stray from your mark or the band would just go crazy.  The visual effects were note-for-note tied to the music with seldom to never an error.  Any concert of theirs you attended was an event worth remembering and cherishing.  The music on both discs here, already reviewed ad infinitum on these pages, is just plain glorious!  The Dark Side Of The Moon is a very nice treat with some embellishments that add to and do not detract from the original.  One note here, no malice to the glorious original of Clare Torry, but huge kudos have to be sent out to the astounding vocals of Sam Brown on Great Gig In The Sky! I honestly love this version more than the original just because of her solo.  If you are unfamiliar with Sam Brown, she is mainly a European act, member of Jools Holland (original founding member of Squeeze) band and daughter of English rock and roller Joe Brown, all who were very close friends to George Harrison.  Jools and Sam perform Harrison's last recording Horse To Water, on The Concert For George.  Sam's vocals on that piece rival the best sounds to ever come from the lips of Aretha Franklin, that's how good a singer she is, and here, Pink Floyd let her loose on one of the craziest but greatest songs to ever come from their archives.  Her work on backing is all over both of these CD's and one has to acknowledge that the backing vocals on PULSE are some of the finest ever produced on a Floyd album.  As for the rest of the music, just read more reviews and look at the overall ranking and that should tell you whether or not you would be wasting your money here.  Not!  This is one of the best live recordings ever made, yes!  Let's put it simply:<br /><br />The album starts moody with an incredible opening salvo of Shine On You Crazy Diamond featuring all the best parts and while the audience is reeling from that, the spacey dissonance and drums of Astronomy Domine rendered in the Ummagumma style (with the sad exception that the flying saucer sound-effect is missing as well as the quiet organ solo in the middle, this is the only bad mark I can give the entire PULSE set).  From there we get the best extended versions of the best of Momentary Lapse Of Reason, Division Bell, Gilmour's best songs from The Wall, a heart-felt rendering of Wish You Were Here, and all of Dark Side Of The Moon from heartbeat and laughter to heartbeat fade-out, there is no DARK side of the moon, really...  Now what more could a Pink Floyd fan ask for?  And if you are a novice looking for a good selection of Floyd, do not let the word \\"live\\" scare you away!  You know how Dave Matthews Band excels in the concert versions of their songs?  While ditto The Pink Floyd!<br /><br />Nuff Said!  Buy!ll you whether or not you would be wasting your money here.

0743298039|4.0|I wanted to love this book, and I did!  How splendid to find a story of this kind, which I haven't read for years, and wrap myself in it like a warm blanket on a chilly night.  Comforting and exciting all at once; one wants to keep turning the pages and living among the characters, somehow, even though part of the story is quite sad.  This is beautifully written and will be especially appreciated by those who love their books as I do...in the hand, right there....an escape, a friend, a bolster, somehow....something solid one can see and hold.  I love my Kindle, but I love my books more!  Anyway, this is a fantastic story with a main character we come to root for quietly and respect, and other most interesting and well-drawn characters, including Miss Winter, whose life story our main character is commissioned to write.  Unlike others, perhaps, I didn't see the surprise coming near the end and was delighted to find the story still twisting and turning a bit.  The reader is satisfied at the end, but not all strings are neatly tied....we still must think a little and wonder, too.  Terrific!  I hope Ms. Setterfield has been busy writing another wonderful novel....I'm going to check right now.  In case not, can anyone tell me of other authors or books of this genre that I might try?
1592536913|4.0|This book is well done and gives a fair shot at showing what the gene is and what can be created by some of the folk around the globe so I rate it fairly high, it is 99% colour photos but my only small problem was that the producers of this book never gave a title to any photo they give the creator and where they are but not what it is that you are looking at.  This is only a very small problem you just need 2 bookmarks (well I needed 16) 1 to show which page you are currently Gobsmacked at and the other for the index so you know what it is.  And the 16 I have that's so I can just jump back and forth to what is at present my best bits.  BIG problem with this book is that if you know anyone into Steampunk is finding a place to hide it cause they will borrow it and may just not bring it back in the near future.  Could be a good thing~ work out how many fiends you have into steampunk get that many =save on postage and make a $ selling them a copy ,never know you may get yours for free.  Review 999 out 1000

B003UESJ9M|4.0|How many more stories are there out there about famous music or movie stars who fall victim to substance abuse and destroy careers/  Well, here's another.  But this time the story remains low key, in part because of the quality of the actors involved, and the theme of 'what is more important, fame or love'? manages to hold on throughout this overly long film.  Shana Feste both wrote and directed this story of a life gone sour and the effects that has on those who care about her.<br /><br />Kelly Canter (Gweneth Paltrow) is a country singer superstar who has a problem with alcohol and drugs and carries with her the devastating loss of her unborn child due to a fall during a concert in Dallas some years back.  She is married to her manager James (Tim McGraw) who struggles with Kelly's addiction, consents to rehab where she meets young Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), an aspiring country singer and talented songwriter,  but James pulls her out early to that she can make a comeback after a series of embarrassing flubbed shows.  James seems more obsessed with Kelly's career than with her emotional stability.  Once out  Kelly and Beau continue seeing each other and because of his talent Beau is added to the Kelly's tour as an opening act.  Along for the ride is a naive ex-beauty queen Chiles Syanyon (Leighton Meester) who idolizes Kelly and strives to get an audition with the famous diva. James hears her, invites her along as an audience pleaser, but on the tour, Beau and Chiles become involved: Beau just want to sing his songs to little bar crowds who love music and plans to move  to California, asking Chiles to join him.  But Chiles is star struck and opts for following in Kelly's advice and tracks until a tragedy occurs and alter the lives of Beau, Chiles, James, and the country music fans.<br /><br />The moral seems to be that love and work can't make good bedfellows and the story seems out to prove that.  The plot gets a bit sappy towards the end but the film itself is salvaged by the singing of Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester.  Paltrow offers some of her own songs, but oddly enough the true country star - Tim McGraw - never  sings!  There are some strong performances in this tearjerker - from each of the four leads.

B002ZG974M|5.0|Babies follows the development of four infants for about a year, from birth until their first words and steps.<br /><br />The babies inhabit four very different societies: Ponijao is from a village in Namibia; Bayar lives in a yurt (nomadic tent) in Mongolia; Mari resides in a modern high rise in Tokyo; and Hattie lives in San Francisco.<br /><br />I loved the movie. It also made me sad.<br /><br />My own three babies had childhoods not unlike Mari and Hattie. They have all grown into happy and well adjusted people. Maybe it is my own sentimentality that gets in the way, when I wish their early years back so that I could do it all over again.<br /><br />I found aspects of Ponijao's childhood most comforting. She lives in a communal society with few material belongings. Mostly what we see is women and children of different ages spending time together. The women sit and talk to each other, tell stories, make jewelry out of rope. They grind flower for food with stones. They hold their babies, or hand them over to older children. Babies crawl around on  the dirt floor. They put things in their mouth. They taste, smell, hear, see. They are fed when hungry and reassured when frustrated. Expectations are clear. There is time for everything.<br /><br />Punjao meets all the milestones that babies in other societies do at a similar rate of development. She (together with Bayar from Mongolia) seems to have gotten there at a more relaxed pace, though.<br /><br />Mari and Hattie have wonderful childhoods, also. Their fathers are present and involved in their upbringing. But these two girls and their parents are living hectic, distracted lives. With their busy schedules they seem to be trying to recreate in baby classes what Ponijao and Bayar have as a starting point. And even though they live in large, populated cities, their existence seems more isolated and restrained than Bayar's and Pujao's. Punjao has her community; Bayar has his animals as companions and the expansive landscape around him is wide open for him to explore.<br /><br />What do infants need to grow and flourish?

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Very Real Book ,I like it so far I had no finished yet<br />was a gift from a friend .. thanks to share this book with us.<br />Some parts made me cry.
0375842209|5.0|\\"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\\"  - p. 528    There are some books that you read and enjoy and perhaps recommend to a friend. There are some that quickly pass a few hours and leave your head nearly as fast. Then there are those that haunt you, nestling themselves deep within you, allowing you to reflect on their brilliance and potency.    Needless to say, Markus Zusak's \\"The Book Thief\\" falls into that third category.    This is a story told by Death (quite literally - it is the narrator) about a girl named Liesel Memminger. In 1939, she is dropped off in the town of Molching, near Munich, to live with foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Her brother had died on the train journey to the town, and she's not entirely sure why she has to be separated from her mother. But it is this event that truly starts Liesel's story. For when her brother died, she stole her first book - \\"The Grave Digger's Handbook\\". Her new papa finds it an odd choice for reading material until he realizes that, though she wants to more than anything, Liesel cannot read. When she wakes up in the night from nightmares of her brother dying, Hans takes his foster daughter to the basement to paint words on the walls. This, plus a lot of hard work, changes Liesel's world.    Rudy Steiner is the boy next door. One of many siblings, he has a reputation in the neighborhood for his stint a few years earlier when he painted himself black and ran around the track in town pretending to be Jesse Owens. From the beginning, Rudy and Liesel become close friends, playing soccer together in the street, attending classes together at school, and finding trouble to get into. However, their world is changing fast. Germany has invaded Poland, and the war quickly finds its way to Molching.    \\"The Book Thief\\" is the story of one girl's life from 1939 to 1943. To the outside world, she is quite unremarkable - just a pre-teen who lives an ordinary life in Germany. Her concerns aren't for the state of the world, but like many children, she is far wiser than many adults. Liesel is confronted by poverty, racism, the Holocaust, crime, unemployment, rationing, social standing, Nazism, and many other events that shape her into the person she has become. And, unlike other YA books that touch on World War II, this book is told with both an innocence and a sagacity that is completely unique. It is descriptive, full of color and life and makes you fall in love with its characters before you've even realized it. It is completely unlike anything I have ever come across before, and while it is a quick read, it is meant to be savored, like any masterpiece.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|What a movie! I stumbled on this recently, and I am glad I did.  It does not fit into any \\"genre\\" that I can think of except \\"All-Time Great.\\"    Marianne Sagebrecht wonderfully portrays Jasmin, a German tourist who gets into an argument with her husband near a stretch of desert highway in the Mojave desert. She ends up walking away from him; he drives away in a bitter huff. So, poor Jasmin is left to her own devices. She makes her way to a seriously decrepit café/gas station/motel called the Bagdad Café. There she encounters Brenda, who runs the decaying operation. CCH Pounder is Brenda and she matches Sagebrecht in terms of performance--fantastic.    Something magic happens at that cafe. This magic includes a touching depiction of people learning to tolerate each other.    Of course, it gets a five!
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti was like no other rock chick that had come before and it's what I love most about her. She was a gender-switching (in terms of her work here) rock poet/sage. Perhaps the Jefferson Airplane's Grace Slick was the closest thing we had of being a powerful female presence (Janis was a powerful singer but obviously had issues that weakened her).<br /><br />\\"Horses\\" is a seminal document of the `70's. Opening with the infamous line \\"Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine\\" from \\"Gloria: In Excelsis Deo\\" which in its punk sacrilege excited me to no end as a lapsed-Catholic, it starts off languidly and builds from there courtesy of Patti's excellent band with a core of guitarist and original coconspirator Lenny Kaye, keyboard player Richard Sohl, guitarist Ivan Kral and drummer Jay Dee Daugherty with help from guests Tom Verlaine (one of Television's guitarists), Alan Lanier (from Blue Oyster Cult and Patti's paramour at the time) and producer John Cale from the Velvet Undergound which was a huge influence on Patti but was reportedly difficult to work with.<br /><br />Thieves, lost boys, extraterrestrial activity, altered consciousness and death are the main themes that permeate \\"Horses\\". Patti switches genders back and forth throughout \\"Gloria\\" and the rest of the album with dramatic effect. Her cabaret background allows her to do this fluently and naturally. After \\"Gloria: In Excelsis Deo\\", the gears switch to the pseudo-reggae of \\"Redondo Beach\\" in which Patti sings of \\"sweet suicide\\", which could be interpreted as one of many references to her heroes Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and especially Jim Morrison. In the jazz-inflected, transcendent \\"Birdland\\" Patti speaks/sings about a boy's fourth encounter with an alien (among other things). This is also one of the many songs that concerns itself with alternate forms of consciousness. The lyrics alone are enough to transport one into another state of mind with the music perfectly capturing a feeling of disorientation, especially the spacey, effects-laden guitars. \\"Free Money\\" rocks wildly, a poor person's dream possibly inspired by Patti's background and the financial problems she and friend/lover Robert Mapplethorpe experienced before they became famous. \\"Kimberly\\", named after her sister, is  a funky little song featuring the great lines \\"I feel like some misplaced Joan of Arc\\" and \\"bats with their baby vein faces\\". With its splitting skies and colliding planets, it seems to be a meditation on the creative and destructive forces inherent in this life. For additional sonic drama, Patti actually pounds rhythmically on her chest while singing passages of the triumphant \\"Break It Up\\" with the guitar echoing the vocals on the chorus beautifully. Horses, horses, horses- you can almost hear them galloping on \\"Land\\", a suite that leads off with \\"horses\\", with alter ego Johnny dipping into the sea of possibilities and death; segues into \\"land of a thousand dances\\" with multiple Pattis speak/singing over one another hypnotically, creating another disorienting effect on the listener. The suite ends with \\"la mer (de)\\", a delightfully playful pun of `murder'. The album ends with the funereal \\"Elegie\\", a lovely, melancholy farewell to Patti's (and my) tragic rock heroes.<br /><br />I bought Ms. Smith's next couple of albums and though there were moments of inspiration on these, none would ever come close to this piece of unique magic- \\"three chords merged with the power of the word\\" is how she put it in her recent, exquisitely written memoir \\"Just Kids\\".

B000LTAY1U|4.0|Days after buying this watch, one of the pins holding the hasp of the band popped off --- not necessarily a problem, unless you're in the process of opening a car door to re-shut it tight while driving. Needless to say, I watched helplessly as the watch bounced down the median of the road for several yards while I muscled the car to a stop on the shoulder. After scooping up the watch while dodging traffic, I see that the watch itself didn't miss a beat, a few shallow scratches on the bezel edges, but otherwise in fine shape. However, the hasp of the band went missing, and I immediately replaced the band with something more sturdy and appealing. So thumbs up on this great value watch, and hisses for the cheap pins used on the otherwise basic but serviceable band. All in all, still a worthy purchase for the watch alone, but a couple of better quality pins could have earned another star for outstanding value.
1416550550|5.0|I bought this last summer intending to read it on my vacation. Well, it got pushed back on the never ending TBR list until one day I said \\"What the heck, I'll just read it.\\" Well I started in the morning and didn't finish until well over 4am the next morning. I couldn't put the book done and was left feeling like I lost my best friend when it was over.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|I find the item packing was poor.  At least the item should be total wrap / covered with good bubble pack material.  The cover was dented due to heavy object sitting on it.  Lucky that the disk inside did not crack.  Other then that i have no comments.
B002ZG976U|2.0|Like a trashier version of `Chicago' (with Cher stepping in for Queen Latifah) or a tamer version of `Showgirls', `Burlesque' is a hot mess that doesn't do anything special and yet proves to be wholly entertaining.  I can't hate on this too much because I soaked up every scantily clad moment (what hot blooded male wouldn't?) but I can't in my right mind actually recommend a movie this brainless in construction.  The scene staging is god awful and the acting is atrocious (except from Stanley Tucci, who proves once again to be the ideal supporting man) and that script is a clich&eacute;d mess, but when you throw it all in a pot with some stunning vocals echoing themselves over a trashy cabaret nightclub you kind of (and I mean KIND OF) get cinematic magic.  The plot is predictable (young country girl with big dreams gets sucked into a crazy new life only to have to use her `gifts' to save her dreams from being crushed) and Christina Aguilera is a very bad actress (all sorts of OMG terrible actually), but the music is a total hit and even though Cher looks like a giantess amongst all these stick thin beauties and her solo `You Haven't Seen the Last of Me' is set up in such an awkward and out of place fashion, the song is amazing and she nails the emotional intentions perfectly (I just love Cher, despite her tranny-like voice).  It's a cheap rendition of a thousand films before it (`Chicago', `Showgirls', `Cabaret', `Coyote Ugly', etc.), but sometimes you want a little cheap.  The costumes are sexy and drool-worthy and the actual nightclub itself is the stuff of every man's fantasies, but Alan Cumming's weak attempt to emulate Joel Gray is an embarrassment and should have been cut from the film entirely.  The preposterous conclusion is also eye-rolling and a hasty attempt to `make everything right', which I never like much.  But, like many have noted, `Burlesque' never once claims to be anything more than campy entertainment, and to a certain degree it succeeds in being just that.that.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|If you want to see a good Aronofsky film, try \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" or \\"pi.\\"<br /><br />Black Swan was total crap. All those tight claustrophobic shots, and the underlying message that anyone who competes to do something well is of course an obsessive compulsive nut case. And of course \\"sex\\" is the only hermeneutic of \\"liberty\\" or freedom. Utter garbage.<br /><br />And as Aronofsky has said \\"The Wrestler\\" and \\"Black Swan\\" are companion pieces, let me make an observation and follow up with a suggestion.<br /><br />Mr. Aronofsky In all your films, death is the ultimate definitive answer for perseverance and excellence of extraordinary competitive people (Pi, The Wrestler, Black Swan....dead dead dead....).<br /><br />Okay....so if you are making *excellent* films, why aren't you dead already?<br /><br />After making your next film, please arrange to be dead. Otherwise, you are a hypocrite.
1416550534|5.0|I love all three of Kate Morton's books, but this one started it all. Beautifully written with character descriptions that leave you breathless.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|After having watched Secretariat on a copy someone had made, this was quite a contrast.  Very well done.  The colors are brilliant.
B000NIVJEU|3.0|I liked this movie but I loved the book so I was really disappointed with this movie. There was so much left out, mainly the ending, in the book Arya was forced to shatter the Star Sapphire. That helped Eragon defeat Durza (can you tell I love the books?) but it was left out of the movie. It's no wonder there won't be a sequel. I'll just have to read the books again.
B0053F042G|5.0|It has been more than a month since I saw Source Code. I have not seen any better film this year. Also, Jake Gylenhaal is perfect for this role and the acting and script are tight.  This is the thriller of thrillers. The suspense, tension, acting, drama and action will leave you gasping for more, yes it's one of those films. Highly recommended. Vera Farmiga, like always, had her good moments in the film too. At 94 minutes this film is really riveting.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco Pastorius' first solo LP is literally mindblowing. He starts by tugging on Charlie Parker's cape by covering Donna Lee, a Miles tune recorded by Bird when Miles was in his band. Then he brings in Sam and Dave to sing on an r&b number, Come On Come Over, in which the speed and precision of his 16th notes is remarkable. He starts \\"Continuum\\" with a triple-stop harmonic, just because he can, and Jaco wannabes (me included) have been playing this song continuously for the last 35 years. \\"A Portrait of Tracy\\" is a similar setpiece for bassists, a drop dead gorgeous piece (written for his first wife) which includes more harmonics than you thought were humanly possible. This CD and his other studio solo effort (Word of Mouth) are jaw droppers. Jaco died young so he didn't get to make much music, but his genius burned brightly (perhaps a little too brightly) for about 10 years. He gigged with Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, and Weather Report, which cut into the time he had to make his own records. Shamefully, Jaco's third solo album, Holiday for Pans, has never been released (though it has been bootlegged). Jaco's genius encompassed composition and arranging, and he produced a record which featured these two facets of his musicality-- but not a note of his bass playing. The suits thought he was nuts, but it wasn't madness. It was genius. \\"Jaco Pastorius\\" remains in Amazon's top 20 bestsellers for fusion jazz-- 35 years after it was released. Unfortunately Jaco did not get much of the financial reward. When he died his estate came to $600. In an ironic touch for a man who spent his last year homeless, living in a park in Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale now has a park named after him, with two outsize wall murals of the great maestro. Jaco lives!
B004AKCME8|1.0|Dark movie, hated it. Watched 15 minutes of it then noticed the kids looked horrified so took it out broke it and threw it in the garbage.
B0057A6GA6|3.0|Great game until ether level with the kamikaze mutants. Like a lot of other reviewers, I stopped playing after I got to that level. PLEASE listen to us and get rid of those guys!  5 stars once that is fixed. Thank you.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I love this movie, The one that started the Halloween series franchise! All Horror Movie fans should have this in their collection!
0142410705|4.0|So far in my John Green reading extravaganza, I have read all three of his self penned novels and the novel he wrote with a friend called Will Grayson, WIll Grayson, this book is my 2nd least favorite of John's novels. I'm not saying that this book was not marvelous and complex, because it definitely was. I just enjoyed a few more...more.<br /><br />In An Abundance of Katherines, a child prodigy named Colin has dated no girls other than ones named Katherine. Through out the book you learn of all his Katherines. Some are out of order some go in the order in which he dated them. Honestly, Colin was my least favorite character of the book. My favorite is Hassan. He is a Muslim who would rather stay at home and watch Judge Judy than apply himself and go to college.<br /><br />Eventually these two take a road trip that ends in Gunshot, Tennessee. This is where the book started to lose me a little. There is a lot of math in this novel. Colin is trying to figure out a mathematical equation that will show the end of the relationship between two people.<br /><br />Love and math is what the rest of the novel is about. And well I guess I can add infidelity, jealous, and the maturing of more than one of the characters.<br /><br />I definitely would say pick this book up and unless you're a math lover, don't worry about skipping over the math bits - I'm not dumb when it comes to math, but I definitely looked less at the math and more of the story itself.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|It is a nice watch and a good deal for this price($79), anyway, I reduce one point because I didn't get the expected design but a lesser one:  The indexes are omitted from the positions of the hours three, six and nine o'clock, and it looks like if something is broken or missed. The reason is, that Invicta decreased the manufacturing costs by cutting some elements of the design. The photo in the product's page still reflects the older, nicer, version.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush and their music will be around forever. They're that good. So much talent, such great performers and you can tell they love what they do. This CD is a must have in your collection. It's progressive rock at its finest. If you're just getting into Rush or if you've been a lifelong fan, then this CD is for you.
0470449748|2.0|This book gives you plenty of practice. That's it, though. There aren't any explanations. This inability to actually understand what you've missed makes it only supplemental. The verbal part seemed spot on, but the math was unlike what the real test was. Some people claimed that this is because it was only the easy to medium difficult questions, but nothing in the book is labeled. Find something else.
B004P9FAK2|3.0|I bought this just to complete the set that I started buying when the first two \\"Ultimates\\" were released. \\"Ultimates\\" 3-6 not ultimates as far as additional deleted scenes. Still waiting.
B001FOR5XU|2.0|The first half of this book was very engrossing. I don't even know what to say about the second half...I would love it if someone could explain to me what the heck it was about!! I hated the last half of this book...it made no sense. I just kept thinking that it would all come together and make sense at some point, and it never did. Thankfully, the movie was very different from the book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm not sure what I can add to the overwhelming response to this film that hasn't already been said other than I wish I could give it more stars. I felt compelled (because I've never written a review on Amazon before) to add my voice to the chorus of overwhelming praise for this production.    Like many, I have never read Elizabeth Gaskell's book (but plan to do so in the future) and like many I was up one night searching for a movie to watch since movies are my passion. I had just finished watching Wives and Daughters on Netflix and felt it was a decent production. I kept seeing the cover for North and South on Netflix as well and for some reason wasn't interested in viewing it even after reading the summary. I finally broke down a few nights ago and all I can say is Wow!! I love great storytelling above all else but especially coupled with a love story. This movie is the blueprint of what a great production should be on every single level. Every actor was perfectly cast, the music was so romantically beautiful, the costumes were superb and the cinematography and production design were outstanding. This is definitely the benchmark for every production to work towards.    But if you need more convincing, then by far the one single reason to view this movie is to watch Richard Armitage bring the character of John Thornton to life. The moment you see him on screen he commands your attention. He was so very powerful in his performance that I believed he really was John Thornton living and breathing, just like Clark Gable was the embodiment of Rhett Butler. RA is what truly puts this movie in the stratosphere of greatness. Needless to say like everyone else I am a huge Pride and Prejudice fan (especially Colin Firth and Matthew MacFadyen versions). But, RA's portrayal of John Thornton puts him almost in a class by himself, which is saying something. I'm now trying to consume everything Richard Armitage appears in, because I know without a doubt he will be faultless in his performance.    So, to sum up, if you love period pieces and love stories, this movie is truly a no brainer on all levels. If you are someone who takes great pains to avoid watching costume dramas or love stories all I can say is, I strongly suggest that you take a look at this production you will not be sorry. It's storytelling at its best!    On a final note, I wish there were more avenues to see all the wonderful British productions that I always seem to stumble upon one way or another. Every time I do, they are usually superb and different from what we experience here in the U.S. If it wasn't for Netflix I would probably never have seen this marvelous production.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard app! the predicted text works very well, and i really like that if you allow it, it will learn from your FB, gmail, etc. i&apos;d be surprised to see anything better come along anytime soon.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|No problems with this app. I like the widget to see at a glance what the moon would look like currently. Easy to understand the information provided, and very cool to see the percent full!
159308336X|4.0|Ultimately, I enjoyed this book, but it took quite a long time to get into it. I found myself rereading many paragraphs, as I really needed full concentration for this one. I will say that the book did keep me guessing throughout. Though I knew that things would turn out well for the heroines, I truly did not know what was going to happen until the very end.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Wow!  This movie takes unexpected twists and turns just about the whole way through.  Initially I thought it was a little strange, but the more I watched the more I realized it was a movie that you have to pay attention to the little details in order to understand.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I with I could really say how worth it it is to get this game. its one of the best games I&apos;ve ever played on a phone or console.

1579126235|4.0|Definitely enjoyed this one. No way to figure out in advance how it's going to end. As the book went on, I started thinking that the plot was extremely implausible, but all was explained at the end and it wrapped up quite nicely.

1442419814|5.0|I only read this book by chance and loved it. Once I started I couldn't stop. This series is a great read among young readers and adult readers. I definitely recommend reading the series, because once you start you can't stop.
0553801473|1.0|Five books later at an expensive investment, I will not read Book 6, 7, 8, 9.....???<br /><br />I loved the first three, even four books.  Then this book five comes out...and what a crock!<br /><br />A l,000 pages that could have been edited easily to 500 pages without sacrificing plot.<br /><br />What plot....this book five just drags on and on....going nowhere.<br /><br />Only in the last 200 pages did any of the story line progress at all.<br /><br />Why does George R.R. Martin have to be so verboise?<br /><br />His fifth book of meanderings is useless.  He is like a mad man on speed, going off on more<br />tangents than need be.<br /><br />I am angry that I spent the time and money on this one.<br /><br />But I will learn my lesson.  Skip this book five.  It in no way adds to the the earlier<br />four (that was suppose to be only a triology).<br /><br />It could have been a triology, but the editors' were  evidently  afraid of facing<br />the dragon RR Martin when he is  such a 'stark struck literary darling' as a never- ending<br />golden  purse for the publishers.....to rein him in on verbriage that never should have been allowed.<br /><br />But a golden calf is a golden calf....thinking of more gold by stretching these books out into infinity.<br /><br />No, I quit the series, now, once and for good.
030745455X|5.0|Wow, this book was awesome! I literally can't wait to read the next one. It ended with such a cliffhanger, that I had to buy the next eBook immediately! Lisbeth is the most unique and interesting heroine that I have come across in all my years of reading.She kicks some serious ass! I really liked 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', loved 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' and now hope that 'The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest' lives up to the other two!
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I am going to stand up and admit my first take review on Foster The People was way far wrong. After giving them a listen on KINK radio out of Portland OR, and hearing them cut loose acoustically with great songs like \\"Pumped Up Kicks,\\" \\"Houdini,\\" and \\"Waste\\" I got a better insight into their lyrically superior humor and alt-rock bluegrass fusion. Foster The People are one of the better young bands out there, and they are sure trending well now. I pulled down \\"Torches\\" and gave it a good four round listen throughout, and I'm a convert, they got me with their playful sound and wizardly hooks. What else can I say, They're super. I'm glad I gave them a second look.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I loved the song \\"Running in the Deep\\" when it played on the radio.  The beat just grabbed me.  I had no idea who the singer was.  Then I saw Adele sing the song on TV.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the big girl with the big voice. not a size 2 fashion model.  I decided I wanted to hear more so I checked out the samples of \\"21\\" on Amazon.  I thought they sounded good enough to buy the CD.  I really like this album.  Adele has the soulful voice of Janis Joplin without the screaming.  I am very happy I purchased this item.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I've never bought a Yes studio album when it came out.  I only own old vinyl and cassette tapes that my older brother turned me on to.  I'm not even a huge fan of Yes, but I bought \\"Fly From Here\\" because I've been really into older artists and their new works these days.  Plus, the album cover is awesome. Thanks, Roger Dean.<br /><br />All I can say is that, after a brief skepticism of the current lead singer and the lead, 6-track song(Fly From Here pts. 1-6?), I am thoroughly impressed.  My favorite tracks come after the Fly From...opus.  The latter half of the album is full of original members Squire and Howe's doings.  The song \\"Hour of Need\\" is one of the prettiest songs i've ever heard, and the final cut, \\"Into the Storm\\" prog-rocks like none other.  In between the above mentioned beauties is the guitar instrumental, \\"Solitaire\\", which comes right out of the \\"Mood For A Day\\" genre that guitarist Howe is so talented at.<br /><br />  I'm extremely disturbed at Rob Sheffield(of Rolling Stone) for his short-sighted and clueless review of this album.  He just couldn't get over the absence of Jon Anderson on this album.  While I can understand missing the wondrous tones of his voice, to crap on the utter dankness of the music here is a sin.  David Benoit does a decent job of singing the Yes thang, and Squire and Howe add superb vocals themselves.  Give this puppy a real try and you will be rewarded.
193659451X|4.0|This was my first foray into Jane Austen. I must admit it took a while for me get accustomed to the literary style, but once I got into the flow of it, I quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to reading more of her classic works!
B000F3A7LE|5.0|Robert Fripp's first solo album after King Crimson split up is nothing short of surprisingly marvelous.  I wasn't expecting this at all, but the numerous amount of positive reviews here on amazon encouraged me to check it out.    \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\" is a fast-paced 50's style rocker radically updated with late 70's technology and given a Talking Heads-like feel.  It's extremely heavy during certain parts, and just awesome.  \\"Breathless\\" is a continuation of the \\"Red\\" theme from King Crimson's Red album, but of course -just like the previous track- updated to fit the (then) modern times.  It's not nearly as raw or aggressive as the King Crimson song but it's definitely good nonetheless.    \\"Disengage\\" proves that Peter Hammill can be absolutely *insane* with his vocal range.  He positively screams and screeches and sends chills through my body with this performance, and I actually detect small signs of Rob Halford mannerisms from time to time.  You know, the lead singer of Judas Priest.  Perhaps a total coincidence.  I was never a huge fan of Daryl Hall even though my parents loved Hall & Oates to pieces, but his singing style on \\"North Star\\" is drastically different from any Hall & Oates stuff I'm familiar with.  He really expands his range while some beautifully performed guitar trickery is taking place in the background.  Subtle, but it's there.      \\"Chicago\\" contains a beautifully sung vocal melody courtesy of Peter Hammill though I wish it were longer because 2 minutes isn't enough to accomplish what could have been a REALLY splendid and meaningful song.  \\"NY3\\" is some chaotic mess that never does anything in particular, and \\"Mary\\" features sentimental female vocals from Terre Roche.  This song in particular is a drastic departure from the rest of the album because it's so soft and quiet.  You'll notice this right away.  It's still really good though, make no mistake about it!      The title song is quite the strange one.  Listen carefully to the trickery in the background.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, it's the final section of \\"Formentera Lady\\" (the King Crimson song) repeating that same section but in a modern kind of way.  What's especially appealing about this song is the female singers style and the way she screams \\"EXPOOOOOSUUUUUURE\\" all the way through.  In fact at the end she just lets loose completely and does nothing BUT scream.  The beat is groovy, so it's definitely unique.  \\"Haaden Two\\" sounds like more King Crimson-like material.    \\"Urban Landscape\\" sounds stolen from the Eno/Fripp album Evening Star (particularly side two) and \\"I May Not Have Had Enough of Me but I've Had Enough of Typing Out This Long Song Title\\" includes another performance by Peter Hammill based on top of a fast-paced almost punk-like guitar riff, and he's constantly trading vocals with Terre Roche.  For some reason it doesn't sound natural at all and it's overlong by about a minute, but I like it nonetheless.      \\"Water Music I\\" is really nothing but a repetitive guitar solo and it's a lot like something from the Eno/Fripp album Evening Star.  The lyrics are funny because they're about the world freezing in 40 years time.  Yeah right!  More like just the opposite.  \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" has some amazingly compassionate vocals courtesy of Peter Gabriel.  It reminds me of a Genesis song, for sure.  \\"Water Music 2\\" is more repetition that neither excites or irritates me.    Interesting enough, this albums main strength is NOT that it's a Robert Fripp solo album, but rather the diversity that's featured -perhaps unintentionally- because of all the popular guest musicians.  These guests are the reason Exposure is so unusually fascinating and diverse.  I highly recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the single most important application on my phone.  I received it for free but it is worth every single penny of the asking price.  Heck it would be a deal at 5x the asking price.  I went from making continual typos and fighting over-aggressive spell checking to being able to type at double to triple the speed with no mistakes.    Being able to select precise or rapid typing styles is great and really makes a difference.  I prefer precise and use a bunch of the recommended words because it has gotten so accurate at predicting my next word after the first few letters.  The learning curve for the predictive text is very fast, especially if you let the program analyze your online accounts (gmail/facebook/twitter).  The key and symbol layout helps even more, with an extra two layers which gives you access to a number pad, foreign symbols, and even emoticons in messages.  There's just tons of little nice features I keep finding that let me type even more efficiently.    I've had to reset my phone twice recently (due to a botched Verizon OTA update) and this was the first app I reinstalled both times.  Even just having to deal with the default keyboard for the setup steps was enough to send me running back.

030726999X|4.0|Is it wrong that I'm upset with the author for passing away before he could complete this series?! Knowing that this was the 3rd volume in what was supposed to be a 10-volume series, I was pretty happy with how it wrapped up. Luckily, this one did not end with a cliffhanger. I would love to see someone at least complete the 4th volume that Larsson had begun before his death, if not the entire series. Much of the story is yet to be told. And, I will really miss Lisbeth Salander... one of the most original and interesting heroines in literature.

B005D643PO|5.0|I am used to TV shows going down in quality, so I was happy to watch Season 5 (via Amazon streaming after buying it online from Amazon) and find out it is actually a compact, reasonably plausible, thrill-ride of a season. One caveat: the treatment of the bad guys' victims is pretty disturbingly described and depicted, almost to the point of being too much - but not for the sake of exploitation, that side of the story is essential to understanding Lumen's character development, her boundaries and motivation, and her relationship with Dexter.<br /><br />One big positive was that the writers/producers/directors kept the usual soap opera antics in the side-stories under control. I enjoyed the side-stories for a change, and Peter Weller has a great turn as a bad cop who eventually gets his just deserts after putting Dexter in one of the worst jams of his life.<br /><br />I don't know what to make of the \\"stand off\\" between Quinn and Dexter at the end. Dexter doesn't monologue his \\"take\\" on it; they just each seem to know more about the other than either would like or is healthy for either, and both have to live with their consciences (yes, Dexter seems to have a conscience).<br /><br />The high point of the series for me was Dexter being righteously angry at a father who has been abusing his daughter. Usually regular Dexter is meek and mild, a real Clark Kent type who stays out of trouble, but in this instance regular Dexter shows a bit of the hero, while I am sure his \\"dark passenger\\" is quite proud of him as well. No one dies, but justice is meted out.<br /><br />Streaming video quality was MOSTLY excellent although I wish Amazon would \\"flag\\" a quality meter if they are going to \\"downgrade on the fly\\" to keep the video streaming. I would rather defer watching to a lower network traffic time than suffer the beautiful HD degrading to SD as Amazon tries to keep it streaming.<br /><br />One tip if you purchase the digital version: I am not sure if actually downloading the episodes locally is worth it. I purchased them only so I would watch more than one time and so I am not hamstrung by \\"windows\\" of time for viewing that expire. Once I purchase them on my computer, I just went to my Roku and went to my \\"library\\" and there the series was, ready to stream and restream as I desire.d them only so I would watch more than one time and so I am not hamstrung by \\"windows\\" of time for viewing that expire.

B0000C9ZSV|5.0|SO, I was visiting my brother in Berkeley in May of 1970  My friend Kelsey and I decided see Jimi at the Berkeley Community Theater.  The first show was sold out so we got tickets for the second show. We ran into a little problem on the day of the show:the People's Park riot!  Tear gas...cops in riot gear with clubs...Yow!  We got away unscathed.  During the first show, I hung out at the back of the WALLY HEIDER Sound truck because we could sort of hear (and see) some the first show. Little did we know that they were recording THIS album.  The show was incredible.

B0055IU4GM|4.0|Dear Consumer,<br /><br />Here are three reasons to buy this music:<br /><br />1.  The words, music, and production are clear, straight-shootin', and catchy.  These are the kinds of songs that are easy to learn the words to and sing along to within just the first couple of spins.<br /><br />2.  Hiatt's voice and singing style is warm, seasoned, and comfortable - like slipping back into your old jean jacket on the first crisp day of fall.<br /><br />3.  The overall feel of the album is atmospheric and romantic against a traditional, good ol' rock n' roll background - these feel like songs one might hear in one of those movie scenes with the crack local band at the small town outdoor dance - lights strung around the dance floor,  a few characters in cowboy hats, the obligatory alternating between dance songs and ballads, the couple that sneaks away from the floor to slow dance alone under the stars together...<br /><br />FOR FANS OF:  Springsteen, Steve Earle, Warren Zevon, Nick Lowe<br /><br />TOP TRACKS:  \\"Damn This Town,\\" \\"All the Way Under,\\" \\"Don't Wanna Leave You Now\\"<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: B+<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
0061148512|5.0|\\"The Bell Jar\\" isn't a book that I would have selected for myself under normal circumstances.  Thus I feel it's appropriate to give the reason for my reading the book as a bit of a premise for my review.  My favorite musician, Ryan Adams has a hauntingly beautiful song titled \\"Sylvia Plath.\\"  The song itself tells of a fascinating woman, and clearly her writing and her life touched Adams in such a profound way that he wrote a tune for her.  It was because of that, that I decided to see what the fuss was about, which brings us to my review.    I did no research on \\"The Bell Jar\\" prior to buying the book, so I had zero idea what I was in store for.  What I found over the past week of reading the book was a thoroughly readable and realistic, feasible story of a tortured, pain filled soul.  The writing style of Plath is beautiful throughout, and what strikes me is how current Esther and her situations seem today.  I felt at the end of the novel as if the book could have been released this past week, it's that true to life.  Now, being a man roughly the same age as Esther it was interesting to read a story which seemed autobiographical throughout from the perspective of a woman.  Esther is so much like many people I've met, and she faces the same turmoil that many young people today still face.     While the content was indeed heavy and deep and often times a struggle to read as a result--suicide is never a fun topic, and I unfortunately witnessed a dear friend's suicide while living in Spain many years ago--it's a very real problem for young people who don't feel there are alternatives to the bad hands they were dealt.    I could not sleep at night if I were to offer any fewer than 5 stars to this book.  So easy to read from the perspective of style, and so hauntingly real, I understand fully well why now after having read the book myself I see so many others ranting and raving, singing its praises.    \\"I wish I had a Sylvia Plath  Busted tooth and a smile  And cigarette ashes in her drink  The kind that goes out and then sleeps for a week  The kind that goes out on her  To give me a reason, for well, I dunno\\"  ~Ryan Adams
1932100660|5.0|For a long time already I have been living on lots of greens and fruit. People around me were irritated and told me I had to eat whole meals to stay healthy. I always felt kind of guilty - as if I was doing something wrong. Now I finally have proof that I'm not wrong and that it is perfectly okay to feel great on only greens and fruit - that it is even normal. And that it is unhealthy to eat a 'standard American diet' (or even European for that matter). I'm happy to inform people around me and I hope that the message will come through finally - for people and for animals.  I would buy this book again if my copy would be gone. It is enormously informative, interesting and eye opening!  I also thought about giving it as a present to people who are interested in nutrition and health.

0670022411|2.0|I wanted to like this book. I enjoy the occasional Vampire and Witch books. I like a good juicy brain candy read (Like Twilight, or the Sookie Stackhouse series). But this book, oh it just kept spiraling down as I continued to slog on....    The first sample chapter on Kindle was great. Good atmosphere, I liked the idea of a serious academic researcher as the main character, the idea of Witches and Vampires and Demons working in plain site seemed good. The idea of a mysterious book seemed great. The first introduction to the characters was good....The first person narrative had tone to it.    Well - that is about all that I can say good for the book. Once the main character meets the Vampire love interest - the whole book is developing that relationship. The whole idea of a mysterious book goes on the back burner as these two fall in love. I believe I was at 60% on my kindle before they even try to get back to the original setup (which had promise in the beginning). Instead of being called 'Discovery of Witches' it should be called 'Discovery of Matthew'    Matthew is the perfect Vampire lover. Much in the vein of Edward from Twilight. Perfect looking, perfect gentlemen, always taking care of his women in a perfectly doting overprotective way. Perfectly in love from the word go. Telling her how amazing she is all the time. Smells amazing. You get the idea....he is just like Edward but 37 and can have romantic encounters. So I guess the author was aiming for TwiMoms...Unfortunately, Edward was more interesting..    The heroine is much in the vein of Bella. She constantly needs protecting - even though she constantly says she doesn't. She is madly in love with her prince charming. She gives into all his bossing and nurturing and protectiveness while she runs around saying how independent she is. This intense love worked in Twilight because that is how teenage romance is. It is way less attractive on a highly educated, respected 35 year old Oxford professor.    Anyway- FINALLY at about the end of the novel some action started happening. But the damage was done. The mystique built in the first few chapters was totally lost and the two main characters were just simply annoying. And the supporting characters were not particularly notable either.     Trust me - stick to Twilight or Sookie. Or if you are looking for an academic mystery/adventure - stick with Dan Brown.
B004G600A4|5.0|I watched this with my grandkids (ages 5 yrs. and 21 months) and I was just amazed at how wonderful the movie was.  It was so funny; loved the horse. We have watched it over and over and it never gets old.
B0016K40KY|5.0|I'm in love with Peter O'Toole after watching this movie. Lawrence of Arabia is an epic story about a poetic British army officer who leads an Arab rebellion and achieves god-like status among his followers. The hero's self-confidence is both his greatest strength and weakness and it is fascinating to watch him struggle with this. I was disappointed that Lawrence did not have a love interest, but this was probably because all his passion was for \\"the desert.\\"

B004LWZW2E|2.0|As a lot of reviewers have mentioned. The first half was a lot better than the second half. Something that really turned me off from this movie was that they copied a lot of the plot from Paranormal Activity 2. It was almost the same thing. I think in Paranormal Activity 2 they even had something that had to do with pictures.     Also what paranormal activity does very well is that it doesn't show the \\"demon\\" and when Insidious does show it, its flat out laughable. Its like a man with a Halloween costume and some face paint. Total fail. The movie could have been better with just better directing and set design as well.

0545259088|4.0|The Characters.....<br /><br />Okay, I just have to rant here at how much I love Sam. Sam is the guy that every girl wants as a boyfriend. Sweet, sexy and protective. Of course, I also love Isabelle for being so rough, tough and crazy. She has some thick skin and Cole is having a very hard time breaking through it. I love Cole and Isabelle as a couple and just wish that they could get their act together. As for Grace...hallelujah!!! she had finally stood up to her parents!!<br /><br />The Storyline.....<br /><br />I enjoyed the direction the story had taken. I know a lot of people were upset with the ending being so open, but it kind of left something to the imagination. I have to admit, I was kind of bummed, but it did not shy me away from loving the storyline itself.<br /><br />Sam & Grace...The Relationship......<br /><br />Ugh! The beginning of this book is absolutely heart wrenching when poor Sam is trying to find Grace. It seemed to have taken forever. (LOL...) Anyway, when they finally did meet up, I really expected some kind of fireworks and them to break into song. I was slightly disappointed at how they just talked to each other at first like they hadn't just spent months apart.<br /><br />In Conclusion....<br /><br />I am sad to see this story end. This was one of the first series that I started reading after I read Twilight and got hooked. I really enjoyed this trilogy and would have read three more books. Maybe Maggie has left it open-ended so that she could write another in the future??? We can always hope right?
0671510991|5.0|Kissinger's ambitious goal is to provide a review of diplomatic thought, theory, practice and result, as conducted primarily in Europe (or by European/Western powers) from the time of Richelieu through to the time of his writing (1993).  A book of erudition, knowledge, discernment, and powerful analysis, Diplomacy fully succeeds in allowing the reader to more fully understand the underlying currents of national grand strategy over a period of nearly 400 years.    Kissinger begins with the development of the concept of the nation-state, and the strategic goals of France (especially a group of splintered and weak statelets in the German area on France's eastern border).  Other countries, especially Britain, will react to these positions; which reactions foster further reactions, and so forth, more or less to the present day.    One recurrent theme throughout the book is the issue of Germany.  The German states, prior to unification, provided endless opportunities for other countries to attempt to gain dominance in central Europe at their expense; France first, but soon to be followed by Austria, which encouraged others (Britain) to repeatedly intervene in order to assure that no one country would in fact gain mastery of Europe.  But Germany once united has, it is safe to say, not necessarily been a stabilizing influence either.      Kissinger's tracking of European thought in grand strategy is fascinating, and his respect and admiration for some key figures - Richelieu, Bismarck, Talleyrand, Theodore Roosevelt - is obvious and well explained.  But there are other ways of perceiving and setting strategy, of setting goals, and using diplomacy to reach them - with the dawn of the 20th century, we are on the cusp of the United States making itself felt on a global scale.  And the United States has acted very differently from the way Europe had conducted itself for the previous 300 years.    America's self-appointed role as global crusader has been remarked upon and analyzed before, but Kissinger's detailed examination is riveting (and sometimes shocking).  One cannot understand current events without understanding the path America's leaders, both Democrat and Republican, have taken; the sole exception since Teddy Roosevelt having been Richard Nixon.      Kissinger thus takes us from crisis point to treaty to myriad personalities on the world stage; the sweep is as grand as could be.  Where it tends to slow down is once we are in the Cold War, and we deal with Berlin, with Korea, Vietnam (three longer chapters), disarmament, detente, the opening of China and Nixon's triangular diplomacy, and the ending of the Cold War.  Having read many of Kissinger's other works previously, including his massive three volume memoirs of the Nixon/Ford years, a good bit of this was already overly familiar (if given a different angle of approach).      This reader found the first two thirds of the book to be thoroughly engrossing, deeply engaging without being terribly technical, superbly written, fair and punctilious in its characterizations of attitudes and personalities admired or not by the author, and superb in execution.  The final third, covering a much shorter period in which is could be said that Kissinger himself has something of a point to prove (and re-prove), could be seen to drag somewhat, and I would imagine that many contemporaries would be more inclined to disagree in some fundamental ways with the arguments advanced (though this reader felt all logically argued and justifiable).    Kissinger's work is an outstanding book to read covering history in a way not often addressed from the angle of national policy in theory and practice.

B004XQO90E|5.0|If it were possible to post five golden stars, such a review still would not be enough to portray the depth and beauty of Source Code.  It is a wonderful film, powerful, brutally logical, tender and caring--with consequences all around.  Yet, pessimism does not prevail.  The world has its darkness, but there are people who courageously care, who are not ruined by those who would exercise primevil dominion.  Their humanity cannot be questioned.  Source Code is more than a film.  It's a way of perceived thinking!

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I think the movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1, is really good.  You do need to read the book to catch a lot of the nuances in the film however.  My biggest complaint is the DVD package itself.  The cover looks like it is about to fall out of the DVD case.  It is in really bad shape.  The fact that the extras are only being placed on the Blu-ray versions is also a crock.  Great movie, the customer with a regular DVD player is really getting bad treatment though.
0307277453|4.0|Having read a number of books on evolution, I was not the intended audience for this book.  It was still of interest, especially the earlier chapters which focus on the transition from fish to amphibian, and on the art of fossil hunting.  I was surprised to learn that current thinking does not regard the development of multi-cell organisms from single cell organisms as a remarkable leap forward, even though it took billions of years; rather, it happened when it did because the earth had accumulated sufficient oxygen to support organisms requiring greater, and more efficient sources of energy.   One of the many interesting  facts: a sponge can actually be chemically disassembled into its individual cells,  these cells then survive on their own, and eventually reassemble.     My one problem with the book is that it manages to discuss embryology in some detail, including the early experiments, without mentioning  epigenetics.  If you are unaware of this subject you should have major questions with the discussion, because it glosses over the issues of how identical cells seem to know where they are and so develop appropriately.  They all have the same hox (control) genes, so something has to turn these control genes on selectively.

1573226521|5.0|One of the few books I own that I will read again and again.  I don't know if it is the story or just the fact that when I read it, I escape to a ocean hideaway far away from the life I have now.  The ocean and stories about the ocean has always drawn me, and this book is no exception.  It is kind of a quirky story, but nonetheless, one that I find escapism in.  Of course, I saw the film before the book, but the book keeps me coming back for more.  I have never traveled outside of my own country (and probably never will), so a place like this will only exist in my mind.  Kind of a good thing though, because only I can be responsible for tearing it down!  I found the book to be so much better than the movie, as is usually the case.  This is, for me, one of those books that stays with you for a while...and somehow keeps entering your mind from time to time.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|You've got to get this one. Before I got heavy into jazz I didn't care for Sonny. But I've grown to love him. He wrote two of the tunes on this CD, \\"St.Thomas, & \\"Strode Rode.\\" He also composed a jazz standard called \\"Doxy\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of humour in his bebop jazz, but on this one, he's completely serious.It's a combo setting with the great Tommy Flanagan on piano; Doug Watkins on bass & Max Roach on drums. Flanagan takes some great solos, especially on St. Thomas.<br /><br />Sonny shows his great skill as a ballad player. In the business we always say \\"Anyone can learn to play fast, but it's the ballad that separates the men from the boys.\\" The tune is \\"You Don't know what love is.\\" Chet Baker used to do it on tpt.(and sing it as well) but this version is much better.OK....you love jazz, you love tenor sax, but you don't know what love is (excuse the pun) 'till you've heard this one.<br /><br />As for sound quality, it was recorded in 1956, but sounds like it was recorded yesterday.......Get it.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I listened a couple times through and then gave up.  This album has one good song and a dozen other rehashes of the same material from her last album.  The sum total of her singing talent appears to be nothing more than stuttering out a few cliche phrases.  After that she just applies a few musical style templates to create a handful of cookie-cutter songs.  Voila, a new Lady Gaga album is born (this way).

0470449764|1.0|I used this book to study for the GMAT the first time I took it. This book tries to go way to in depth with concept and theory for the math portion. I am not math inclined- I don't want to know why the angle of the triangle is x, I just want to know the fastest way I can select the right answer on the GMAT exam. After I did bad the first time, I bought a kaplan book with a CD Rom. It was such a game changer. It shows you the tips and tricks you can use to solve the problems quickly. Instead of explaining why the answer was correct, it showed me simple math tricks to get me to the right answer. The CD rom from Kaplan was so valuable as well. It gave me actual GMAT test scores after I took practice exams, and then went back through and showed me what I did wrong and how I can avoid being wrong in the future. To sum it up: this book totally sucked, if you want to improve your score, like me, don't buy it and go with Kaplan instead.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|As the content has been reviewed enough, I'll limit myself to saying that if you are expecting something Disney-like, you should look elsewhere. After all, it was a pay cable show not on the tediously bland broadcast networks.  What is bothersome is the Closed Captioning flicking on and off by itself.  I was not even sure what the problem was exactly until I freeze-framed the video because the Closed Captioning doesn't stay on long enough to read.  Its only a single flicker of a gold rectangle and then gone.  Since my copy was a new factory sealed item, I would guess that it is a disk pressing issue.  All said, its not bad enough to return the item, just a slight repeating annoyance.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Excellent music, lyrics, and vocal.  Love all the songs, especially Goodbye To The Girl.  Can't wait for his next CD.
B003ZHVJFK|2.0|Once again! Another failure to the live-action movies based on videogames. I mean... Mortal Kombat is the best but Max Payne, Prince of Persia, Resident Evil, Hitman, Final Fantasy S.W. and Silent Hill were so-so and the rest is garbage. Tekken didn't sucked but at least it's better than the animated movie that was made in the late 90's or early 2000's.<br /><br />I still think that Tekken is a failure because many cool characters from the videogame were RUINED in this movie (especially Jin), many cool characters from the videogame were not in this movie, some characters didn't fought at all, some good fights were very short, and the storyline was a mess.<br /><br />NOW! It wasn't THAT bad because some fights were pretty cool and the dark environment did matched with the videogame but it wasn't good enough for me. At least it wasn't sooo stupid as Dead or Alive, Street Fighters, Mortal Kombat Annihilation or King of Fighters.<br /><br />If you like movies like Bloodsport or Best of the Best then you can give this one a little chance but if you want good movies based on videogames then pass on this one. Tekken is not so good for a videogame movie.<br /><br />Adios.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard opens up about her abduction and sexual abuse and 18-year ordeal in a simple way that will touch your heart and sear your soul, all at the same time.  Her memoir is one of the most moving I have ever read in a lifetime of reading many memoirs.  Yes, there were times it was difficult to keep reading the explicit details of what a monster of a man did to a young child of only eleven years.  Yes, there were times that tears flowed down my cheeks, but I could not put her story aside. I read it in one night.<br /><br />You will never read another story quite like Jaycee's story, and you will never \\"meet\\" a more courageous survivor.
B0028K3192|4.0|I know i'm super late, but this is my honest opinion.  This latest disc by Maxwell is a slight step down from his past cd's.  It seems that something is missing and I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it's the fact there are only 9 songs (well, only 8 and 1 instrumental).  Maybe because a couple of songs i'm forcing myself to like (track #2) because it's Maxwell.  I just don't know.  What I do know is his talent is still as strong as ever and I will purchase his next cd when it comes out because I do believe in him.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|With a hokey name like \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\", you're really not supposed to expect much more than Cowboys and Aliens, fighting.<br /><br />And very little of the movie even deals with that.  For an action/adventure film, there's remarkable little action and no real adventure.<br /><br />Being PG-13, it couldn't go all-out in a faithful depiction of the Old West, but it seems they only really pushed it so as to show off Olivia Wilde's buttcrack and a quick shot of a a guy with a big hole shot through the chest with an alien weapon, as everything else is virtually squeaky-clean, not a hint of racism or sexism, grit or grime, and an utterly blas&egrave; attitude from everyone but Sam Rockwell as the bartender \\"Doc\\".<br /><br />As the review in my local newspaper said, very little is devoted to \\"why\\" with regards to the alien, and far too much \\"why\\" with regards to Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan, played so stony and cold you don't give a damn about any of his problems.<br /><br />The characters are horribly one-dimensional and predictable, and there were so many instances in the film where not only me, but a large group of people, burst out laughing.  And not when the movie was being funny.<br /><br />Not going to spoil it, but the big \\"revelation\\" moment with Olivia Wilde's character caused some very loud and noticeable derisive laughter from many of us in the theater, and the moment with the alien that Jake had first met having a final standoff with him at the end was so hackneyed, it provoked chitters and groans.<br /><br />For a movie that felt so long and, by concept, seemed to be aiming for something big, it sure felt small, like a Syfy original movie with some big-name actors in it.<br /><br />But the absolute biggest plothole involves the aliens interacting with the people.  Not only is it never explained WHY the aliens are randomly abducting people, but as it turns out, their ultimate reason for coming to Earth, and their goal, not only has little to nothing to do with humans, but considering their technology, they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all!<br /><br />Considering how a clich&egrave;'d Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning, these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason.  But then we wouldn't have this big dumb mess we call a movie.they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all!      Considering how a clichè'd Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning, these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason.

0316056863|4.0|My friends always tell me I remind them of Tina Fey.  In fact, Tina Fey is actually one of my heroines, up there with Hilary Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Oprah.  I am the real life younger version of Liz Lemon, as sad or awesome as that might be, so of course I wanted to dive into this book the moment I got it.  That of course didn't happen, so come July and it was the Oh No They Didn't Book Club Light Read Selection of July, I finally made time.<br /><br />From recollecting tales of her childhood to a honeymoon ruined by cruise ship fire, Tina Fey's life is surprisingly...not as comical as I had expected.  Not to say this book wasn't funny, but I wanted more funny.  She's a comedian.  She's a comedy writer.  Bossypants fell short of the laugh out loud funny mark, but it made up for that in relatable and even inspiring tales about life, love, work, and popping out a kid.  All I need help on, so I was happy in this camp.<br /><br />Another problem I had with this book was the fact it skipped around and didn't follow a timeline.  We'd go from childhood to college to work back to college to 30 Rock back to SNL back to childhood to having a child at random parts.  The parts where she recounts her life before she gained fame are amazing, 5 stars all around.  Even the parts where she talks about her honeymoon and her child fall in this category.  But the work parts?  Three stars at best.  I got bored with descriptions of coworkers, staffers, friends, Saturday Night Live bits, and 30 Rock's will it or won't it fail recaps.<br /><br />Tina Fey manages to keep her heroine status with this offering, but it wasn't as good as I had expected.  If it had been timelined better, and if it had left out ¾ of the work-related stuff, it would have been a 5 all around, but I will give it 3.5 and round it up to 4 because I love Tina and I'm a nice girl.  Also, the cover is hilarious.<br /><br />VERDICT: Not as funny as what you might expect from Tina Fey, but BOSSYPANTS does offer a lot of fun stories and advice and a look behind the scenes at her life.and a look behind the scenes at her life.
B000024TFY|5.0|\\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" was the second album released by Judas Priest and not only one of their best, but also one of the most influential metal albums of all time. Much has been said about the amazing vocals of Rob Halford and the killer guitar work of K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton. And while they absolutely deserve the praise, not as much credit has been given to the rhythm section of drummer Alan Moore and bassist Ian Hill. They lock in together and form the pounding, driving rhythms that went on to help define heavy metal. The song writing on this album is incredible, and the diversity is awesome. \\"Victim of Changes\\" and \\"Tyrant\\" rock, with heavy, driving guitars. \\"Dreamer Deceiver\\" is a classic metal ballad, and \\"Prelude\\" features some mood changing keyboards. Every single song on this album is amazing. If you like metal, and want to hear one of the most influential bands of all time, you can't go wrong here!

B000XR4OC0|3.0|I just got my toms from amzon and noticed that there's only one 'TOMS' tag on the side of left shoe (not on the right one).  I've been looking at toms website and looking at the pictures of their shoes and all of them have white toms tag on both shoes(on the side).  Is mine fake or did they make design change?
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I would argue that this book is a bit too casual at times.  I find this works well for some, but not necessarily for a book discussing an inherently technical subject.  I found myself wanting more detail - more sections with \\"Geek Alerts\\".  Chasing down references is not why I pay for a book like this.  Better editing needed.    If you can get over the writing style, the content of the book was pretty good.  I'm no scientist, but I can put two and two together.  A lot of what is written here makes sense.  It sure beats spending countless weeks or months surfing the web for this kind of info.    I regularly read and put training and nutritional advice to the test.  I'm a hard gainer and like Ferris, I'm not blessed with athletic genes.  If something works, I'll notice a change.    What I tried:    1) diet - similar to Atkin's in terms of the kinds of food that is allowed, but that's where the similarities end.  Cons: the \\"Slow-Carb\\" diet alone didn't work for me, whereas Atkin's always did.  Pros: I learned a lot about how to improve my current eating for athletic performance.  When I added nutrient rich vegetables back into my diet, my race performances noticably improved.    2) the binge - loved this concept - who wouldn't!  Does it work?  Not sure, but I certainly have not gained any more weight.  I cycle my calories anyway as an athlete, but wasn't aware of those extra little steps you can take to minimize the damage.    3) Ice Age - I didn't notice any change.  As a bonus side-effect though, my back pain dissapeared and I slept better.  In the past, when I used to swim a lot of laps, I do recall, that I performed better overall in other sports.    4) \\"Occam's Protocol\\" - I didn't respond as quickly as illustrated in the book, but my body **did** respond AND in a whole **lot** less time than I ever imagined.  From what I can see in the mirror (compared to two months ago) and how my shirts fit around my arms and chest, the change is noticable.  Impressive, considering the measly 40 minutes per week (two sessions of 20 minutes each) that I spent working on this.)    5) \\"Ultraendurance\\" & \\"Effortless Superhuman\\" - there wasn't advice for an athlete that needed both a mixture of endurance and speed.  So, I created a mixed program out of the recommendations from these chapters.  Did it work?  Not entirely sure yet.  After a long layoff from training I felt that I quickly regained 70 to 80% of my top-end sprint speed only after two months of training (in and out of the gym in less than 25 minutes, twice per week and not including practice time on the track.)    As for the ultraendurance piece, the verdict is still out on that (as of this writing Ferris either still hasn't run the 50 mile race he was training for or hasn't posted anything about it.)  It feels like it is working and the workouts are very short (between 20 to 30 minutes per session, not including practice time on the track or road) but as any athlete will tell you, endurance takes more than a couple of months to develop (regardless of whether you use high intensity or high volume.)  In my opinion, experience tells me that the advice given in this book (for endurance) will get you part of the way there with far fewer hours and much quicker than using conventional methods, but ultimately to get to an elite level will require longer sessions (but probably not as many as was once thought in the past.)    Overall, I found the book to be very motivating and fun to read due to the various anecdotes that Ferris shares with us.  If nothing else, his words should be enough to motivate you to go after higher levels of athletic performance, or to scare you enough to get off your butt and pay attention to your health.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|It seems that the newest flavor of rock & roll in the 21st century bears a strong resemblance to the origins of popular music itself:  folk.  Whether it be with pianos, organs, banjos, or acoustic guitars, the DIY attitude of the indie musician has truly infected the seemingly-unkillable beast otherwise known as Mainstream Rock.  Just take a look at the number of popular artists touring the globe and you'll agree:  retro is the new black.<br /><br />Enter Mumford & Sons, the latest sensation from across the pond.  They dress like train conductors and play old-timey acoustic music.  But are they deserving of the hype and buzz they've generated over the last few years?  Sure, they're talented; that much cannot be denied.  But are they truly worthy of the praise heaped upon them by the music press?  I think not.<br /><br />Before you start with the angry comments, please understand:  I listened to this album several times, and I did enjoy it, but it didn't sound fresh to me.  In fact, it sounded a bit like a rip-off.  Listen to an Avett Bros. album, and you'll hear exactly what I'm talking about.  The Avett Bros. have helped to create the sound that Mumford & Sons are taking to the bank, which, to me, seems criminal.  For one, the Avett Bros. write better songs.  MUCH better songs.  To take my point even further, the Avett Bros. play their instruments better and fully utilize their influences into something fresh and original.  To quote Marcus Mumford himself:  \\"We're just mediocre, fat English musicians.  But we try hard.\\"<br /><br />And try hard they do.  While underwhelmed by their debut album, I hope that the band's \\"try hard\\" work ethic will allow their music to grow beyond sounding like a cheap knowck-off of an already-established artist.  Meanwhile, I'll keep my fingers crossed.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is an incredible story.  Well written, fantastic storytelling skill.  Thanks Christopher, it's been a long time since I've read such a great story!    As an amateur, I look to established authors and books to learn about storytelling and techniques to improve my own writing skills.  This book is truly a work of art!
0300169787|2.0|Despite all the raves here, I have to say this book is a big disappointment.     It was produced before the exhibition, obviously they needed to have available at museum shops. But as a result it really misses the opportunity to document one of the most amazing museum presentations ever produced. As is, the book lacks all the flair and theatricality of the show and McQueen's work itself. In fact the photography against stolid gray backgrounds is really a major mistake. And all the head pieces and most of the hats that further enliven the show are missing here.     Finally the scholarship is reduced to one rather terse essay and strips of mini pictures of all the McQueen shows etc., this section should have been radically more expanded and inclusive. The Met web site, which is fabulous, provides a ton more useful info than does this book. One can only hope that the Met sees the wisdom in producing another McQueen book that does the show justice. Perhaps at additional venues in Europe, which they swear aren't scheduled but are really inevitable.    Yep, it's got a groovy lenticular photo on the cover (which btw I for one happen to find in bad taste, a skull and McQueen's face, really? Isn't it a little soon after the suicide?) but otherwise this fast-selling book is a big letdown.

B000021YQV|4.0|System of a Down may not be as different as the Deftones are, but their second and most popular album, Toxicity, is still a fantastic album nonetheless. The lead singer and the whole band are more energetic than any other band in the world, but that's not to praise it thoroughly. And what else, some of the songs run for under 2 minutes, and the lyrics are creative (as well as Serj's ode to the American Prison) which definitely indicates that they are different. So, overall, Toxicity is something you'd expect from System of a Down.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars/5 stars
B001GMH8RO|5.0|seen this in theatre and in VHS... great in blu ray... of course the movie is classic and that you can watch over again after awhile and won't get tired of the movie... great romance movie and the power of love and faith; and the question that lingers in all our minds-- good versus evil; the consequences of our actions surely lead us to our ultimate destiny.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is my favorite Linkin Park album compared to Hybrid Theory. They put so much effort into this record, while I thought Hybrid Theory was just not as amazing, but I still liked both records.<br /><br />My favorite song on Meteora is Don't Stay. It's a perfect opening track after the brief intro. Somewhere I Belong, Lying From You, Numb, Faint, and Breaking the Habit make great singles, while Figure.09, Hit the Floor, and From the Inside are great cuts.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Meteora rocks more than their other albums. Therefore, I found Meteora to be amazing.<br /><br />5 stars/5 stars

B000008GHW|5.0|The Cry Of Love is a powerful, intense, and heartbreaking swan song that Jimi left us with. He was just exploding with talent and there are so many beautiful, complex song ideas and killer arrangements that it is truly a classic. Originally intended as a double album, the leftover material appears on the two releases after this one, Rainbow Bridge and War Heroes. 40 + years later The Cry Of Love is still a landmark recording, and as the last song is fading away, you can't help but imagine how many more songs Jimi would have written and how many more albums he would have recorded.<br /><br />The full double album, \\"First Rays Of The New Rising Sun\\" was released in 1997.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|In all objectivity, while 'The Fame' was a certainly a good album, 'Born This Way' makes it looks like commercialized trash. However, Gaga cannot be faulted for this. Those familar with how the recording industry operates should be fully aware of the treatment of a new artist. Here, after proving herself an international superstar, Mama Monster takes the wheel and really displays her vocal power, range and versatility; non-fans will have to admit that the girl can definitely sing circles around her contemporaries. The songwriting on this album is remarkably substantial,introspective and is simply an exaggerated version of her nights at the Bitter End in New York City. This album is a sincere and honest work. Maintaining consistency, the production is of tasteful, clean quality, never skimping on emotion and fun. No need to skip around on this one, and the song order flows quite nicely. The Special Edition includes a few extra treats, specifically some very Euro-sounding avant-garde pop. Enjoy!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Slow and hardly advances the story at all. With every other book in this series I raced through to the end. I started this one that way until I realized the book is apparently one giant prologue for...what? Like others have said in these reviews, we waited six years believing that this book would answer certain questions or at least advance certain story lines. It didn't do either. Mr. Martin better get his act together, quickly this time, and recover from this travesty with a better book because right now he is doing exactly what he says that he feared. He's on the verge of pulling a Lost.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great predictive function nice layout and lots of settings keep it up!!!!!! Would have paid for this but free is nice to
B0056BMK6K|3.0|The most important thing to remember is that this is a how to book, essentially and even the most detailed and sincere how to books offer more hope than substance. My initial reaction to the book was the same as with all the other how to books I've bought (and there are many) which was to start punching the air, shouting yesss, and making posts saying I'd found the best thing ever and had started preparing for author superstardom. Couple of weeks later, you guessed it, the book is sitting on the lonely shelf with all the other how to books that promised me a quick fix but never delivered. Well, it would be if it had been a real book, I bought the kindle version. And the reason it will probably stay there? I bought another book, similar promise, I mean premise, sell gazillions of books using only a piece of string, some social media and one small blog. Only problem is that this book said both the same (good news bad news, but more of that later) and something different (cue confusion). The similarities went like this - put on your most sincere smile, befriend folk on twitter, facebook etc, be sure to be a really sincere friend, show interest in them and their posts, work etc, then sell them your book. Or hope that they'll somehow find your book, which is the same thing. Where they differed was that Locke says blog infrequently, the second book said no less than three times a week or you're wasting your time. At this point I was both alarmed and confused. Alarmed because very soon the whole of the indie book community is going to look like a Miss Author Pageant, with everyone smiling earnestly, trying to look interested in other people, while at the same time calculating how long they'll have to listen before mentioning their book. And we'll all be gushing over kittens and puppies, celebrities and starving kids in africa in our blogs in an effort to look concerned, altruistic, and hopefully get some good SEO hits so we can sell people our books. It's going to be a summer of love that has no end (until you buy my book) after which I promise to stop smiling and stop pretending to be your friend.     I'm giving the book three stars because I enjoyed the read and it reminded me that I need to promote. Taking off two stars because I'm blaming it (and others) in advance for making authors believe that friendship is synonymous with marketing. Yes, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but my friends don't send me chatty emails full of buy links. I don't do that to my friends, either. By all means be nice to people, show an interest in their posts, but do it like you really mean it, not just because you want them to buy your book. It's a system that works brilliantly if a few people are doing it. Once everyone starts doing it the smiles will become a tad fixed and it will lose effectiveness. So yes, I recommend the read, but I'd say think hard and long before trying the system yourselves. It will only work if you buy into the principles. It's not a right or a wrong system, it's a great system that worked wonderfully for a man with a brilliant marketing mind. If you think like a marketing department, it will probably work for you. If you don't, it probably won't. And, if like me you're addicted to the quick fix lure of the self help book, it's probably already languishing in your kindle archives, or sitting lonely on the shelf.
B001ED7C58|5.0|this soundtrack does what its supposed to, you can listen to it by itself without seeing the movie and enjoy it or if youve watched the movie the songs seem to fit perfect! there are times when ive heard a song on the radio and had the clip of the movie with that song run through my head :) this is a great movie soundtrack!

1935670913|5.0|This is the best self-help book on publishing and marketing that I have ever read. Hands down! I know a cliche, but this was so full of encouragement and hand holding care from the author that I was touched and renewed in my efforts to continue to write.     I received this book from a precious friend as a gift and I can't say enough about this book. It's a fast read and positively a huge help to any writers who are thinking about doing all the work themselves. He writes clearly and takes the reader step-by-step through the process. He makes difficult decisions and helps you to do the same about your personal style of writing.     Thank you John Locke,I believe you have changed my life as a writer. If for anything, I am encouraged to keep going. :)    Paulette Harris  [...]  [...]
B000SINT52|5.0|One thing I must say about all of the Michael Moore films I've seen so far as a sixteen soon to be seventeen year old, none of his documentaries are dull. Even if I disagree with some of Mikes points (one of the great rights of being an American)his films still catch my attention the whole time. However, you aren't reading this for an essay on how muych I love and praise Michael Moore. You're most likely here to read my opinion of the movie. Well, the movie was very entertaining (very important for documentaries) and informative at the same time. Many documentaries are all facts but no fun which is almost pointless because no one wantys to listen to the monotone Biology teacher talk about the wild life. (or Ben Stein sell Eye Contacts or whatever) The movie at time can be bias which isn't anything abnormal. (Spoiler alert, everyone has a personal bias of some degree, so get over it) However, once again Michael Moore does not pull any punches. This movie is next to flawless and I encourage mostly anyone to watch it. I hope you find my first review helpful.
B002ELMMVI|1.0|But I am rating the error in what we watched...the picture is right...the title is wrong...Love American Style?  Really?  Okay and $2.99 meant I found an alternative real quick to view the remainder of the Dexter Series...which we love.  At one time it was represented that Prime members got a reduced price, but I guess that is over...I did get a penny off.  So yeah, my rating is basically about Amazon here and I usually voice my disapproval when others complain by using the star system for their beef...
B0055SWM08|5.0|I&apos;ve seen variations on this theme on every conceivable platform, starting with what I believe was called &quot;Inertia&quot; on old Unix machines to older android apps like &quot;Tiltmazes&quot;. While the concept isn&apos;t new, this is about as good as it gets in terms of control, graphics, sound, replay value, and UI. Well worth the buck.
B004HZ76FQ|2.0|reeling is slow and tedious, hooks don&apos;t register all the time, can&apos;t reel during cast, always casts same distance... would be fun with better execution of controls. even still only a few minutes of play and get bored.

0553801473|1.0|I've edited my review to 1 star. This is an improvement over Feast of Crows. I've also seen it compared to Jordan's Crossroads of Twilight. I don't believe it's anywhere near as bad as that. That being said it's not good.<br /><br />Good things:<br />One. Pacing. Feast suffered from pacing issues. I think this was caused by the splitting of the novel. Since everything that happened focused for the most part around King's Landing it didn't have the feel that previous novels had. Martin is a genius at leaving you on the edge of your seat. You're reading about Tyrion and the end of the chapter gets there and cliffhanger, and you're in a Jon chapter and although you love Jon you want to know what happened to Tyrion. Then he pulls you into Jon. Then Jon cliffhangers and it's an Arya chapter. Feast was missing that but Dance has it back.<br /><br />Two. Everybody is back. There aren't many chapters but there are Jaime and Cersei chapters. There's no getting to the end of the book and not having at least checked in on your favorites.<br />Three. Style. Martin is still a good writer, no question. He has been and remains a master of the written word. Period.<br /><br />Indifferent thing:<br />It ends with cliffhangers and no plots are tied off. Well it's part of a series. Plot was moved forward in this book make no mistake. Nothing was wrapped up but I won't complain about that for another two books. It is what it is.<br /><br />Bad things:<br /><br />One. Introduction of a major new character. One that was not foreshadowed, set up, or honestly needed. New characters are fine. Not pivotal ones. We should have a full cast at this point. Because one of two things will happen. Martin will kill him so what was the point. Two he becomes a major part of end story resolution so why didn't we have him sooner. It's sloppy story telling.<br /><br />Two. Introduction of pointless minor characters. We get introduced to some new points of view. Some were characters we have seen before just never followed from a POV. One in particular was brand new. One was killed and I didn't care. It was a throw away character. Martin never made me truly care for him so there wasn't the shock I had with Eddard's execution or the Red Wedding. Since Martin doesn't have a problem killing characters I wasn't even shocked that he died. Just mildly surprised because it was sloppily done and not what I would expect from Martin.<br /><br />Three. Daenerys and Tyrion. Two of my favorite characters who were always guaranteed to entertain sucked. Tyrion wasn't Tyrion. Yeah he's dealing with some stuff but when hasn't he. It wasn't the same character from the first three books. Daenerys... The one character who had a clarity of purpose and action at all times didn't throughout the whole book. \\"you must go back to go forward.\\" I read that and cringed. Eleven years man. The Daenerys storyline doesn't need moved back. Nothing needs moved back.<br /><br />Four. Too familiar plot tricks. Another Stark doesn't listen to his wolf. Tyrion's wisecracks get him hit again... and again... and again...<br /><br />Five. Stupid tricks. Not using the characters name in the chapter title but a description. For instance a Selmy chapter marked as Queen's Hand. He does it alot and it gets annoying. You'll see.<br /><br />So eleven years, countless broken promises, missed deadlines, and half a novel for this. It's not as bad as Crossroads of Twilight but Jordan didn't take eleven years to write it. Plus I've edited my review to one because the number of lackluster 5 star reviews that use similar wording and seem fishy.....
1463514581|5.0|This book was a great read. I normally don't read books for fun but I saw this one and had to see what it was all about.  I couldn't put it down. Every page left me wanting more.  I can't wait until the next one comes out.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|Undoubtedly some of the best music you will ever hear right next to Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom. Ten years after The Phantom of the Opera you will see what has happened to all the main characters.  You will be mesmorized by the music, hanging on everyword and holding your breath to the end as if you were watching it live in London or Melbourne.
B004GGM444|5.0|i just purchased this cd and i also heard every track on youtube already, skrillex is a musical genius. This music takes dub to a another level , i have heard other dub artist and it is all fairly good but, but this dub right here by far is more superior to anything else out there. This cd alone is the best dub cd out there , but if you ever downloaded skrillex other tracks that are out there online some songs are even better than whats on this cd! Skrillex takes music to a whole new level even my dad listens to this. I Highly recommend this cd to anyone into dub our any form of techno. it is a must have.

1853260444|5.0|After reading The Woman in White and thoroughly enjoying it, I looked forward to more of Wilkie Collins.  I was not disappointed with The Moonstone.  Interestingly, just before reading the book, I had \\"coincidentally\\" found in other research that many ancient religions worship the moon, have a legend about a green stone falling from the sky, and guard their green-stone-from-the-sky with jealous zeal.  In the first few pages of The Moonstone, the stone's history is explained.  I realized that the author must have known something about the green stones and the moon god worship of ancient civilizations.  That is all a curious \\"aside\\" to this review.  The Moonstone is another riveting Collins' mystery novel, with new surprises popping up especially at the end.  I could never have guessed the solution to the mystery, which is what makes this book so good.  Not only are you wondering \\"who did it and why?\\" but you are also wondering about the final results of the matchmaking, after all the obstacles.  This is certainly a mystery much more than a romance, although it seems that few authors can resist writing a good book without having a young couple fall in love.  Buy this book and enjoy!  (The Wordsworth Classics edition was very readable in terms of print size, and had explanatory notes at the end.)
B0012GMXBK|5.0|I have heard quite a bit of skinny jean wearing, zit-faced, whiny dissent forced at this album too many times.  These comments included the below:    \\"It's radio-friendly!\\"    \\"The production isn't as good as {insert album name here}!\\"    \\"Udo's voice is too shrieky!\\"    \\"The guitars are not very technical!\\"    \\"That guy that sings for them is short and weird looking!\\"  \\"There were other metal bands from Germany before Rammstein?\\"    I had listened to most of these comments a few years ago when I was part owner of a record store, and they came from the upcoming younger generation of metal-heads, the \\"nu-metal-heads,\\" I suppose you could call them.  The same generation that seems to have massive entitlement issues as well as a very defined poor taste in metal.  I personally believe that there is one thing these whiners are NOT entitled to have--good 80's metal like this gem here.  \\"Metal Heart\\" kicks things off with some of Accept's patented bizarre science fiction lyrics about the human race dying and some other stuff, but it makes no difference once Udo starts shrieking and the guitars start riffing.  The guitar solo hits and the classical shred influence shows in it big time. The opening tunes on this album probably are the best of the Accept catatlog IMO, it tracks forward to \\"Midnight Mover\\" then \\"Up to the Limit.\\" The fourth track, \\"Wrong is Right\\" is more of a speed metal tune, sort of a let down after the previous tracks, but it gets by on its high energy and chorus. \\"Screaming for a Love-Bite\\" comes crashing in, this is another song to put down on the Accept classics list, along with the following track \\"Too High to Get it Right.\\"  The rest of the cuts are just as good, closing out with the awesome power metal of \\"Bound to Fail.\\"  I would recommend this album to any metalhead whose only taste isn't the taste in their mouths.  Besides this thing is selling for $2.50, and I call that definite value for your money.

B004KD5TQI|5.0|Loved the movie and love this soundtrack.  Note, the songs are longer than normal because they seem to be exactly what the movie editor used in the movie.   I half expected to hear some movie dialogue in there.   Great for people who loved this movie as the musing was at LEAST 50% of the experience.    Yes, I bought the BluRay/ DVD set, but from a different retailer... begins with a W
0553801473|3.0|To be honest, it's more of a 2.5 star book.  I honestly think the publisher told Martin - look, give us SOMETHING! We've got the HBO now, perfect tie-in yada yada.  Not his best effort.  Clunky and about 300 pages too long.  Please, don't just give us a bunch of pages edited into a \\"book\\".  I swear, if I hear, or read, the phrase \\"much, and more\\" or one of its permutations one more time, I will scream.  That phrase appears in the book approximately 8,999 times.  I am not sure when the next installment will come out.  Certainly I won't wait another 10 years.  At this point, I am not even sure I want to read it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've compared SwiftKey X to Better Keyboard 8 (BK8) on my Droid, and I am loving SwiftKey.  Even though there are fewer word choices at the top while you're typing, I find the predictions to be MUCH more accurate and efficient, and it's easier to select the words when they're a little bigger.  This app has truly saved me a lot of typing, and I admit I was skeptical that this app would impress me like it has.  Perhaps it's because I took the time to let the app learn from what I type in e-mail, facebook, and text messages.  I look forward to having more skins available for this keyboard. I'm surprised there aren't more options for keyboard layout especially in portrait mode, but I honestly haven't missed that option much.  The keyboard in portrait mode just seems more precise than it was using BK8.    As for downloading, I did have to wait until I had access to wifi particularly when trying to download the language dictionary.  No biggie; it was worth the wait!
B000000OE7|3.0|Put together years after Mercury's death, MADE IN HEAVEN is a mixture of older material reworked by the remaining band members into what really ends up being the original bands last album. Mercury is the central point and the songs titles and subsequent lyrics all have a memorial feeling. \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" kicks off the CD with a mix of positive \\"The sun is shining, I feel good\\" to melancholy \\"Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad\\" that is repeated in one way or another on the entire CD. No flights of fancy here nor anything particularly catchy just Freddy singing his heart out on tracks that have been given a polish, but are lacking the Queen magic. A must have for Queen fans, but casual listeners can and probably have given this a pass.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|\\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" is a film with a simple plot with a few surprises. It takes place a few years after the Civil War and Harrison Ford is still complaining about the Union generals at Antietam, as well as having to deal with a spoiled, drunken son. Daniel Craig has amnesia and a strange bracelet clamped on his wrist. And Olivia Wilde is a beautiful, gun-toting woman who seems to know what's going on with Craig, as alien spacecraft start blowing up a town and the area's cowboys, and later robbers and Apaches. The film meanders along for quite some time, but heats up in the second half, as humans band together to try to save humanity from extinction.<br /><br />\\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" has some good action sequences and photography, and the aliens are ugly and scary. The main actors all do a good job, as does Keith Carradine as a sheriff and Sam Rockwell as a non-violent saloon owner who learns to shoot a rifle.<br /><br />All in all, this is a well-made film, which is generally entertaining, especially in its latter stages. Three and one-half stars.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|When you listen to the songs on THE PROMISE, you realize Springsteen's career would have gone in a very different direction if he had chosen to go with the pop sound found here. This is a lighter, more formulaic Springsteen; one who owes a debt to the Do-Wop bands of the 50's and Motown; worthy ancestors but not as important to the sound Springsteen eventual developed with BORN TO RUN and a DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN. Appearing sparingly throughout his albums, these types of songs are welcome breaks from the seriousness, pleasant interludes before you get back to the meaningful material; when you listen to all these songs together instead of the occasional cut found on various albums, you realize how slight they are, lacking the depth and meaning you expect from Springsteen. Even the versions of songs later used like \\"Candy's Boy\\" which became \\"Candy's Room\\" and \\"Racing in the Street (78)\\" pale in comparison to the final forms that were chosen for DARKNESS. Even familiar cuts like \\"Fire\\" work better live and Patti Smith's take on \\"Because the Night\\" is simply better than Springsteen's. You can't help feeling like it was a good thing these songs didn't appear until now. That being said this is still a fun listen; it's almost like an alternate dimension version of the Boss. Maybe he would have a few more top 40 hits with these songs, but he definitely would not be considered one of rock's legends.
0307719774|3.0|I LOVE this book -- at least I love the idea of it. I've been wanting to keep some kind of journal/diary that my kids could read someday and learn about me ... this little book is perfect for that!<br /><br />It asks a simple question each day for a year. There are 4 lines to answer the question, which is great for someone like me who tends to ramble -- the 4 lines ensure a short and sweet response. In front of the 4 lines is a bolded \\"20__\\" where you fill out the current year.<br /><br />Basically, it's set up like a traditional 5-year diary. Each page has 5 groups of 4 lines beginning with 20__. So after you go through a year of answering the questions at the top of the page, you start over again on the second group of lines.<br /><br />I think it's a great tool to see how you've grown and changed over the course of a year -- as well as how you've stayed the same. I'm excited to see how my answers will vary from year to year.<br /><br />I know another reviewer gave a good sampling of the questions, so I'll just throw in a few here: \\"When was the last time you flew on an airplane?\\" \\"What's your favorite word (right now)?\\" and \\"Write down a problem you solved today.\\"<br /><br />Now for the reasons I only gave this book 3 stars, even though I love the idea of it:<br /><br />1. It's tiny, about 6x4 inches. That makes it handy to carry around, but hard to manage when you're trying to hold the book open and write in a very small space.<br /><br />2. It doesn't lay flat. That's a big pet peeve of mine, especially for a diary or journal. It makes the chore of writing in a tiny space even more of a chore. My first entry is all messy; it feels impossible to write neatly. I'm hoping to get used to it so my printing can be somewhat legible.<br /><br />3. I was surprised that there's no ribbon to use as a bookmark. I had to use a sticky note page marker. With the style of this book -- gilded edges, hard cover -- the missing ribbon is confusing, as well as inconvenient.<br /><br />I think 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating. This would easily get 5 stars from me if it were a bit bigger, laid flat, and had a ribbon bookmark!r />I think 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|With a vocal performance that strives to create an overpowering sense of emotion, Cook tries very hard to sell each and every song. This overwhelms the lyrics and just becomes an exhausting experience for the listener. There is very little to separate one song from another and there is an instant memory loss after each one is over. The shame is I feel there is real talent here; I think when you hear songs like \\"Bar-ba-sol\\" or \\"Kiss on the Neck\\" you get the perfect mixture; powerful vocals backed up by a real rock beat. It beats the MOR approach of the rest of the album by a long shot and you have to hope the production of the next one is more in line with this side of Cook.
030726999X|5.0|Loved the book. I've read all of JOHN SANFORD & LEE CHILDS's books and was looking for a new author that was as good. It was suggested to me to check out STIEG LARSSON. I did and was hooked from the first book. Much like his previous two books I couldn't put it down once I started. Unfortunately there will be no more from this author but I truely enjoyed his writting. Definately a great read.
B00008G9JN|5.0|SONGS FROM THE WOOD is just what the title says; Jethro Tull going back to the sounds of days gone by and putting their own spin on them. Starting with the thrilling opening to the title track with its killer harmonies and quickly moving through to the forest imp \\"Jack in the Green,\\" this is an excellent example of folk rock. Anderson gets to indulge all those tendencies he had shown throughout early Tull works, working not just the flute but every bit of sound that would have been found in madrigals and ballads to excellent advantage. This is one of Tull's most satisfying recordings and even the bit of overindulgence on \\"Pilbroch\\" doesn't really keep this from being a good time from beginning to end.
B000WGNJ78|5.0|In the future, scientists create \\"Replicants\\", genetically engineered biological slaves pretty much, that are described as being \\"More human than human\\" (Remember that cool Rob Zombie song from Astro Creep 2000 titled \\"More Human Than Human\\"? A great song that was heavily inspired by this movie.). That is the main premise of the movie \\"Blade Runner\\". Replicants are used to fight wars, do offworld mining, and all kinds of other mundane, dirty and dangerous jobs that most people wish not to do. The Tyrell Corporation is one of the biggest manufacturers of Replicants on the planet.<br /><br />Well it seems that a group of 4 Replicants no longer wish to be slaves to humans, and especially do not like the 4 year lifespan that they have been genetically programmed with in order to keep them from becoming too smart and emotionally experienced. After all, how else could you control an advanced genetically engineered slave and keep them in line with your directives if not to limit their ways and means of knowledge and experience? So Roy Batty, played by the menacing Rutger Hauer, and his team of rebel replicants kill a bunch of offworld people and head to planet Earth in order to meet their maker and have a little talk with him. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a \\"Blade Runner\\". A guy whose speciality is \\"retiring\\" rogue replicants (A fancy way of saying 'killing'.)<br /><br />In order to get more information about this certain group of rebel replicants that he is assigned to terminate, Deckard heads to the Tyrell corporation where he meets Rachael, played by Sean Young, a secretary of the Tyrell corporation and also a new generation replicant who does not realize that she is a replicant. Soon enough Deckard falls madly in love with Rachael.<br /><br />Anyway, can Deckard stop the evil replicants lead by the wily and determined Roy Batty from performing their mission on Earth, and also find true love and happiness with Rachael? You will just have to watch the movie to find that out.<br /><br />I first saw Blade Runner in the theater way back in 1982 when it was first released and I enjoyed it pretty much. It was a nice little noirish sci fi thriller that had a grim view of how the future (2019) would look like such as constant acid rain falling from the sky, and all the other depressing things that go along with it that we have seen in many other countless dystopian films since this movie's release.<br /><br />I owned Blade Runner on VHS and watched it every now and then over the years. It was an interesting movie to watch, especially for the performances of Harrison Ford, and the most excellent and menacing Rutger Hauer, and the superb special effects of futuristic buildings and flying cars of the supposed future (Yet no cell phones or laptop computers are present in this movie, ironically? Something that other futuristic movies, most notably the Star Trek films happened to get right.)<br /><br />Anyway, this review is for the DVD \\"The Final Cut\\" version that I watched, and the picture and sound of it all was simply stunning, and it also features extended scenes and previously unseen footage that previous versions of the film lacked. If you are one of the few people who has not seen Blade Runner yet, then I highly recommend that you give this film a view. It's a really good thought-provoking film that is worth at least one viewing. It is also the final cut of the film that is most-endorsed by the director Ridley Scott.first saw Blade Runner in the theater way back in 1982 when it was first released and I enjoyed it pretty much.

B004QPOVG4|5.0|At this point in time, if I had to recommend 2 ACDC concerts on DVD, I would find it hard.However, with three, The collectors edition of Let There be Rock is essential, Live at Donnington, and Live at River Plate. The three concerts show how solid ACDC have been for a long time, and how they sweat blood to give the fans what they want.Whilst I have no problems with the quick cuts ( you have to remember that there are 32 cameras at least, over the three days of shooting), and since I saw what MAIDEN did with their Live in RIO quick cuts and loved that, so if you don't like that, at least remember the sound on this is amazing, and its current sound.The only difference in my recommendation is that Chris Slade does the most outrageously great drum work at Donnington, and in 5.1 its awesome.Phil Rudd's work here is great too, just different, more in line with the Let there be Rock sound.        There are plenty of other concert videos of ACDC, so, if you prefer a more \\"static\\" approach, then take your pick. However, I got the DVD with T-shirt, and since no two concerts are ever the same ( even comparing them to when I saw them in 2001, or so on the Stiff Upper Lip Tour, where the concert was filmed in Munich and the CGI , 500 foot high, version of the Angus Statue used in the tour was SUPERB!! What I saw Live is the same feel as the three DVDs above I recommend, in my view) , I think it was almost inevitable that a quick cut edit was going to come out of it. If you don't like the Quick cut, just stick the DVD in a Theatre sound quality system, and listen to the guys ROCK !!!   Besides, if you don't like this, then change it for another ACDC dvd, its ALL great from the foremost Rock band in the world !!  ( Afterthought: If the quick cuts are really that big a hassle, then put the play back to 50% or 35% of full, and you will see what you want, or better yet, watch the thing a lot, I am sure the news media is moving from 12 second to 4 second, if you say so, cuts, and thisway you get to be ahead of the skill curve.)

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|You just cannot do this book in two hours - that's the most important thing to remember here. The feel of the film is RUSHED. Rushed, rushed, rushed. It's like viewing a dramatization of the CliffsNotes OF CliffsNotes of the novel. Seriously. It was like listening to an excited five year old tell you EVERYTHING about a wonderful day at the zoo. A jumble of elements rushing past you.   I'm guilty of dearly loving the book - I read it recently - that did NOT help me like the film! It's visually BEAUTIFUL... but if you love the book, this film will disappoint.  Plot elements were changed - some were eliminated. Dialogue was changed - unnecessarily. The dialogue in the book is sublime. Jane says things in this film that she NEVER would say - she only tells the reader in the book. The film should have had narration for those things.  There were some scenes with behaviors Jane would NEVER engage in. The film wasn't completely true to her Victorian values and character. Worst of all, the development of the relationship with Rochester - the love that grew between them - never was portrayed. Just taking the film on face value, one would ask why they decided to marry at all - why there was talk of love - when SO little was put into that part of the story.  Overall, this is probably the WORST adaptation I've ever seen of my very favorite book. I'm terribly disappointed. It's visually pretty and the music fits - but throughout the film, I kept cringing. You just cannot do this book in two hours. I don't recommend it.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Rango is a brilliantly designed film. It's a western, starring desert animals that look every inch the part. It is a triumph of character design, drawing on a vastly underutilized subset of the animal kingdom. The casting is note perfect. Toads, possums, lizards, tortoises, and the deadliest rattlesnake gunslinger this side of the Rio Grande. Desert animals tend to be scaly, bumpy, and scruffy, and they seem so at home in the mining colony of Dirt, it makes other talking creature movies look like they were designed by plush animal companies. The irony is that if they ever made toy action figures of those mariachi owls, I would buy mine in a heart beat.<br /><br />The story is rather simple. It's the same plot from A Bug's Life, which is the same plot as The Brave Little Tailor. A newcomer (recently escaped lizard Rango) is mistaken for a hero to help solve the town's big problem. in this case, it's a lack of water. Had the movie simply stuck with this tried and true narrative, it could have become one of the all time greats.<br /><br />Instead, the filmmakers seemed determined to load it down with weird quirky bits that look like they belong in a Wes Anderson film. Rango's lizard love interest has a brain glitch that causes her to space out for minutes on end. There's a bizarre homage to Eastwood's Man With No Name, who drives around in a golf cart. The townsfolk line up to perform a strange rain dance every Wednesday. Rango himself spends the first several minutes of the movie putting on an odd one-man show before his aquarium is tossed out the window. These episodes add nothing to film, and only serve to jar us out of the expertly realized Wild West.<br /><br />The bits that work best are based on those time-honored motifs. Rango leading his posse out into desert in search of bank robbers. A runaway wagon chase, with a hundred bats in pursuit. Facing down that slimy rattlesnake at high noon. Too bad that storytellers want to keep busting up these scenes with walking cactus spirits and mystic roadkill. Rango is definitely a beautiful film to watch. It just could have used some tighter focus.stic roadkill. Rango is definitely a beautiful film to watch. It just could have used some tighter focus.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I suppose it's not unusual for fantasy books to be long or slow-starting, but A Game of Thrones felt longer and slow-starting-er than most. Once it gets going, it turns into a gripping tale of kingly bloodlines, monsters from the woods, and royals in exile.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the political intrigue takes center stage, departing from the genre's usual focus on magic spells and epic battle sequences. The thoughts and motivations of the characters call to mind the moral conflicts of Orson Scott Card's work, and make for a far more interesting read than the usual mage-fighting-a-dragon. Yet it's not without its action sequences. Or its brutality. Early on, one character -- a young child -- is paralyzed from a high fall. Other characters are raped, beheaded, or similarly made uncomfortable. Several wolf puppies are also killed, which is somehow even more awful. The novel features more than its fair share of sex, giving it a grittier feel than its peers.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is sometimes its own worst enemy. The sheer volume of characters puts biblical genealogies to shame. If by the end of the first reading you've got a good feel for half of the major and minor players, consider yourself lucky. So many lords and squires and young ranger boys traipse through the pages, it takes a few paragraphs to figure out which names are the good guys, the bad guys, the wolf pups, and the cities.<br /><br />Like all Book One's of a fantasy series, this one ends just when you've decided you'd like to know the answers to some of the questions. I presume Book 2 (and 3 and 4) will start to resolve this Game. But I have to say, it made me want to keep reading, so I think it's done its job.

0061784788|2.0|I am an avid reader, especially of the thriller genre, and there are a handful of authors who's work I actively look forward to and seek to get my hands on as quickly as possible, even if it means buying and Advanced Reader's Copy on e-bay. For me,  James Rollins is one of those authors. In this instance, I exercised the patience to borrow it from the local library (but I got on the wait list very, very early). I was anxious to read this novel because it features great characters from past Sigma force works like Painter Crowe, Gray Pierce, Monk, Kowalski, and Seichan. Good start. However, overall, I found the story line to be rather dull. The aging Sigma crew came off as old, tired and ready for retirement. Yet, against all odds, they still managed to save the world from imminent destruction. By the end of the novel, it is clear that one of them is ready to retire, one or two of them SHOULD retire, and the operation needs \\"new blood\\" in a big way if it is to continue. The plot intermingles native american lore with secrets kept by some of America's founding fathers, most notably Thomas Jefferson, and the threat posed by so-called \\"nanotechnology\\". The author's opinion that nanotechnology has ancient roots is, to me, difficult to swallow. This conjecture was not proven to my satisfaction in \\"The Devil Colony\\". Just because we don't understand how an ancient sword was manufactured, and even if microscopic analysis of the material revealed the presence of \\"nano\\" strands of something, this does not necessarily mean that the creators of that sword understood the concept of nanotechnology. In fact, the term nanotechnology itself is nebulous. Basically, the \\"nano world\\" is the level of individual molecules. We have very few tools to observe the nano world. One is high powered electron microscopy, which can generate images of the \\"nano world\\" at its upper end--that is, molecules that are multiple nanometers in length. The other is X-ray diffraction of crystalline molecules, which can image, via electron density, atomic resolution images of molecules at a accuracy of 0.1 namometers or even slightly better. A strand of DNA is part of the nano world. And cells carry out nano reactions involving DNA all the time. So nature uses nanotechnology all the time. So how do humans use it? So far, mostly it is done by chemical rather than biological reactions. One group recently produced DNA molecules that resembled a \\"smiley face\\". Eventually, molecular polymers may revolutionalize computer science, body armor, and other things mentioned by Rollins. But at present, this science is in its infancy, and no one understands its potential. What is totally off the wall in \\"The Devil Colony\\" is the idea that ancient people not only understood the advanced concept of nanotechnology (they didn't even know what a molecule was!), but were somehow also able to harness its potential to create a dangerous substance with the potential to destroy the world. I ask you: how could they have done this (maybe it came from an advanced alien culture?), and why? Where did the \\"nanonests\\" described in the novel originate from? This is not explained. And what was their purpose? Also not explained. There are additional scientific questions that the book raises. For instance, if these nanonests, presumably consisting of nanobots, are breaking down matter into something that resembles dust, then where are they getting the energy to do so and where is the energy that is dissipated by breaking matter into smaller (unspecified) entities dissipated? E=mc(2). When mass is destroyed, energy must be produced. One would think this energy would be liberated in the form of heat, which, according to the novel, would destroy the nanonests. So how exactly does that work? It doesn't. At least not for this reader/scientist. \\"The Devil Colony\\" is a slow read for a Rollins novel, and by the end I was skimming the pages and hoping it would all be over soon. This is a far cry from previous recent novels by the same author, which this reader/scientist found to be more scientifically plausible and more suspenseful. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed by this latest Sigma Force novel. And I think it may be time to put the Sigma Force to rest. I have focused mainly on the scientific aspects of this novel but the character development and general story line were also weaker than what I have come to expect from Rollins. This novel ended up being an unsatisfactory meld between a by now run-of-the-mill type Dan Brown decryption plot and the Michael Crichton novel \\"Prey\\". However, Crichton did a better job making the science of nanobots seem credible.nt novels by the same author, which this reader/scientist found to be more scientifically plausible and more suspenseful.

I love the idea of making this record like they did during those times when singers are real singers and composers are as passionate as they can get unlike now where everything must be in auto-tune rubbish land.<br /><br />Listening to this is like watching a great piece of cinema with a pair of ears. An auditory landscape of pure bliss.<br /><br />Critics always say Jack White can't carry a tune but he proves them wrong as evident in \\"Rome\\". Norah Jones suddenly sounds oh-so-seductive.

B0051DSAP8|5.0|I'd never heard of Powerwolf until a few weeks ago, but I haven't been this excited about a new band discovery in years.  Powerwolf boasts a gothic metal make-up and wardrobe style, black metal blasphemy (though it's played up for humor rather than genuine Satan worship), a classically-trained operatic vocalist whose delivery has the grandeur of power metal and the snarl of thrash metal, and a massive heavy metal sound chock full of organs, choirs, atmosphere, and dramatics.<br /><br />Powerwolf does not attempt to hide their musical inspirations.  Several songs feature melodies and arias lifted straight out of Catholic mass, and this liturgical melodrama mixed with bombastic metal makes for a skin-crawling audio experience.  Close your eyes and you can just imagine this band blasting through the naves of Notre Dame cathedral or Westminster Abbey.  Attila Dorn's vocals are monstrous and avoid the pitfall of many power metal vocalists to remain at a constant stratospheric range.  He doesn't hit falsetto notes, but his voice soars over the music and fills the sonic space like an orchestra.  Speaking of orchestra, the bonus edition of this album has a companion CD featuring classical reinterpretations of Powerwolf songs by a Russian filmscore composer.  Epic beyond imagination.<br /><br />The lyrical content is the only weak point in my opinion, but that's just a matter of taste.  With music this massive, I would expect the lyrics to be about end of days battles between angels and demons and whatnot, rather than goth-punk poetry about creative ways to die and werewolves and supernatural creepiness.  But this has been Powerwolf's modus operandi since their creation, so they can rock out however they want.<br /><br />Simply put, theological differences aside, Powerwolf would be the result if the Pope commissioned a metal band to make the most reverent, majestic, worshipful metal music ever created.  Not necessarily the most technical or complex entry into the power metal catalogue, but certainly original and the most fun I've had listening to a metal album in years.catalogue, but certainly original and the most fun I've had listening to a metal album in years.

B003UESJEM|3.0|At first, I nearly turned it off. There was no way I was watching a thinly-veiled story about rich executives bitching and whining about not making their boat payments, even if those rich executives were played by actors I always enjoy, like Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones. But I gave it a chance, and at a certain point the worm turned and the film became more of an enjoyable window into the true lives of these characters, rather than just a parable about the recent economic crisis in this country. Definitely a 'bootstraps' kind of story, but not overly heavy-handed, and by no means does everybody come out on top in the end. Ben Affleck, who continues, for some reason, to get flack for performances he's long outpaced, does a fine job as a genuinely unpleasant guy who's facing a brutal reality which reaches beyond the wound to his own pride.

The author didn't make me want to care about anyone in the story (perhaps his intent); the characters simply were not developed; the story didn't grab me in and I should have quit reading after the first chapter.  I feel I wasted my time when I could have been reading something more satisfying.<br /><br />Frankly, I was bored and was looking forward to \\"the end.\\"  Perhaps it's a man thing.

0553801473|1.0|A \\"trilogy\\" in seven or more (potentially) volumes, several thousand pages, and nothing really happens.  We waited how many years for this \\"conclusion\\"???  I have lost all faith in Mr. Martin and in his ability to actually end a story.  The final pages of this book leave us with almost every interesting character either standing in a field, or half-way to a desired destination, wondering what comes next, or (even worse) suddenly killed without warning.  There is very little actual plot advancement from the end of Book Four.<br /><br />The Bible required only 2 \\"Testaments\\" to cover a great deal of material.  War and Peace managed to be complete in ONE volume.  Many, many great authors have created satisfying masterworks in Trilogies..  Originally planned to be a trilogy, this series was (apologetically) expanded to 4 volumes.. which still didn't reach a conclusion.  Then there were FIVE volumes, with a promised \\"conclusion\\" that didn't happen.  Now there are chapters of a SIXTH volume making their appearance, with hints that a SEVENTH volume may be necessary.  Where does it end?  How many years?  Will Brian Sanderson be asked to complete this series when another five volumes eventually seem to be required. and Mr. Martin has retired at the age of 150?  Will my great grandchildren still be alive when the final page is completed?  Will the TV series run even longer than \\"The Simpsons\\"???  Give us a break, Mr. Martin!<br /><br />It seems far easier to create a bunch of interesting characters than to know what to do with them.  There are far too many characters in this series for anyone to expect the author to track them all the way to their ultimate goals, so Mr Martin solves the situation by many, many sudden deaths.  Still, it would have been pleasant to see the main characters eventually achieve some kind of goal.  Even two of the three dragons vanish from the storyline shortly after being introduced.<br /><br />The one star is for creating interesting characters.  Sorry that they are all, after all these years, left dangling or (at least temporarily) dead.Sorry that they are all, after all these years, left dangling or (at least temporarily) dead.

Riggs' mastery of prose is evident, each sentence like a delicious sip that lingers to be enjoyed slowly. The photographs add whimsy, and though they make the book unique, they are almost unnecessary in that Riggs' descriptions of the children and the landscape are so intensely well-developed.

So even if you don't really need six cores right now, you will later.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|While I was generally familiar with the story of this young girl prior to watching the movie, I just knew the basics - young surfer who had her arm bitten off by a shark, she made a recovery, and was surfing again.  I didn't know she was a competitive surfer who made a truly miraculous comeback and was back on an international competitive circuit.  I was very impressed with this movie for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />One thing I will point out is when we watched this, we had an age range of 9 years old to 71 watching it - this is truly a great family movie which is pretty hard to find these days.  Be prepared to tear up several times in the movie as well as feel a burst of pride as Bethany goes through her recovery.<br /><br />The family leans hard on their faith in God to get them through this struggle - most movies with this type of theme fail because you feel as if the faith aspect is being put in front of the tale of the movie.  Not so in this case, but it is a refreshing thing for me to see - I believe God does have a plan and Bethany learns the plan is not for her to be a #1 ranked surfer, but for her to be an example to others worldwide for those with disabilities to overcome.<br /><br />The acting was very good in this one, with Helen Hunt providing her usual outstanding job, Dennis Quaid continuing his kind of goofy but still a role model characterization, and Carrie Underwood doing a believable job of a youth / missions leader.  I've never really noticed Anna Sophia Robb until this movie - she is an up and coming actress who should be in leading roles for years to come.
B004TWOXIU|5.0|La Tosca, a play written by the French playwright Sardou, was Produced in Paris in 1887. In 1889 Puccini saw the play,which he liked. Eventually, it became the opera we know. The original play had five acts and 23 characters. Puccini's opera has nine characters and is in three acts. He was only interested in the interaction between Scarpia,Tosca and Cavaradossi. The opera is set in June 1800,the time of the battle at Marengo, where Napoleon defeated the Austrian forces. The Libretto was written by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica. The two worked as a team and were responsible for La Boheme, Tosca and Madame Butterfly. Illica made the prose sketch of the work and Giacosa then versified and polished it,with Puccini's input. Tosca's premiere  was in 1900 in Rome.    This version of Tosca sounds and looks like a play with singing and music. Set in the Period of 1800,the staging and costumes which are stunning are traditional. The centre piece is of the head ,shoulders and hand with a sword of Emperor Constantine,who first made Christianity a state religion.The symbolism shows the power of the Church and the state. In the Church service  the monks carry the cross and so forth.Cannons are used. I hope your neighbours are tolerant. In the second act, Scarpias desk is shown. The third act we are on the roof of the prison. This opera is staged in the huge open air arena at Verona,with what I call traditional minimalism sets. The orchestra and chorus of the Arena of Verona are conducted by Daniel Oren, passionate and fast tempo when required. Fiorenza Cedolins who is a singer actress, brings out the human character of Tosca,as opposed to the usual over the top rendition of the part.  Marcelo Alvarez is Cavaradossi. Scarpia sung by Ruggero Raimondi, is not the usual evil  police chief, but subtle,charming,sly,and ruthless. What is amazing is that all three are believable. On such a huge stage and theatre,this opera seems intimate. Usually it doesnt. Probably, because Raimondiand Cedolins are Italian, this makes a difference. All the parts fit the whole and works. As I stated it seems like a play, not a opera. The blu ray is amazing,probably one of my best. Worldwide.

I consistently schedule an annual physical due to high cholesterol in the past.  I am 55 and have never taken any of the statin drugs. At this point, I don't think I will need to for several years if not ever.  My total cholesterol went from 213 down to 187 within 7 months of changing my diet.

B001UV4XHY|2.0|The video quality of this DVD is appalling -- dark backgrounds often show very distracting rectangular blocking with an attendant lack of detail.  It does seem that the poor quality is probably a marketing attempt to drive sales to the Blu-Ray version -- the preceding movie in the Harry Potter series had far less difference in quality between the DVD and the Blu-Ray versions.    In support of the \\"marketing caused it\\" theory, although the Deathly Hallows Part 1 DVD is a dual-layer disk, only a modest amount of the additional dual layer disk capacity is actually used -- using more of the available capacity would certainly have allowed better quality video.
B005AUWY90|5.0|I see that there are a lot of negative reviews, and this movie has only a 3 star overall rating. I really can't understand that, because I felt like this movie really lived up to legacy put in place by the original Cars, and all other Disney-Pixar movies. The most likely reason for a low rating is because this movie is in very few ways similar to the the original. The first one tugged at the ol' heart strings; it was a very sentimental movie. This one takes a totally different turn, with intense action sequences and a globe trotting race tournament. The plot of the first movie was really simple, the second has many unexpected twists. You have the return of the main characters from the first movie, and a handful of new cars make their debut as well. Voice acting stupendous, which is to be expected from a Pixar movie. Overall, this is a great, high-octane adventure that you definitely won't want to miss.

0553801473|2.0|Well, I finished the latest book in the Game of Thrones series, A Dance with Dragons, and it seemed as though George RR Martin was just trying to tread water to ensure that he has the 7 books he has promised.  He started to bog down in the last book, A Feast for Crows, but this new one was even worse!  The characters we were invested in, like Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, Arya and Bran Stark, their plot lines were bogged down and purposeless.  There are several others, but I mentioned the ones that aggravated me the most.<br /><br />Further, the story lines about Cersei and Daenerys were hardly satisfying, minor happenings stretched on for much too long, and their believability was strained.  Cersei shamed?  Dany unable to control her dragons?  Married to an idiot?  In love with a sellsword?  And the new prince, whose identity is dodgy at best, why on earth do we need him?  I can't believe that, by book 5, we don't have enough characters, especially in this series.  These books are full of entire clans and countries that are pointlessly included.  We get it, there are a lot of families, a lot of countries, a lot of alliances and betrayals.  The apparently never-ending changes in loyalties are tiresome.  \\"Words are wind.\\"  \\"Dark wings, dark words.\\"  \\"Winter is coming\\",  and may actually be here.  Dead dull!  Is there no outline for this series, no cohesive flow of characters from beginning to end?<br /><br />I am so disappointed because I expected more books like the first three, but these last two books are just plain tedious.  I am especially bummed out that I paid $14.99 for the Kindle version, first day.  Hell, I can get Dickens and Shakespeare for free.  At least they're worth reading.

The sound is reminiscent of the Drama album, but with definite classic Yes flavor. I highly recommend it for any true Yes fan.

1439116881|5.0|Heartbreaking, sad and insightful look at the progression Alzheimer's.<br /><br />It started with small things, forgetting words in the middle of a speech, forgetting where she lived when she went running in her own neighborhood and misplacing things, but it didn't occur to 50-year-old Dr. Alice Howland that a professor of psychology at Harvard was facing anything worse than the problems all women face with the advent of menopause. She was wrong, so very wrong.<br /><br />The worst part for Alice of being diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease was telling her family and continuing to teach as long as possible. At the end of the year, Alice had no idea just how much the rapid onset of the disease had affected her teaching and her family. Alice's husband John, a professor of biology at Harvard, wanted a quick answer, a magic bullet to fix things, but there was none.<br /><br />As the disease progresses, Alice's life falls apart and there was no way to know who will still be around when Alice no longer recognizes those nearest and dearest to her.<br /><br />Tackling a subject like Alzheimer's, especially early onset Alzheimer's disease, in a fictional novel is a monumental task that Lisa Genova accomplishes with poignant results. Still Alice is a powerful story of the breakdown of an intelligent mind and the repercussions the course of the disease has on her career, marriage, and family. Genova never lets the story sag and doesn't resort to literary sleight-of-hand or emotional blackmail to make her point.<br /><br />Reading the slow loss of Alice's mind is fascinating and terrible, magical and heartbreaking, but above all, it is moving. Alice's family responds with denial, selfishness, anger and sadness and no one comes through unscathed, and yet their responses are very human. However, Still Alice is honest and the Alice's story is mesmerizing, full of terrible beauty. There are no easy answers and Genova doesn't give them, instead relying on remarkable insight into a deteriorating mind and plain truth to share Alice's tale.n truth to share Alice's tale.

I usually don't write reviews, but this album is so terrible and boring that I just had to help people avoid it. If I could give negative stars I would. Do not waste your time people. If you want something that truly rocks and is creative and imaginitive take your chances on Glassjaw's 'Our Color Green' or 'Diamond Eyes' by Deftones.

0307272702|5.0|This book is very helpful to understand the biology behind getting fat and the main cause of it (insulin spikes caused by a carb-rich diets). What a great paradigm breaker to understand that people does not get fat because of all the overeating and sedentary lives. The author makes a great case explaining that, at the contrary, getting fat is a hormone driven process triggered by our fat regulatory biology (after being altered by our consumption of hi-carb diets) which in turn, lead us to overeating and sedentarism.<br /><br />Though the author makes a good case explaining why exercising does not have an effect for fat-loss AFTER the fat regulatory system has been totally altered by the effect of high-carb diets, I believe the he should have devoted at least a section about the positive effects of excercise for a person that is following a low carb diet and has normal fasting blood glucose levels (or simply that his/her fat regulatory system is working as nature intends).<br /><br />Other than the comment addressed above, I highly recommend this book for those interested in the topic.

During the Blue Moon Festival, an evil but wacky wizard named Gargamel chases Papa, Clumsy, Brainy, Grouchy, Gutsy, and Smurfette into a vortex and transports them to New York City. (It's a classic fish-out-of-water story) They seek refuge with Patrick and Grace Winslow, a couple who are expecting a baby. The Smurfs drive Patrick crazy and almost cost him his job. They try to bring the vortex back before Gargamel captures them. This is definitely a movie I would see again and again. I highly recommend THE SMURFS!!!
0307454541|2.0|After muddling through this book, the only logical explanation for its insane popularity is its captivating title, and perhaps the tragic untimely death of the author. The latter makes the book hard to criticize, but it's also not a reason in itself to recommend it.  The fact is that \\"Dragon\\" is poorly paced, tedious to read, and the \\"mystery\\" appears to be nothing more than window-dressing for the author's not-so-subtle political agenda.  (I also dislike movies like Syriana and The Constant Gardener for that very reason.)  And it's shabby window-dressing at best.  For example (***SPOILER ALERT***), one of the keys to solving the central mystery happens to be a cryptic series of names and numbers found in the missing girl's diary.  Larsson's hero, Mikael Blomkvist, spends months (and a good part of the book) trying to decode it, only to have his daughter -- who had not yet appeared in the book and would not appear after -- parachute unannounced into the tiny island where he is staying, notice the scrap of paper with the coded message on it, and figure it out in five seconds.  Then she's gone.  I nearly stopped reading the book right there it was so ridiculous.  There are other points in the plot that are just as laughable, and the \\"solution\\" to the murder mystery will make you shake your head in disgust at how much time you've wasted.<br /><br />The writing itself is several steps below the Da Vinci Code, which will never win any awards for prose style but at least Dan Brown keeps it moving.  Lisbeth Salander is an interesting character (and the reason for two stars rather than one star) and you keep wishing that the novel was more about her, rather than the 20 percent that is.  Blomkvist himself is boring as hell.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. Mixing the Western and Sci-fi genre was a smart idea. It had good action, and interesting characters. Daniel Craig stars as a mysterious man named Jake Lonergan who has no idea what happened to him or why he has a metal bracelet on his arm. After running into Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde, the town is attacked by aliens and take their kin. The survivors decide to track the aliens down and save their loved ones, or die trying. If you want a different style of Sci-fi/Western, you'll love COWBOYS & ALIENS!!!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Good story, tugs at the heart strings, just as good as any Satoshi Kon movie, you sould watch them all.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Over two months later and I'm still loving this album.  From Marry The Night to The Edge of Glory, it was/is a necessary and wonderful evolution of Gaga's sound yet this time around she sounds more impassioned than ever.  If you haven't listened to it LOUD while driving down a highway, you haven't heard it right!  Bring on the tour!
B0000DI7UR|5.0|This disc is part 2 of 2 Elements Discs by Stratovarius. They are both Classic-sounding Strato. albums but they have many differences. The most obvious difference is that this is more of a straight-forward approach; The symphonic arrangements aren't as prominent as they were on Part 1. Now that being said, the songs rival the amazingness of part 1. If the choir and orchestral arrangements were the strength and primary feature of Part 1, then the guitar work and musicianship is the strength and primary feature of this one. This is the last album that people call a classic Strato. album.    The music of the album:    Alpha and Omega- Not the best start to an album, but a good song. It's a slower hypnotizing rock song. They haven't started off slow since Kiss of Judas on Visions and even that was faster! It also starts with the ocean sounds that A Drop in the Ocean ended with on Pt. 1.    I Walk to My Own Song- This is the \\"Hunting High and Low\\" or \\"Eagleheart\\" of the album. In other words, the catchy song that becomes a single. It isn't the best choice off this album for a single but decent. I like it a lot tho.    I'm Still Alive- My fave of the album. I like the catchy chorus of it (Most of their choruses are extremely catchy if you are new to this band). But the song is solid and the one I think would've been a better single.    Seasons of Faith's Perfection- A ballad, but a very good ballad. I think it may drag on just a bit, but I don't mind, it's a good song.    Awaken the Giant- This song is like Soul of a Vagabond from Pt. 1. I like it; it's got a good beat, great drums at the beginning, but Soul of a Vagabond is a much better song.    Know the Difference- A fast song like I'm Still Alive and Learning to Fly off Pt. 1. Of the 4 fast songs on both Elements albums, this is my least favorite. With Learning to Fly being the best followed by I'm Still Alive and then Find Your Own Voice. It's not bad, it's just not as good as the other faster ones.    Luminous- Theone song on this album I don't like. It's not bad, but it's just too slow and mellow and doesn't go anywhere.    Dreamweaver- Another slow rocker. Of the Slow Rockers on both Elements, this is 3rd best behind Soul of a Vagabond and Elements. Great chorus tho. I read somewhere that Tolkki sings backing in the chorus but I can't really tell.    Liberty- Another ballad. But this is the best ballad on both Elements albums. I also think this is the best ending they've had to an album (Except for Elysium...That is their best album ending EVER!)    Verdict- If you qualify for any of the following: Love Stratovarius, Love Power Metal, Have Elements Pt 1, Like Neo-Classical Metal, Like Timo Tolkki, or Think the radio sucks nowadays, then you should buy this album.    Now if You love the radio, think that metal is lame, stumbled upon this page by accident, or just don't like music, then Don't get this album because you wouldn't like it anyway...unless you are open to see what the radio rejects, what metal can be, and think that this accident of veiwing this page wasn't coincidence, then scroll up, and click the Buy button...

B004MC8CA2|1.0|Thank you for helping promote and encourage further the scourge of hymanity known as Christianity. It&apos;s too bad this religion wasn&apos;t done away with before the digital age, now we&apos;ll never get rid of it.
B00407PNY2|4.0|Being a native San Franciscian and growing up in the 60's, this will always be my favorite cop movie because it was filmed in my home town.  The movie was based on a book call \\"Mute Witness\\".  Steve Mc Queen plays a cool and groovy unconventional cop, there is only one scene where he actually wears a tie and overcoat looking like an official Police Inspector, all other scenes show him in a turtle neck.  Car chase scene is a classic and if you have a big screen television monitor, your stomach will rock when they go flying down hills.  If you know the streets of San Francisco, the chase route does not make sense- but it is still cool anyways.

0553593714|5.0|I picked up this book \\"A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire\\" because of the hype. So many books that are made into movies and mini series are all hype and no hope. To my great surprise this book has sucked me in and kept me glued to the pages. The writer has made me care about the characters and intrigued me with the plot. I hope book 2 does not leave me wanting.

0439023521|5.0|A real page turner, that is for sure.  This was both an exciting and unique book.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characters (you will fall in love with Rue and find Katniss refreshingly vulnerable and yet strong). I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a bit of adventure.  Although I will put in a warning... some of the violence can be a bit graphic (but it's a story essentially about gladiator games, so what can you expect?).
0812550706|5.0|I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about this book.  This is science fiction, this is one of the first books that really drew me into this genre.  Before this I was always a fantasy reader, but that has greatly changed since reading Ender's Game.  This book started off a year for me where all I wanted to digest was this universe.  I read all of the books in the Ender series and the Shadow series and since this book Orson Scott Card has become one of my favorite authors.  If I was going to recommend a book to someone new to the genre this would be one of them.
B003PGNBO8|1.0|ABC doesn't care about you.  It only cares about money.  To them there is no such thing as a satisfied customer.  That's why they make shows that don't end but yet still sell them.  Greed.    Your only line of defense against unscrupulous people like this is to boycott ABC.  Don't buy anything they produce.  If everyone started boycotting ABC, then I would imagine they would have to render a more responsible account of themselves instead of cheating people.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this series.  Awesome CG for a weekly series, intelligent writing, great cast, all around awesome!    Then Fox dumped it for the O.C.  Rumor had it that one of the Fox Exec's kids were to be a regular on the O.C., and we see how long THAT series lasted.    Really enjoyed the Serenity movie as well.      I see they now have the Firefly series on blu-ray!    Also, for all you MMORPG fans, it was just announced a month or so ago that DarkCryo Entertainment, a Firefly fan-based startup, has been in development on Firefly Universe Online (fireflyuniverseonline.com) having picked up the pieces after Fox Studios & Multiverse dumped it.  They're looking for fan-based support during development which will include access to the Alpha & Beta releases.    Go check it out if you're a fan of this genre.
038533348X|3.0|Actually the three stars I am giving it are in my opinion a gift. I am assuming it is supposed to be satire but is too outlandish to take seriously and not funny enough or outrageous enough to be good satire. Overall it was mildly amusing but I was expecting much more based on all the great reviews.It is too lightweight to be put in the category of great books it is rated alongside!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Being new to the Amazon Kindle arena (I currently publish Raven c.s. McCracken's books under the imprint Swooping Grizzly Publications), I picked up John Locke's book to check out how he managed to do what no one had managed to do before: sell 1 million+ of  self-published fiction on Amazon Kindle eBook format.<br /><br />I've found it's always a great idea to learn from those who've done what you wish to do. John Locke's track record definitely puts him in that category for me. And his book does not disappoint. It's true that some of the methods he's recommending have been out there for awhile - he admits it himself.  But he's using them in a way that really drives home the \\"customer service\\" aspect of the writing business, something that gets left behind in this day and age of \\"sell, sell, sell.\\"  He also makes wonderful points regarding competing with established, \\"bestselling\\" authors given the new eBook model that's taking over the industry. He's helped me see quite a bit of the whole process in a new light.<br /><br />If you write or if you publish books, and want a nice, quick read that's to the point, well-written and well-thought out and will help you in your marketing efforts, then you should pick up John Locke's book and add it to your reference library.

0857680986|5.0|What a great book.  I read somewhere this book is the ultimate authority on figure drawing.  I was intrigued so I bought it, since I need to learn how to draw people.<br /><br />When I got the package, I was already expecting \\"the ultimate authority\\" in terms of content.  I was definitely not disappointed, but more so, the book blew me away!  Andrew Loomis was absolutely amazing!  The book teaches you everything you need to draw people, including skeletal structure and muscles!  Well written, too.<br /><br />The only thing this book does not focus on enough is the face and hands, but there's another book devoted to that by Loomis.  I'm still waiting for that one to be released... somewhere in October 2011, if I remember correctly.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!

B000JIHP88|4.0|This mobile is awesome! There is no motor noise and the different movements really capture my son's attention. He loves watching it for over the 20 minutes it plays, and I usually turn it on again for another 20 minutes before he drifts off to sleep. (and can do so without fully entering the room with the remote!) The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because my husband had to rig it with a couple of zip ties to keep it on the crib (not recommended of course)since it has a screw back and was not compatable with our crib.
0142418471|5.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is the story of two boys, both named Will Grayson, and their struggle to learn to love others and themselves.  John Green and David Levithan each created a character and then had them meet- incidentally at porn shop that neither one was supposed to be at.  This chance encounter brings out different aspects of their personalities as their friends interact and as they compare themselves to each other.<br /><br />The \\"first\\" Will Grayson is a quiet boy with a very loud, very openly gay, very huge best friend named Tiny.  Tiny is a giant football player who falls in and out of love several times each week, and he's working on a musical about his life called Tiny Dancer.  Tiny is the GSA president, and another member, Jane (who at first may be part of the gay or the straight side of the alliance, Will isn't sure), turns out to have awesome taste in music, be very smart, and totally cute to Will.  Can Will discover his place in this group of friends?  Will needs Tiny, but does Tiny need Will?<br /><br />The \\"second\\" Will Grayson is a guy struggling to live with major depression.  Will lives with his mom, who loves him dearly, but clearly has her own problems as well.  He has few friends, none close, except for an online friend named Isaac.  Isaac and Will talk online every night, and they hope to one day meet.  Finally, Will plans to travel to meet Isaac...<br /><br />I had a hard time getting into this book, but once I got past the first 50 pages, I loved it.  This is an excellent LGBT book about teens, but it's really just a book about LOVE.  Love between parents and kids, love between friends, love between boys and girls, and love between boys and boys.  What is love?  How do you know you are in love?  What will you do for someone who loves you?  Can you make someone love you?<br /><br />While this book deals with the painful topic of major depression, both Wills are humorous which keeps this from being a depressing read.  There is a dark tone to it, but the use of music lightens things up periodically. The \\"first\\" Will Grayson and his friends are into punk/indie music, and they go to a couple of shows and talk about their favorite songs.  A sub-plot of the book is Tiny's production of his musical, including some lyrics, that are super funny while expressing issues and questions surrounding his sexuality and his desire for love (example: a baseball scene with the song \\"What's Second Base for a Gay Man?\\").<br /><br />Bottom line: GREAT read.  I'd highly recommend it to all high school students as well as anyone who likes diverse romance books or books about friendship.  I can't wait to read other books by Green and Levithan.<br /><br />I checked this book out of my local library.lightens things up periodically.

B0006J28L4|3.0|Spike Lee, this movie's director, faithfully rendered Malcolm X's renunciation of racism after he returned from his Haj; but Spike himself made a movie that says \\"White people are evil.\\" Is this irony, artistic license, self-promotion, or something less laudable?<br /><br />Politics aside, this movie has high production values, the acting is good and the story is faithful. Is it entertaining? Ummmm, I think reading the actual book was more interesting.
B00338QENI|5.0|There are so many facets to this book-all are interesting, many disturbing and others heart-warming.  Foremost it reveals that everyone in the scientific research business does not have noble goals.

I didn't have to install nothing exept for the aios driver so I could use it with adobe audition 3 which is great. I get professional studio sound from this mic its just crystal clear. I don't have the pop filter yet so when I get that I know I'll love it more. Get this Mic if you need a good mic but have little money to spend on one this will do the job.
0553801473|4.0|Its a good read.  If you haven't already, read the previous books in the series before you read this one.  If you don't you will be totally lost.  Lots and lots of characters to keep up with although many do die along the way.  Bottom line I looked forward to my daily reading of this book and look forward to the next one....
B00466HN6S|1.0|This movie is good only for those who dream of becoming the Easter bunny. I am so sorry I wasted 95 minutes with it. What a lame, unimaginative, just plain awful story! It has absolutely no depth. None of the characters is at least a bit interesting. It seems that James Marsden will accept any stupid role as long as he gets paid for it. That's too bad. And David Hasselhoff? Anyone who wants to make a good movie will not have him in it. I would've given this piece of junk negative stars if I could.
B004GYY714|5.0|Amazing application. Finally a real reason to give up Satellite radio. Loads fast, lots of options for many different genres.
B004XANKVO|5.0|If you are looking for a superior quality backpack for carrying your laptop or iPad, then you need to look no further. While this may be pricey, when it comes to protection for your equipment, you could not do better. I love the built-in compartments for carrying accessories and even a cell phone. It has enough room that I can fit keys and my wallet, so I don't need to take a purse unless I want to. The material is nice and incredibly strong, and the padding is more than adequate for protecting your equipment. The only thing I rated 4 stars (instead of 5), was on stylishness, but, that is only because a backpack is well, a backpack, and not exactly the most fashion forward carryall I have used! But, please, do not let that discourage you from purchasing this product if that is what you need. The carrying straps are extremely comfortable, too. Just a great quality product that I highly recommend.
0811875040|5.0|I purchased the only copy of this beautiful book today at a local shop.  I spent the evening enjoying the beautiful photos and yummy recipes.  I was so delighted with my purchase that I went on line to purchase additional copies for friends.  I was terribly disappointed to learn that the book was filled with errors.  I emailed Meg Ray to ask about a replacement book.  I was surprised to receive an immediate response.  Meg is as lovely as her book. She is disappointed with the mistakes, but said it has given her a chance to have conversation with many customers which has been enormously gratifying. She continued by saying \\"when life gives you lemons make lemonade.\\" What a great attitude!  She took steps to have my book replaced by the publisher when the reprint is available.    I appreciate Meg's immediate response and her help. Until I receive my \\"perfect\\" copy I will use the book along with the update sheet provided by the publisher, to make delicious treats for friends and family.
B000PC0SPU|4.0|If you're into a little light psychology and how to \\"hack\\" your mind to become more effective and marketable, this is a pretty good place to start. I found the exercises in each chapter very useful.<br /><br />There we're a few too many reference to \\"right-brain\\" for my tastes, but it didn't overly distract from the message.<br /><br />There is not much overlap between this book and \\"Drive\\" so don't worry about it being a rehash of the same material.

0743298039|5.0|I could review this book in one sentence: This is one messed-up family, but its a family that makes for an enchanting story.<br /><br />This is a book that reads like a fairy tale. Bookshop assistant and minor biographer Margaret Lea is summoned by dying writer Vida Winter to write the latter's life story. Winter has lived and secretive and reclusive life, and Margaret will be the first to get a look at her past. What she finds when she arrived is a story of abuse, abandonment, and twins helplessly devoted to one another. In the course of writing Winter's life story, Margaret will be forced to confront a tragedy in her own past.<br /><br />I was fully enthralled and engrossed in this book. Once I started I read at every spare moment until I was finished. This is a novel full of gothic atmosphere and mystery. I must say that I found Vida Winter's story far more engaging than Margaret's. Margaret struck me as a fairly annoying individual. Luckily she is mostly a foil for the story of Vida, her family, and her childhood home.
030746363X|3.0|Haven't read the entire book yet but eating beans/vegetables/protein and nothing more is extremely boring.  I've only been on the diet for two weeks and have lost a couple of pounds.

B0051CSIL0|5.0|I'm not a huge horror fan and tend to like movies that have a unique story and great acting performances, as it turns out Stake Land is all that and more. It's hard to believe that they refer to this as a low budget movie since it is more appealing in many ways that some big budget films can only hope to be. Stake Land blends a unique story, brilliant acting, stunning visuals and a dramatic soundtrack to create a truly thrilling film. I was glad that I decided to purchase the 2 DVD edition which includes the very interesting character prequels. All the wonderful things I had heard about this movie encouraged my purchase and it was even better than I expected. My hope is that a sequel might be in the works.
B004LR5K0I|5.0|I was a little hesitant to order this as it was an import.  However, the quality is very good.  The CD's are a little difficult to remove from the case, but that probably just needs a little practice.  The sound was good, and I like the songs.  A great addition to my Elvis collection.
B005F2BHGE|4.0|Assassination Games opens with a demonstration of the smooth proficiency of hitman Vincent Brazil (Jean-Claude Van Damme) as he attacks with his primary weapons of choice - anything with a blade. The tone of the movie is then set for the dealings of those in this dark business and the cold, callous exteriors these professional killers display. But they are human after all, so expect to find that they do have a heart thought it may generally stay deeply buried.    Roland Flint (Scott Adkins) prefers to make his hits with his considerable arsensal of firearms. Brazil and Flint are brought together when they each go after the same target but for very different reasons. Soon they become the targets for hits and forge a necessary but uncomfortable union. Can they or should they trust each other? Hitmen like to work alone.    Van Damme and up-and-comer Adkins deliver a few good fight scenes but emphasis is on their weapons and their relationship as they take on mobsters and dirty government officials. While the plot is not unique, Assassination Games has moments when it stands solidly on it's on feet. A very good supporting cast elevates this to a movie that has been shown in limited theatrical release and lands high on the heap of strait to DVD action films. If action is what you're after plus a few grisly surprises, Assassination Games will not disappoint.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have to agree that Jane Eyre is very difficult to condense into a two-hour movie, but Cary Fukunaga's adaption was amazing.  Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were outstanding.  In fact, I really think Fassbender was the best Rochester yet, very believable in the role.      IMO, a book is almost always better than the movie and movie adaptations usually fall very short.  In this instance, however, Fukunaga, Wasikowska and Fassbender came together and pulled off an excellent piece of entertainment.  I think Ms. Bronte would have approved.  I know I did.

4770031246|5.0|This book is what everyone outside of Japan has been waiting for. I have tried many of the books that are already out, and found them to be a waste of money. Her methods and ingrediants are right on for the USA markets. I would say the only issue I have with this books is that most of the meals I have made take much longer than she suggests and I now start the night before.
0307946711|5.0|The writing is consummate, clever, quirky, but never gimmicky.    I've noted that some reveiwers have deducted stars because they found Dexter Mayhew to be quite the despicable cad. Irresponsible, unethical, unprincipled; yet charming and quite likeable nevertheless.     As if they could punish Dexter by giving the book a poor review.     When, afterall, it is a testament to the quality and power of the writing that the reader cares enough about the characters to feel that strongly about them.
B005FOQDC0|4.0|This is 199.00 on the Lego site, massive mark up here. As for the set itself its the biggest Technic set ever. Took me about 7 hours taking my time. Not really anything new as far as Technic sets go but I really enjoyed the build.
B0012GMVXU|4.0|I was a little nervous upon initial listen that this album was \\"too 80's\\" sounding. It's my first Leonard Cohen album that I decided to purchase after hearing Tower of Song for the first time. Jazz Police is still a little too exotic for me personally, but the rest of the songs display the song writing prowess of Cohen I had heard about, but hadn't yet been exposed to. Tower of Song is an amazing track, and I also love Everybody Knows. The album would be worth it for those two songs alone.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|Different for Yes and i do like it. Lots of reply on the title song. Quite a few other songs that keep one focused on the whole cd. As always, great messages from the worlds greatest prog rock band. I certainly miss Jon and Rick, but this is now and this is Yes. I am glad they put this cd out. Yes is not just a band, but also a place and mindset. Positive Affirmation= YES
B003W5C0VW|5.0|There is no getting around it, the Rolling Stones golden years were 1969 - 1974, when Mick Taylor was arond.  This concert from the 1972 American tour, shows why the Stones were so hot back then.  Never mind Keith Richards derisive remarks on Mick Taylor's playing after he left, the Stones never did sound as good, post-Taylor.     Gimme Shelter also is memorable for the excerpts of the Stones 1969 tour, and I am frustrated a full DVD has not been released of the Get Your Ya Ya's Out album (Madison Square Garden performance on that tour).   Ladies & Gentlemen is the only full concert of the Stones with Mick Taylor, and it's the Stones at their best, so don't miss it!
B001AQWC2C|4.0|Nostradamus, the ambitious double disc concept album by Judas Priest was released in 2008 and saw the band in new territory.<br /><br />The vast majority of music on Nostradamus is new for Priest, mixing long keyboard buildups and atmospheric moments full of story exposition with their usual heavy metal sound. Rob Halford even brakes out some Italian vocals at one point.<br /><br />Nostradamus is certainly impressive for all its ambition and atmosphere, although it is something of a grower as when you get right down to it, the ratio of stand up rockers in the overall album is relatively low. It may take a good few listens for the full effect of the record to click with you (even just to absorb all of the music as there is so much of it) and if you are impatient you could easily just dismiss this record as boring and samey.<br /><br />Standout tracks include `Pestilence & Plague,' `Prophecy,' `Conquest,' and `Persecution,' all of which represent the most metal moments on the record.<br /><br />Overall, Nostradamus is not an easy listen and is not for everyone; it lasts almost and hour and three quarters, is full of choirs and keyboards and new vocal styles from Rob himself. If you are patient however, there is a very good record to be found.

B00138CUN8|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears album came out in 1991, it was his six full length studio outing as a solo artist and Osbourne entered the 1990s in spectacular fashion. This was the second album to feature guitarist Zack Wylde, following the excellent No Rest For The Wicked album.<br /><br />No More Tears was a smash hit multi-platinum album that found Osbourne and his band in ambitious new territory, modernizing their sound with some strong turn of the decade hard rock influences and some songwriting help from the legendary Lemmy. Zack Wylde even managed to add a little southern rock influences into the overall sound in the odd place here and there.<br /><br />The vast majority of music on No More Tears is pretty much faultless, mixing atmospheric ballads with bouncy and heavy rock numbers full of Zack's amazing guitar flourishes, creating a superb heavy metal sound.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the incredibly catchy `S.I.N,' as well as `Desire,' and the famous `Mama I'm Comin Home,' all of which are some of Ozzy's finest ever compositions.<br /><br />The album isn't just a few good tracks and a bunch of filler however as No More Tears is consistent of quality throughout, arguably one of Ozzy's most solid records to date. On top of all this; the production is pretty much perfect, Ozzy is at the top of his game in terms of vocals and the band are all on top form.<br /><br />Overall, No More Tears is one of Ozzy's best albums and an absolute must own for fans. If you have any interest in Ozzy you should check it out.
159514188X|2.0|Jay Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why is exactly the kind of book teenagers don't need in their lives.  It's the psychological fantasy \\"If I kill myself, they'll be so sorry!\\" brought to life. I started the book with high hopes; my daughter had recommended it. There is no question that it's a gripping tale--I won't argue with that. The problem is that the main character Hannah--the girl who commits suicide--apparently does so as a way to punish other people, yet she is rational enough not only to create a fairly lengthy diatribe against a bunch of her peers but also to find a way to make that diatribe very public. Yes, some of them need to feel ashamed of themselves; some of them need to be incarcerated, for that matter.  Hannah takes the easy way out, though, in the long run, which I found offensive, if not downright maudlin.    I guess one of the things that most bothered me about the book was Hannah's decision to leave the teacher/counselor with apparently the biggest burden of guilt for her choice to commit suicide. From the outset, I assumed he had done something quite awful; her taped instructions were that, as the last recipient on the list, he could take her confession with him \\"to hell.\\" Later she mentions in passing that this tape might cause someone to \\"lose a job.\\" Since the teacher's the only one with an actual job, I pieced together that she must be talking about him.  So I read on, figuring he'd abused her, insulted her, berated her. . .something.  Instead, we find only that he tries to listen to her, and doesn't chase her down when she runs from his office after seeking his advice a grand total of one time.    This does nothing if not glorify suicide as a viable way out, a way of getting revenge on those who have wronged you.  I don't recommend it.

1463514581|4.0|What an addictive read! I loved it, especially Rose. The best thing about this book is the mystery; it kept me turning the pages until the very end because I still hadn't figured it out. What an end, too. I never would have guessed.<br /><br />Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is very well-written. Rose develops as a character (she grows a spine!) throughout the story, and the relationship between her and Joe keep the tension crackling. Denise Grover Swank is one hell of a writer and I can't wait for the next Rose Gardner mystery and what this author cooks up.
B000XUAEUS|5.0|I enjoyed Brazzaville Beach and thought of Boyd as a good writer. Any Human Heart, however, puts Boyd in a whole new league. The technique of creating a fictional, but realistically flawed diary for the mail character is unusually well done. I read this in two long days of travel, but reread many paragraphs to admire the technical skill of the writing. Not only is the diary realistic, the life portrayed is both fascinating and surprisingly normal. This may make my top ten list in a lifetime of compulsive reading.
0300169787|5.0|I got this book for my birthday, and I have been completely enamored with it the past three months. I saw the exhibition last monday when I was in NYC and it was phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. I think the photos in the book are incredible quality, and the pictures from some of his earlier collections are so hard to find that it's amazing that we can see some of them. It's a shame that it didnt have everything in the museum but then people wouldn't be going to the show, so it's okay. It really is an amazing book that even if it were produced without the met, it would stand perfectly on it's own. The interview of Sarah Burton by Tim Blanks was brilliant and informative. I give this book 10/5 stars, and I give the exhibition 100/5 stars.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Blade Runner: The Final Cut [Blu-ray] is a top-notch movie transfer from the masters to Blu-ray, as I can not see any artifacts or grain except in extremely rare places in this movie. I want to say I can also see some \\"problems\\" at the beginning in the opening sequence with all the special effects in Los Angeles' futuristic landscape, but the detail is so amazing and the transfer so crisp, that I was hard-pressed to find anything wrong with it. All colors, lines, detail and special effects were pretty much immaculate and very crisp. No annoying blocky dark patches, no fuzzy effects overlaid over the film's original background, nothing. Like I said: I was really trying hard to see any visual problems and I think I just \\"convinced\\" myself I could see some in very few places.<br /><br />Whew! The Final Cut is finally here, and I have to say, of all the versions I've seen, this is my favorite. I have owned this movie on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray, and I am completely amazed at how good this movie looks on the Blu-ray transfer.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get it. I get tired of all the various versions that keep coming out for movies (and I just see it as a money-making excuse for the production companies to cash-in on a movie, rather than provide anything substantial for fans; yeah, I know, I'm cynical that way).<br /><br />But, I'm a huge Harrison Ford fan...Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Hunt for Red October, Regarding Henry...he's made a lot, but those are my favorites...and I had to have Blade Runner on Blu-ray.  I've not seen the other Blu-ray versions, so I can't really comment on their qualities, but I have to say this version of the movie is my favorite. It had been awhile since I'd seen it, and this Blu-ray version and transfer are proud members of my collection now.<br /><br />You want a review of the movie? It's good. Not great, but it's good. It's a dark and brooding glimpse of the underbelly of the future, although I can't see (and hope it doesn't) look like this in the future, 8 years from now. Harrison Ford's job is to terminate (\\"retire\\") synthetic human-looking robots that are too human and have been deemed illegal on Earth. Rutger Hauer is in true form as the deranged, psychopathic leader of the replicants that come back to Earth to meet their creator face-to-face and demand that they be given a chance to LIVE! They've been preprogrammed and hardwired for a 4 year lifespan, and they don't like it. Harrison Ford finds himself coming out of pseudo-retirement to bring down these highly dangerous, very lifelike enemies, and soon realizes he has feelings for another replicant...and things get \\"complicated\\".<br /><br />This movie is stylistically and artistically a visual treat to watch. Every scene just drips with detail and dark ambiance, whether it's the gorgeous futurerealistic cityscapes, or the dark underbelly of the city in even its rundown environs...it just has a visual style that is interesting to watch.m now.

962634427X|4.0|Northanger Abbey - Jane Austen<br />4 stars<br /><br />This was the first book that Austen wrote. She sold it; it was never published; so she bought it back when her other books became successful. Possibly she intended a rewrite. Her brother had it published after her death.<br /><br />The story concerns the teen-aged Catherine Moreland who has little experience of the world, but much experience with gothic romance novels. Austen manages to make Catherine comic in her awkwardness and excessive imagination, but lovable in her direct honesty. This book has all the satire and social commentary of Austen's later books, but other than Catherine, I felt the characters lacked depth. Although Catherine's brother has a failed love affair with one of her new friends, Austen only deals with the effect this has on Catherine's relationship with Isabella. Little is said about the brother. Nothing at all is known about Eleanor's relationship to her Viscount. That marriage is only mentioned because it allows Catherine and Henry to marry. I missed the more complex interplay of multiple characters and plot line that occur in Austen's later books, but I enjoyed Catherine's runaway imagination.<br /><br />Juliet Stevenson gives a wonderful performance of this book. Each character is captured distinctly while she adds to the atmosphere and the comedy with her animated reading.

B004WESFZW|4.0|The Adjustment Bureau (Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller)<br />Directed by George Nolfi<br />Starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Anthony Mackie<br /><br />Universal Studios   2011   106 min   Rated PG-13   Released Jun 21, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy<br />Digital copy (on disc)<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />I almost went to see The Adjustment Bureau at the theater, but generally negative reviews made me decide to wait for the Blu-ray release. The same was true of Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, also starring Matt Damon. I'm going to have to trust my instincts more because I found both movies entertaining.<br /><br />So why the negative reviews?<br /><br />What do you expect from a Matt Damon movie? His biggest role was as Jason Bourne in the hugely successful trilogy and I think he's expected to be an action hero in every role he plays. That's simply not the case. The man can act and he has a lot more to offer than some give him credit for. The marketing for The Adjustment Bureau is selling it as an action movie, but it's actually a love story with a science fiction element. The front cover shows Damon and Blunt running. They do run in the movie, but that's not the point of the story.<br /><br />This is not an action movie.<br /><br />David Norris (Damon) is running for Senate and he's losing. He meets Elise (Blunt) in a bathroom and they kiss. A brief conversation influences his concession speech and he decides to be completely honest with the assembled crowd. This is not typical behavior for a politician. The entire meeting was arranged without his knowledge just for the purpose of influencing his speech.<br /><br />We are introduced to four men in suits and hats. They look like the Men in Black. What is their origin and why and how are they trying to influence events? One has an assignment to delay Norris by making him spill coffee on his shirt, but he fails to intervene in time. As a result, Norris walks into his office and sees the men altering the memories of his colleagues. He runs, but is quickly caught. They make him promise to keep their secret. They also demand that he drops any interest in Elise as the two aren't supposed to be together.<br /><br />Norris isn't ready to give up on Elise and feels strongly attracted to her. He searches for years and eventually tracks her down. The Adjustment Bureau fails to anticipate his resourcefulness and level of determination. In order to prevent the relationship, other methods are tried to tear the two apart. Norris is given some strong reasons to walk away from Elise. Will they be enough, or will his attraction toward her prove to be too strong?<br /><br />Philip K. Dick wrote the short story on which the movie is based. He was also responsible for Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which resulted in Blade Runner being made. I'm not saying that the Adjustment Bureau is on the same level, but it's certainly a thought-provoking story worthy of your time.<br /><br />Think about fate and predestination for a moment. Do you live your life thinking that every step has been mapped out? If that were the case, why bother to do anything? Do you think that your overall destination has been decided, but it's up to you how you get there? That would at least give your actions some meaning. Or do you think that everything is random and there's no reason or purpose behind anything we do? The Adjustment Bureau raises similar questions. You might be able to predict how the movie ends, but the fun is experiencing the journey.<br /><br />Emily Blunt has good chemistry with Damon and the casting was spot on. She had to learn how to look like a ballet dancer for the part and she was utterly convincing in the role.<br /><br/>I love the Bourne movies, but I'm a fan of Damon's acting in general. It dates back to Good Will Hunting and Rounders. In fact, I've rarely seen Damon disappoint. Hereafter and The Adjustment Bureau will stay in my collection and I'm happy to own them. If you give The Adjustment Bureau a try without expecting an action movie, you might end up enjoying it as much as I did.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />While most recent releases use the MPEG-4 AVC codec, The Adjustment Bureau uses VC-1. The result isn't bad, but I've seen more striking presentations. Grain is moderately thick and detail is average. Many of the scenes have an intentional blue tint, but colors are otherwise accurate. I wouldn't complain about the picture quality, but it's far from exceptional.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a good job for the most part. Dialogue is clear, apart from in noisy settings when it's not supposed to be. When Norris is talking to the crowds of people, the atmosphere seems realistic and sounds are separated well. There are no gunshots or explosions, but the sound quality is good throughout.<br /><br />Special Features 2.5/5<br /><br />Audio Commentary by Writer/Director George Nolfi.<br /><br />Deleted and Extended Scenes (6:54)<br /><br />Labyrinth of Doors - A Google Map allowing you to explore various parts of New York. Each door offers a small feature; normally under a minute long. It's a lot of work to navigate through everything and the reward doesn't seem worth it.<br /><br />Leaping Through New York (7:36) - Showing the wide range of locations used during the shoot.<br /><br />Destined to Be (4:51) - Damon and Blunt talk about the casting process and their characters.<br /><br />Becoming Elise (7:08) - How Blunt learned how to become a dancer for the role. Acting can be hard!<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau asks some interesting questions. It's well-acted and kept my interest for the 106-minute duration. The mystery element and slow exposition have the effect of placing the viewer in the same situation as David Norris, and it works effectively. If you go in with the right expectations (not anticipating explosions and constant action), the story has a lot to offer.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5Adjustment Bureau will stay in my collection and I'm happy to own them.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|Thor was a good film with great special effects. Some parts of the film were underdeveloped at times and the earth scenes with thor less gelling and believable than when he was on Asgard. Most of Thors stay was on his home planet of Asgard and a bit on the Ice-giants planet. The acting was pretty good, the story was well executed but the love scene between Natalie Portman and Chris Helmsworth was pretty forgettable. Overall I enjoyed this film and it was fun! Cant wait to see what they do with Thor 2!

076781326X|5.0|An outstanding movie musical in every way.  This movie stands up in comparison with the greatest movie musicals of all time like the King and I. It is very hard for me to believe that this movie was made in 1968, it seems like it's from a different, better era. There is no 1960s bad politics - this is traditional Dickens where good is good, bad is bad - and the dangers and corruptions of the city are lurking near by to threaten an angelic little English orphan. The movie is perfectly cast with charming Fagin, Dodger and beautiful, angelic Nancy and:    \\"I'd do anything for her (you)\\".    Loved it.
0553801473|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  The main problem that people seem to have with it is that none of the plotlines get resolved.  I say, enjoy the ride.  There are only two more books, and soon enough, all of the plotlines will be finished and the story will be over.  For me, the end of a story is never as good as the story itself.<br /><br />In my opinion, this was the best book yet.

The book is well-organized into chapters on different book structures, binding methods, techniques for making covers etc. There is also an introductory section explaining the materials and methods needed to make a book. The instructions are pretty easy to follow and some are accompanied by diagrams. But if you're new to bookmaking and prefer illustrated step-by-step instructions, you may want to check out the book first before buying it.    Those familiar with Golden's works should take note that this is actually a compiled version of 2 previous books by the author: \\"[[ASIN:0806988258 Creating Handmade Books  (Paperback)]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1402706146 Unique Handmade Books  (Paperback)]]\\", with added comments from other bookmaking artists on their creative processes. If you don't already have those 2 books, though, this is a great buy.

B004SBQGHS|1.0|I paid because I hate ads. Now instead of little ads off to the side, the game will randomly pause and open an ad in my browser?  This is blatant false advertising, unethical and really pisses me off!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I wasn't sure if this would be a good book, but I quickly fell in love. It starts off alittle slow but once you get through that, it is truly a wonderful book. MUST READ.
B000QTCXIW|3.0|Love her music, however some of the songs on this \\"new\\" CD had too much static and not very clear. Sounds like an old 45. Came with 2 CD's. The Spanish one sounds incredible, I was pleased with that one.

B004ECFW94|5.0|Honestly, I would give this 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option. . .    My family found this DVD to be very enjoyable. Yes, me and my wife and two young girls. In fact, Live in HD is on DVD is about the only option for me with young children -- I can always pause the DVD to explain the plot and read the subtitles for them.     The sets and costumes are so good and the camera work is excellent. You often forget you're watching a live stage production instead of a movie.    Placido Domingo amazed me. That anyone can sing like that at 69 is astounding. Like another reviewer, I was not so impressed by James Morris.    Adrianne Pieczonka was very enjoyable. I didn't hear the flaws that the other reviewer did. Marcello Giordani was excellent. I really enjoyed listening to him.    Overall the acting was first rate. I believed the story as it was presented.
0061784788|3.0|James Rollins' latest book, The Devil Colony, begins with our introduction to a strange artifact and hide found in a burial mound in Colonial America. The expedition uncovering the artifacts is attacked, and a young boy is whisked out of harm's way to deliver the items to none other than the nation's third President -- but then Governor of Virginia -- Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />Thus the tale begins. As we go through the book, the author weaves in threads of religion, Native American history and legend, contemporary dangers, and, of course, the intrepid members of the Sigma Force. It is an approach to storytelling that Rollins likes to use.<br /><br />Rollins' writing is as usual, clean and clear. This is the highest praise I can bestow on this book, however. While I love a good romp through history, conspiracy, danger, and so forth, this time the plot seems strained. The recurring sub-plot of Gray Pierce's ailing father and long-suffering mother appears again, but there is little new and the prose takes on a blah-blah-blah character, like even Rollins can't find a way to make this storyline interesting. Somewhere near the middle of the book, the sub-plot disappears ... it is never developed to any degree in this book, and seems like it was included only because it was supposed to be. The event at the end of the book involving his parents seems designed to jar the storyline back to life (so to speak) in an awkward and barely credible manner.<br /><br />The religion angle, this time around, just made me roll my eyes. While there are plenty of religions on the earth full of wisdom and mystique, those that have just shown up in the last century or two just don't have the same draw as the ones with more staying power. I'm not going to say the \\"c\\" word here, but this novel's chosen religion has bordered on cult status (ok, I said it) since its beginning.  This element of the plot was just so silly, it damaged my entire ability to suspend disbelief and enjoy the story.<br /><br />It was a little jarring for me to find the Monk character going around doing things in The Devil Colony, because he was pretty much dead at the end of the last Rollins book I read (The Judas Strain). I guess he was found alive in between these 2 books. That's always kind of a cheap tactic, to me, kind of like the \\"Bobby Ewing isn't dead, it was all a dream\\" trick.<br /><br />There is lots of shooting, and explosions, all the fun stuff you want in a Rollins book, but somehow, the catastrophic threat to the world just didn't work for me this time. The storyline did this slow buildup to less than a climax that just fizzled. The main characters being saved by a body stuck in a keyhole passage in a cavern .... I just sat there thinking, \\"You're kidding right.\\"<br /><br />The book starts out with lots of promise, and all the elements you expect, but as we go along they never quite come together into a cohesive story that pulls us forward, to a climax that keeps us wondering and guessing if they will be able to resolve things. In The Devil Colony, we know they will, because we know the ultimate, ELE catastrophe isn't going to happen. The groundwork just wasn't laid down.  And having read the entire book, with deliberation, I still can't figure out why it's the \\"devil\\" colony, and how the recurring mentions of the pootsie'ev (or whatever they are) tribe figures in. The many sub-plots just never come together. Some, like Gray's parents and the religion angle, just seem to go away and mostly don't manage to work their way back into the story. It's as if the original story concept was too bland, so the author tried to crowbar in more complexity.<br /><br />The other odd thing I noticed was how here and there, Rollins just plops in some fun little Wikipedia factoid about this or that. It's as if, having done all that research, he didn't want to waste it on just himself, so just plopped it in the book. Pay attention if you choose to go ahead and read this one, and tellme you didn't find these little factoids jarring ....<br /><br />The final thing that caused some irritation was this dangling mention of the True Bloodline. Now, at first I thought we were touching on that whole offspring of Jesus thing that that *other* writer did. No. This one ties in a prominent political figure into the whole evil axis storyline ... so obvious Rollins is setting up the next Sigma Force book.<br /><br />My first Rollins book had similar elements woven together, but it was done with great enough skill to elicit a suspension of disbelief and an enjoyable ride through the entire story. This one seemed half-hearted and badly crafted. I hope it's an anomaly and that the skillful storytelling returns in the next book. Which doubtless will involve the True Bloodline, some ancient artifacts, a religion or two, and unsolved historical mysteries...

B000BTGY7I|2.0|I loved this movie, so much so that I wanted to get the \\"behind the scenes\\" 2 disc edition to learn more about how the story was written and how the movie was developed.  In my opinion this is a good example of how NOT to do a 2 disc edition.  Long on storyboarding and deleted scenes and short on \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff.  What a disappointment!  I'm keeping my single disc edition of course, but the 2 disc edition is going right back on the market.

0553801473|5.0|I'm not a huge fantasy reader but I love this series of books.  I'm not finished with A Dance with Dragons yet but it is my favorite book by far.  That says a lot because I said the same thing about A Storm of Swords.  I highly urge everybody to read this series of books.
0385342047|5.0|This was another fast read for me. Rebecca just can't seem to keep herself out of trouble! And I guess that's why she is so lovable??!!??! lol Sometimes I feel like the situations are a little far-fetched or maybe that's the intent but other than that I think this was another great installment of the series. I hope we get to skip a few, several years so we can see Baby Bloomwood as a pre-teen or teenager and then see what sort of fiascoes that causes Rebecca...
B003YFIUW8|2.0|INCLUDES SPOILERS    Room reads like a really smart exercise for a creative-writing class... the kind that was worth the effort, showed some talent but still fails to come together as a narrative and ultimately doesn't work. The narration by 5-year-old Jack quickly devolves from literary device to gimmick. Once Emma Donoghue has established and shown off his precocious nature, he becomes an obstacle to the story I think she wanted to tell.    This is a great shame, because our cultural fixation on the real-life inspirations for Jack and Ma (disappearing children, serial abuse, Elizabeth Smart, etc.) really do beg for a strong treatment of the life behind the headlines. Donoghue quietly captures the way unthinkable terror can become daily drudgery over time and, even more importantly, the way that escape from abuse and imminent danger is only the beginning of a difficult lifelong recovery.    I could have made peace with the one-dimensionality of the entire supporting cast, even as they become more important in the novel's second half. We can live with Old Nick as nothing but an amorphous evil - more plot device than character - and the blandness of Ma's parents and the clinic staff are forgivable mistakes from a generous reader.    It's impossible, however, to look past the vanilla blandness of Ma, especially post-rescue. We get only the barest glimpse of her tumultuous return to society. I suspect an advocate of the book would argue those limitations are a product of our young narrator, who has limited ways to put her behavior in context. If that was really the author's intent, it simply backs up the bedrock assertion that living entirely within Jack's mind is this story's ultimate flaw dressed up as its central feature.    Room could have been so much more successful as a short story or even a novella. At full length, however, it left me disappointed that Donoghue conceived an important idea and painted such a wonderful set and then failed to animate it with fullyrealized characters.
0810993139|4.0|Overall Review:  In Diary of a Wimpy Kid we find a classic and fantastically funny example of the foibles, follies and funnies of middle school!  We're taken on a tour de force of all the most embarrassing, frustrating, irritating and (most of all) hilarious happenings of childhood: Christmas disappointments, embarrassing school plays, hiding video games, planning out the all-important trick-or-treating route, geeky friends, bullies, wrestling units, tattling brothers, trouble with parents, substitute teachers (yikes!), trying to make the `Class Favorites' page of the yearbook, and all the other random antics inbetween!  The diary/comic strip style of writing makes the reading easy and accessible--and even funnier than it would be otherwise!  Greg, our `hero', lays out his cockeyed sense of what life is all about in a dry, no nonsense style that will keep you in stitches!  There are no great literary moments or fascinating character developments; instead, you'll find yourself chuckling as you reminisce about your own days in middle school...or perhaps you'll find a kindred spirit who knows just what you're going through!  Hilarious and true to life, Diary of a Wimpy Kid reminds us of many important things, but first and foremost is this: Don't touch The Cheese!  Overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />Content Review:<br /><br />PROFANITY: One mild instance<br /><br />VIOLENCE: A few very mild instances<br /><br />SEXUAL CONTENT: NONE<br /><br />MATURE THEMES: Mild<br /><br />RECOMMENDED AGE GROUP: 9+<br /><br />There is only one word in this novel that could be construed as profanity.  Other than that, there are a few crude references and some `little boy' humor.  There is no sexual content (although, there is one part where reference is made to a magazine owned by an older brother).  The violence consists of pushing people over in the hallways and throwing things at people.  Some of the characters write comic strips that get a little violent--such as stepping in acid puddles, moms slipping and dying (because they stepped on a crack), heads being chopped off, etc.  The themes are mostly about life in middle school, which include lying to get your way or get out of trouble, and the meaning of friendship/popularity.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a Squeaky Clean Read for ages 9+.<br /><br />This review was written by Emily<br />A Squeaky Clean Reads Book Reviewer<br /><br />To see more fantastic books reviewed with content in mind, visit us at squeakycleanreads.com!y stepped on a crack), heads being chopped off, etc.  The themes are mostly about life in middle school, which include lying to get your way or get out of trouble, and the meaning of friendship/popularity.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|This app really helped me to get started cooking. As a college student, I&apos;ve been looking for a good way to learn to prepare healthy meals without spending hours and hours looking at recipes, tracking down ingredients, and then trying to make something edible. Jamie Oliver&apos;s app comes packed with useful information and great, simple, healthy recipes that simplified the process of learning to cook.
0439023521|5.0|The synopsis of the book sounds horrific, but in Suzanne Collins' gentle hands, the violence is palatable but still heartbreaking.  I picked this book up because of the buzz about the upcoming movie and am so glad I did.  It is thrilling, tragic, and utterly fantastic.  You won't want to put it down.  Be sure to buy all three books!  You'll be desperate to start in on \\"Catching Fire\\" the second you've read the last word!

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Dragon Bound starts shortly after Pia has stolen Something from a big bad Someone, and she was gonna kick her ex's ass when she finally met up with him. The first few chapters keep the reader in the dark but were so full of tension that it really held my attention. Pia is full of secrets and mystery and she's scared to death. Not just scared of the person she stole from, but the people who forced her into the theft and she just wants to disappear. She is a capable young woman, but not a hard ass and no desire to play the tough girl role, it was an interesting combination.<br /><br />Dragos is her polar opposite. He was born with the universe and has grown and developed over the eons. He leads the Wyrs (the shape shifters of Harrison's world) and is the only known living dragon Wyr. Dragos is incredibly old, incredibly powerful, incredibly strong, incredibly rich... are you getting the picture? He can do whatever he wants, can have whatever he wants, and few would dare cross him. The fact that someone stole from him - he is briefly insane with rage but then amused and occupied with finding the thief. Having been bored for centuries the theft makes for a nice diversion.<br /><br />Harrison has created a nicely detailed world, a fun story, and the most adorable alpha male ever. Yes, there are oodles of shifter and dragon romances out there and it was occasionally predictable, but I really enjoyed Dragon Bound and I've pre-ordered the sequel. Dragon Bound is an enjoyable story that never takes itself too seriously. Harrison's world is well fleshed out without spending loads of time on the world building. Pia and Dragos were fun characters who never lost their personalities despite drastic changes in attitude.<br /><br />Featured at An Abundance of Books, read full review here - [...]
B001AW156U|5.0|Okay, let me start off by saying I hate Sony's triggers compared to the Xbox 360 triggers and this is why I bought these. I been a PS3 and Xbox 360 gamer since both consoles came out, and believe me these triggers are well worth the price. I been using them for a few hours now. Playing DiRT 3, CoD: Black Ops, Homefront, MLB 11: The Show, Fallout: New Vegas and Uncharted 2. These triggers work great with all these games, specially Black Ops, trust me. Purchase these triggers.
B004RKXN44|4.0|I'm going to keep this review short in order to stay SPOILER FREE.<br /><br />I'm not as big a fan of the Psy-Changeling series as I am of Singh's Guild Hunter series.  I've read some of the books but not all of them.  That being said, even I was excited to finally get Hawke and Sienna's story.<br /><br />I was a bit worried about how Singh would handle the story.  The biggest stumbling block being how young Sienna is, not quite 20.  So how do you have a great romance with steamy scenes and not be skeevy?  You do it the way Singh did, which was wonderfully.<br /><br />While both characters struggled with their desires and their pride (and barely contained dangerous powers in Sienna's case), they never did that ridiculous waffling that you see in so many romances.  It never seemed like they took a step back but more like they were trying to come to terms with what was happening despite their intentions.  (Though there were times I wanted to smack Hawke upside the head for being so obtuse.)  While Hawke and Sienna struggled, argued, stormed off, or slammed doors, they never closed the lines of communication.  Despite massive frustration they always managed to talk to each other.  It might take some time for the message to sink in (I'm looking' at you Hawke) but they listened to the other.  Sienna never came across as needy or childish - she's grown into a strong woman.  Hawke never seemed ridiculously overbearing, but snarling did seem to be something of a defense mechanism when he was confused about his feelings.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow handled the age difference , dangerous powers, and all the other obstacles very well.  There was danger, excitement, romance, and passion - I don't think that the Hawke and Sienna fans will be disappointed.<br /><br />Featured at an Abundance of Books, read full review here - [...]
B002UKVO3U|3.0|Unlike the newer Solid State Society(SSS), this one has a less descent voice work. I've watched the Japanese version of both movies(with Chinese subtitle). When watching the English dubbed SSS, it's as if the original Japanese voice actors are speaking English. However, in this first Ghost in the Shell(GITS) movie, the voices don't sound familiar, even the translation of the script is not quite accurate. For example, at the start of the movie, when Batou asking Major why there is a lot of noise in her brain, Major's answer in the original Japanese version is \\"Must be the menstruation thing\\". Since she's actually a cyborg, this answer has become one of the most famous quotes in the GITS series. I really don't know why in the English dubbed version it becomes \\"Must be a loose wire\\". Another obvious mistake occurs when Major shoots outside the window to kill the ambassador. In the original Japanese version, she says \\"Oh, really?\\" in response to the claim that the country of the ambassador is a \\"peace-loving democracy\\". However, in this English version, it becomes \\"Of course it is\\". Frankly when I heard this I felt a little angry.    Thus, for the core fans of the GITS series, a Japanese version with English subtitle is recommended.
0007150369|5.0|The boy from How To Catch a Star is back in Oliver Jeffers' second book, Lost and Found.  The boy discovers a penguin at his door one day.  The penguin follows him around looking sad.  Deciding that he must be lost, the boy endeavors to help the him find his way home.  He asked at the lost and found office, he asked some birds, he even asked his rubber duck - nobody seemed to know where the penguin belonged.<br /><br />Finally the boy discovers that penguins come from the South Pole.  The next challenge was getting there.  Eventually the boy and the penguin build a row boat and row for many days and nights.  After floating through seas filled with varying degrees of calm and danger the finally arrive at the South Pole.<br /><br />\\"The boy was delighted, but the penguin said nothing.  Suddenly it looked sad again as the boy helped it out of the boat.\\"<br /><br />As the boy rows home he feels strange to be alone again.  He eventually realizes that he made a big mistake - the penguin had not been lost, it had been lonely.  He begins to row back as quickly as possible, unfortunately missing that the penguin had chased after him using an umbrella as a boat.  Once back at the South Pole the boy looks everywhere but cannot find his friend.  He sadly sets off for home once more.  Ahead of him he sees something in the water and is reunited with his friend.<br /><br />\\"And so the boy and his friend went home together, talking of wonderful things all the way.\\"<br /><br />My love for Oliver Jeffers' books and illustrations cannot be verbalized, but I will try.  The story is simple, sweet, and even my 4 year olds become emotionally invested in the book.  The illustrations are spare and humorous but use beautiful colors and a water color technique that gives depth and movement to each painting.  I love the expressiveness of the characters, the ridiculousness of the boy's stick legs holding up a solid body, the wonderful lollipop trees that have square shapes overlaid, and the fantastically pudgy penguin!  Oh, how I love the penguin.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BOOK and everybody would have a copy.  Well, if you like picture books or have kids, then you should have a copy.  The watercolor illustrations and story are lovely and the penguin is so cute readers lose the power of speech and can only make squeaking sounds.

B004HD61KE|5.0|I absolutely love how James Rollins incorporates historical facts into his books that really get you thinking, \\"Could that really be what happened?\\"  I come from a Mormon background and even though I don't follow the religion I really found the explanations  to some of the questionable stories fascinating! I recommend this book if you want something that gets you questioning what you think you already know. Like all of James Rollins books, I couldn't put this one down without a million questions that I couldn't wait to find the answers to!
B004XE0P5E|2.0|He has an ear for tunes and harmony. Very emotive. But it sounds like what he has to say isn't anything special. Unfortunately, that might count more than how 'emotional' he can be.  Also, I know voice is very subjective, but I don't really get anything out of his. Layered vocals can get repetitive.  There are other artists with better ears who write more clever, interesting music, in addition to having something more genuine or significant to say.  Is he really that deep?
0756665949|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did. I listened to an interview with Tara Bennett and Paul Terry before their book was released, and they sounded very enthusiastic, very much fans of the show. It sounded like the task was in good hands. I feel bad for knocking fellow fans, but at this point I am starting to feel like this book is actually more of a negative for Lost, than a positive. Sooooo many errors inside those pages, which are well-documented on the book's entry on Lostpedia, the truly definitive (though unofficial) reference source for Lost. For those thinking about purchasing this book, I suggest you first go to Lostpedia, search for the \\"Lost Encyclopedia\\" entry, and read through all the sloppiness that somehow managed to get published.    Bennett and Terry claimed that all of the entries were vetted through Gregg Nations, who was in charge of continuity for the show, and that any lingering questions were submitted directly to show creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. I'm sorry, but considering the number of errors present in this book, I find this very hard to believe. Perhaps Bennett and Terry did run drafts of the book by the people in question, but if they did, it doesn't seem like Nations, Lindelof, or Cuse looked at the material very hard. The feeling I came away with, was that the people involved in making this book, just didn't care very much about getting it right.    Bennett and Terry also claimed that they would not be inserting their own opinions into the book, that the book would strictly adhere to information given by the show and the creators. No \\"fan-fiction.\\" Again, I find this very, very difficult to believe. In particular, if you look at the Lostpedia entry under \\"Erroneous conclusions,\\" There are a whole host of items there, which smack of bad fan-fiction written by somebody who just didn't pay sufficient attention to details of the show. The typos and grammatical errors I can forgive, but the outright misinformation is grosslyirritating to me, particularly when Lindelof and Cuse proclaim the book to be an \\"official\\" source in their foreword, thus lending an air of canonicity to stuff that is clearly wrong.    This \\"encyclopedia\\" is, frankly, an embarrassment.    Has some nice pictures, though.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|Basically the story is about Sara Mathews, a relatively normal, likable college freshman who ends up with the roommate from Hell. Sara makes friends, blends in, goes to parties, even dates a relatively normal likable guy who plays in an on campus band. The running joke is that his band can't get a gig off campus. We see so little of the bf and his band that it's hard to form an opinion as to their musical skills. Nothing much happens to Sara's new bf and that's part of the problem here That the main part of the story doesn't seem as interesting as what might have happened between Sara and her new (normal) friends. Sara's roommate, Rebecca goes to great lengths to alienate anyone that Sara has any contact with. This becomes thoroughly predictable to the audience. Sara, an aspiring fashion design major finds that a class she needs is filled. The professor suddenly showers her with praise and then invites her along on a vacation of sorts. A tape of the professor's offer gets sent to the right people just to get him in trouble. Admittedly, it seems that he had it coming. A possible subplot about a college professor romancing students and ending with deadly consequences and we fall back into the same rut with Sara and her roommates. The other characters seemed interesting sometimes, like the professor, and could have become victims in a slasher style picture or maybe more of a \\"Carrie\\" type thriller.<br />  The appeal of this kind of movie to certain audiences is that you can make fun of it while you get drunk or high to. Remember \\"Scream\\" ?<br />There are a few creepy moments as seen in the previews. Rebecca's pale complexion and blank stare look disturbing enough for Sara's friends to notice that Rebecca is almost always somewhere watching Sara and then disappears when discovered. For a moment something scary seems about to happen, but don't hold your breath.

B004LWZW24|5.0|This movie had it all and you really need to watch it in a theater or at least in a dark room with volume turned up to get full effect.  I cannot believe some people being so negative about it and saying Paranormal Activity was better.  INSIDIOUS is at least 1,000 times scarier that both of those horrible Paranormal Activity movies.  If someone does not think this movie is scary then they must love violence and blood.  There is a difference in being scary/creative/creepy opposed to just being bloody and stupid.  If you like movies like The Ring and The Others you will LOVE this movie.  If Saw and other bloody films are your interest, then don't even bother watching this creative ghost/horror movie!!!

This has the air of the Princess Bride but it's a bit more serious and much more fun. It has a wonderful story with beautiful music and the cast is just phenomenal. This is probably the best movie I've seen in a VERY long time.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This is quite simply, Sarah's, best recording... it will raise you to the heights,  break your heart, and stir up some very deep things with in you... She has done  nothing before or since to even come close to this..She must have been going thru  some deep times in her life when this recording was made, and it really shows...  If you have ever loved and lost or simply loved from the bottom of your heart,  you will be deeply touched by the music on this disc...The only sad thing is that  there is no sequel...you will be left hanging wanting more.. but you won't find it...
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As a writer myself, I have thoroughly enjoyed John Locke's series of Donovan Creed novels.  His description of Rachel in \\"A Girl Like You\\" would make a dead man smile.  And now, Locke has come out with the recipe for epublishing success.  \\"How I Sold A Million Books...\\" is a must read for anyone aspiring to make it in the new landscape of independent publishing.  I heartily recommend it!
1439153663|3.0|This was a seletion for my book club and I was disappointed.  There were too many characters and not enough depth for the characters. Was it plot driven or character driven?  The author had mixed messages and I have read better books about isolation of women and their abuse by men. I am looking forward to my book club discussion and hear the diversity of opinons.
0061537969|5.0|this book was recommended to me by friends, and it is well worth the time, it's an easy read, written from the dog's perspective.

B00005LC4B|3.0|Thirty years after J. Lee Thompson brought John D. MacDonald's dark revenge thriller to the screen, Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear pays homage to original and ads a few new odds and ends. The story stays relatively intact; Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) and his family are being stalked by a psychotic rapist named Max Cady who served a 14 year prison term. Bowden was Cady's lawyer but he surpressed the evidence of the victim having a loose sexual history. Cady is out and now seeking revenge.     I would say, overall, this is a decent film that has it's own new twists. The Bowden Family in this film is a sharp contrast to the one in the 1962 original; Sam and Leigh Bowden fight almost constantly and their daughter Danny is miserable as a result. Sam also has a close lady friend and maybe a little arrogant for his own good. Another great idea was Cady taking the opprotunity of the poor family situation to stalk the Bowden family one by one. There is a very tense scene with Danny Bowden and Cady and the film now free of the prudish censors of the 1960's, it's highly sexualized. Scorsese directs with a technical expertise that pays to homage to the old Universal thrillers of yesteryear. Unfortunately, this is not as good as it sounds.    First, the problem with making The Bowden Family so troubled is that it distracts from the plot. We have scenes that akwardly go back and forth between The Bowden's arguing and worrying about the looming threat of Max Cady. This bickering between the couple seemed more like a way to kill time. The film also seemed so desperate to promote as much sacrilege as possible from Cady. That also lead to another problem; Cady just talked too much in the film. He constantly pops out of nowhere to a make long, pretentious speeches filled with bible verses and just leaves. Again, this seemed like a lot of filler and did not advance the story. The final act is definetly when everything fell apart because it's so over the top and stupid, you'd think it was froma James Cameron film instead of a Scorsese work. We two climaxes; One at the Bowden house and then again on the Cape Fear river. The showdown at the Cape Fear river was just awful; We have Cady as superhuman mutant surviving his head being set on fire and multiple bashes to the head with a rock and all this occuring with a huge thunderstorm destroying the Bowden's house boat. What started as a good film just got worse over time.     As I said before, overall, it's a decent film but you'd be better off sticking with the original.
0061784788|5.0|Having been less than completely thrilled by [[ASIN:B001NLL0RW The Doomsday Key: A Sigma Force Novel]] the last book in this series, it's possible I had lower expectations for this one. That said I found The Devil Colony right up there with Rollins' best work.Old favorites received their required screen time. The new arrivals enough to feel fleshed out.<br />Typically it's a page turner, I read it straight through.Although I believe this will hold up as a stand alone novel, the experience is better served by having read the previous Sigma Force novels.Highly recommended.
1451629184|4.0|This book tells the story and all the details of her life (even the horrific details), it pulled me in and has stuck with me since I read it.  There were parts that weren't as interesting, but this is her life story, and not everyone's life is interesting all the time.  She also has only a 5th grade education and has missed out on normal life experiences, so I am impressed at how intelligent she has turned out to be!  Jaycee, if you are reading your reviews, you are a wonderful woman and I praise you for overcoming everything you went through!  You are amazing!  There were a few things the book left out, like how her daughters felt about the whole thing and whether or not Phillip ever hurt them.  I hope he spared them from that.  The was the reason for the 4 out of 5 stars.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What a place to live-Plant Earth! This video series is the best. The videographers did such an amazing job filming these different segments. Oh what an adventure they were on while doing this. A lot of the filming angles give you the perspective of being right there. Such an wonderful experience in seeing the animals, the land, and the earth in this upclose and personal way. I have watched some of the segments more than once because they are so informative and beautiful. I highly recommend this video.

0316017930|5.0|It's always a treat when Malcolm Gladwell brings out a new book. I read them like fiction - quite quickly - which is unusual but is a testament to how he's able to create excitement and narrative from facts and stats.     It was an important book for me because it confirmed some of the suspicions I've always had regarding potential, genius, talent and so forth. He argues that to a great degree it is created by circumstance and environment but backs this up with illustrations from real lives. It is really a wonderful read and I cannot recommend this highly enough.
0312199066|5.0|I definitly recommand that book. Very easy to read, from a veteran astronaut yet a very modest man, with plenty of humoristic anecdotes. However, the reader completely shares the thrill evocated by Eugen Cernan when he describes his space missions, including for example his painful extra-vehicular spacewalk with Gemini 9.... As a summary that book is a must for every space exploration fanatic.
1594744769|5.0|Jacobs lives an ordinary life with an ordinary family in an ordinary town. The only excitement he has are the stories his beloved Grandfather Portman tells him about his youth growing up in an orphanage after escaping the Nazis in his native Poland.  Unlike other orphanages, this one was magical: the sun always shone, the other children had fantastic powers, and they were all lovingly looked after by a wise bird. Most importantly, his grandfather, and the other children, were safe on the island from the monsters who hunted them. Jacob believes his grandfather's stories with all his heart, but as he grows up he begins to wonder the truthfulness behind his tales. All of the old photographs his grandfather showed him, of children levitating, hoisting enormous boulders, and making fire in their hands, start to look fake and Jacob, and the rest of his family, begin to doubt the aging man's sanity. After his grandfather is brutally murdered, however, Jacob is convinced there was some truth behind his stories of monsters lurking in the shadows hunting the children, especially since Jacob believes he saw the very monster that killed his grandfather. In order to uncover the mystery behind his grandfather's death, and restore his own sanity, Jacob and his father travel to a remote island off the coast of Wales, the location of the peculiar orphanage.<br /><br />At times touching, horrifying, mysterious and always interesting, Ransom Riggs begins a very promising series with this page-turning novel. Almost as important as the text are the vintage photos scattered throughout the book. Riggs makes sure to point out that these are actual photographs collected over the years by various enthusiasts, and their appeal adds enormously to the story. Many of the characters introduced in the story are illustrated in the photos, helping to set the mood for what is actually a very interesting and original story. Jacob is a compelling protagonist, particularly because of the sweet relationship he has with his late grandfather. As he uncovers more about his grandfather's past, and his own future, the reader begins to genuinely care about Jacob and the other children under the care of the mysterious Miss Peregrine. The novel is always full of twists and turns that keep the reader on their toes, closing with a cliffhanger that leaves a great deal of anticipation for the second installment. Although the date of the sequel's release has not been announced yet, Fox Studios has already won the movie rights for what is certain to be a very successful franchise for Riggs. An exciting beginning to a wonderful series.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and am so excited that it seems to be getting quite popular. I think Riggs does a fantastic job of writing a very compelling story that can be enjoyed by teens and adults alike. The vintage photos are great, and I really fell in love with the world Riggs created. I can't wait for the sequel, and the movie version!<br /><br />Like my review?

Attempting to do nearly anything like undo or info or help (all features that appear to be necessary for reasonable play) resulted in a nag prompt to buy things on what _appears_ to be a micropay plan with a different charge for each upgrade..    No thanks.  Looked fun, but crippleware this badly crippled, also infested with ads AND nagware after every few minutes means I will just give it a miss. Uninstalled.    TlDr: cripplenag-adspammer-micropay greedware not worth wading through to play game.
B00144VBBS|5.0|As usual, my Amazon purchase was hassle free.  I purchased this for a friend, and I assume she likes the CD since she asked me to buy it for her.  Price was definitely right, and it only took a minute to complete the transaction.  Thanks again Amazon.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|You know, after reading 5 books - some thousands of pages - it would be nice to see somebody accomplish something.  Perhaps, dare I say it, even succeed at their plan?  Let me make the obvious comparison: after 3 books, Frodo threw the ring in the fires of Mt. Doom.  How cool was that?<br /><br />Basically, this series has fallen into the seemly inescapable trap that fantasy series have a way of doing.  That is, after a couple of books there are way too many characters and story lines, no goals are met, and endless ink is generated describing silly details like clothes and food.  (I almost expected Rand al'Thor to show up at some point in this book)<br /><br />So...I guess what I'm saying is that I hope you are reading this review before you start the series.  The first couple of books are great.  But you will eventually be disappointed.
0375701427|2.0|There was a time when I would rather cut off my left arm than not complete a book once started. However the passage of years has cast time more savory than a bottle of rare and expensive wine and more precious than gold so when a book fails to deliver after giving it a fair accounting back on the book shelf it goes. American Pastoral is one those books. There are a number of adjectives that could describe the experience but one will do - boring. Inadequate development of and unbelievable characters, no driving plot (even books that are based on character development versus raging action have a plot that moves forward with the characters, this one gets stalled), far too much time spent on gloves, redundancy and repetition :) makes this book one for the shelves. Don't know how it got the Pulitzer. I read The Human Stain which is similar in some regards but is a much better novel. For a novel with plot and fine characterization read The Story of Edgar Sawtelle by D Wroblewski (his debut) or Empire Falls by Russo.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Most fun I&apos;ve had killing zombies. Some level of difficulty and very responsive. Wish it was the full game that is offered in other platforms.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game, looks great on my Droid 3, but randomly gives me a loading screen during some levels, and it isn&apos;t a specific level, but totally random. I haven&apos;t had any other issues except that I can&apos;t seem to get credit for a couple achievements, like Blind Faith for one, even though I completed it numerous times. Overall, though, the game rocks!!
B004UOE7VA|5.0|Since the Tron: Legacy soundtrack became one of my favorites I had to listen to the remixes. They don't exceed the originals by Daft Punk but are still worth listening to. My favorite has to be \\"Derezzed\\" mixed by The Glitch Mob. It's good enough to be on the soundtrack and in the movie. I do like the rest of the songs and enjoy all of them. This album is worth buying and you won't be disappointed.
0062060554|2.0|I went in to this book thinking it was going to have a nice pace and a shocking, suspenseful ending.  Not the case.  Far too repetitive (think Waiting For Godot only stretched out over days upon days), literally nothing happens until the last 40 pages of the 350 page book and there was no subtlety around the 'clues' planted by the author.  It read like a Mystery Novel For Dummies.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I actually listened to the soundtrack before I saw the movie and it definitely exceeded my expectations. This has to be one of the best soundtracks  I have ever listened to, definitely my favorite. I actually liked the soundtrack more than I liked the movie.  Daft Punk really made me proud on this one. I could honestly listen to this everyday and unfold a new layer, it never gets old.  This is a soundtrack worth buying and I would definitely recommend it. I am disappointed that the bonus tracks are extremely hard to get (if you want them all) because they are definitely worth listening to also. Seriously, there is no bad song on this album and it will exceed your expectations, buy it!
0316069353|4.0|I guess the streak of great books by Michael Connelly had to end sometime. After the last several books just owned me, demanding my undivided time and attention, the latest legal thriller by Connelly was kind of a disappointment for me. I don't mean to say it was a terrible book or not worth the time. It just wasn't up the standard his last few books have set.<br /><br />But the good thing about Connelly is he's so prolific that within six months we'll have a new novel to read and hopefully get that streak going again.<br /><br />\\"The Fifth Witness\\" opens with Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller falling on hard times. He's focused his legal tactics on representing homeowners facing foreclosure. When one of his clients, Lisa Trammel, is accused of killing one of the men at the bank trying to foreclose on her home, Mickey steps up to defend her.<br /><br />What Mickey doesn't know is that he's stumbled into something potentially larger than one woman's fight to save her home. As the story unfolds, we get bits and pieces of what this could be, all culminating in one monumental court scene that gives the book its title.<br /><br />On the private side, we see Mickey continue to engage in the on-again, off-again dance of whether or not he'll get back together with his first wife, Maggie.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"The Fifth Witness\\" feels like it's doing a lot of heavy lifting to get Haller from a low point in his life to the life-changing decision he makes in the novel's final pages. (It's heavily foreshadowed throughout the book, but I won't ruin it here). Connelly's clearly got an idea of where he can take this series in future installments and I'm along for the ride as far as he wants to take it. But it still doesn't help make this novel feel quite as compelling or as compulsively readable as his last few.<br /><br />Again, it's not a bad book. It's an entertaining legal thriller with some nice character moments thrown in as well. Connelly even gets in a joke about the casting of Haller in the big-screen version of the first novel in this series.st novel in this series.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I have now read this book twice, but have been struggling to put into words why I read it, and even more why I read it again.  Every time I try to figure out what to write the main idea that comes to mind is that this book is crazy messed up, but in the most perfect way.  I gave this book 4 stars when it probably deserves 5 because of the ending.  The last chapter and the epilogue, for me, were too much.  I understand for this book the ending is perfect, and it is exactly the type of ending readers want, but it was too much for me.  See, Abby Abernathy had a horrible home life.  Dad was a gambler in with the mob and mom was a raging drunk.  The only family Abby had was her best friend America.  The two of them set out on a new kind of adventure, college.  Abby decides college is a place where she can escape her past and start a new, but she takes it to extremes.  She decides to be goody-to-shoes Abby instead of Vegas Abby.  This worked until she met her match in Travis Maddox.  Travis is exactly what she wanted to avoid in her new life, a tattoo covered, ultimate fighting, womanizer.  And for some reason Abby has captured his special attention. He starts flirting with her, giving her a pet name Pigeon, and trying his hardest to show her that he can be boyfriend material.  Abby tries her hardest not to fall for Travis, but the strength in how he loves her is too much for her to avoid. They go back and forth in this love/hate tit-for-tat through out the book.  I guess that is the part that I loved the most.  They would go one minute making out in the middle of a history class to a scratch-down, drag-out fight.  The craziest part and the most addicting was how they needed each other like a drug.  And when I say need, I mean NEED!  They didn't just love each other, they needed each other to remain in tact.  I don't want to go into any more details because I truly want you to read the book, but understand that I agree with Abby's roommate that this relationship was dangerous.<br /><br />There are many twists and turns in this book that make it so exciting and something you will struggle to put down.  You may even be like me and have the urge to read it all over again.<br /><br />~Kiki (From Kiki& Jules Reviews)rous.<br /><br />There are many twists and turns in this book that make it so exciting and something you will struggle to put down.

B0033H7VI6|4.0|Not to large, not to small. Chops well, batons great. Comes out of box razor sharp and maintains that edge well. Carving chores are not as easy as with a smaller knife, but not impossible either. Takes a bit of getting used to. Grip is not uncomfortable, but feels a bit strange. This could be because I have small hands and the finger grips are not quite right for me. Balance is good and feels good and solid in your hand. Sheath is good quality, the front pocket is not large but holds a wet stone, ferro rod and a small set of folding pliers. I would recommend this as a good woods knife.
0553801481|5.0|Robin Hobb's Rain Wilds books create a rich, wonderful world. Fool's Errand is the seventh book in the series, but it is also Book One of the Tawny Man trilogy.<br /><br />One of the great things about this series is that each of the Rain Wilds trilogies stands on its own. If you haven't ready any of Robin Hobb's books, Fool's Errand is actually a great place to start.<br /><br />The Rain Wilds is one of my favorite \\"worlds\\" - I go back and read all of the books over & over. Definitely worth getting them all in hardback, so they will survive years of reading!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|First and foremost it works well.  Running an I7-2600K full bore (einstein@home) with the stock cooler I was getting temperatures on the individual cores between 94-96C. (98 is max).  With this cooler they are running 68-72C.<br /><br />It took some research because the package does not list 1155 surface mount (only 1156) but it is on their website and it does work.<br /><br />I agree whole heartedly with the suggestion to watch the YouTube video CM uploaded.  I didn't understand from the instructions and the bag of parts how to do it.<br /><br />I had to remove the motherboard to install it and compared to the Intel stock fan of put it on and press down the connectors it's not easy to install.  It is also HUGE so be sure your case has the room.<br /><br />Bottom line if you need better cooling this device works great and is a bargain.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones is one of my top five TV shows ever, and I've been watching TV for over half a century.<br /><br />I love being able to buy entire seasons of the show on DVD, and this particular season has great packaging, sturdy for many years of viewing, and also extended versions of episodes that were cut for broadcast, usually due to length.<br /><br />Great show, great product!
0545259088|5.0|Love. It's the word that keeps echoing in my mind since I finished Forever. I loved reading the series' conclusion, but I couldn't help but feel a little sad at the same time. I was hesitant to start it both because I had read mixed reviews, and I just didn't want the series to be over. I should never have feared because Forever was fantastic. I took my time with it, and savored every word. Yes, savored.<br /><br />Forever picks up the spring after [[ASIN:B003NHRGSQ Linger]] ends. Honestly, I felt a little lost in the beginning and ended up flipping through Linger to remind myself of what happened. I kind of wished I had re-read Linger beforehand but once I had Forever in my hands that wasn't going to happen!<br /><br />I was happy to be back in the world of Sam and Grace... I really like them as a couple; they're solid, loving, and supportive of each other. There are so many great Sam and Grace moments in Forever - fans will not be disappointed! Forever, like Linger, is written in the perspectives of Sam, Grace, Cole, and Isabel. While I liked the addition of Cole and Isabel in Linger, I wasn't really sure how I felt about them as characters. I loved them in Forever! I really enjoyed getting to know them both better, and seeing the softer side of Cole.<br /><br />I am such a huge fan of Maggie Stiefvater; she is easily one of my favorite authors. I simply love the lyrical way she writes. I find it amazing how she can capture a moment or an emotion and put it into words - often in a way that surprises me. I found myself re-reading passages just to soak them in, to ponder her words, and savor them. I liked how Forever started at a leisured pace, and slowly picked up as the story went along.<br /><br />I thought Forever was a great ending to the series. I will miss The Wolves of Mercy Falls!
0545123283|5.0|Why I read this: I really enjoyed Shiver and I was happy to get my hands on an ARC of this for a short while - long enough to read it! :)<br /><br />Plot: I'm not going to reveal much (promise), but I was surprised to see two more points of view written into the story. Isabel is the sister of the boy who turned wolf and knows about the world surrounding the wolves. Cole, is a new werewolf who can relate to Isabel in a way that I can't quite describe. Is this a budding romance or just a way to distract Isabel from all the sorrow she has had to deal with in the past year. And then Sam and Grace are doing well, only Grace keeps getting sick and she doesn't want to worry anyone - as per usual - and let's just say that things get a little scary at times.<br /><br />I have to admit, it was hard to get into the book at first, but by the last 100 pages I was fully engaged and loving the story line. Definitely a series I will own and cherish.<br /><br />Characters: It was hard to like Isabel and Cole, both of them being sort of unfriendly characters. As a girl, Cole was appealing because he was so much the bad boy of the book. Isabel gets less annoying as the book goes on and we start to see a little more into her personality and past all the issues she has.<br /><br />Sam and Grace are themselves - they just fit so well and it's not at all that on and off annoying romance that you get annoyed with in this genre. It's refreshing and more mature than their ages call for.<br /><br />Relatability: If you've fallen in love or dealt with difficult parents, you can relate to this book. If not, you've at least read something similar or know someone in these types of situations. Definitely a great young adult read.<br /><br />Cover Commentary: I just love it. It's so different and it's nice to have a theme carried throughout the books cover-wise.

B001EC3JME|5.0|The holster works just like it is supposed to. Holds all thickness of flashlights as long as it is not too thin for it's smallest fit and not too large for it's largest fit. You can use it on different lights eliminating the need for multiple holsters, unless like me you like like each light to have it's own, but none the less this one is great for all your lights. Very durable even though it has the plastic, yet strong, belt clip. I have snagged the holster on corners, rails, and what not yanking it lose and it has not broken. I have purchased many Nite Ize holsters for lights, phones, and tools and have not been disappointed with any of them. Nite Ize is a great company making great products and they have a friendly costumer service department so if for any reason you do have an issue with their products they will make things right.
1439102724|4.0|The book was absolutely wonderful! I saw her at Mount Holyoke College, doing a reading presentation before an audience, and seeing Ellen Wilber sing some of the songs that are on the CD really helped bring the book to life. When I began reading it, I knew what to expect. A debate on gay rights. But what I got out of it was so much more than that. It is a book about humans and how humans tend to be CRUEL to one another simply because they don't understand the other person. It is a book that shows how people CAN be of the same gender and show equal or more powerful love towards each other than a straight couple sometimes can, and that love trumps hate every time.   Now, I will say that Exodus International isn't as extreme as the book makes it out to be. I know this because I used to be a member of the organization. They don't attack people as this book illustrates, and they CERTAINLY don't insult people or threaten them. Exodus is for people who go there voluntarily, and even though I no longer believe in God and support gay rights, I see nothing wrong with what Exodus does. THAT is the true nature of being tolerant. Not picking and choosing what I can be tolerant of...  Besides that one aspect to the book (Which, if it were written a little more accurately, would have earned this book a full 5 stars) the rest of it is absolutely amazing. Buy it, you won't regret it!
B004TTZHBK|5.0|this app is so polished and well made and informative that it is a crime it is on sale. this app goes over every aspect of cooking even showing you have to use knives correctly which is really nice for beginners.
B00005JKG9|4.0|This movie was interesting.  The movie was based on a play and I didn't know this when I bought the movie.  The story was very much like a play by using a good hard twist, long scenes in a single location with characters coming and going.  The characters were constantly one on on and the dialogue seemed to be more play-like, if that makes sense.  Also the way the time line works, how it is very linear and reveals the ending are very typical to a play.  The movie really gets you in the heads of these characters in a distant way.  I don't want to say much more as it may give too much away.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie.  I would have loved to have seen more Alec baldwin, but his character is very memorable in the movie.<br /><br />It is hard to describe, the movie was good but watched very much so like a play (which makes sense because it was based off of a play).<br /><br />I would say if you are into drama and liked Wall Street (the movie is about salesman) this movie for sure is for you.  Not for your average movie goer, in my opinion.

0393061434|5.0|Woz tells the story of his whole life with such candor and believability.  You get to know him based on his stories and the way tells them (From the heart).  I can honestly say I have a good feeling for who he is as a person, after reading his book.<br /><br />This is the guy behind Apple, he is the genius behind the Apple and the Apple II.  These products were the first that set the trend for Apple's easy-to-use, customer friendly products.  Without him, there is no Apple.  Period.<br /><br />Woz doesn't gossip much about Jobs, he does talk about their friendship and business dealings.  Woz really stepped back more or less after the Apple II.  He truly believed that creating personal computers was an art as much a science.  Having taken a digital electronics course, I have some appreciation for what his skills were and he is an incredible man.  He had some serious talent for sure.  He talks about his whole life, his dealings with Apple are only a part of that.  Much of his previous work certainly built up to that and you can see him build up to it.  His life story is awesome, this book is a page turner and easy to read.<br /><br />If you like Apple, autobiographies, little bit of counter-culture, electronics or genuine guy you will love this book.
B000002L9M|5.0|I don't think Depeche Mode could follow up Some Great Reward any better. This has to be one of the best albums I've ever heard. So dark, so emotional, so beautiful. Black Celebration was what intrigued me to get the cd, but that was just the first song. A Question of Lust, Sometimes, It Doesn't Matter Two, A Question of Time, Stripped, Here Is the House, World Full of Nothing, and New Dress. Not any better way to end the album then New Dress. (And of course But Not Tonight tagged on to the end on the CD version) I can't say enough about this album, wish Depeche Mode was still this good.
0393324818|5.0|This book is a great narrative about \\"Moneyball\\" the concept and those behind it.  The book details Billy Beane and his rise to become the A's GM, and the GM of Moneyball.  It also speaks about his relationship with his employee, JP Ricciardi.<br /><br />The story is fantastic about how this poorly funded team.  These two guys could run a team that competed with (but never truly beat) the Big Teams - like the Yankees.  The book is written as a narrative (story), but does a great job going over the logic of moneyball, without over complication.  If you are a fan of baseball, this book is the basis for a lot of the theory in modern day baseball and statistics.  Moneyball is what gave statistics in baseball a whole new meaning and revolution.<br /><br />JP Riccardi had a shot and unsuccessful run as the Blue Jays GM  My friend said it best, \\"The A's never won a championship using moneyball.\\"<br /><br />If you are a fan of baseball, this is a must read.  Aside from learning a lot this is a great narrative, that is a good length.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I was a little bit of a Lady Gaga fan before this album, but still wanted to get born this way when it came out. Someone on here said it sounded like bands from the 80's, including the Pet Shop Boys. (My favorite band) Every track on here was incredible, from beginning to end. Singles like Born This Way and Judas, club songs like Government Hooker and Scheibe, classic rock like You and I, and everything else. This is already in the top 10 albums all time list for me, maybe even TOP FIVE.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Anyone who claims they know anything about film needs to have seen and know the importance of this movie.  Orson Welles understood how to use the medium of Film so well, in respect to everything that goes into making a movie.<br /><br />He would put the camera in places never before imagined, he would cut into the stage to get low shots, he understood depth of field and panning through those depths and countless other techniques that made great use of visual story telling.  On top of that, he understood story from a Theatrical/dramatic point of view.  Welles understood the medium of film from A to Z, top to bottom, inside and out, period and he shows it in this movie.<br /><br />Not to be brief, but this movie still not only holds but is still a great piece.  The story still resonates with us today, as it is a strong story based in good characters.  If you like movies, you should see this one for sure!
B003Y5H574|5.0|My mom and I went to see this movie.  We both like Steve Carell.  I was not sure the type of movie this would be.  I could have been like 40 year old virgin and had sexual things through out, or it could have been a romantic type movie like Dan in real life.  Luckily it was like the second.  In the movie Carells character is shocked to hear his wife wants a divorce.  In fact, it is all he can think about.  He goes to a club and talks about it day after day.  This is what catches the eye of a man who has no trouble getting ladies.  The mans name is Jacob.  He sees carells character moping and realizes he needs help.  So, he goes over to him and they become friends.  He tells him what he has to do in order to get more woman.  Be then just to sleep with, he wants to help him.  While this is going on, Carells son is in love with a girl who man be in love with his dad, while at the same time the man who is teaching Carells character how to play women may be about to fall in love with someone Carells character is close to!<br /><br />The movie was great.  It told you just enough about the characters for you to care what happened.  You wanted Carells character to be happy, but you probably will not be sure if you would rather him be with other women or his wife.  The story is kind of 60/40.  60% is about Carells character trying to figure out what love really is and means to him and the other 40% has to do with another girl and Jacob who is played by Ryan Gosling.  As I said earlier, the movie could have went on the sexual humor track and had things through out talking about sex and showing the men having sex.  But, as luck would have it they stayed away from that type of story.  This movie will make you laugh, feel sad and make you care about the characters.  Also, there are some romantic movies that try to make you feel sorry for or like one of the people in the couple more than the other.  I didn't feel that in this movie.  While Carell and his wife are apart, you never feel like either one really likes it.  You get the feeling that they themselves are wondering if it is the right thing to do.  One or both of them may at times be with other people.  But, they just seem numb after.  Also, the end of the movie is great because it may leave a question as to wither or not Carells character and his wife like, hate or still love one another.  I am so happy this was a great movie.  I look forward to adding it to my collection when it comes out on blu ray!like either one really likes it.  You get the feeling that they themselves are wondering if it is the right thing to do.

6305692572|5.0|This movie depicts a family's struggle when Meg Ryan's character tries to triumph over the grip of alcoholism. I saw this film for the first time on the Oprah Winfrey Network recently & was pleasently surprised.   Ryan & Garcia's acting is superb, joined with the well-written, realistic points of the movie make it what it is.   Watch this movie. You won't be disappointed!
0312600844|4.0|Dear Meegan,<br /><br />I've just finished reading Freedom by Jonathan Franzen and I wanted to write my thoughts down before they flew away like the birds Walter tries so valiantly and hopelessly to protect. And, I fear, I will not be anywhere so eloquent as Franzen in this writing. This is a very eloquent book. That drove me crazy at times.<br /><br />I've already told you how the voice of Patty, as the narrator, doesn't really distinguish itself from the voice of Franzen, the narrator, and this was a chief culprit in making me crazy. As was the length and depth of the book. And all of the telling where a little more of the just showing might have gone a long ways. If I'd shown some of the sentences Franzen produced to my writing group, as though I had written them, I can just imagine the long awkward silences that would follow as they attempted to formulate the feedback that I was telling and not showing.<br /><br />So there's that.<br /><br />In spite of it, it was an interesting choice, one I wonder might have been inspired by the ghost of Franzen's suicided friend, David Foster Wallace. I wonder. (Is suicided a word? I guess now it is passing for one.)<br /><br />Here's what I liked best, though: the characters really got under my skin. Espescially Patty and Richard. So terribly flawed and interesting. What bad choices they made. And it left me wondering again about the title. Freedom. Is anyone in the novel really free? Are any of us. Trapped by the families we're born into, the predetermined dynamics and politics of it all, then trapped again by our choices and finally (and I wonder if this is the big message of the book, if there is a big message, anyway, it's the one I got) how trapped we are by our connections to one another, the love that bonds us even in spite of ourselves and our stupid mistakes.<br /><br />That's my projection anyway. I recommend the book. Not as good, still, as The Correction, but very good and the best novel I've read since Olive Kitteridge.<br /><br />This is too long. Steal any good stuff (if there is any) for your book group.<br /><br />Much love,<br /><br />Miketuff (if there is any) for your book group.    Much love,    Mike
B004DLPXAO|5.0|awesome app for reading practically any book that you could ever need. Use it on the DROID X and it functions flawlessly. You can boost the text to a ridiculous size, the only thing that i wish I could do is make it just ONE size smaller. Definitely not knocking a star off for that though!

0780626494|2.0|I purchased this as a gift for Father's Day, happy that I had FINALLY found a widescreen copy of \\"Blast From The Past.\\" Under 'Format' it says (among other things) \\"Anamorphic . . . Widescreen, Full Screen.\\" Given how old this was, I took that to mean it was perhaps a double sided disk for each version, or perhaps they skimped on extras to put both versions on one side or something. Under 'Aspect Ratio' it also says \\"2.35:1\\" which is a fairly common widescreen format. However, the disk that I received was only Full Screen.<br /><br />Upon contacting the seller, they couldn't even tell me whether it was a mistake on their end (ie they sent the wrong version) or if it was a mis-listing on Amazon. They wouldn't even tell me if there was a widescreen version available. The best I got out of them was \\"Return the item, and if the proper version is available we will resend it. Otherwise you will get a refund.\\" Is it so hard to reply with, \\"We're sorry, we don't carry a widescreen version, we can refund your money if you return the item,\\" or \\"We're sorry, return the product and we will promptly send you a widescreen version\\"?<br /><br />Not knowing how much time it would take for them to send it back, and because I didn't know if they would send one back or just refund me, I just kept the movie for a Father's Day gift. But I'm a little peeved that this sort of mistake happened in the first place. Given how hard it was to find a supposed widescreen copy in the first place, I'm wondering if they even released this in widescreen. Regardless, there's no excuse for this being listed wrong (which, at the moment, despite my protests to both Amazon AND the seller, it's STILL listed wrong).<br /><br />If you don't mind the full screen version, then by all means get it. But It's a little irritating to buy this for somebody who only owns widescreen TV's.<br /><br />FYI, both me and my dad LOVE this movie, the movie itself would receive 5 stars if that is all that I were reviewing. Butas Amazon puts it, I'm reviewing my 'purchase,' not just the 'product.' The product was great, the purchase was not. And it's because of how much I love the movie itself that I put up 2 stars instead of 1.

B000001DVD|4.0|I cant even listen to anything past Pyromania because its all commercial BS after that.  This album smokes, man!  Another Hit and Run may be my favorite on this one.  I avoid the overplayed Bringin on the Heartbreak because its just terrible, always was even before radio got a hold of it.  The reason why it sucks is that song started the whole \\"lets write a song for FM radio mentality\\" that this otherwise good band fell into.  I cant listen to their Hysterectomia album at all, just too flippin awful.  Savage, Elliot and Clark (RIP) relaly lost their nertz on that one.

B004V7EW66|3.0|I love Paul Simon and have been listening to his songs since I was a kid. I had a lot of expectations about this album with all the great reviews I'd read. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. While his voice is still velvety, powerful and intimate, I wasn't impressed with the music. Great lyrics as always, but none of the music sticks in my head. I'll keep giving it a listen, but it's not in heavy rotation on my iPhone.

His world including his mother who is his protector, educator and friend and old nick who is his biological father and simply someone who provides them with a sunday treat. Parts of this book made it almost impossible to put down and towards the end a feeling of jubilation that these two innocent people could now start a life outside the Room together.

1599218011|2.0|The information in the book is fine, if you don't mind the forced sassiness of the tone. But I was piqued at the false advertising. It says on the cover that there's a 21-day cleanse plan. There isn't! There are no meal plans for the 21 days. It's just one page of platitudes for each day, like smile and meditate and make time for yourself, for 21 pages. As a kind of by the way, the instructions say to eat vegan for those 21 days. But since the entire book has only a few recipes, stuck in the back, you're pretty much on your own. Anyone who actually wants to try eating differently, or doing a cleanse, should seek a different book.

I chose Rango this year and while a good film it wasn't what I was expecting from an animation film. I bought Rio on blu ray the other day and aside from great graphics this movie is very well done, funny and your typical family animation to boot. Id highly recommened this, I havent enjoyed an animation this much since I saw Dispicable Me. Again highly recommened.

1400079276|4.0|I've read a few Murakami books, and though this one isn't as strong and amazing as Wind Up Bird Chronicle, it still has the same weird, on-edge tension. You're never quite sure what's happening or what's making sense, but it's easy to lose yourself in this and forget these scenarios and just get caught up in the dreamlike story qualities. If you have read Murakami and have decided you don't like him, you won't like this. but if you've ever thought favorably of his work, then you'll enjoy it.
B00304LF0W|5.0|All movie reviews are, ultimately, a person's opinion. I've seen the reviews of this movie and find something in all of them to agree with.  It's easy to do so, depending on what you are expecting from this viewing experience.  This movie is a \\"self-shot documentary\\" of a couple's experience with supernatural events that rapidly escalate in severity.  Obviously, there are going to be moments of \\"For heaven's sakes! How can you be *that* dumb?!\\"  On the other hand, there are often moments of unexpected shocks.  To believe that a true-life couple would lug a camera around or have one running at all times to capture this stretches credulity to the breaking point.  That said, if you allow that and other expected snags to pass by, this can be a rewarding viewing experience.  You never see the \\"monster\\", a point that I find makes this movie MUCH more scarey than it would have been if they'd floated by all sorts of CG phantasms.  They leave it up to your imagination to craft the monster, to shiver over its decision to escalate its attentions, to almost see it in the darkness just beyond the lighted doorway.  The actors are believable for the most part(in my opinion).  I give this movie a high rating, not for its technical excellence or superlative story line, nor even the actors.  I give it marks for allowing me, the viewer, to make it as scarey as my imagination is capable.  And, as anyone who's ever jumped at a sudden inexplicable noise in the dead of night knows--our imaginations are very very capable!
B00127RAJY|2.0|OK, the work outs are very good, she's good and you do see results quickly, but a HUGE TURNOFF to this DVD is that I can't skip the 10 minute intro before I can begin a workout.  I accidentally stopped the DVD, so I had to wait another 10 minutes for everything to reload and play out.  Come on already, stop with the advertising and just give us what we paid for. I don't need to be sold on the Biggest Loser or anything else, and this wastes 10 minutes of time when I could be working out.  Thanks for listening.

0062024329|5.0|For worldwide fans of The Alchemist, we now have another format to explore, and I recently had the sheer pleasure of doing just that!<br /><br />Like many readers of the original novel, I had a favorite part of the story and a favorite character. In my head, not only could I hear music, but tended to see living scenes - like a movie.<br /><br />So when the author made an announcement that his book was going to be published into graphic novel format, I was excited for the new readers (kids that prefer story telling through images more than text or in addition to text). Curiousity led to wondering how the artist's pictures would paint the scene where Santiago turns himself into the wind, and how my favorite character, Melchizedek, would be portrayed.<br /><br />Then several months of waiting began. Boy, it's not easy. It doesn't get easier waiting for Paulo's new books. The release date of November 23, 2010 seemed a long, long way off.<br /><br />But the waiting became fun, an adventure in itself, for many of us. Then, on November 22, my copy arrived!<br /><br />Well, without spoiling the fun, let's just say that I wasn't disappointed!! Magic on every page, simply brilliant. Actually, I'm thrilled. Can one be more enthusiastic than that?<br /><br />Happy Birthday to The Alchemist Graphic Novel and Happy Reading to previous fans and new ones! This was a dream come true for Paulo Coelho. And we all get to enjoy it, WOW!<br /><br />I recently purchased another copy as a gift for my daughter's boyfriend.  Overnight he had already read half the way through, and wished he also had a copy of the novel.  And was really glad that I had taken a copy of the novel along too.  You have a new fan Paulo.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a great movie. The acting, settings, development of story and characters is exceptional. There existed chemistry between the two main characters in this film. The story incorporated the vices, virtues and emotions of human nature - greed, violence, selfishness, kindness, generosity, pride, prejudice and love. This is a movie I will watch again and again.
0307272702|5.0|As the author of The Three Diets Solution and The Path To Mindful Eating: Overcoming Emotional Eating and Adapting The Weight Loss Mindset, I feel well read in understanding good and bad information, and this book is tops for me.<br /><br />I used to be very fat.  Obese.  347 pounds.  Okay, not one of the biggest losers fat, but, I had hard times breathing, I suffered from depression, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, constant illness, alergies, joint pain, lethargy, apathy, and just plain old uck.  I was 18.  When I saw that 347 on the scale, I suddenly wanted to take control of my life, I wanted to lose my weight, I wanted my life back on track... I wanted to be one of the skinny people--or at least, healthy people.  But what works.  When I was 13 I weighed 230 pounds.  My parents spent 17 thousand dollars taking me to nutritionist across the USA.  I ate six carb servings a day, following the food pyramid, and got fatter.  I tried the atkins diet, but a misreading and mishandling of the material had me urinating fire pretty much by the second week, I tried Jenny Craig, Weight watchers, the bible diet, South Beach, and a host of others.  You know what.  They didn't work... at least, they didn't keep the weight off.  I was fat and there was nothing I could do about it.<br /><br />At eighteen, I decided I had to do something about it.  I went to a bookstore, I spent about half of the money I got for graduating high school on health books, and I went home on a saturday, went to my room, and didn't leave but to use the bathroom.  I read everything I could, from nutrition, to diets, to fads, to science, until, I decided on doing a strict diet of basic protein (two eggs in the morning), high vegetables, and fruit.  THis cleared up the depression, most joint pain, and the apathy.  And, I lost 80 pounds and it stayed off, even when I started back into bad habits for more than a year--pasta, subs, calzones.  The problem with the diet is that I was worn out, I had no energy, no strength, and, as I would learn, as I still felt flabby and out of shape, my body was eating my muscle--well some of my fat-about 60-40.  My insomnia was still there.  I'd go to sleep at 6 or 7 in the morning, wake up at noon time because I couldn't sleep nights, and then by four o'clock I needed another nap--if I didn't get the nap, I still wouldn't sleep until six, but, I'd feel very lethargic through the night, and be unable to do anything.<br /><br />Enter Gary Taubes and his first brilliant book, Good Calories Bad Calories.  It's 2009, I hear about it, I buy it, I read it, and I thought it was interesting.  But it doesn't catch my attention, it goes against a lot of what I've researched, and, a lot of what doctors told me.  I live in my state of lethargy and insomnia, for a year, just figuring I'm a night person, and that's just who I am.  Then, in 2010, I'm at a conference, the only places around serving anything good are sea food restaurants, so for a whole week, I'm ordering some form of fish at every meal--since I was still on my vegetable diet, I wouldn't allow myself to order fries every meal, and so I ordered vegetables.  This conference took place in the mornings, and I would be exhausted, lasting until the afternoon, my head was hurting, my stomach was sick, but, after two days of the fish protein, I was wide awake, able to sit up and listen and take notes.  By the forth night, I went to sleep for the first time in years before one o'clock and woke up at 6:30 refreshed and feeling good.  By the end of the six day conference, I had no afternoon slump, my eyes began losing the bags under them, and I could swear my hair was growing back--I had begun thining at the top, I was 22 for God sakes.<br /><br />SO, I decided protein needed to be a part of my diet, and, through a usual move through the bookstores, I came upon this book and I got it as a belated christmas present to myself.  This year has been wonderful.  This book was brilliant, along with Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf, The Primal Blueprint by Mark Sisson, Good Calories Bad Calories by Taubes, and The Paleo Diet by Loren Cordain.  I sleep regular for the most part, my sex drive is up--and with my constantly improving appearance, it gets used--and where in my family, there's a history of cholesterol problems, high blood pressure, and diabetes, my blood pressure became normal for the first time in my life, my cholesterol went from borderline to outstanding, and my blood sugar sits at a perfect 85.<br /><br />So, why do I say this is not the only way to lose weight.  Because, I'm a stuidous student of weight loss, of health, and I take that serious, meaning I research everything, and test it.  A diet of natural fruit and vegetables, for the purpose of weight loss is highly effective as well.  A diet of just vegetables, no protein, sugar, carbohydrates, or fat, I've personally witness on multiple occasion put cancer--which can be caused by too high of protein--into remission.  So, where he says this is the only way for weight loss, one can safely and effectively do just as well, on a natural fruit and vegetable diet.  However, such a diet, I think, runs roughly 20 dollars a day.  Where as the Paleo diet can be as low as 10 dollars a day.<br /><br />Sorry for the long review.  This is a great book.  My energy and continued weight loss is contributed to the works of people like Taubes, Wolf, Sisson, and Cordain.

1439170916|5.0|I would've never thought that the history of cancer could be an interesting read so I would've never picked up this 592 page behemoth. However, I kept seeing it in different \\"best of 2010\\" lists so I ended up picking it up. This book is fantastic. He makes the history of cancer so incredibly interesting and moving that this a must read for anybody who has been touched at all by this horrible disease. It'll make you laugh at times, it'll make you cry even more, and overall it'll just move you to the core. A fantastic read.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Love the movie! it will make you think a little about the people you have loved and lost. very well written, acted, and directed. NOT your typical movie! The supplier shipped it to me in a timely manner in the condition that was promised (new).

0143038583|5.0|The book is kind of divided in two halves that are very different. In the first half he follows food from the field, to the animal, to the slaughterhouse and finally to the table and is very interesting. His research into corn is very impressive and well worth a read. In the second half of the book he gets a little wordy and tells you in depth about his adventure in trying to become vegetarian, trying to hunt a pig, learning to \\"hunt\\" for mushrooms and trying to make a meal entirely with things he completely prepared himself. I found that second part to be somewhat boring. I give the book 5 starts for the first half and 3 stars for the second half. Overall it is an interesting read and especially if you haven't read much about corn and how it is heavily subsidized in the US this is a very interesting book.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Love the movie, but I am sure there is a scene cut from the DVD...I saw this movie in the theater 3 times, and I distinctly remember a part where the ambulance driver whispers in Bethany's ear \\"God will never leave you nor forsake you\\".  It's not in the DVD.  What's up with that?

The very interesting part of this one is his scholarly analysis of Americans worth over $1 million dollars and their families. It is VERY interesting and not at all what most people would expect.

B002VPE1PW|4.0|The original Case Logic sleeve I purchased for the Kindle DX did not fit after I put the OtterBox cover on it to protect it. I figured this sleeve would fit and it does. Fortunately I didn't expect much protection and that's exactly what I got. I just needed to keep the screen from being scratched and keep the Kindle clean. The padding this sleeve offers is about an eighth of an inch. As the pictures show, it's black on the outside and orange on the inside.<br /><br />You need to be aware that the true outside dimensions are 11 X 8.5 (not 12 X 9.2). And it's definitely not 1.8 inches thick. Because of this if it didn't stretch a bit it would not have fit over the length of the OtterBox cover. The width leaves about an inch of room.<br /><br />Over-all for the money it's not bad. Just don't expect much and you'll be very happy.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003FZA2VE Case Logic Canvas Kindle DX Sleeve (Fits 9.7\\" Display, Latest and 2nd Generation Kindles), Dark Green]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0049IYLOA Otterbox Commuter Series Amazon Kindle Dx Black]]
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  It was so unique to hear the story from the dog's point of view.  It also lets us know just how smart dogs are.
B0045U9WPU|2.0|While the plot of the book is one I'd enjoy, this book felt like a huge prologue. It was almost tedious at times trying to get through the book without skipping a paragraph. And even if I did - I didn't feel like I missed anything. I force myself to finish books, hoping they'll end well, but this story didn't pick up until the last 20-50 pages.     Perhaps the next book will be much better because this is definitely a talented writer in the terms of conveying beauty. Hopefully in the next book she'll develop a sense of movement and flow throughout the book without dragging us through the mud.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|For me, the track record of the 2011 comedy releases did not seem great, so I was a bit nervous about watching this movie. That being said, I was completely wrong and surprised by this film. Starring Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, and Woody Harrelson, \\"Friends With Benefits\\" is, well, exactly about what it sounds. Timberlake, upon moving to New York to take a new job, has as his only friend Kunis, who lured him to New York for the job to begin with. As the two develop as friends, so does their relationship develop. While the ending may be predictable, the storyline of the friendship, a character with Alzheimer's, and the \\"realness\\" of the film lend reality to comedy.    ACTING: A    Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, and Woody Harrelson all shine in this film, with Timberlake and Kunis taking charge of the lead roles and producing a sense of positive interaction and giving believability to the plot and the humor. Harrelson, as a side character (Timberlake's gay co-worker/friend), is flamboyantly gay and unafraid to show it: creating many entertaining moments in his own right.    PLOT: B+    Sure, the plot is believable. Most plots of romantic comedies are. This film, for me, was different in that it was also about Timberlake's film-dad suffering from Alzheimers, about Kunis' mommy-issues, and about the development of the characters as adults. This is far from a rote comedy along the lines of every other script, making it enjoyable!    COMEDY: A    At points, I couldn't stop laughing, particularly in the interaction in the bedroom between Kunis and Timberlake as well as due to Harrelson's character. To be sure, the humor is crude and sexual most of the time, but you could probably guess that from the title.      FINAL REVIEW: BUY IT    This film is definitely one to purchase. I will be doing so as soon as it leaves theaters. It was more than a romantic comedy, for me, just as it was more than a raunchy, sexual comedy. If you like Kunis and Timberlake, they are at the topof their games in this film. Don't hesitate to buy, but be aware that it is a very sexual movie!
B001FB55L2|4.0|I ordered this for my friend and they shipped it fast over to my friend's house. No complaints and it was a great movie.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|As a brief summary, Cameron Diaz is a teacher who hates her job. She is happily looking forward to being able to quit (so as to pursue other interests, such as a breast augmentation), when her husband divorces her. Reeling, Diaz is forced to confront the fact that she is no longer wealthy by continuing to teach. It becomes apparent that Diaz's character is far from the most ethical and competent of teachers, as she simply does not care about her students' performance. What follows is the story of a school year in which Diaz first ignores then aids her pupils in an effort to win prize money which would allow her to win prize money sufficient to afford an augmentation in order to impress a wealthy coworker (Justin Timberlake).    On the whole, I rate the film as follows:    ACTING: A   -Diaz shines in this movie for, really, the first time in a while. Timberlake and Jason Segal each add the flare that we are accustomed to receiving when they film. The interactions between the characters are believable and each embodies the role cast to them.    PLOT: C  -The idea of a \\"Bad Teacher\\" is a creative one, to be sure, but if you are expecting huge comedic interactions between Diaz and her pupils you will be disappointed. These occurrences, while present, are few and far between and, to me, made the movie somewhat less enjoyable.    COMEDY: C  -The comedy is raunchy, as would be expected. It's not a blockbuster comedic hit, for sure, but it will cause you to chuckle at points. Certain comedic points do seem stretched, and the lines of comedy are not as creative as would be expected for such high-profile actors. What comedy I found in this film came not necessarily from character interaction (which was more of a storyline) but from individual character moments. The group could have been a lot funnier together had the plot been more helpful in creating comedic moments.      FINAL REVIEW:    If you can rent this, then do so. I wouldn't necessarily buy it. At points it's good, but it had the potential to be so much better. Then again, everyone has different tastes in movies.

B0036TGSIK|1.0|This movie was one of the worst I have seen in a long time.  A true piece of trash.  It glorifies sluts and promiscuity while degrading those who believe in God or wish to save a certain part of themselves until after marriage.  The plot was horrible and deserved an R rating.  It is because of films like this that I've started to give up on Hollywood.  I got the impression that the profanity and sexual content was created first, and then the writers tried to build a plot around that.

B004MNVKVO|5.0|First of all, although this review comes in the name of my wife, it's actually me, Carlos A. Fernandez's words that you'll read.  The first time I owned this album was in 1981, when I stole, (yes, stole) the LP record from Sears in Puerto Rico.  I had received a US$100 bucks gift that I blew up in music LP's in Sears, and they didn't allow me to get this LP because I was a couple of dollars short, so I decided to steal 6 LP's and put them in the same bag with the LP's I've purchased.   But, as things are, I've ended buying this record in every format it has come out, cassette, CD, remaster and finally this BLU-RAY version, and, if it comes in a USB that I can connect directly to my brain, I'll buy it!!!  If you ever heard this music, or not, BUY IT!!!  That's all I can say. I am an expert in great Rock music and this is in my Top 10.  Buy it!!!!

0393061310|4.0|The author covers a lot of ground.  I do question his theory whereby he discounts man's intelligence as a factor in a nation's development.  Someone had to think of the \\"wheel\\" and someone had to think of expanded uses of the wheel.  No doubt the availability of certain plants and animals and the lack thereof played a major role in man's progress in each area of his discussion.  This seems somewhat obvious.  Yet, I like to think that the human mind's ability to visualize new ideas and to implement these ideas brought us further down the road to civilization as most, but not all, know today.  It would a an interesting exercise for the author to expand his theories and speculate what life might be like in the year 4000.

0553251023|4.0|While not as insouciant as the young Albert Campion (from which were drawn most episodes of the fine British TV series), this is a good one which can held its own against much of the competition today. The characters and plot are interesting, the settings, indeed, flavorful. While Albert's long time friend, police superintendent Luke, takes up more of the stage, Campion does have his innings. For those counting on detective stories for much of their light entertainment and escape from the stress of the day, this will be a winner.<br />I should mention that I purchased my used copy for the four dollar shipping charge plus a nominal charge of under ten cents and found it to be quite a good reading copy though the cheap paper is beginning to show the chemical changes induced by the aging process. A good way to go for a book which slips handily into a pocket for reading while waiting for, or traveling on, bus or train.
1439177791|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It is very easy to read, and it is a very simple story of what Portia felt when she struggled with a eating disorder.  I particularly like it that she did not try to \\"explain\\" why things turned out they did.  I used to watch Ally McBeal and I could never imagined what Portia did in order to play Nelle Porter.      In a way, Portia seemed to be insecure in the sense that she totally underestimated herself.  She played Nelle Porter well and I always liked her.  It is however a shame that she does not act more often these days.
8862933177|5.0|Gracias a los reviews que le&iacute; ac&aacute; (en ingl&eacute;s, obvio), no tuve ninguna sorpresa (negativa) al abrir mi caja desde amazon con mis moleskine, empecemos por el principio.<br /><br />La libreta mide unos 13,5cm x 21cm x 2cm, vac&iacute;a se ve bastante fome y hasta me pregunt&eacute; &iquest;Que voy a hacer con esto?, pero apenas empec&eacute; a llenarla, fue maravilloso, porque habitualmente tengo problemas ya que al ver tantas pel&iacute;culas, y al haber tantos actores en las mismas pel&iacute;culas, se me confunden a veces.<br /><br />Bueno, es evidente, despu&eacute;s de escribir 2 rese&ntilde;as juntas, que las paginas son un tanto delgadas, por eso, recomiendo no usar un l&aacute;piz de tinta y mejor usar un l&aacute;piz pasta (para que la hoja no la absorba).<br /><br />Son 240 paginas, 6 planas por letra (imposible poner los 8 Harry Potters en la 'H'), es mas creo que mas adelante tendr&eacute; que usar el otro titulo o rellenar en la X o Y (existe un indice al final, por lo tanto es poco probable que se te pierda una rese&ntilde;a)<br /><br />Los stickers parecen ser pocos para poder complementar las rese&ntilde;as, pero no sean taca&ntilde;os y &uacute;senlos.<br /><br />El lomo de la libreta se puede personalizar con stickers, no los malgaste, ya que al ser el lomo muy liso (y creo que no poroso)el sticker se sale.<br /><br />La moleskine viene con un un peque&ntilde;o diccionario para traducir los conceptos que hay en la libreta y en los stickers, es bastante &uacute;til para ciertos conceptos que se pueden confundir o para los que no somos nativos en ingl&eacute;s.<br /><br />En fin, estoy feliz con mi libreta, los detalles en la tapa son destacables y realmente la hace mas querible.<br /><br />No es como para traerla siempre en la mochila/cartera porque igual es grande y da la sensaci&oacute;n que se tiene que cuidar mas porque tienen que durar mas (me refiero en el tiempo, como recuerdo de las pel&iacute;culas que viste).
B003Y5H5A6|4.0|Ok, we all know that super hero movies are going to be \\"popcorn\\" movies, i.e. movies that are trying to put as much action, noise, explosions, maybe a few girls running around, etc into two hours.  These days (yeah, I'm showing my age) I believe that the movies studios are addicted to CGI and special effects, they just don't know when to stop, and just because you can do ANYTHING you want in a movie today, most definitely dosen't mean you should do it. (see Spielberg films, Transformers, et al).  SO, Captain America, in my humble opinion, does show some restraint on the \\"popcorn\\" front.  Is it a popcorn movie?  yes it is.  But it sure helps having one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, The Red Skull, superbly played by Hugo.  The other actors do a fine job, and there is a lot of cool weapons and costumes as well, the action is well done for the most part.  SO, I only own one super hero movie, the first Spiderman, now I will buy Captain America, cheers.
1600108512|5.0|The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle illustrated by Renae De Liz and Ray Dillon is a beautiful rendered adaptation of the original fantasy classic. This graphic novel uses Beagle's words, however, in an abridged format, so the original text isn't presented in entirety, but if it was then I guess this would be the illustrated edition and not graphic novel which is a whole new awesome medium for the story. Yet the original meaning of The Last Unicorn is retained.<br /><br />So the plot in a nutshell: The Last Unicorn alive finds out that she is the last one and so goes on a journey to find out what happened to the other unicorns. Along the way she makes new friends, discovers different things about human nature, and learns the true fate of the unicorns. You can find a more detailed explanation in my review of The Last Unicorn.<br /><br />The art in the graphic novel of The Last Unicorn is gorgeous. I felt the illustrators had an excellent use of colors. For instance the pictures just pop right off the page because the illustrations are bright. Yet when bad things happen, the pictures go dark. The characters aren't all pointy and angular, but nicely rounded. There aren't any abstract pictures, yet the drawings retain a fanciful quality. I thought the art really breathed a new life into this fabulous classic.<br /><br />There is also BONUS CONTENT which includes an interview with Peter S. Beagle in the back. I honestly found this interview to be fascinating. I won't go into strict details, but my favorite part was this story Beagle told about going to a convention. He figures no one will know who he is at the convention. Anyways these two gang banger Latino guys comes up to his table and asks if he is the guy who wrote The Last Unicorn. Beagle says yes. And they proceed to tell him this story about how The Last Unicorn saved them, which was incredibly touching and unexpected and worth reading the interview for.<br /><br />I think The Last Unicorn graphic novel would be an appropriate read for the fantasy-inclined younger reader. The only scary parts were when the Red Bull would show up, and I don't believe that's enough to traumatize someone. Also, there are no swears at all. I do think this could be a gateway graphic novel and may convince the reader to try the original source, as this does justice to the originalsy-inclined younger reader.

B004OCCFFI|4.0|I can't bring myself to disagree with the lead review's enthusiasm, but in part that's due to the disappointing track record of Fidelio over the past four decades. The closest we've come to a great one is Bernstein's on DG, with a more than honorable mention to Colin Davis's concert reading on LSO Live with a very impressive Christine Brewer in the title role. This new Decca set is a showcase for Kaufmann, and he deserves it. He was a sensation as Florestan on a DVD from the Zurich Opera, not only looking the part of a gaunt, suffering hero but singing with such resplendent voice, courage in attack, and astonishingly accurate intonation that he bowed to none of his predecessors on disc. Decca also finds Abbado in good form, giving us fairly energetic pacing and not too much of the mini-me Beethoven that has infected this opera with the influence of period style: this is a masterpiece of revolutionary fervor and all-embracing idealism. Unless those values are honored, any performance of Fidelio is a pale imitation.<br /><br />After a somewhat too meticulous but well played overture - why is this piece so hard for conductors and orchestras to get right? - we find ourselves entering the story without much energy. Unfortunately, Strehl's Jaquino shows not the slightest urgency, romance, or callow pique; he's the FedEx man delivering a parcel to Marzelline, and as sung by Rachel Harnisch, she is an emotional cipher, displaying neither acceptance nor rejection toward her unfortunate suitor. Here Abbado lapses into a familiar weakness in his opera conducting, forgoing passion for polish. How odd that Karajan is the one saddled, quite unjustly, with that reputation. His casting in these two roles, especially Helen Donath's Marzellinae, is fully up to the mark.<br /><br />Clearly Abbado is attuned to the nobility of Beethoven's conception more than its dramatic urgency, running against the current grain, which is to extract more psychological realism. On his own terms, the conductor can't be faulted. The blending of voices in the Quartet is marvelous, and Rocco's \\"gold\\" aria is delivered with impeccable balance and poise. that's not what one really wants from Rocco, who should show more character as a troubled working-class functionary, but Christoph Fischeser has a smooth, sonorous voice that fits into the blended ensembles. I imagine any listener will be satisfied except for those who feel that the dramatic line should be more tense.<br /><br />I like the fact that in his recitatives Struckmann's Pizarro isn't a cartoon rug-chewing villain but instead a smooth aristocrat whose cunning is more serpent-like. He delivers a nuanced, highly effective solo in Act I, although Mr. Moore is right to point out the wide vibrato that develops under pressure. Still, in concert Struckmann must have been quite powerful.  I don't mean to tiptoe around Stemme's Leonore. We don't live in an age of great dramatic sopranos, and those that have achieved success, like Stemme and Christine Brewer, fill the gap admirably. She is particular is musical, warm, even in vocal production, never steely or squally. There's no great dramatic impact or imagination, however, which puts Stemme at a disadvantage compared to, say, Waltraud Meier, who even at this late stage can deliver a riveting, dramatic characterization of Leonore that the more placid Stemme cannot approach. One shouldn't expect fireworks from \\"Abscheulicher,\\" which is taken rather cautiously by both singer and conductor. the particular vocal flaws pointed out by Mr. Moore are there but didn't excessively bother me. I kept remembering far worse from her rivals.<br /><br />And Kaufmann? I had no doubts about him, and thankfully Abbado supplies a tense, heroic orchestral part for \\"Gott! Welch Dunkel hier,\\" rising to one of his best moments, in fact.  I doubt that Kaufmann will fully challenge is younger self from Zurich for harrowing impact, but he transcends the calm atmosphere of a concert quite successfully. He knows how to manage his big dungeon scene with passion and musical intelligence. He really has no equal in the part today, and we are fortunate that his Florestan has been captured at its very height. Comparisons to the great Vickers are not amiss.  Deep thanks to the engineers for bringing out the all-important oboe descant.<br /><br />In the \\"Namenlose\\" duet Abbado chooses to emphasize tenderness over visceral excitement, and he achieves a truly moving account, with his two lead singers rising to their very best as musicians, singers, and actors. Bravo. The final crowd scene is handled with not quite the ebullience and triumph that I'd like to have, but as in everything else, the musicality and balances are a delight. I have no doubt that this was an occasion fraught with spiritual significance for everyone; that's exactly what Beethoven intended.<br /><br />P.S. 2014 - a relisten left me frustrated with Abbado's lack of dramatic urgency, and I'm not sure at this point that the fine singing quite overcomes this flaw.ssfully.

1451626657|5.0|I found this book to be a masterpiece in its own genre. I agree that Heller's writing might not appeal to everyone, but I found narrative to be excellently sarcastic, clever and enjoyable to read. Bitter humor intertwined with realistic descriptions of the war atrocities, as well as insane dialogs, which correspond to the insanity of the surrounded bureaucratic chaos are simply genius.   The book's plot is not built in a traditional way, but at the same time, it is shrewdly completed as a whole, even if chapters seem to be randomly put together with description of memorable characters, as well as events in the military base. I didn't laugh out loud as some readers did, because I just don't enjoy the topic of war, but that is just my personal preference, which doesn't prevent me to see that book as a all-time classic read.

0316069353|5.0|On the surface, Attorney Mickey Haller, brash, cocky, and seemingly amoral, is a hard guy to like. But hey, the position of a defense lawyer is never ethically simple, and once he accepts a client, Haller goes to the mat for her. In this case, the client is the emotionally volatile Lisa Trammel. Mickey has been representing her in a house foreclosure suit, when she's accused of murdering the banker who held the mortgage. He doesn't much like Lisa, but he does believe in her innocence, and he turns over every rock in LA in his quest to cast doubt on her culpability. In the process, Mickey discovers that the long tentacles of organized crime have infiltrated the mortgage business.<br /><br />The Fifth Witness is populated by a spectrum of colorful, well delineated characters, ranging from Haller's ex-wife (prosecutor Maggie \\"McFierce\\", whom he still loves), to his researcher Dennis, to his client. The bad guys are equally well represented. The first half of the novel concerns the investigation, and the second, a virtual battlefield of a trial. Mickey's up against a very sharp prosecutor, and he's in for the fight of his career. In his eyes, his job is to inform himself of \\"the knowns, the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns\\" of each case. During Lisa Trammel's, although he doesn't realize it for quite some time, he's taking a hard look at the cynical \\"game\\" he's required to play each time he defends someone, guilty or not. Beneath the surface, there is definitely active conscience. The trial is full of zigs and zags, but the biggest surprise is held till the end.<br /><br />Michael Connelly has been authoring the best in legal thrillers and police procedurals for more than a decade, and The Fifth Witness is no exception. Fast paced, exciting, intelligent, and endlessly interesting, the pages practically turn themselves.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I've never read the novel, so I'm looking at this mini series on its own, and since there are many other reviews giving you the gist of the plot, I won't waste time reiterating it. The two leads are very natural, and really own their characters. Especially the lead dude, who is refreshingly more than a cliche handsome guy insert. He's an intelligent, intimidating business man who starts off giving the worst first impression in history, which makes it so much harder for the heroine to come around to him. There is also a political sub plot about unions and working conditions of that era. This created a big philosophical rift between the heroine and hero. It was also intriguing, because it's a look at a unique place and time in English history. Overall, it's an impressive, entertaining accomplishment.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Well...  What a long wait for such a disappointing book!<br /><br />I am sorry Mr. Martin but your series and your writing plots just don't cut it anymore.  Yes; their is acknowledgement that this series and this book is on par with JRR Tolkien; but as of today I would offer that that is a slap in the face based upon the new pillars in this genre.  Yup JRR Tolkien was good in his day but time passes and the reader becomes even more educated.  You would do well to read these latest authors like Steven Erikson (Malazans Book of the Fallen), Ian Cameron Esselmont (Malazans Book of the Fallen) and the creator of the new wave in this Genre; Glen Cook (Black Company).<br /><br />Your story line and disjointed hiccuping from character to character continues to be distracting and tells a tale that now borders on boredom; you spend untold amounts of time devoting background detail to minor characters and the plot is so obvious that, even with probably two books to go, one might guess that Jon Snow (not dead yet even though it reads that way in this story) and Danerys will get married, save the world from a northern invasion of undead and live happily ever after...  geez  did Frodo really make it to the tower to destroy that ring through all those dangerous enemies?  course he did...  but our world is no longer 'happily ever after' is it?  And the ironic thing is -- if your storyline does become more grey and more gritty in the next volume it is proof that your original storyline was 'overcome by events'...<br /><br />I highly doubt, after reading this many reviews, that the editorial comments saying your stuff appeals to the 'intelligent' readers is accurate... by all accounts it appears to me that the intellectual readers have rebuffed this latest concoction of disjointed stories...  a paltry average of \\"3\\" from this many reviews clearly indicates there remains 'no value' in your story line.<br /><br />It is even more insulting to the intellectual that HBO have now createda mini-series to go with this...  a true sign that your storyline looks to appeal to the 'unimaginative'...  so how on earth does HBO create any sort of storyline from this latest book; if it ever gets there...  it jumps all around the place and even has mixed timing with the previous book...  wow...  and imagine all the folks tuning in to HBO when Cersei walks through the street naked...  shaved... from head to foot...<br /><br />In closing I would offer that for those who have limited internal imagination your stuff is good; for those that stretch their minds and push imagination to the limit it is clearly a two horse race between Glen Cook and Steven Erikson...<br /><br />I wonder if the thought of milking this story-line out to six or seven books (instead of the original four) came to mind now that HBO has created a mini-series for it!!!!<br /><br />You, like Robert Jordan, have lost the plot on this evolving change in our genre!!!<br /><br />Go grey go gritty and for pete's sake create a world of your own instead of piggy backing of the British Isles and the European Continent.

B004V6MWFU|3.0|Who knew after all that angst that Eddie Vedder was an old softie at heart?  The folks that stuck with Pearl Jam long after Vitalogy that's who and they have witnessed the change in the man through the work the Seattle based band has released over the past 15 years and all the live bootlegs out there.  Vedder's second solo release, a much more personal collection of songs than his first, is very honest in the realm of relationships both lost and found.  The issue is that the ukulele runs together after a bit making it all seem to be a variation of the same vein, maybe it's just the nature of the chosen instrument but it makes it hard to distinguish each track from the next.  At least two of the songs have floated around in Pearl Jam setlists or other live appearances for quite a while and one is taken from the forgotten but excellent Riot Act album.  The voice is amazing, as always, the sincerity in the lyrics as well but fleshing out the songs would have made it an enduring listen rather than just the novelty that it is.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|I saw this movie a few years back and thought it was very entertaining. It has suspense, and great underwater photography.  Some scenes are more adult than family fare, but it adds to the storyline.  I purchased this as a gift for my sons birthday and I think he will like it, even if it is a few years old.
0807014273|5.0|I was reading a counseling book on the \\"Search for Meaning\\" and in the introduction Dr. Gary Collins stated, 'For a number of years Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning was required reading for all incoming freshmen at a Christian Liberal Arts college where I taught.'  The statistics showed that students who read this book upon entering college did better in their academic life because it helped prepare them to understand what their true desire in life was.<br /><br />So, before I finished that book I purchased this book and read it.  I was amazed at all of the lessons that are taught, all of the theories that made sense and the purpose that it gives towards the work of a counselor that was so practical.<br /><br />The first half of the book talks about Fankl's time spent in a Nazi prison camp.  He talked about how there was only a 1 in 28 chance that the prisoner would survive the camp.  Most either died from disease or malnutrition or they were sent to the ovens where they died.  Many more died by their own hand.  Their lack of hope for a future drove them to suicide.<br /><br />Frankl took his observations of human nature and the experience in the war camps to think through the best way to provide counseling for people who are stressed, anxious, depressed, etc.  The counseling he came up with is called 'Logotherapy.'  He states that \\"Logo\\" is a Greek word which denotes, \\"meaning,\\" and therapy is the method used to help people learn to deal with their neuroses.<br /><br />So, 'Logotherapy' focuses on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future.  In other words, what is the meaning of life for the individual that is being counseled.  As a counselor you must remember that the meaning of life for each of your patients will differ.  There is not one easy answer that works for everyone.  Each person is different.  One of Frankl's favorite quotes is from Nietzche and it is, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\\"  The point of that statement is that people can endure any suffering, any disease, any hard life lesson if they know that they have a reason to live for.<br /><br />This is why a patient with cancer may beat all the odds, in other words, he is told he has only two months to live, but because he desires to see his child graduate from college he might actually live for 9 more months until that accomplishment is fulfilled and then the person takes a turn for the worse and dies.  There was meaning for life, so life was lived.<br /><br />The second half of Fankl's book expresses his thoughts on why Man's Search For Meaning is so powerful and so necessary for each person.  The subject is not fully discussed, this is a summary of his overall therapy method and learning.  But it gives you a great introduction to what he believes is a good therapy format.<br /><br />After reading through this short book I can see why Dr. Collins and others felt that this was a good book for college freshman to read.  The statistics gathered by George Barna were that upon entering college when asked what they hoped to accomplish, students answered 84% of the time that they wanted to find the meaning for their lives.  The other 16% stated they wanted to gain a degree to earn more money and satisfy their desires.<br /><br />So, let's help our students and others learn more about the meaning for their lives.  From a Pastor's point of view I was amazed at how well Viktor Frankl's thoughts weave right into Holy Scripture and are so pertinent.<br /><br />I think all serious students will gain much insight from this short work.<br /><br />Enjoy!y how.\\"  The point of that statement is that people can endure any suffering, any disease, any hard life lesson if they know that they have a reason to live for.<br /><br />This is why a patient with cancer may beat all the odds, in other words, he is told he has only two months to live, but because he desires to see his child graduate from college he might actually live for 9 more months until that accomplishment is fulfilled and then the person takes a turn for the worse and dies.

1451629184|5.0|this book shows how strong a child can really be, it showed how Jacyee was albe to endure such abuse because she was already being abused in a different way by her step dad, even before she was taken. she was already used to keeping quiet and going with the flow in order to not have a man mad or unhappy with her. i am so glad she is free, and i wish i could meet her.
0439023483|3.0|The reason I bought this book was because 2600+ mostly positive reviews indicates that this must be a good book.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed it, but it's not exactly the most enthralling work that I have read lately. It is worth a read though.<br /><br />Moreover it seems like they are definitely going to adapt this into a movie next year. So maybe all the more reason to give this a read.<br /><br />I didn't read all 2,672 but I was wondering if anyone noticed that the parallels in the premise of this and Battle Royale.<br /><br />I am not suggesting that is a bad thing, dystopian fiction and gladitorial games are not entirely uncommon.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />There are just a couple of striking similarities.<br />For one the fact that it is all teenagers between the age of 12-18.<br />Two, the kids take off at the start and snag up various useful items, weapons or backpacks.<br />And naturally the brutal battles that follow.<br /><br />***End Spoiler***<br /><br />Again, I am not really knocking this book for being similar, the concept is common enough, I'm merely pointing it out.<br /><br />Which means if you loved this book, you should rent or buy a copy of the movie Battle Royale immediately. BUT DON'T watch the sequel, it was filmed by a different director, and it was terrible IMO.<br /><br />*edit<br />Apparently many people had already drawn that similarity. In fact Stephen King drew that same similarity.
0553801473|5.0|So let us get some stuff out of the way. The first three are amazing. The fourth was lacking a little bit. Now that is out of the way lets talk about A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />There is so much being thrown at this book series. I believe we should examine a few of them. The first I would like to address is I don't care how long it takes in between books. I think people would be a lot more kind to this novel if it had come out a year later instead of six that it took. I would say that anybody that this bugs has a valid point, but for me it just doesn't matter. I wait patiently for these type of things. So while I think they have a point it didn't ruin any part of this book for me.<br /><br />Another thing is \\"that nothing happens and that it is just a placeholder for this series\\". Again I could see it. Books four and five are the middle in this long series. Martin can't rely on it being new nor can he rely on its ending to maintain the narrative edge. So having said that I expected that these two would be like this. In a trilogy it is always the middle that suffers. When going into a massive series like this you need to give a little to get a lot. A trilogy is nice and clean having a beginning, middle, and end. A series of this size can't be like that. When entering into a saga of this size there is always going to be a little place holding. Some have commented on that certain characters take a step back in their development. This is also true. What the endgame is with this form of storytelling is that when the series is done that the impact will be greater on the reader than if told in a clean three act structure. This means that books six and seven (could) should be better for the very fact of the place holding that four and five have done. This will lead to the argument \\"that this is all well and good but I just didn't enjoy this part of the story\\". To those people I would say that you are right in your opinion. It's just that I have a big picture view while reading these books. Meaning that I enjoyed the heck out of this book.<br /><br />The argument has been made \\"that it has to many new characters\\". I see them as frustrating as well but I keep in mind that characters grow more interesting the more you read of them. Perfect example would be of Davos. I was not that into him in book two. When I got to book three I loved him. This is Martin populating his Universe before he starts to break it apart. One good note that some might find interesting (as I did) is that Martin said that books six and seven will not contain any new POV characters excluding the Prologue and Epilogue. So if nothing else you won't have that problem going forward.<br /><br />One note of interest is that the critical reviews for this one have been very good while reviews on amazon have been less than kind. I thought when the critics reviews came out that everyone was going to be happy again. That didn't happen. It is for this reason I decided to write my review from this kind of perspective.<br /><br />I hope this review shows that I loved this book but understand where you guys are coming from. I think anybody that gave this book a one star review was right. That is what they believed. They can not be wrong it is their review. I myself enjoyed my time Westros. I love epic literature like this. I will be looking forward to the sixth book as I hope you are too.reading these books.

0307594777|4.0|Stieg Larsson has created characters that will live on for a long, long time. However, Lisbeth Salander his girl with the dragon tattoo, is the most fascinating of them all. In fact, she is the most unique, most nuanced personality that I've met in any novel in recent memory. You will learn to care about this weird but brilliant girl and you will wish for more of her at the end of the third book but unfortunately, this is all we get. Larsson does a masterful job of keeping interest strong and creating a plot arc that sustains through three books. He also packs in a lot of contemporary information on Sweden's economy, politics, culture, etc., and the result is that his stories ring true. Do pick up all 3 books and do read them together, they make the most sense that way.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I had no idea the magnitude of the film. I couldn't appreciate the subtleties in its metaphors or the amazing art direction or even the great writing.  After seeing it a few times now, I see something new every time, it's one of those movies that you enjoy seeing each time just because it strikes a certain chord within you.  If you like macabre films that make you question the meaning of existence and space and time, by all means watch this film.

It has not come off,but seems like a couple of good bumps if you were holding the camera lens up and it could fall off.  Only time will tell.  It has helped me to level the camera even when hand holding using livemode, so I'm happy.
B004XE0P5E|3.0|It's always an eyebrow-raiser when artists name their second album after themselves. Why didn't they think of doing that for their first album? Have they run out of ideas? Or is it just time to get serious? Would this be the equivalent to a system reboot?<br /><br />In the case of \\"Bon Iver,\\" Bon Iver's sophomore effort, the answer is yes to that last question. Founder Justin Vernon, after recording the 2007 folk-rock debut entirely on his own, deliberately added other personalities to the mix and, as such, \\"Bon Iver\\" is a less introspective, more prog-minded creation.<br /><br />Bon Iver still conjures up moments of sublime musicianship, most notably on \\"Calgary,\\" with its strokes of brass, bass drum and guitar fuzz -- Vernon's vocals buzzing and bouncing along as if coming from inside a cavern -- and on \\"Wash.,\\" with its sparse use of violin, piano and pedal steel guitar. In fact, the whimsical and nostalgic \\"Wash.\\" is as good as any tune I've heard from Bon Iver, and the debut \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" had a fistful of gems. That album came as close to flawless as most music ever gets.<br /><br />But \\"Bon Iver\\" is an uneven ride. It doesn't grab my attention until the fourth song, \\"Towers.\\" The first song, \\"Perth,\\" seems to be an ode to Richard Wagner or heavy metal, big swells of drum and guitar drowning out Vernon's vocals. The album closer, \\"Beth/Rest,\\" a messy, symphonic rock ballad, suggests too many cooks were bandying about in the kitchen. I want to like \\"Holocene,\\" but it sounds poorly mixed, a seemingly lazy rocker injected with rankling static.<br /><br />I miss the nuances and the spartan zeal on \\"For Emma\\"; the creaks during small silences that came from the old cabin in which Vernon isolated himself to record that album, and the subtle changes in his singular, haunting croon. \\"Bon Iver\\" is worth a listen for a few notable standouts, but here's hoping Vernon gets the itch for solitary confinement on his next outing.
0316056863|1.0|This book was chosen by our reading group / book club, in anticipation of \\"something light and funny.\\" The result  was that only 2 of the 10 who purchased the book actually read past the halfway point.  (They would have quit prior to the halfway point, but held on in the hopes that it would get better!)  The book had many unintelligent and inappropriate comments, references, and stuff, that just frankly turned off our readers from even finishing.  This was a terrible waste of time and money, and is definitely not for persons of any intellect, or those who just desire a \\"good read!\\"  Sorry Tina, but although we love your Sarah Palin, let this be another friendly reminder to you and the world that you don't have to be vulgar to be funny!!

0316056863|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I've never been a big fan of Tina Fey.  SNL has never really been my thing. I've never seen an episode of 30 Rock and that movie Baby Mama?  I'll pass.  With that being said, I'm really not sure why I decided to read her book, Bossypants.  It probably had something to do with the fact that she wrote Mean Girls, one of my favorite movies.  It was a fast read, Fey is down to earth, and she offers good life advice.    I finished the book in less than a week.  She isn't your typical celebutante.  Fey is hilarious and her book has an uncanny outlook on life.  I was able to relate to it, even though I'm not a multimillionaire with an Emmy award winning prime-time television show.  I felt like Fey was sitting across from me at Starbucks, sipping on a caramel macchiatto, and talking candidly about her life.  The book doesn't really have any type of organization or timeline, it is full of little vignettes about her life.      If Fey was in my college dorm, we would have been friends.  Great friends.  She makes up words like I do.  One example of this is blorft, her word meaning, 'Completely overwhelmed but proceeding as if everything is fine and reacting to the stress with the torpor of a possum.'  We also have similar views on girl drama, which Fey quotes, \\"Obviously, as an adult I realize this girl-on-girl sabotage is the third worst kind of female behavior, right behind saying 'like' all the time and leaving your baby in a dumpster.\\"  Finally, she gives good career advice: \\"Is this person between me and what I want to do? If the answer is no, ignore it and move on. Your energy is better used doing your work and outpacing people that way. Then, when you're in charge, don't hire the people who were jerky to you.\\"  Who doesn't want someone like Fey in their lives?      Tons of laughs, and I don't mean LOL.  I literally laughed out loud every few pages.  LLOL, I guess is what you could call it.  Try it.  Love it.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno really knows how to make the best out of a bad situation. I like to watch this movie when I'm not in a good place, it really cheers me up.    I particularly like the setting in which it takes place, the nice rural setting really does justice to the story itself and brings more definition to the characters. Nothing says unique like a small backwoods town in midwestern America.  The love felt between Bleecker and Juno is pretty real as far as acting goes, Michael Sarah and Ellen Paige be proud.

The cure for deliria will also rid Lena of all her pain. In the days approaching her procedure, Lena does the unthinkable. She falls in love.<br /><br />I really liked this book, it has potential to be one of my favorites... but it did have it's problems. The beginning was endlessly slow, and when something finally did happen- the story got really interesting! The story seemed very similar to Matched, and Hunger Games Fans would enjoy this read.
B00005JLIU|5.0|It is hard to believe that A THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE was made 45 years ago, set at a period 90 years ago; it's ancient history to taxpayers.  It is good to see Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, and Carol Channing at their lovliest before they are forgotten.<br /><br />The 2½ hour musical is a satire of the flapper generation: its music, its dance, its speech, its dress, cars, and notions --- even the cliches of silent movies.  To appreciate the humour, however, one must have lived and believed in the realities of that era; you must have marvelled at first-run silent movies before there were talkies.  I expect it is all apple sauce to young people today.<br /><br />Millie lands in Manhattan as a proper and naive Edwardian girl determined to marry a rich employer --- as soon as she finds a job.  Immediately on eying her competition, she bobs her hair, flattens her fronts (sic), dons a short sack, (rouges her knees), and smokes a cigarette --- the gun in the First Act that explodes in the Third. Her residential hotel for young ladies is run by Bea Lilly as a front to shanghai girls to --- Shanghai.  Millie and her young neighbour are soon mixed up with their men like the BLONDS who PREFER GENTLEMEN in an accelerating madcap comedy until flopping in the final showdown with the White slavers; it might have looked climactic before Jackie Chan's fun-fu did it much better.  Otherwise, it is a perfectly written, perfectly produced, perfectly performed, and perfectly directed showpiece of film boffo, with Elmer Bernstein's perfect OSCAR-winning score.<br /><br />If you want more of SOME LIKE IT HOT, you'll love MILLIE.<br /><br />TP

1451629184|5.0|I recently read Jaycee Dugard's book, A Stolen Life, which encapsulates the eighteen years she spent in captivity in the backyard of Philip and Nancy Garrido.  I had many reactions to this book: anger, fear, sadness, and eventually happiness followed by more sadness.    I was angry because I still can't believe someone could do this to another human being.  I've read a couple other books related to the subject because it just doesn't seem real to me.  How, for eighteen years, does someone go completely unnoticed?  How does a man get turned on by an eleven year old girl?  Why does a wife think it's okay to help capture an eleven year old girl as a present for her husband?  What goes through their heads?  It just doesn't make sense.    Fear overtook me eventually because this could happen to anyone.  I can't even count the amount of times in my head that I walked to school by myself.  Even today, I occasionally go for a morning stroll or jog and I feel pretty safe in my suburban neighborhood, but even the strongest woman in the world would be helpless if she were attacked by a stun gun.  It really makes me question.    The book made me cry.  Tears of anger and then of happiness that she was finally able to escape.  Stockholm Syndrome is a scary thing.  I'm glad that Jaycee was able to overcome it and escape.    I had nightmares because of this book.  Thankfully I didn't have to live a nightmare like Jaycee did.  Reading Jaycee's story was unnerving and sad.  She is so strong to be able to write it all down, and actually read it for the audio of the book.      I don't have much more to say on the subject.  Watch the Diane Sawyer interview.  Read the book.  Even if you don't finish the book, part of the proceeds go to the JAYC Foundation, which Jaycee founded to help victims of capture.

0142419400|4.0|Really 4.5 stars<br /><br />I have to admit that I had this book for a while before I read it. I read much more paranormal or fantasy than contemporary, and even though so many people loved this book, it seemed like it would be a frivolous read that would appeal more to high school students than an adult reading YA. But I finally gave in and read this book, and I loved it.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss might be a romance, but it doesn't follow the traditional models. There is no insta-love, and the story isn't about a perfect relationship that has to endure challenges. Instead, the novel is built around one question: Will they or won't they? Anna's father has decided to send her to boarding school in Paris, and she resents having to leave behind her friends and her maybe-boyfriend for a city and place she doesn't know. However, her neighbor comes to welcome her the first night, and Anna soon finds herself in a new circle of friends. This circle includes Etienne St. Clair, the swoon-worthy boy with a British accent. As Anna comes to know him better, she can't help but feel chemistry between them. However, she still has attachments back home, and St. Clair has a girlfriend. But in the City of Lights, anything can happen...<br /><br />There are so many things to love about this book, but the characters are especially great. I really felt that I knew each and every one of them, quirks, flaws, and all. Anna and St. Clair really came to life, Anna with her sense of humor, her love of movies, and her emotions, and St. Clair with his charm, his love of history, and his (sometimes maddening) loyalty. I loved watching them grow closer, even if I did want to yell \\"Just kiss already!\\" in so many places. The longing and tension were so clearly felt, as were the attraction and the budding feelings. And this is a given, but I also loved the setting. It was so much fun to go on tours of the city with Anna and St. Clair - because really, who wouldn't want him for a tour guide?<br /><br />Even though this story was set in a Parisian boarding school, there were plenty of moments that felt just like a regular high school. The fights between friends, the secrets, and the moments of bullying that happen all the time to teenagers happen here as well. While at times things were frustrating, everything seemed very realistic, and it was easy to get caught up in the story. I did enjoy the ending; sometimes it is refreshing to have everything wrapped up tidily.<br /><br />In her debut novel, Perkins weaves a story of longing, love, and life, one that is realistic yet engaging, and one that is guaranteed to leave you with a smile.

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|I don't usually write reviews but am taking the time to write this one.  The movie was HORRIBLY violent.  My 5 year old has worshiped Lightning Mcqueen from the moment he saw Cars.  It is NOT an exaggeration to say we have more Mcqueen stuff than Target and Walmart combined.  My 10 year old son saw the first one in the theater and passed his stuff onto my 5 year old.  Needless to say the whole family has been waiting excitedly for this movie for over a year.      Within the first 15 minutes my 5 year old (not usually a cry baby) was crying because cars were dying.  One of his favorite new characters Rod Redline was tortured and then killed.  I tried to say they just blew his engine but my son was not to be fooled and was crying because that was his heart and he couldn't live without a heart!  TOO smart.  We had to leave once the threat of death was imposed on his hero Mcqueen.  The stress of his hero possibly dying made him start to shake.  My older son who thought the action was cool was also horrified at the violence and stated \\"Is this really a G movie mom!\\".  When we got home I had to remove the Cars 2 poster from my son's room as the 'bad' cars were on it and he couldn't sleep with them there.    I am SO disappointed in Disney/Pixar and emailed them a letter basically mirroring this review.  I hope someone listens and realizes what a horrible disservice was done to such a beloved character.

1451629184|5.0|This book is so sad. You almost wish it wasn't a memoir but fiction instead. It's well-written, easy to follow and quite detailed. The insider's look into Jaycee's experience is harrowing but I appreciate Jaycee even more for it. I'm very glad she is safe and sound, with her two daughters and back with her mother.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Updated my rating from 2 stars to 1 star due to the additional changes; in particular the yelling Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi...    I couldn't stand a lot of the changes made to the original trilogy. But I think I can figure out why he doesn't heed the requests for the originals. The product he created from Return of the Jedi on is meant to appeal to children and hard core morons whose brains probably didn't develop much past childhood (and probably to make his wife happy or something stupid like that). He succeeded in attracting the audience he targeted. The people that fell in love with the originals are a demographic that he's determined will not make him as much money. A strategy to create a massive new fan base that will keep the dough flowing well into the future will fail though. The prequals lack the originality, substance and quality (due partially to the originals having actors that could actually act and dialogue that didn't suck) than the originals and will not have the same lasting effect. I've tried hard to like the changes made to the originals. Han Solo shooting first helps make his character more fascinating as he transitions from kind of a bad guy to a good guy. Now I think he's a giant d-bag.
0553801473|3.0|**Spoiler**This is for those who Read it**<br />Did anyone else but me look at this book when they got it and think...\\"Wow..I'm gonna have a lot to read\\" And then when it was finished think..\\"Now, what did I just read?\\" Its a huge book, yes. You'll be reading for a while. BUT, its mostly words, words, words! Nothing major happens..When Tyrion was in the Sarrows, I was thinking, finally, his story is going to pick up. And then it fell flat. Daenerys story was mostly boring...And even when she FINALLY flew on a dragon, its was close to the end of her story, and then its nothing major..Yep, she flew a dragon...No, Targaryen ansestry blood of the dragon running through her veins stuff. Ugh..And then there is Jon. Yep, his story was a bore too. So, he gets stabbed at the end, but who cares. Ghost, where are you Ghost. And the other characters, I'm not even going to go there, because I didn't even like them.<br />When this series started, it was epic..The first 3 were like nothing ever written. But now, It just feels like its being drawn out to much and to many details that don't need to be in there. GRRM has talent. I'd just like to see him get it back on track.<br />So, I guess I'm stuck here for the next 10 years waiting on the next one. And of course I'll read it. ;)
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I just got the watch.  Tried to set the time and date.  It chewed my fingernail up just trying to pull the crown out.  Finally set the time and the crown pulled out entirely.  I put it back in and managed to set the date.  Is this crown supposed to pull out entirely?  I never had a watch where the crown and pin just pulled out.  I will keep the watch for a few days to see if it can keep time.  Then it's going back.  This is ridiculous.<br /><br />In the last 15 minutes, it had kept good time.

1451629184|1.0|I wanted so badly to enjoy this book and find it interesting. Her story is tragic and unimaginable, but this book just does not convey the true horror she went through. I believe this is mostly due to the fact that she did not have a ghost writer and it was (clearly) unedited. The plot is all over the place as well as the verb tense. At times you are reading about her experience before being kidnapped and then it skips to present day without any warning. The reader will also learn about something that is going to happen in the future, but it is inserted in the middle of a story from the past which sort of spoils it. There is also a serious issue with the fact that much of the book is devoted to Jaycee's love of her cats. I realize that she had the educational experience of an 11 year old and a stunted emotional development, but if a ghost-writer had been with her they would have conveyed what should and should not be written about. 10+ pages on how she would give her life for her cats is very strange, considering she hardly says the same about her daughters. Speaking of her daughters, another annoying issue was that she never says the children's names and merely calls them A or S. The names are not written \\"A.\\" but just \\"A\\" which can be quite confusing when the sentence reads \\"A was crying...\\" or something along those lines. She (the author) tells you very little about the children, hardly mentioning them at all. I would love to know how they were treated on a daily basis, whether or not they were abused, how Jaycee managed to raise them and educate them and etc. but this information is just not given. In fact, mostly she talks about her cats and the mundane life she led while living in his backyard.<br /><br />Overall, I was very disappointed with this book. So little was said about how Philip and Nancy Garrido were able to keep the girls hidden, when and how the police were involved, what was going on with her family at the time, or any insight into how this affected her as a person. It seemed to be written by a middle school student, which makes it difficult for an adult to enjoy. It concerns me that so many people actually liked this book as it was so poorly written. I advise the interested person to, instead, just read the Wikipedia about her since it is more interesting and (honestly) gives more pertinent information than this book does in all its 268 pages.ted her as a person.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|I was a little nervous when I ordered the Deluxe Version of Britney's album, I have been a fan of hers for so long and I didn't want to hate it, Good news, I loved it!     The Album itself is proof that even though she is going through tough times personally, she can still rock it with a hot album. My favorite songs have got to be: Hold it against me, I wanna go, Til the world ends, Seal it with a kiss, and He about to lose me. She did a great job with this album, and getting the deluxe version is definitely worth it. The bonus tracks just seem to round out the album perfectly.    if you haven't gotten this album yet, BUY IT! Especially if you're a Britney fan. I hope she continues to make great music and release more CDS and I really hope she films a concert special or has her own camera crew film her Femme Fatale concert, that's one DVD I would love to have, that's for sure.

Heavy snoozers can limit the amount of snoozes and even decrease time between each subsequent snooze alarms. With so many other customization features it&apos;s almost like building your own app.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|As good as you would expect from these two groups.   It's about time they got together.  I had heard that they had toured together.  I'm glad they put out an album.  I have only listened to it twice, but it's amazing.  I wouldn't call it a collaboration, but a natural progression .  As a husband-wife team they are just great , and their musicians are up to the standards that you would expect from Derek and Susan.  Great musicians themselves.      Thanks folks for sharing your music with us.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Doesn't get any better!! This is real music - that is why the two groups remain \\"at the top.\\"  The good stuff goes on forever, i.e. Wheel of Fortune, Andy Griffth Show, James Bond, etc.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|When I read the sample, I was interested. After I bought it, I regretted it.  It's like the characters of Twilight rewritten as college professors.  The love/hate, I want to be with you but it is forbidden relationship between the two main characters (whose names I cannot recall thankfully) is irritating.  And what makes it worse than Twilight is the witch is a tenured professor at a university, the puppy dog lovey dovey dialogue makes her sound like a flaky high school girl.  If you want to read a good vampire novel, stick with a classic like Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice, a thrilling series like The Diaries of the Family Dracul by Jeanne Kalogridis, an underrated gem like The Vampire Tapestry by Suzy Charnas, or something completely different Fledgeling by Octavia Butler.  If you want a good mix of vampires and witches, Anne Rice's Merrick is also a good one.  Don't waste your money on this trivial garbage.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought these as the final touch to my daughter's princess room. While they still stand out fine on her pink wall, I think they would look better on a white wall.

0143116177|5.0|This book is a review of financial history.  The author is very thorough in his documentation and it is well-written.  He does draw many of his own conclusions, which the reader may or may not agree with.  I found a copy on my local library shelf after seeing it here and picked it up.  The most interesting part of the book is that many of the problems have not changed, it is simply a new generation applying the same greed that is inherent in humanity.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Had I written this review while I was reading A Discovery of Witches, I would have rated it much higher, possibly even 5 stars. However, the last pages of this book (I hesitate to call it an ending) not only left me wanting, but they quite honestly, ticked me off!  I invested 579 pages of my time (and emotion as this really is a well written story) only to be left with absolutely nothing (and I truly mean NOTHING) resolved. Not one mystery solved at all.  Very disappointing! The author is wonderful at crafting a story and creating characters that draw you into their world. Ms. Harkness is bright, articulate and well versed in history.  It is a shame I cannot recommend this book to my friends simply because it ended up being 579 pages of going nowhere. I hope in the future, the author will put more thought into giving readers some light at the end of the tunnel, instead of just a wider tunnel.

B004SUDQ4U|5.0|Over 25 years ago Das Boot impressed me overwhelmingly - even in the relatively low resolution HiFi stereo VHS format (thoughtfully recommended to me by the rental store's manager). It was one of the films I keenly anticipated for DVD release - which was wonderful - but the Blu-ray is an ultimate leap forward in terms of the quality of both video and audio. The 2 Blu-ray disc set includes the 208 minute Director's Cut on one (with Wolfgang Petersen's commentary as an option), and on the other the 149 minute USA theatrical release (plus all of the extra features). Nicely packaged and very sensibly region free (Regions A, B and C).<br /><br />Das Boot puts the viewer squarely in company with these brave young men in the oppressive confines of their submarine, doing nothing more or less than their duty, while facing the likelihood at any moment of a traumatic and inescapable life and death struggle. There's no trace of Hollywood trickery - but everything about the film, including the characters, the dialogue, the equipment, the cinematography and the soundscape, all confer an aura of honest realism.<br /><br />The soundscape is one of the best I've ever heard, and has huge impact in uncompressed DTS HD Master 5.1. For me the only film that rivals Das Boot for soundscape brilliance is The Right Stuff - and we can only hope that it will be granted the same high quality and care in restoration when it finally makes it to Blu-ray.<br /><br />Das Boot leaves the viewer in no doubt that war is hell. Those of us who have never served in war need to be informed and reminded of what we are expecting our young men and women to endure in the course of military service.
1600242405|4.0|I recommend this book for most people but with the caveat the entire sections might best be skimmed.  There are many entertaining parts as well as Keith Richards' observations and insights.  His perspective is interesting yet unfortunately much of the details covered lack interpretation and therefore meaning at least to me.  This is a long biography and it seems to nearly run out of steam progressively.  Nevertheless, this is among other things historically important because Keith Richards had kept a dairy with detailed accounts of the music environment of the 60s and beyond.    To me the most insightful parts of the book had to do with Richard's tastes in music and what it means to him.  He is profoundly sensitive to music while retaining the ability to explain it to the average person.  I enjoyed his narrative of how the Stones initially weren't happy to be considered pop because they wanted to be the best blues band in London, but they quickly got used to it.  His early life story helped me to appreciate how people of modest means and even unhappy early teenage years can achieve their goals.  The backgrounds of his parents and various relatives as well as Richards experience as an only child were well told.  I enjoyed this part of the book, his early life.    This autobiography is advertised as a life well-remembered.  Thanks to his discipline of keeping a journal with loads of details, the author really does remember his past.  Richard's experiences held my interest while certain recitations of names and quick summaries of so many people challenged my ability to remain attentive.
0688014291|5.0|Even if this book is a bit older, it does not mean that the subject is not accurate. On the contrary, this book is still up to date and  worth to read.

B003Y5H5AG|2.0|Raja Gosnell must be stopped.  Hanna-Barbara made amusing cartoons for children.  Movies based on Hanna-Barbara cartoons aren't half as amusing, but they're ten times more nauseating.  Gosnell doesn't get it.  First he gave us the lanky-brained \\"Scooby Doo\\" movies, and now this, an adaptation of the most obnoxious, hackbrained Hanna-Barbara cartoon, with the obnoxiousness and hackbrained quality of the small-screen TV series multiplied to fill the Big Screen.  It could have been worse, and children, especially younger children, do seem to enjoy most of it, which is simple slapstick and nonsense jokes.  But aren't we above this?  Aren't our children above this?  Pixar makes perfect films for children, films encouraging thoughtfulness, films about emotion and humanity.  This is one of the many modern children's movies that are just adult films dumbed down to a childish level, with all the life cut out.  On the upside, Katy Perry voices the Smurfette.
B001G8XON0|2.0|I love the movie Moulin Rouge, I saw it twice on the big screen and many times on the regular 'ol DVD.  So I thought the blu-ray version would be stunning.  It is-but not in a good way.  The movie is already bright and garish by it's nature.  The blu-ray makes the colors too loud, too garish. It's obnoxious.  The final number where Satine dies is awful, the colors are just wrong.    I won't watch it again.  Major bummer.

B000U7SN8O|5.0|This album is a grower.  The first time you here it you will be turned off.  You won't like the vocals, the playing, maybe even the lyrics.  But if you're like me, then you will be drawn back.  You will listen to it again.  If you are willing to give it those extra listens you will be rewarded with what is, in my opinion, the best album of the 90s (Arguably the best decade in modern music history).
B004EPYZSU|3.0|At least one critic has suggested that \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" should have been done as a comedy, like \\"Men in Black,\\" but the film wouldn't have been half as valuable if its creators had taken that approach.  Half of audiences seem to think it was unsuccessful anyway, apparently confused by the blending of a genre reputed to be harshly realistic and a genre known for its driven sprint from reality.  \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" is an impressively smooth marriage of both genres, considering its straight-faced approach.    Like many newlyweds after the honeymoon, this marriage has left those involved a little disoriented: the script rarely seems confident in its direction, and there are a couple contrivances for the sake of convenience toward the end.  It's wisely simple, like so much of the best sci-fi, but creative, too, more creative than the \\"Independence Day\\"-in-the-old-west ads have suggested.  It's more like a pulp sci-fi fantasy from the days of Edgar Rice Burroughs, if Larry McMurtry had been around to help.      Thank goodness for the bold-chested confidence of Jon Favreau's direction, which guides the film and inspires it to carry on, and have a good time doing so.  Favreau's jokester image post-\\"Swingers\\" should now be shattered post-\\"Cowboys & Aliens\\": he made \\"Iron Man\\" a surprise triumph, saved \\"Iron Man 2\\" from the meandering attention-deficit script resulting from a rushed production, and now he's shot \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" with impressive steadyness and equal helpings of reserve and flair.  It's best when it recalls \\"Unforgiven,\\" although Favreau's tight panoramas have more color in them than any image from Clint Eastwood's film.  His sureness is the glue that holds together this strange narrative.  Its success is his own.    Daniel Craig plays the hero, an amnesiac with a bizarre bracelet.  Craig was cast for his resemblance to \\"The Magnificent Seven\\"'s Yul Brenner.  He performs with a hoarse brashness and undercuttingly nasal American accent that would knock Brenner off his feet.  He's nowhere near as brash as Harrison Ford's domineering colonel-turned-cattle-rancher, possibly Ford's sole turn as a villain (the quality of his character in \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" is debatable).  Ford's performances seem to be growing increasingly delightful: first his left-field knockout performance in the awful \\"Morning Glory,\\" and now his deliciously devilish portrayal of a right American bastard (although, unfortunately, his character and thus his performance seems to have turned around at the film's end).  Ford may not have enough screen time to clearly be the jewel of the cast--but he is.    Olivia Wilde, who charmed in \\"Tron: Legacy,\\" charms here as well.  She's so charming that the audience seems to immediately clamor for Craig to forget the woman who starts him on his journey and fall for Wilde instead.  Paul Dano is also charming in the opposite way.  He's mastered the role of the contemptuous hypocrite, first in \\"There Will Be Blood\\" and now here.  He's on-screen for a total of no more than 10 minutes, but he makes an impression.    So does the film.  It's a soft impression, when it's over: it's surprisingly good, the kind of good that keeps one happy and entertained and even occasionally riveted during the course of the film, but also the kind of good that falls short of great and doesn't cry out for further investigation.  \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" is a simple film, despite the seemingly complex task of blending the science-fiction and western genres, but it's a good one.  It's pleasant and satisfying entertainment.
B002D0L0R2|2.0|Perhaps it's unfair to review a film adaptation of a Broadway show shortly after seeing a first-rate live production of that show.  But that's where I found myself - my daughter and I saw a terrific live stage production and she was so excited that I had to snag the movie . . . what a disappointment.  To be fair, the movie is a faithful adaptation of the Broadway show, which is in turn a faithful adaptation of John Water's original film version featuring Ricki Lake.  The movie is more tame than the Broadway show and much more sedate - although it's hard to see any film providing the same stand-up-and-dance exuberance as that hysterically upbeat show.    For the most part, the cast plays their parts with good cheer and warm humor.  Nikki Blonsky takes on the key role of Tracy Turnblad, the plump and plucky Baltimore teen who wants nothing more than for everyone to dance together in harmony to the coolest tunes on the Corny Collins show.  Blonsky's got a fine voice and has the rampaging cheerfulness to play Tracy, and that's saying a lot.  Several other supporting roles, such as Amanda Bynes as Tracy's best pal and James Marsden as Corny, are well-played.  The story also gets high marks as ever - \\"Hairspray\\" daringly takes on the racial and sexual mores of Baltimore circa 1962 - and there's lots of fodder there.  But it's hard to give a remake of a remake a lot of credit for telling an original story.  The key is whether this film version of \\"Hairspray\\" does a good job, and that's where things fall apart.  In their zeal to sell a Hollywood hit, the filmmakers made some big casting mistakes with some of my all-time favorite actors.  John Travolta's fat-suit performance as Tracy's obese mother Edna just flat-out does not work.  Travola adopts a weird accent that, like Ben Stiller's in \\"Zoolander,\\" wears out its welcome quickly.  The gimmick of \\"Hey, that's Travolta in a fat suit!\\" also wears thin as the effect is more creepy than comical.  It must be said that while Travola's performance in Greece spawned a million karaoke performances, his singing in \\"Hairspray\\" is subpar.  The movie would have been much better served if they had chosen a relative unknown from a touring production of \\"Hairspray\\" rather than finding a Big Hollywood Star brave enough to take this role on.    Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better as Velma Von Tussle, as her razor-sharp cheekbones and chiseled triceps embody the evil mother's frosty competitiveness.  But she does surprisingly little with \\"Miss Baltimore Crabs,\\" a disappointment.  For all her brassy talents, Queen Latifah doesn't have the singing chops to pull off Motormouth Maybelle's bring-down-the-house number, \\"I Know Where I've Been,\\" a song that had the crowd alternately cheering and tearing up at the live show we attended.  Saint Christopher Walken seems to sleepwalk through much of the movie, although he does shine on his duet, \\"You're Timeless To Me.\\"   I'm not naive about Hollywood's need to bring in big names to get movies made . . . it would have been too risky from a box-office perspective if the filmmakers had chosen relative unknowns but who had brought the house down in one of the many live productions of the Broadway show.  But it would have been a much better movie.

B003EYVXSW|3.0|I watched this movie last night as a \\"time killer\\".  I was intrigued by the premise and give it a chance. The plot is a \\"by the numbers\\" 1950s \\"B\\" movie updated to 2010 sensibilities.<br /><br />Sarah Polley; (who has always reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster)and Adrien Brody try their best to make the characters believable and the actress who played \\"Dren\\" is the real star of the movie.<br /><br />But the plot gets muddled half way though the movie as Dren has sex with Brody's character and then has sex with Polley's character as \\"Dren\\" has a sex change which is explained earlier in the movie by two blob-like creations who eventually kill each other.<br /><br />I wanted to like the movie but the premise in the second half of the movie just didn't work for me and left me somewhat flat because it seemed to get more and more silly.  The ending which I'll spare you, didn't work for me either.<br /><br />In any case, there are enough good aspects to make the movie watchable, but don't take it too seriously.  You'll be in for a big letdown.

The production on all 4 was in your face and the band was just BRUTAL in spots! Now we get \\"Call To Arms\\" and it is a major let down. The songs..BY SAXON STANDARDS...are very \\"poppy\\". It's all about sing along chorus's on this one. The production is SEVERELY lacking. The guitars are very \\"warm\\" sounding. They should be ripping your face off...but they don't. And as unbelievable as this is to say...Biffs vocals are mixed wayy too loud on the recordings. There is not a single song that stands out as a possible future \\"classic\\". I really don't know what changed on this CD, but I would bet the farm it's the producer / engineer / mixer or something new in the songwriting team. This is not a BAD Cd......but it SUCKS compared to the last 4.

0743270754|5.0|Very good!  Mrs. Goodwin is one of the best researchers and writers around and it really shows in this book.  This book was not just a historical biography for me, it was also a total experience which made me unable to put it down.  She brings to life Lincoln's emotions and sets the table for all of the drama that constantly unfolds in his life.  Kearns involves the most important people in Lincoln's life and seamlessly adds their impact on our 16th president's story. If there is a fault with Kearns it is she tends to not mention her subjects faults but with Lincoln, he does not have many so it really works and you get you a riveting read. I cannot wait to see the movie that's screenplay is based off of this book.  Terrific.  Go rush out and buy it.

B0052U59F4|5.0|This story is magical! It may not be perfect by literary standards, but as far as pure enjoyment and joy, it's my favorite romantic story. Over the last two years ago, I have read well over a hundred books as well as many fanfiction stories and have a TBR pile that could bury me, but I have returned to this story for re-reads all the time!! I have never reviewed a book either, but for 50 Shades, I'm happily writing a five-star review. While it was still on the author's blog, I'd been known to re-visit this story for specific chapters, special scenes, or to hunt down one of a hundred favorite lines. Now as an e-book, it would be my desert isle keeper because it just never gets old for me. One small complaint: I was hoping after the professional edit, the opening chapters would be stronger, but they are still not a good indication of just how compelling this story becomes. After that though, so much unfolds between the two leads at such fast pace that my re-reads have been even more enjoyable than my initial one (which I did one chapter at a time as the author was writing it)  I won't go over the storyline as other reviewers have done that, but I do agree with the reviews that describe this story as addicting and entertaining. Ana's \\"inner characters\\" are riotously amusing (and a new one shows up that wasn't in the fanfic version). Other favorite elements include, the music in the story that runs the gamut from Kings of Leon's, Sex on Fire to The Flower Duet by Delibes; the RRoP jeans (What it is about those jeans?); the email/texting dialogue which is pure brilliance. I liked all the \\"firsts\\" and the theme of \\"more\\". I also like the honesty between Ana and Christian (misunderstandings are my least favorite device) and the twisty/turny evolution of their relationship, which surprised and delighted me all the way to the end. Speaking of which, the ending of this first book is quite the cliffhanger. A *screaming while hanging off the edge* kind of cliffy, so be warned! I know how the next part gets started and its some of my favorite dialogue in this story, so I look forward to the edited version of the next book.<br /><br />I won't say that I haven't rolled my eyes (which is a dangerous thing to in this story, ha!) at a few plot devices in 50SoG or haven't noticed all the British-isms that show up in this American setting. There is also a lack of sophistication in some parts of the story, but its the author's first work and, well, its mostly amazing so those things don't disturb me at all. The brilliant \\"bits\\" (see what I did there?) are so good that it's worth suspending my belief at certain points and forgiving the author's incorrect use of a term or two. You can tell the author was writing for the pure enjoyment of her unfolding story and she added a lot of fun or interesting elements for me to love. I am ready for the next one!<br /><br />The sensuality factor is very high and yet tasteful in spite of pushing the envelope. I still get stunned by some of the steamy scenes and find I can't breathe until its over. Then I just mutter something like, \\"that s*** is hot\\"!<br /><br />For those who loved Beautiful Disaster, I highly recommend this story because of the possessive Alpha lead and the intensity that builds up around the relationship. This is also written in the First person perspective, which I tend to like as long as there is a lot of action in the story, and boy is there. The description on amazon for 50SoG is oh so correct in stating it, \\"will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever\\".I know how the next part gets started and its some of my favorite dialogue in this story, so I look forward to the edited version of the next book.

1932100660|4.0|I think that this book is a very important one that more people should be reading.  I came across many people who were negative about this book, but weren't quite sure what exactly it was about.  I would encourage everyone to read, ponder and decide on their own, and not just listen to popular opinion.  The research is presented and discussed, somewhat dryly, but in a thorough manner. The reason I gave it 4 versus 5 stars is because I still had some questions following its completion, that I feel should've been answered by the book.  Yes, it advocates a plant based diet, or veganism.  Yes, I personally find the science to be valid.  I am also a vegan at this time, but I do wonder if there isn't room for small amounts of meat as I would think would be in primitive diets?    I just dislike thinking that the authors view the public as not quite smart enough to 'get it,' and instead of a thought out approach with the use of small amounts of meat as I would think they use in rural China (the groups studied) they advocate the complete absence of all meat and animal products.  Again, it is a very important book that I am currently reading to my children so that they have a modern, updated understanding of nutrition.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I am a big fan of this series. There are some that I missed and I had to get my Smallville fix on those that I missed. I am pleased with the video and its content. If you are a fan of Superman like I am this is the best way to see it.

Normally I try to ensure all unnecessary services are stopped before starting the game. But It runs well enough for me to get though Second Life, so I'm satisfied.    Then I tried it on my wife's iPhone 4... what a difference! So fast and smooth running, and different features on iOS, like Zen Garden.    Either way it's a great game worth a few bucks any day (tho I got it free... thanks free app of the day!)
B0000025DT|4.0|Jeff Lynne's Electric Light Orchestra is a group that was a bit over the top with elaborate stage shows and non-traditional rock instruments such as cellos and violins, they always seemed to be left out when people talked about the great groups, but at the same time they were unique and their music immediately recognizable.  The same is true with their album \\"A New World Record\\" which achieved some great success in Australia, Canada, and Sweden by reaching the top of the charts, and peaked in the top 10 in the U.S. and the U.K. along with most of the European markets.    The album has a nice collection of singles, but it also includes some pieces which are less pop and more album oriented.  The result is an album which is fun to listen to as it has a good deal of variety, and every piece has something to offer.  The biggest weakness of the album is its length, at less than 37 minutes of music it leaves the listener wanting more.  There are 9 tracks, and the group was clearly moving to shorter pieces.    The album opens with \\"Tightrope\\", a very upbeat tune that probably should have been a single, but perhaps we felt to be a little too long at just over 5 minutes.  \\"Tightrope\\" segues nicely into \\"Telephone Line\\" which was the last single released from the album and which made it into the top 10 in several markets.  \\"Rockaria\\" is next, another single, but a bit of an unusual one but that is one of the things which I like about it.  The first side closes with \\"Mission (A World Record)\\" which is probably my favorite track from the album.  Clearly not a single, but yet it is a piece which is very memorable.    The second half of the album opens with \\"So Fine\\", an upbeat piece, especially after \\"Mission\\" and it includes a wonderful bridge section which makes it unlike anything else on the album.  Next up is \\"Livin' Thing\\", which is one of ELOs most recognizable songs and a great single.  \\"Above the Clouds\\" is next, another very different piece with some simple instrumentation and the shortest piece on the album.  \\"Above the Clouds\\" leads directly into the single \\"Do Ya\\", which was originally done by The Move, Lynne's former group.  The album closes with the longest piece, the wonderful, and again unusual, \\"Shangri-La\\"    \\"A New World Record\\" is an underrated album by an underrated group.  The performers on the album are:  Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy, Kelly Groucutt, Mik Kaminski, Hugh McDowell, Melvyn Gale, along with some guests.  I put this album between 4 and 4.5 stars.
0143118706|1.0|How on earth did this book come to be published?? And how is it getting more than 2 stars?? It's the whiniest, most self-indulgent, self-absorbed research paper/rant I have ever read. Her refrain, as other reviewers have noted, is indeed, \\"What's in it for me? What about me? How does that help me?\\" It gets old. Fast. I read the entire book because I stubbornly held onto  some idea that I might get to the end and the whole thing would be worth it somehow. That moment never came. I should have put it down after the first chapter. I did get a little misty while reading the last chapter, but I think that had mainly to do with the niece and nephew...    She seems to have forgotten everything she supposedly learned and all her zen-like qualities that she supposedly gained from her EPL phase. She is right back where she started in EPL: paranoid, entitled, needy, sulky, with way too high an estimation of her own intelligence, beliefs, sense of humor, and opinions. I liked EPL, I liked her narrative voice (even though I don't agree with a lot of what she said), and I liked the optimistic and perseverant quality of herself in that book (or at least how she portrayed herself). That said, the same Liz Gilbert did not write both books. Her voice in Committed is a shrew's shrill, harping, whiny, bitter, unrelentingly pessimistic screech. At first, I tried to discover which voice is really hers, but after slogging through this entire book, which felt as weighty and uninspired as an encyclopedia, I don't think I care anymore. All I know is that I will be hard pressed to ever pick up another of her books. And I'm writing this review to warn readers to stay away from this book. There are so many worthier uses of your time.    This woman loves to research everything, it seems. Instead of researching, why doesn't she just get in touch with herself? Or don't. But stop obsessing and second-guessing yourself for months on end. Does it really matter what other people think? In America today, a man and a woman can pretty much craft whatever kind of marriage they both want. If the man wants to do all the cooking and let his wife sit in an easy chair and drink wine, then more power to them. If they want to write up a pre-nup, no one's going to stop them. Was this really a revelation to the author? Seems pretty obvious to me. Does it really matter what all her girlfriends here in America and women from rural Laos think about marriage, children, feminist issues, and so on? Why do all these things matter? Why can't she just quietly examine her own love for Felipe and his love for her and come to a decision, instead of going on and on and on about how much marriage exacts from women, how much men benefit from marriage, how many women in her family gave up their dreams for marriage? I think she likes making things a lot harder than they really need to be. Or maybe she just needs drama in her life. That would explain a lot.    In addition to her obsession with all things marriage, she also throws in a good deal of her opinions about social conservatives. Could she hate conservatives more? I doubt it. She blames them personally for just about everything she can. She blames them for her family's women giving up their dreams and \\"scraping the walls of their souls\\" in sacrifice for their husbands and families; never mind that her mom and sis are happy in their marriages. She blames conservatives for conditions throughout the decades and centuries which she will never even have to experience. I suppose she's complaining on behalf of her ancestors. Even though she blames conservatives for encouraging mothers to stay at home with their children, she admits that when her own mother quit her job and stayed at home to raise the author and her sister, the girls loved it. She is quick to follow up this admission with the fervent desire that her mom had been able to have both a fulfilling career and a happy, nurtured family. She says everyone's lives got better when her mom quit her job, except her mom's life. (It is ironic that near the end of the book, the author discovers a theory that she claims to be her salvation, served up by none other than Ferdinand Mount, a conservative Brit.)    Which brings me to the idea of \\"having it all.\\" This author has bought into the feminist idea that a woman can have everything she wants, and that's a shame. She doesn't seem to know that for every thing we choose, there is something else that we have just given up. There is no possible way to have everything we want. If we choose Option A, then that means we won't have enough time/energy/money for Option B. She seems to take this law as a personal insult/challenge. Just as a person cannot be in two places at the same time, there is no way that a person can have every single thing she wants. Priorities are made, decisions are made, and hopefully we made the best choice. This isn't something the author is willing to do.    And the fact that she keeps blaming Homeland Security for her impending marriage and insists on calling the refusal to let Felipe into the country \\"deportation\\" makes this author come across as a spoiled teenager. For being as smart and well traveled as she is, it's impossible to believe that she had no idea that Felipe's coming into the country for 90 days at a time several times per year would be sure, eventually, to be scrutinized and put to a halt. And enough whining about how hard it is to get all the various documents in order. Many others have done this same thing; somehow they figured it out.    This author is best when she tells stories and anecdotes. Those gleaming moments came too few and far between and lasted all too briefly in this book. I got so excited when she would start talking about how Felipe mixes up his idioms and words, like \\"Nobody sings until the fat lady sings,\\" or when he says \\"lulubells\\" and means \\"lullabies.\\" Also, when she told stories about people, dogs, chickens, and frogs she met in her travels.Or describing her conversations with her niece about what constitutes a proper marriage or describing her niece's impromptu wedding ceremony in the kitchen. But those storytelling segments never lasted very long, and then she would be back at the horse's side, beating and beating the poor thing, even though he was long dead. She goes on for pages and pages, draws a conclusion... and then says, \\"BUT,\\" at which point the reader knows he's in trouble. She's going to take the whole issue apart again and reassemble it from a different angle. It's so obvious from her writing that this lady is up to her eyeballs in neuroses. I think she undid every positive thing that happened to her in ELP. She's regressed and her readers are only some of the people who are suffering from this development.     Poor Felipe. You know she's going to make his life miserable. Run, man, run! And reader, spare yourself, too! Skip this one.

Its combination of rousing ensemble songs and poignant solo, duet and trio ballads is just right and this version includes some great extras, like 18 Jean Valjeans from around the world singing \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" in turn and together.  I liked the 2010 25th anniversary performance at the O2, but must admit that the singing on this recording is better.   Well worth the price!

1401207510|1.0|Format aside this is one of Moores worst works ever. Its really just a rambling dabbling pornographic exercise in fantasy(as stated by more at the end). Sad, I had hopes for future LOEG books but its obvious with this and 1910 that moore is simply mining other peoples material and struggling to jam some \\"new and depraved\\" pieces into the puzzle.<br />After reading the regular hc I hoped to be able to sell it before tooo many other people had read it. I did, but took a big loss on it because its such a crummy book. Not like his other two LOEG books which inspired a crummy movie, perhaps it was this movie which inspired moore make another LOEG comic, but this time a crummy LOEG comic.

1594202842|5.0|The story of how she raised her daughters 'the Chinese way' is entertaining, and very thought-provoking.  I think that what I took out of it was a few questions/conclusions:    1- Should I be investing more in my kids?  Sometimes it's easy to be lazy, to come home tired from work, to let the kid play by himself and be relieved that he doesn't seem to need any attention today.  But her 'work ethic' puts me to shame. Despite a much more demanding job than mine, she spends hours every day working with her kids on their music and studies, drilling them, pushing them.  Let's put aside that she took it to wild extremes which I would not do.  It still makes me think that I should do more.     2- Should I be more strict with my kids and insist more on things related to education, music, sports etc?  Again, I am not considering becoming a fanatic, but maybe I should take an assertive role.    3- What is 'success' as far as our long-term and short-term goals for our kids?  For her, success is 'being number one' in something and everything else is failure.  She says that Western success is just 'being happy'.  I think that as a parent my take on this is that I would want my children to be above average and I do want them to have careers that make them comfortable financially.  But I don't think that being number one is the recipe for happiness by any means.  There has to be a balance.  But she did get me thinking about rewarding children for grades on a sliding scale, and maybe she's right that children should only be rewarded for A's.  That does set the bar high and push them to achieve more.    4- Does it really matter that her children were music prodigies?  Was it really worth the effort, for them and for her, and everything that was missed in order to practice so many hours a day?  Will that really bring them so much closer to success in whatever field they choose?  Doesn't it all balance out in the end when everyone is in college and then it doesn't matter so much who was the smartest in 5th grade anymore or who was a 'prodigy'?  In the end, other people find the same successes as child prodigies without being child prodigies.  I am sure that most of the other law professors at Yale who reached the same success as her had varying types of parents and were allowed to have a childhood as well.    Anyway these are just a few musings about the book, and I have this book to thank for getting this discussion onto the table in our house and getting me thinking about these things.
0439023513|4.0|When I got to the final book in the series, I knew something bad was coming. Because of the seething reviews I briefly skimmed trough, while trying to shield my eyes from spoilers. After it was over, I cried for about 10 minutes (embarrassingly enough), so I get where the confusion and anger comes from. I was more saddened than angry though. So many shattered memories, so many unanswered questions. But there's no need to turn MJ into a witch hunt for mrs. Collins. A lot of the crazed disgruntled fans here remind me of the sadist from Misery (Stephen King). Do I recommend it? Yes. Would I read it again? No, it's way too depressing for me to want to re-experience.      I would give it 3 1/2 stars, but I rounded out and gave 4.

B000002KET|5.0|Just a short review...<br /><br />To me, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) represents Black Sabbath at their peak.  This album has more of a \\"polished\\" sound, in my opinion.  The sound isn't as \\"raw\\" as on, say, Master of Reality (1971).  Instead, the production values are higher, very much like they are on Paranoid (1970).  The songs are slightly more poppish (though hard rock at the core) compared to their previous albums up to that point.  Songs such as \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\", \\"Spiral Architect\\", and \\"Looking For Today\\" are examples.  This album also features a little more use of keyboards and synthesizers.  Rick Wakeman, keyboardist for Yes, was brought in as a session player for the song \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\".  A couple of the harder, more raw edged songs are \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" and \\"A National Acrobat\\".<br /><br />Black Sabbath's music has been hugely influential to so many artists over the years, especially when it comes to their first five albums.  If you like your hard rock Black Sabbath style, then this is one of the best they have to offer.  I highly recommend this classic album.

0375850864|4.0|This is not a high action or humorous read so it will appeal to stronger, confident readers in grades 4-6. A well told story with good moral implications.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|The book is so much better because it creates such a heroine who has so many trials, tribulations, values and essence. Also Bronte gave us the greatest romantic hero in Rochester. The love between Jane and Rochester didn't fall victim to passion's trap, it endured because of their compatability. So for that reason I was disappointed, for me the ending is so important. The depth of their love reveals itself, Jane is so accepting and playful. Bronte does what Austen never would --- give us the romantic scene and dialaog and the man's point of view instead of censoring them. So I didn't like the ending, it really felt like the director had run out of time and just stuck it in. Other reviewers have said that 2 hour was just not long enough, I agree, although I think the whole Rivers episode is a yawn and should be left out if possible (its a weak part of the book, who cares about Syngen Rivers and his boring sisters?) But the whole Lockwood story is really important to show how Jane develops and is both worldly and other wordly.    On the other hand Mia Waslowsky has to be hands down the best Jane Eyre I have ever seen on screen. She could have been a little fiestier but she expressed so much with her eyes. I felt like Fassbender was trying to channel Toby Stephens from the other adaptation. Fassbender was great in some scenes and believable and strong. But he was a terrible kisser! Lost all his sex appeal for me when I saw him with wooden shoulders trying to \\"peck\\" Jane Eyre.     Finally have to get to my favorite adaptations -- has to be Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine because Rochester is supposed to be scary. BBC one with Timothy Dalton is the best one for understanding the whole novel (as they hardly leave anything out), but the Jane Eyre in it is so annoying with all the foundation trying to cover her zits. And Dalton is too dramatic sometimes. Toby Stephens one is very good but doesn't use the great dialog enough.     So like my favorite all time Bronte Adaptation-- 1939 Wuthering Heights -- Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier, the old black and white movie with the great actor wins hands down.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Great BUY!  I recommend this to everyone!  What a fun movie...my 3 year old loved it so much that he is begging me to let him watch it in 3D!

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I pre-ordered ADWD and I repurchased and reread the first four books.<br />ADWD SUCKS!!!!! AHHHHH! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This book was SUCH a disappointment.<br />Let's be clear, I enjoy Mr. Martins' writing style. His depth of character, wicked twists, breathtaking descriptions and a world that is unique and realistic.<br />However, this particular book SUCKED BEYOND ALL THAT HAS EVER SUCKED BEFORE!!! I feel that this book is a stalling tactic for the HBO series to pull new fans into the series (AND the next two books) in order to make as much money as possible. I think Mr. Martin is fully aware of the suckyness of ADWD, and as a fan all I can do is SMDH. Shame on you Mr. Martin! It could still be good even if it was just a place holder!<br />This book was a drag, a bunch of new characters I DO NOT CARE ABOUT (I have been trained by Mr. Martins previous 4 books not to care too much for any character as they may be killed off at the drop of a dime) I was bored with all the traveling here and sailing there and eating locusts and puppies and other nasty stuff, and still not tying up any conflicts, old or new, just creating more and more and more conflicts. Enough is enough. I first started the series 2001 and I am too through! I have also told all my friends and family who I bragged and bragged to about this series to that it is a big fat waste of time. I am selling my books to a newbie to the series. They won't know any better. SMDH.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|For what this album has tried to accomplish, I'll give it 5 stars. I remember first buying it, and from the opening cut, being like \\"what is this?\\" As with other albums, this one has had years to grow and it takes a place in my collection as a profound collection of songs and visions. You get your '70s movie setting with the opening. But \\"The Healer\\" brings one essence of the album together: HIP-HOP. This album has some serious hip-hop beats and influence worked to profound effect. \\"Me\\" is straightforward until the horn solo at the end. Listen to what Erykah is saying and you'll get it. \\"My People\\" sounds like a Ring Shout, and a well done one with a simple beat. \\"Solider,\\" is another straightforward hip-hop track about social ills, and a clear highlight. \\"The Cell,\\" I had to read the lyrics from the booklet. Once I did, I knew this track was dope. More hip-hop, a bit of repetition at the end. \\"Twinkle,\\" probably named for its sound effect throughout the song  contains what I think is a centerpiece of the album: the \\"dystopian\\" vision at the end that takes up 2:41 of the track. I forgot which movie it comes from, but it serves as one of the album's message. I love the track as a whole. Ms. Georgia Anne Muldrow makes an appearance on \\"Master Teacher,\\" which asks a HEAVY question as its hook. Props. She switches off the hip-hop at the midpoint to prepare us for the grand soul offering that comes next: \\"That Hump.\\" No one does storytelling of life issues like Erykah (Penitentiary Philosophy from Mama's Gun rings a bell), and this one is no different. It even comes with a Motown-like jazzy interlude in the middle. Great stuff here! And you can listen to the words and get that message in.    Ending the regular portion of the album is Telephone, E's tribute to J-Dilla. It's a haunting track that does not need much explanation. It is so great that a guy at the end (it might be ?uestlove doing the drums) exclaims that he was moved in few words. And, for those wanting the upbeat soulful track, you have a nice dosage of Honey at the end.    Yes, this is quite a different Erykah. She wanted to give us her vision of the problems in our world, at least that's how I interpret this. Infusing hip-hop all over this disc, I think she does a remarkable job that is not in-your-face preachy. You can still enjoy a great number of tracks by the beat alone. But I always aim for a message in music. And I got it here, which is why I call this album one of my favorites.
B0007RT9LM|4.0|Actually appreciate this movie considerably more after watching for at least the third time. Definitely an underrated offbeat light-hearted comedy IMVHO (in my very humble opinion). Well acted, good story, entertaining; co-starring a couple baaabes, piper perabo and brigit moynahan. Raucous bar.. rockin' leather pants.. chicks high steppin', struttin' & bootin' it right up on the counter..  OH YA.. Totally recommend!
0316098329|5.0|Wow. Be prepared to sit and read a book and not move for hours and hours. This book was fantastic! It was so challenging to read, knowing that this kind of thing happens in real life, but so hard to put down.     Room is told from the perspective of five year old Jack, who was born in an 11x11 storage shed turned into room, and has never been outside the four walls. His mother was abducted at 19 and held in this room for the last 7 years. He doesn't understand that \\"outside\\" is a real place and that the things on tv are true and real.     It's heartbreaking to read the story, \\"written\\" by Jack, and hear his thoughts and his feelings and his challenges in life. It's saddening to hear what he considers to be normal, and then to read about his adjustment into the real world.     Emma Donoghue somehow taps into this unknown world of a little child's mind in an incredibly strange situation. It's completely captivating, and incredibly interesting. For the first time since having kids, my husband went to bed and I had to stay awake and read.

0061928356|5.0|Lately I've been fascinated by life in India. I've read quite a number of books based on Indian culture. This one had an incredibly startling beginning (although knowing the title, I shouldn't have been too surprised), and kept going from there! What a great depiction of life for the average person in India!     Gowda's writing is fantastic - it's simple and easy to read, yet captivating for those who are accustomed to a higher level of literature. It was such an easy read, yet moving on so many levels.     I thoroughly enjoyed The Secret Daughter, and can't want to read another book by Gowda!

0300169787|5.0|This is a beautiful, picture-full, book packed with quotes and explanation of the pictured designs and seasonal lines from the late-great Alexander McQueen. The cover is a hologram image that is a picture of Alexander that morphs into the skull pictures on the item images. I have the book on my coffee table, and my guests always make comments about how neat the book looks, and when they open it, they are stuck, flipping the pages of the beautiful artwork that was/is the Alexander McQueen fashion line. I recommend this book for anyone who is in search of a cover to cover McQueen handbook that will undoubtably be an eternal treasure of his life work. This would make an amazing gift for any fashion, costume, or MCQ fan.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Although comletely superior to the previous entry in the series &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34; still falls short of the gripping page turning naure of &#34;A Game of Thrones&#34;.<br /><br />The novels greatest flaw is simple really; Theconcept of plans going completely awry is so over embelished it's painful. From the first word you can easily make logical leaps regarding the rest of the novel.<br /><br />Still, it's more competently written and presented than most fantasy being published at the moment. I enjoyed the ride, even if the trip failed to pull me in.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|After watching the opening scene (which seemed to be taken directly from one of my favorite books: [[ASIN:B003URRSX2 Gods of Ruin: A Political Thriller]]), the plot from Phillip K Dick's short story took hold (a team of adjustment specialists freeze people and adjust reality in order to conform to \\"the plan\\"). The story is wild and the production/acting is great, but I started getting bored toward the end and the finale left me unimpressed.    One ironic philosophical twist was how the screenplay writers tied the concept of free will for humanity with fascism and the wars of the 20th century. When the adjustment bureau left it up to the humans to act according to their will, we devolved into totalitarianism. I'm not sure what this says about the producers' view on freedom, but I don't think it's positive.     AB is certainly a conversation starter though and worth the watch!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Why on earth are all you adults moaning about this film, it is a CHILDRENS movie, it is aimed at them. It doesn't matter if you liked it or not, did the children I asume you took to see it enjoy it? Mine did, he hasn't stopped talking about it and we went on release day! He loved it, if I go to a child's movie with my son, i am not expecting \\"gone with the wind\\", or to be intellectually challenged, I go so he can enjoy it. Actually, I did too, its meant to be a \\"James Bond\\" type, lots of chases, explosions, etc. And it delivered in spades. Just watch with an open mind, dont expect \\"oscars\\", and you will not be disappointed.
0767827902|5.0|This is the classic by which others must be considered.  Of course, this possibly applies only/mostly to persons who grew up in the 1950s and identify with the lives and the times of small town Texas/Oklahoma/Kansas/etc. I doubt seriously that folks who grew up in, say, Manhattan or the Bronx, during those times will have a clue as to what's going on (but I guess the same could be said about a lot of things).

0393324818|5.0|I'm not a baseball fan, nor do I really understand baseball statistics. So why did I buy this book? Mostly because I am a huge fan of Michael Lewis and because I was interested in the creative use of statistics by Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's.    So what is this book about? In short, this book tells the fascinating story of Billy Beane, the person who changed the baseball world for good by changing the usage of statistics to evaluate the quality of the players. Billy Beane was an extraordinary person with a unique personality. The sentence below may capture his mind set: \\"Think for yourself along rational lines. Hypothesize, test against the evidence, never accept that a question has been answered as well as it ever will be. Don't believe a thing is true just because some famous baseball player says that it is true.\\" (p.98)    To sum up, as usual, Michael Lewis' writing style is great and very engaging. This book can enjoyed by business and baseball fans alike. Highly recommended.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Received movie very quickly.    If you are not a fan of the Twilight series don't bother.  I read the series of books first and enjoyed them.  The acting in the movies especially the first one was not top notch, but they are getting better.

B0013K8IFU|5.0|There are many albums that have the tag \\"classic\\"- Sergeant Pepper, Zeppelin IV, A Night at the Opera, 1999, Wish You Were Here, Master of Puppets, Number of the Beast, Never Mind the Bollocks, Autobahn, so on and so on.     However when there is a review of electronic music of the late 20th Century, this album deserves the accolades. As other have pointed out, without this blueprint, everything else that followed subsequently, techno,house,trance, ambient,soundtracks alternative rock, drum and bass, dub step and pop would of sounded completely different and arguably poorer without it.    Even people not usually listening to his work have probably been exposed to this music- Pirelli, Orange, Saab, Mercedes, Gary Rhodes, Blue Jam, Top Gear-all feature his soundtracks. (and the Aphex Twin is not the only one-Boards of Canada, Air and Autechre also feature as well)     This is electronica's Sergeant Pepper-it is that important.     Richard D James AKA the Aphex Twin (the \\"Twin\\" is a misnomer), the young unassuming lad from the West Country, was already making a name for himself as a DJ in the early 90's- his terrifying acid house techno storms like \\"Didgeridoo\\" and \\"En trance to Exit\\" were already destroying sound systems, if the infamous \\"Summer of Love `88\\" and Ecstasy tables were making people happy clappy- Mr James was bringing the bad acid microdots with him-his music was dark, angry industrial noise, and had more in common with Cabaret Voltaire, Throbbing Gristle and Front 242 than Bomb the Bass or S'Express.    \\"Ambient House\\" had already been realized with the Orb's \\"Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld\\" which mixed steady 4/4 house and techno beats with ambient soundscapes. What makes this album so different is the diversity of styles that make up the disc.    Starting with the haunting \\"Xtal\\", anybody who thinks they are familiar with 4/4 techno or house will be about to tear up the rulebook. The haunting synth line is looped over the top of a dub break beat thatseems almost to crush the melody-yet the interlocking rhythm just seems to add more depth. This is proto-dub step almost 20 years before Burial (who many thought was RDJ!) \\"discovered\\" it.    The cross pollination continues, \\"Tha\\" \\"We are the Music Makers\\" \\"Ptolemy\\"  mixes ambient soundscapes with prime time Detroit Techno, the acid washes of \\"Pulsewidth\\", \\"Heliosphan\\" \\"Delphium\\" and \\"Actium\\" contain almost tribal dub beats with pulsing synth lines, the acid bass lines with proto-dub step beats and haunting atmosphere on the magnificent \\"Agispolis\\" and the opening track, \\"I\\" with its ambient homage to the works of Brian Eno and Steve Reich, the techno acid storm of Green Calx, and the brooding dark industrial menace of \\"Schottkey 7th Path\\" and \\"Hedphlym\\"-incorporating textures normally found on the works of  Stockhausen or Doctor Who (the BBC Radio phonic Workshop being a massive influence on the experimental electronic scene). Classical music structures dominate the proceedings, yet it's as infectious as any pop record.    Even within tracks new ideas are introduced that on paper sound at odds with each other, yet produce driving, hypnotic pulses of energy. Tempo's shift with little effort, the melody and the hook are never lost in a sea of beats- and although the original release did have sound production issues, the power and intensity of each track is never lost, such is the strength of the release.      Anybody who says electronic music is \\"repetitive\\" \\"boring\\" or is requires little musically ability needs only to be exposed to this for five minutes to realize that Mr James is a master of the beat. His influence and stature reaches far beyond electronic- Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Phillip Glass, David Bowie, Jean Michael Jarre, Dream Theatre, Dillinger Escape Plan, Tool, Curve, Stockhausen, Madonna (who asked him to re-mix her work, but that's another story!) and almost every contemporary artist and producer has in some way been influenced by Mr James productions.    Do yourself a favour-You Tube \\"Aphex Twin\\", behold the power, then buy his whole catalogue. I did 20 odd years ago and I have never looked back...............
B0050PLT8W|5.0|For some reason, Theory of a Deadman is a band you either love or hate.  For me, it's definate love.  They are one of the few bands that sound just as good in a studio as on the road.  This CD, in particular, comes with some great tunes that you will grow to appreciate.  I think the biggest surprise of this album, for me, is \\"Hurricane.\\"  It's a slightly different sound for the band and I like the direction they are going in.    This CD won't make you a believer, but will simply keep current Theory fans satisfied the band is still alive and rocking.
0061020680|5.0|I was picking at the edges of the Discworld-verse, reluctant and wondering if I should make the time and monetary investment involved in exploring this vast world that for some reason I hadn't explored as of yet.<br /><br />The books are not in a helpful serial order, so there is some intimidation and confusion on where to break into the world.  I looked up (and was pointed to) a handy chart that is available on the internet with a simple [Enter your favorite search engine here] search.<br /><br />There are several arcs that happen, and they weave through each other and touch tangential so it feels like there's no one riht way in (there be dragons that one way though).<br /><br />So, you see, the character of Death gets to star in one arc.  Since Discworld is a lot like our world only different, Death is a familiar archetype twisted.  He has all our trappings, but also has a servant, an adopted daughter, and in this book he takes on an apprentice: the titular Mort.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is one of those books that I have had trouble finding since graduate school sucked the fun out of fiction -- it is engaging and lively enough that I turn off my critical capacity and I just enjoy the ride.  Here I didn't think about the author's intentions or look at the decisions he made about the plot and the characters. I just laughed; I kept turning pages.<br /><br />Ultimately, the best review I can give this book, and that of my experience of the Discworld so far follows: I was half-way through this book when I bought the next two books in the \\"Death\\" story-arc.  I'm worried though.  If I finish those too soon, there's no way I can get the next ones until after the weekend.  It is Thursday already.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|\\"Soul Surfer\\", the movie adaptation of the 2004 Bethany Hamilton Biography of the same title, is a life-affirming, as well as faith-enriching and spiritually-stirring, film not to be missed.     Directed by Sean McNamara (\\"The Suite Life Movie\\" [2011] and \\"The Even Stevens Movie\\" [2003]), \\"Soul Surfer\\" is an excellent film for family viewing. Anna Sophia Robb, \\"Race to Witch Mountain\\" [2009], lead an amazing cast. Dennis Quaid (Academy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actor, 1973) Helen Hunt (Academy Award winner for Best Actress, 1997), Carrie Underwood in her acting debut (multi-Grammy Award winner), Craig T. Nelson (Emmy Award winner, 1992), and Kevin Sorbo (t.v. star of \\"Hercules\\" and \\"Andromeda\\") along with several others did an excellent job portraying family and friends coping with life-altering circumstances. For brevity's sake, my review is broken down into cons and pros of the film.     Negative: (1) The film takes a bit more dramatic license regarding the rivalry between the surfing competitors than the book portrays. (2) The film may appear \\"sugary\\" or \\"cheesy\\" at times when dealing with difficulties encountered such as Ms. Hamilton's way of helping some of the 2004 Indian Ocean and Tsunami victims or Ms. Hamilton's statement at the end of the film.     Positive: (1) It's an unbelievably, true story. (2) It is a well-casted film. (3) The cinematography and surf scenes are a joy to watch. (4) It is family-oriented in the way films were before the 1968 MPAA rating system came into existence.     In conclusion, if you are looking for a film to watch with your parents, siblings, younger family members (7-12 yrs old), or grandparents, then I highly suggest \\"Soul Surfer\\" is the one for everyone to enjoy. It's universal tale of struggle and triumph will have you in tears before you cheer.
B0043GAZYS|3.0|I really enjoyed some of the more off beat humor and retrieved video game references, but some of the secondary actors are less than believable.

His grandson attends the same school as me and so he came on Grandparent's Day to speak at an assembly (and, following him were about three or four news channel cameramen). He talked mostly about what is in this book: his life, his career, etc. I was surprised to find that he was a very interesting speaker. Not that I had expected him to not be, but I hadn't even known who he was at the time- much less that the last man on the moon happened to my classmate's grandfather. All in all, very interesting person and I will totally be buying this book.
B00001OH7X|4.0|The grand finale of David Bowie and Brian Eno's Berlin trilogy, \\"Lodger\\" (1979) is superior to \\"Heroes\\" and comparable to \\"Low.\\" Criminally underrated, the album contains some of the singer-songwriter's finest music: the British hit \\"Boys Keep Swinging,\\" \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" \\"Look Back in Anger,\\" \\"Move On,\\" \\"Red Sails\\" and the classic single \\"DJ.\\" Side Two loses momentum toward the end, but the overall recording displays Bowie in top form.

B000BHHVPO|5.0|Of of the best Live DVDs of any genre, the collection of artists and music captures a unique mix of superstars and up-and-coming artists.  Having McCartney and U2 play together was amazing.  My appreciation for Coldplay increased 10X after watching them on this DVD.  Some of the newer artists like Keane and Kaiser Chiefs really blew me away and I've since followed many of these bands live too.  There are a few duds as with any huge collection. Much of the Philadelphia show bored me, but almost all of the UK Hyde Park show was amazing.  A great DVD for a music fan or casual fan of these artists. Great DVD to throw in on a Sunday afternoon while doing email or whatnot. Disc 1 is so great, we often show it to guests when we have a dinner party. 4 DVDs. Very good.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|an extremely verbose novel that did little to advance the story. not sure why this was so long in the making unless it was to just increase the number of pages. very much a disappointment.
B002WCLG3O|5.0|Paid $10.54 brand new! Shipping was awesome as well. I own both the Blue-ray and the standard DVD. Of course, the Blu-ray is much better. There are one or two shorts that I'm not fond of; however, the majority of the films are great. This will add to the experience of the Halo universe. The short film \\"The Package\\" was quite well done!
B004SIP9U6|4.0|Great movie overall. I laughed and I cried. Paltrow was okay in the film. I think she had chemistry with Fiennes but her reciting Romeo and Juilet was not jaw opening or enchanting like the protrayed in the movie. The only annoying thing was the fact other people were flat out telling Shakespeare his plays. He just wrote the words and someone else gave him the plot/storyline. Could of done without Ben Affleck lol. Other then that, it was great! Nothing to take to seriously.
0440243688|5.0|Child's first novel, The Killing Floor is my least favorite Reacher Novel of the 6 or 7 that I have read to date, and I think that I may call this, his 13th in the series, my favorite.  I love the NY city milieu where Jack spends the entire novel starting with the witness of a suicide on a subway. What a cast of characters that he encounters!  The final battle is the most exciting scene that I can remember Reacher being involved in.  Look, the guy gets into the oddest situations in every novel. They are almost comic book in their outlandishness, but Child has such a way with the character that those of us that are enthralled by Reacher are willing to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. Take this ride and you will have a great time.
B0059R5Q08|2.0|I agree with other reviewers - 2 hours is insufficient. It seems like the movie is broken into 3-5 minute segments of the most important scenes in the book. It's very choppy, rushed, and doesn't really explain anything. If you watch this (and haven't read the book), you're going to wonder what the hell happened between certain scenes. I thought the cast was great, but the movie just didn't flow. If you're looking for a good adaptation, check out one of the BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions; they never disappoint.
0062060554|2.0|The book jacket on my copy of this ploddingly slow and predictable novel had a quote from Dennis Lehane \\"Like Memento on Crystal Meth\\".  Well Mr. Lehane, I beg to differ.  This was so darned slow and repetitive.  I don't think I am giving away any spoilers by discussing the fact that the book's protagonist, Christine, has to relearn who she is on a daily basis and she is able to do this with a journal that we the reader have the pleasure to read ourselves.  Each day when she wakes up it starts almost the same.  It didn't work one iota for me.  Not one twist had me interested or surprised.  And I was particularly bothered by the fact that some days she would start with reading her 200 page or so journal and then add another 70 pages or so which of course would only occur on days when a lot of extraneous stuff was also occurring thus giving her the impetus to write.  The book is a train wreck. Really.  I have never been steered wrong by Amazon's recommendations prior to this one.  In fact, John Hart's new novel \\"The Iron House\\" is next on my list and I was turned onto him when Amazon recommended \\"Down River\\".  I gave it two stars because it held my interest enough for me to finish, but just barely.
B000063DFQ|5.0|\\"Piece of Mind\\" was Iron Maiden's 4th studio album and the first with drummer Nicko McBrain. It was the follow up to their Break through album \\"Number of the Beast,\\" and was their first to reach North America's Billboard charts. \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is the opening song, and right away the energy of McBrain's pounding drums reaches out, grabs you by the neck, and reels you right in. Steve Harris' trademark bass and Bruce Dickinson's amazing vocal range add to the dynamics of every song. As on all Maiden albums, the dual guitars of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are awesome and intense. They compliment each other extremely well. Each and every song on this album is incredible. The lyrics are well written and fitting of Maiden's style, and the energy is phenomenal. Though I know some people might disagree, to me, this is their best album by far!
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I was shocked.  I had been keeping my eyes open for Steely Dan and Thomas Dolby albums...never thought to check Amazon for YES.  Put it in the CD player....and the chills started.  That excitement of hearing YES music I hadn't heard before.  I wasn't disappointed!  Overture made me wonder how it's many themes would be used later in the suite.  Fans of Close to the Edge know this feeing well.  Benoit's voice will make you think Drama.  Steve's guitars and his cultured, exquisite riffs are ever present.  Section three of Fly From Here will make you push rewind to hear it again.  Section 4 is definitely Drama worthy...think a long version of White Car, with great lyrics.  It usually takes me three, four listens to hit the lyrics book...check what I have missed.  Another YES specialty-finding the hidden meanings.  Compared to Close to the Edge or Magnification, Fly From Here (the song) isn't as magnificent (sorry for the pun).  But it's a new YES song and it stands on it's own as a YES suite!  I say HURRAY!  The Man You Always Wanted To Be - very Drama like - could have done without the OOh-OOhs.  Trevon Horne's production is evident throughout...  Hour of Need is a beautiful piece of music!  Unlike anything YES has ever done!  Man, Steve Howe can play inside a man's heart!  Speaking of Howe, many YES fans own his solo stuff.  Solitaire qualifies as a really good Howe solo effort.  Into The Storm brings ya right back to YES music - Drama again.      In conclusion, if you like YES and enjoyed Drama - you will LOVE this album.  I am more of a Close To The Edge, Fragile, Magnification, ABWH fan...less a fan of Drama, Talk or Big Generator..yet I still give this album 5 stars and solidly recommend it to old YES fans and folks looking for good music to listen to.

B004LWZW4C|2.0|It's hard to imagine how far a successful movie franchise can fall until you see it being pushed out to make room for an even larger franchise. Sometimes this is done deliberately, sometimes by accident, and sometimes executive producers think the franchise is so famous they can trim their budget down to sock puppets and still make a buck.<br /><br />I don't really know where X-Men: First Class falls in regards to those categories. Maybe it's a little bit of all three. What I do know is that:<br /><br />1) The X-Men movies helped relaunch the comic book series.<br /><br />2) A thousand mutant-style movies and television shows popped up as a result.<br /><br />3) X-Men Origins: Wolverine tanked.<br /><br />With this timeline, it looks like First Class was thrown together to commit franchise suicide in order to make room for the juggernaut movie crossover that this whole Avengers series is creating (Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc.) Maybe I'm being too harsh. Let us dissect the mutant movie gene, shall we?<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the plot. While it doesn't follow exactly with the comic book timeline, I'm really not that much of a hard-ass. The plot was good: compelling back story, the beginnings of the split between mutants who are pro-normal people and anti-normal people, rifts that create fear of mutants with normal people, a storyline that really made this a good prequel in writing.<br /><br />However, mutant casting just didn't do it for me. Could I have given the movie a pass on this? Of course, but when the majority of the action happens in mutant training and a big battle, you need some people with bad-ass powers. Granted, many of these powers are on the up-rise, since it is a prequel, but the problem is that it is seen as a cut-back in originality and special effects.<br /><br />Beast is a prime example. Kelsey Grammer was a CGI spectacle in the third X-Men movie. What do we get here? A walking, talking blue stuffed animal.<br /><br />Then we have an all-powerful mutant that screams at you in Banshee.<br /><br />In place of Archangel, we have a flying mosquito.<br /><br />Nightcrawler is replaced by his evil twin.<br /><br />We're shown the dangers of hula-hooping without the proper training in Havoc.<br /><br />Mystique shows off her baby fat.<br /><br />Magneto shows he's had a heart all this time.<br /><br />Professor X annoys everyone with his \\"smarter-than-thou\\" attitude.<br /><br />The only things that visually saved this movie hardly had any effects at all:<br /><br />1) Breasts<br /><br />2) Kevin Bacon<br /><br />Most people know this as a formula for movie gold. Everyone loves breasts, and everyone loves Kevin Bacon. In fact, the characters of Emma Frost and Sebastian Shaw seem to be where all the money of the film was invested in, besides having Magneto lift up one ridiculous object. That was the mistake. You could have Emma Frost(played by January Jones) put on gypsy clothes and have Sebastian Shaw(played by Kevin Bacon) throw snaps at people and they would have been stellar. It was the other characters that needed visual safety nets that they never really received, and ended up helping the movie fall into limbo.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie, too, and I kept giving it passes because I wanted to believe, but once Beast came out looking like a life-like Care Bear, it was all over.<br /><br />I give X-Men: First Class two out of five horribly cheap and useless \\"Coming Soon\\" movie posters that should have given us all a heads up for what was coming.gel, we have a flying mosquito.

B0011Z5IUK|5.0|I just turned 30 and i started getting into Zeppelin about 3 years ago and now I cant get enough of them. My 8 year old absolutely loves this CD as well... 5 stars hands down
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have been an avid Gaga fan since 'Just Dance', and since then I have watched her grow as a musician and as a performer. Her last album The Fame Monster was by far one of the greatest works the world has ever experienced...my great-great-great grandkids are probably going to be blasting it some day. Many, including myself, wondered if anything could truly top TFM...the answer is yes...and the album is Born This Way. If you think Gaga is just singing about telephones and boys then this album will CERTAINLY prove you wrong. From the techno beats to the dark lyrics, Gaga leaves us with a work that is made up of many different jewels. Each song is distinct and unlike anything that she has done before. Gaga is able to take her listens on a journey that is both whimsical, yet so raw and genuine.<br /><br />INTERESTING FACT before my review: ALL of the album include the word 'love' in them :).<br /><br />Marry The Night: This song is about Gaga's realization that she'd never be an LA Hollywood sort of girl. Marry The Night represents giving yourself over to your passions regardless of what anyone may think. It's about believing in yourself and knowing that failure is not an option. Marry The Night is probably my favorite song on the album. I love it so much that I am planning on getting the first few lines tattooed on my inner left arm \\"I'm gonna marry the night, I won't give up on my life. I'm a warrior queen, live passionately tonight.\\" I would love to see Gaga make this her next single release, I believe it'd be the most commercially appealing. (10/10)<br /><br />Born This Way: Born This Way was Gaga's first release from the album. Although I do love the message of Born This Way, love yourself and never compromise that for anyone, it's probably my least favorite track on the album. Yes, it is a very powerful song and many people do love it, but for me it's just so easy to overlook in comparison to all of the other songs on the album. I do like the country version (which is on this album at the end) and the acapella version (at the end of the HBO special, in the credits) better! (5/10)<br /><br />Government Hooker: This song fuses techno beats and electronica. It reminds me of something you'd hear in an Eastern European club or something! It's raw, dirty, and sexy all at the same time. Not to mention the chorus is incredibly catchy. My only wish is that it was uncensored to give it the full Hooker effect! (8/10)<br /><br />Judas: Quite easily one of the most popular songs on the album. Judas is so much more than just a song referring to religious figures, it's about falling for the wrong guy again, and again. I've LOVED Judas from the first moment I heard it, which was on my iphone in a bathroom during my 15 minute work break btw lol. The beat is contagious as are the lyrics. I cannot wait to hear Gaga perform this at her next concert. (10/10)<br /><br />Americano: It took a while for this one to grow on me. It has a beautiful latin flare to it and once again that catchy chours is what drew me in. Gaga has explained that the song is about what the American Dream means to her. The lyrics to the song are truthful and symbolic. It reminds me of something you'd hear during an epic movie car chase in Mexico or something. (7/10)<br /><br />Hair: Aww...Hair has a special place in my heart because it reminds me of my jaded high school years. Growing up, like many, I struggled with trying to fit in and of course using my hair as a form of self expression. For some reason I always think of Glee when I hear it, I'm sure they'll use it in their upcoming season. Although it is a very up beat song, it does have a sadness to it. I think Gaga was definitely able to capture what it is like to be an outcast growing up, and she does it through using hair as an incredible metaphor. (9/10)<br /><br />Scheibe:At first I loathed Scheibe with a holy passion. I felt like I needed to be at a German disco or something. However as time grew I realized that it couldn't go skipped. It's definitely a song that supports women's rights, but it is able to get the message across with being too 'I am woman hear me roar!' which is great. I love playing this when I'm driving and working out! (9/10)<br /><br />Bloody Mary: Bloody Mary reminds me of a lullaby...it's sinister, colorful, and rather eerie. If it were a movie...it'd be a Tim Burton movie. It's very dark, yet the lyrics are quite poetic if you take the time to listen to them. It's the favorite track of so many, and although I don't really understand why...I respect it for what it is. But it's still not something I'd blast. (6/10)<br /><br />Black Jesus + Amen Fashion: Has an 80's high fashion runway feel to it, which is precisely what I believe Gaga wanted. It's one of the most unique songs on the album. I also feel that it is a nod to the fashion world, Gaga is a huge fashionista. (5/10)<br /><br />Bad Kids: This is another song that reminds me of my teenage years. It's loud, sloppy, and rebellious. It often seems to get overlooked by many Gaga fans, maybe only bad kids like it : /. It's an incredible song. I probably find myself dancing and singing along to this the most out of any other tracks. I'd love to see this as a single as well, just because the music video would kill! (10/10)<br /><br />Fashion of His Love: This was inspired by Gaga's dear friend, fashion designer Alexander McQueen. It reminds me of New York, high fashion, and a day at the hair salon for some reason lol. It has an incredible upbeat tempo. I love that Gaga was able to turn such a tragedy into something that is not just filled with sorrow. It's a celebration of her and McQueen's friendship. (8/10)<br /><br />Highway Unicorn (Road to Love): I HATED Highway Unicorn the first 5 times or so that I heard it...then one day. It was like something clicked in my head. I remember turning it up one morning and singing along like I'd been possessed! I love everything about it...I can't even begin to describe it! It's just so different. (10/10)<br /><br />Heavy Metal Lover: Another favorite since day one. Heavy Metal Lover is sexual, fun, and enjoyable to grove to. Once again that eastern European techno influence makes its way onto the album. It makes for a great jukebox song to play at the bar or lounge. And no, it doesn't have a trace of heavy metal in it. (10/10)<br /><br />Electric Chapel: This pairs very well with Heavy Metal Lover. Once again it has a great rock-trance like appeal. It's fun to grove too, and I love that Gaga once again incorporates the phrase 'holy fool' which is prominent in Judas. In a lot of ways I feel like this is like...Judas part 2. (10/10)<br /><br />The Queen: Has a regal, yet very modern appeal to it. It is another song about being confident in your abilities, yet once again Gaga is able to get the message across without being campy. It's far from a favorite, but I won't skip it when it's on. The last 3 minutes remind me of Gwen Stefani and Santana. (7/10)<br /><br />You And I: This is Gaga's most recent single. To be completely frank. I prefer the live version way more than the album version. The stomp clap kinda overshadows Gaga's piano and singing. However I love the guitar and the drums. This is just a good old fashion rock love ballad. We haven't had one of those in a while now, so who can complain! And if you know the backstory behind You And I you'll appreciate it even more :) (8/10)<br /><br />The Edge of Glory: Gaga wrote this song for her grandfather who passed away. It's about the last few minutes one has on earth before their life concludes. I especially love that the song starts with a heart beat and ends with a flat line. It's an extra song because it was one of the last projects Clarence Clemons played on before his passing (he also plays in Hair). It has a has a heavy 80's early 90's feel to it. So many songs about death are slow and depressing, but TEOG is really about celebrating the life that an individual has lived. It's an incredible song to hear her perform live on just a piano, but do be prepared for tears if you decide to. TEOG was a perfect album conclusion. (9/10).al Lover is sexual, fun, and enjoyable to grove to. Once again that eastern European techno influence makes its way onto the album.

B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This plays like an old school turn based RPG. It is surprisingly fun and reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy games.   5/5 for story.  The story is different but still cliche. I give it a 5\/5 because this is a mobile phone game and you only have a limited amount of file size before you make a person download the game via WiFi.    4\/5 for art.  The character design bothers me but the sprites look good. It could look better but hey it is still better than others out there.  4\/5 for music.  The music reminds me very much of Final Fantasy 8bit soundtracks. A problem with it would be how much each track starts to sound the same.  4\/5 for character development.  I've played the game for about 15 hours now and the characters are developed...but not as well as they could be. There were moments where I want to know more about a character but the story progresses at a pace where it does nothing to satisfy that curiosity. It gives you a small and but doesn't answer it completely.   Note:  Once I beat the game I'll probably change this review to be more accurate.  On a different note... did anyone read the synopsis from Amazon about this game? It is almost as if they played 5-10 minutes of the game and wrote the entire summary based on that. \\"Eternity Symphony\\" also is not the name of the game.

0470638842|4.0|Chock full of case studies, Socialnomics reiterates everything I've ever learned about social media and its use in the real world. From business marketing to family connectivity and job searching, the social revolution is seemingly unstoppable. If you aren't standing up and taking notice, you could be missing out on life in general.<br /><br />Socialnomics is defined as the revolutionary shift in communications through the value of content created and shared via social media outlets. It's the influence on outcomes - economic, political, relational, etc that make it an impasse in today's world. With billions of users worldwide, social media is \\"Word of Mouth on Steroids.\\"<br /><br />It's a regular occasion when I hear from friends and associates who say, \\"I don't get it. Why do I care that my friends are sitting down to a bowl of cereal. Not only that, but I don't have the time to follow everyone's daily life. I've got my own to live.\\" Socialnomics author Erik Qualman says that people who use social media to share with their connections what they had for breakfast don't understand how to use the tools. Similarly so, those who check their phone every few moments to answer and read the messages from their connections are only wasting their own time.<br /><br />According to Qualman, people should instead check their social networks when they have the time. Waiting in line at the grocery store? Post an update and flip through your connections. Just return home from a great ballgame? Share the score/highpoints and take a moment or two to comment on your friends' posts. It's all about productivity.<br /><br />The social search tool is a powerful way to stay informed on information relevant to you. Looking for a new baby seat? Search \\"baby seat\\" and see what comes up. Your friends may have already gone through the search and found the perfect product. Social media relieves the redundancy of reinventing the wheel so to speak.<br /><br />This is why businesses today don't have a choice on whether or not to use social media, but how well they use it. Social media allows businesses to keep an ear to the ground and monitor the conversations people are sharing about their products or services. Of course, it's important to have a plan for your online spaces. Don't just throw it against the wall to see if it'll stick. Qualman says businesses should know their purpose for being in a particular space online, what success will look like and what pitfalls they may run into.<br /><br />My favorite points from this book:<br /><br />Business:  Instead of shutting down people developing applications relative to your brand or product or sharing videos or content that you generated, think through the possibilities of an affiliation with them. If their content was popular enough to be found, they are influencers and have the ability to be seen.<br /><br />Personal:  Read your social media posts to see what kind of message you are portraying. Everyone has bad days, but you don't go up to friends and say, \\"I'm having a really bad day. I think I'm going to punch someone.\\" Instead, you either avoid people or find something positive to do that will pull you out of your funk. Remember, what goes on the Internet stays on the Internet and you never know who might see your post.<br /><br />Branding:  Everything doesn't require a response. Just knowing what is being said is power. Monitor your key words online, but don't try to control communities. The people have the power.<br /><br />Online ramifications: Everyone has multiple personas - work, home, friend, family...the lines are blurring to these personas. It's important to remember how you influence others, especially in the online atmosphere. Slander, amd cyberbullying are real. As a person, watch yourself. As a business, develop an online policy for employers.<br /><br />Productivity:  It's okay to not know what everyone is doing at all times! Also, allowing oneself to relax on social networks for a bit canincrease your productivity at work.<br /><br />Nothing is New:  Most information is not new. It's just being shared in a different way.<br /><br />Communications: The new generation of youth are not used to public speaking as their older counterparts. Information they give and receive is shared in short 140 character spurts, so even their social interactions are altered by this new<br /><br />Media: All media is influenced by online media. Television, radio and print are multi-media outlets and should use the Internet as an additional outlet or they will fail.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|Daria is such a wonderful show to own on DVD. Who can't appreciate her wit and sarcasm? The original music missing from the show does not bother me at all. Haha, I'm very satisfied since the theme song remained, which was my favorite song from the series. My only complaint would be that some of the discs were scratched, and some of the episodes could not play fully, though the boxset was supposed to be brand new; it was also shrink-wrapped upon arrival. Overall, a great find. I'm very happy with the price I paid.

B00005JKTF|3.0|Since I read his Birdsong (which I thought was amazing) first, I felt Charlotte Gray is a lesser strong book. I had serious questions about the credibility of Charlotte character. Even though she was sent to France for six months, but it didn't seem that long, on a mission, which itself seemed to have flaws. I couldn't tell exactly what she was supposed to accomplish there other than the fact that she spoke French. For a while, I thought she was going to save the Jewish boys from taken away by the Nazis but she didn't. And then I thought she must be on another mission of searching for her boyfriend, whose plane was shot down. She didn't do that either. Instead, she was having sexual relationship with another man while she was on her `mission' and still claimed that she loves her boyfriend. In the end, it was her boyfriend who had to track her down! Some of the historical facts were interesting, although seemed disturbing. I am a fan of Faulks and I like the way he writes. Charlotte Gray, in my opinion, may not win everyone's heart.
B004G600A4|5.0|I was stuck babysitting my sister's while my parents and older siblings weant out. I bought this movie because it was disney and it looked like a great kids movie. I think that I enjoyed it more than they did. The story was absolutly brilliant. There were alot of funny parts in the movie such as the horse maximus which was our favorite. I will never regret buying this movie, the whole entire film was pure enjoyment and it is honestly one of my top favorite movies.

B002ZG9760|3.0|If you think you're going to see a cinematic masterpiece...find another movie to watch.  If you want a sweet, cute piece of fluff to watch on a rainy afternoon, I think you'll like this movie.  It's not worth the time to pick this movie apart and criticize it with more than one paragraph.     Yeah, it's really hard to update Beauty and the Beast - protecting the daughter from drug dealers by hiding her in a house is a weak and unprobable way to keep \\"Beauty\\" locked away to fall in the love with \\"the Beast,\\" but seriously, it's 2011, do you have a better idea?      I was interested in seeing this movie because I like the male lead - despite being a young actor, I think he carries (if that's the right word) himself more maturely than other actors his age.  I really liked him in \\"I Am Number Four\\" so I thought I would give this movie a try.  I also like Neil Patrick Harris in almost any movie and the sarcastic humor his character brought to the table was one of the best parts of \\"Beastly.\\"    Several times in the movie, Lindy (the modern day Beauty) says how she is a sucker for sappy romance.  That is exactly what this movie is...a sappy romance.  But at the same time, it's cute with a happy ending.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|I heard good and bad things about this movie but all in all I would say it is good and is suspenseful, if you can believe it. You immediately start trying to figure out what could be wrong in this scenario but I think it did proved a little twist and something that wasn't my first guess. I would recommend this movie.
0316098337|3.0|This could have very easily been a five-star book.  The premise is intriguing and,  with some minor exceptions,  the author is successful in pulling off the narration by a five year old boy. There are certainly some inconsistencies in the narration,  but these can certainly be attributed to the severity of Jack's entire life in \\"Room. \\"     My only complaint is the seeming obsession with the breast feeding of Jack.  It really doesn't bother me much that Jack is still breast feeding at age five; but the constant referral to Jack \\"wanting some\\" detracts after awhile from what is,  for the most part,  an excellent read.     A mention or two that Jack is still breastfeeding to establish the closeness and dependence of mother and son would have been sufficient and could have enhanced the story.  The constant reference to that fact,  just detracted from the read for me.
B004W1GD4A|5.0|I can't seem to find the right words that accurately express how much I liked this series. I was afraid since this was a reproduction of a previous highly thought of series, it would fall short. However, I think that it has great entertainment value and proved its worth. Very glad that I chose to make the purchase.
0380713802|2.0|Excerpt from the book: \\"In the evening I went looking for a restaurant (-in Cologne). This is often a problem in Germany. For one thing, there's a good chance that there will be three guys in lederhosen playing polka music, so you have to look carefully through the windows and question the proprietor closely to make sure that Willi and the Bavarian Boys won't bound onto a little stage at half past eight, because there is nothing worse than being just about to tuck into your dinner, a good book propped in front of you, only to find yourself surrounded by ruddy-faced Germans waving beer steins and singing the ''Horst Wessel Lied'' for all they're worth. It should have been written in the armistice treaty that the Germans would be required to lay down their accordions along with their arms.\\"    This book is full of clichés (French are arrogant and rude, Italians loud, Germans efficient and humorless etc.). That´s fine with me, I sometimes have the same clichés in mind when travelling (as long as they are not taken to seriously). And as a German I have learned to live with the equasion: Germany = Bavaria (you will not find lederhosen nor polka music (which originates from Czech Republik) in Cologne or beer steins in a town that \\"invented\\" the tiny and infamous 0,2 liter beer glasses. Believe me it takes some time and effort to get drunk in Cologne ;-)) You will find things like that all over in the book due to the fact that he stayed only for a few days in a particular city (at best) or even left a city after a few hours because he dind´t like the surrounding of the railway station. The rest is an exhausting description of hotels (including the search for, the way to and the way back from one), restaurants and trains. Still it´s quite funny here and there, BUT (although Mr. Bryson seems to be a quite sophisticated guy) to claim that germans gather in restaurants to sing the \\"Horst Wessel Lied\\" (a Nazi propaganda song honoring a SA-Sturmführer, who was shot by a communist in 1930) is just plain insulting. I really doubt that Mr. Bryson even knows what the song is about, let alone ever heard it in public (for it´s banned by law in Germany). Someone who writes in all honesty about s**t like that is either mindless of the consequences, malicious or plain stupid.

0380804557|5.0|If you've seen the movie and thinking about reading this book:  Please do!  The book is absolutely amazing.  There were so many parts that were left out b/c of time constraints/bad translation to screen/etc.  I found myself finishing this book very quickly, and very disappointed when I was done.  Mr. Gaiman does a fantastic job of creating a world that is completely full of magic, but doesn't bog us down with page after page of description like some other authors do.
0553801473|1.0|I could not.  I got bored part way through, decided to research what I was missing, found out I wasn't missing anything, discovered the rest of the book was going to be the same, and put it in the recycle bin.  I'm done with this series.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Bought this as a present for my husband and he was super happy. It allowed us to leave our Macbookpro at home and only take the ipads on the backpacking trip to Italy. My husband was able to upload his pics to the ipad with the card reader (We didnt really try the usb at all) and used the app \\"blogpress\\" to add his pics to his blog hosted on blogger very easily. Without the app. you arent able to add pics so dont forget this!
030726999X|3.0|In my opinion, the first book (Tatoo) was great, the second (Fire) was fabulous, and this one was a attempt at a 3rd book based on the notes of the deceased author...worth reading, but it dragged on until the exciting end. Will the heirs attempt a 4th book under the name of this deceased author? Most likely.

B002KVSJ64|5.0|After three records, you would think that Breaking Benjamin has forgotten everything they are good at. No, they still haven't! And it's proof with their fourth record, Dear Agony, which is more in the lines of We Are Not Alone than Phobia or Saturate. The guitars sound more electronic than any other Breaking Benjamin album, that's for sure. My favorites: Fade Away, I Will Not Bow, Crawl(my favorite), Give Me a Sign, Hopeless, What Lies Beneath, Lights Out, Into the Nothing, and Without You.<br /><br />Breaking Benjamin is capable of any good expectations, so I suggest you check out this album, and their other albums.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars

B0051MKNV8|4.0|What if you could advance the quality of your life by being super-smart/creative/talented with the aid of a pill?  What if the pill had deadly side effects and evil people wanted your stash?  This is an exciting and intriguing film with the talented Bradley Cooper in the lead.  He has an everyman quality that is relatable (although at times he seems a bit of a loser which makes the plot turns all the more interesting).  Abby Cornish plays the girl lead and she was great in this action thriller.  One of my favorite parts was her in the park at the rink - great action chops on her.  Would love to see her in more action films in the future.  I liked this film and found it exciting though at times there were some really scary parts.  Two thumbs up.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Perhaps if this book had not come out the same generation as Harry Potter, I would have been more inclined to like it. Maybe that will make more ppl want to read it, but for me, I felt it did not compare. The pictures are interesting but I don't get what all the fuss is about. Big deal - an author stuck a few drawing in his book. I actaully started off liking the book, but about 1/3 through I stopped caring about the characters and the whole plot seemed to slow down. It also annoyed me the whole book is just a setup for the sequal. Yes, books in a series are all like that to some extent, but this one had no arch on it's own.  I will say that if you're set on reading this book and you have a Kindle, I thougth the pictures transferred well.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I'm a wedding photographer so I needed a good flash. This is THE flash to get if you're a Nikon owner. The controls are great. It can work in SU remote flash mode, which is a great feature. Most of the time I use it on manual to avoid the pre-flash that all of the automatic modes use to predict the necessary final flash output.     If you're in the business there is no point buying anything less.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|As of this writing (August 2011), AMD is about to launch the new Bulldozer line. Is this a reason for you to skip the Phenom II line, and particularly this processor? It depends. If you are one of those who always want the latest and most cutting-edge products, then you should wait. But if you want the best bang for the buck, then you should get an X6. Any computer product will no longer be the latest in a very short time anyway, so if you wait for the Bulldozers, you'll just postpone the moment when you won't have the latest or fastest any more. And the very fact that the AMD K10 line is at the end of its market cycle will ensure that you get awesome bargains for an excellent product - if you rush to get it while you can.  My PC is 8 months old now and the 1090T *was* bleeding-edge at the time (the 1100T was still hard to find back then, and the performance gain negligible anyway). It is still certainly more powerful than 95% of all PCs in use out there - and that is being conservative. Yes, if you are a gamer you will probably get better performance *for current titles* with an X4 970 quad-core, or an Intel Core i5 or i7. But I'm not a gamer, and I wanted a general-purpose PC that could serve my needs without worries for years to come, as hardware can be very expensive where I live and I can't afford to make frequent major upgrades just for sport. I've got exactly what I wanted, and I'm very happy.  Don't pay much heed to those who say that you only get real performance gains on a hexa-core if you use optimized multithreading apps, which are still few. This is true (so far), but first, if you think in the long term and want a system that lasts, like me, such titles tend to become more numerous with time (they are already, and this includes games), especially as both Intel and AMD are announcing new 8-, 10- and 12-core processors. Ironically, Bulldozer will make Thubans more attractive because of that, as the software industry will certainly not be indifferent to that trend.  Second, this line of reasoning forgets multitasking, which is another great strength of multicore processors. If you are a more generic user who opens dozens of apps and browser tabs at the same time, an X6 is for you. And if you use virtual machines, you'll love it: what about dedicating 2 or 3 cores to a VM and still getting very good performance outside of it with a tri- or quad-core processor for the rest?  I almost bought the 1055T or the 1075T, because they would be already enough for my needs, but since I wanted a future-proof system, the Black Edition's overclocking possibilities made the deal. There are tests that very nearly equate the performance of an overclocked 1090T to the ultra-fast but outrageously expensive Intel Core i7 980X (at stock, but still...). Well, great to know that. But so far I have felt no need at all to overclock it. At stock speeds, it's lightning fast for everything I tried to do with it. I can't remember the last time anything was slow here - because when this last happened, it was with my old PC. NOTHING is ever slow here, even if I have 30 windows and 20 browser tabs open while I use Photoshop, WinRAR creates a very large archive on a TrueCrypt drive, a virus scan is performed and a video is encoded at the same time - the CPU still yawns at 30% use... (Of course, lots of RAM help, too: I have 8 GB, with Windows 7 x64.) I tried hard to make my 1090T let me down and be slow. I never succeeded. (H.264 two-pass encoding does make the CPU usage go through the roof on the second pass, but it's over so quickly that you'll hardly be bothered with that.)  So the benchmarks say Intel this or that is faster? (Or even Bulldozers, for that matter?) So what? Do you really need anything faster than *this*? Is it worth to pay the extra bucks? I bet the answer is \\"no\\" to both questions. You simply won't see any noticeable improvement. (Also consider that AMD's chipsets are usually vastly superior to Intel's - that's where AMD compensates for the processor performance gap. A more advanced chipset doesn't make the processor any faster, but it allows motherboards for AMD to usually be one step ahead and more feature-rich than Intel's. For example, USB 3.0 and 6-Mbps SATA were available for AMD long before they were for Intel.)  At stock, X6 processors have FABULOUS thermal efficiency. 125W TDP, the spec sheet says? I doubt I've reached half that consumption on more than a handful of occasions. Even in summer (December/January here in the Southern Hemisphere), normal temperatures were still in the 27-30ºC (80-86ºF) range, and when heavily taxing the processor with video encoding I saw it reach 43ºC (109ºF). True that I'm not using the stock cooler but an Akasa Nero 2 (another great bang-for-the-buck deal: cheap, efficiency comparable to much costlier products, and extremely quiet), but the numbers are still impressive. Of course, if you intend to overclock it, you CAN'T keep the stock cooler, because then power consumption and heat grow exponentially - that's a feature of the AMD K10 architecture. Since so far I've felt no need to overclock it, I'd rather stay with the low power and heat of the stock configuration, at least for the foreseeable future.  The 1090T and the 1100T are still great deals, even with Bulldozer looming on the horizon (in many cases, even better *because* of that, with the falling prices), and they are highly recommended if you want a generic system to last for a long time, with good overclocking possibilities. But for most users, the 1055T and the 1075T will probably have even better cost/benefit ratios. Considering the large headroom and idleness I'm seeing with the 1090T nearly all the time, I doubt that the 1055T or the 1075T would perform any noticeably slower for most tasks. And it's not impossible to overclock them either, with excellent results - it's just a bit harder and more technical to do it with the locked multipliers. So, consider them, too, especially as they tend to become dirt-cheap very soon and will offer unrivalled performance for their price.  And if you are still in doubt, pair it with an AM3+ motherboard (they are backward compatible with socket AM3 processors, like all Phenom IIs), or with an AM3 motherboard that can be flashed to support AM3+ processors (Asus and MSI, among others, have such models). This way, if you later decide you want or need a Bulldozer, you can just pop the 1090T out and put the new processor on. But I doubt you'll need that any soon.  Bottom line: it will be hard for you to be disappointed with *any* Phenom II X6 processor. Go for any one of them and you'll love how much so few bucks have bought you.
044654759X|2.0|I should start by saying that I love Nicholas Sparks' books. I have every single one, and I've liked them all.<br /><br />This one however, was terrible. It was not well thought out, predictable, and repetitive. The characters were hollow, and the story was nowhere near original.<br /><br />Save yourself some time and read Sleeping with the Enemy by Nancy Price and Rose Madder by Stephen King. They did it first, and they did it better.
0446619078|2.0|I am a Michael Connely fan and have read many of his Bosch novels, but I found the plot of the Last Coyote very contrived.    The author wanted to put in the surprise at the ending, but ended up losing all credibility in the story.

There is nothing more to Clary's world than the everyday--until reality comes crashing through the thin veil of her mind late one night in a sketch downtown club. One glimpse and Clary's mundane life becomes utterly complex: mother's missing; Simon's hopelessly in love with her; angels exist, so do demons, werewolves, and vampires (aka \\"downworlders\\"); and the only person who seems to know what's going on is the single most arrogant, cold, and freakishly HOT guy Clary has ever seen.

Before she can even remember to object, Clary is thrown headlong into a serious interspecies conflict led by a rogue Nephalim--Valentine--whose very name inspires the shivers. As the whole shadow world struggles to decide whether to combine forces and stop Valentine from claiming the 3 powerful Mortal Instruments or to give in and allow him to fulfill his diabolical plans, it slowly becomes apparent that Clary is the unsuspecting lynchpin.    In order to stop him, she must face a host of challenges--physical, psychological, and romantic--before confronting the ultimate choice to sacrifices what matters to her most, or live with the devastating consequences.    _______________________________________________________________________________________________    **--Spoiler Alert--**    (I won't give away whole storylines, but will hint at things that aren't revealed until bk 3.)    I knew that sooner or later it'd have to come along: my first negative review. However, please bear in mind that I'm not saying not to read these books. Though I got frustrated and sometimes put them down (for the reasons outlined below), I wouldn't have not finished them. Hence the 3 stars (where I was tempted to give 2). I don't think that I will pick up the new *surprise* book 4, City of Fallen Angels though...and I don't really think back on the ones I did read...at all.    That's because this trilogy falls firmly into the group I'd call \\"cotton candy\\": look pretty, smell pretty, melt in your mouth and are gone. They are, seemingly without remorse, a very cheap thrill--a la Twilight & Co.--and for that reason, very hard to put down. I found myself alternatively groaning with gusto and sighing with teen fever.    If you're interested to know the details of why I wasn't so keen on them, keep reading. If not, skip to the next set of stars.    *     *     *    *     *    In particular, these 4 things bothered me:    1) Simon. Love triangles are common enough that I've devoted an entire category to them here. But, some are achieved more or less annoyingly than others. This was not in that group. Simon, Clary's friend-turned-gaggy-crush, doesn't stand a chance--he's a clear 2nd best to the cold, heroic heartthrob, Jace. Although, there is one \\"turn off\\" about Jace that is supposed to make us doubt his destiny to be with Clary, it was so un-deftly played that I never bit. As a result, Simon ended up looking even dorkier than intended, and, well, just grated on my every last nerve.    2) Incessant Foreshadowing. A literary device full of potential, it became something of a dead horse in these books. I knew the answers to the \\"burning\\" questions (and was 100% confident about them) some 500 pages before they were answered. This was, in part, because the narrative was a little too transparent, but also partly because the author spent so much energy trying to keep the questions burning that she smoked the answers out. I like a little more cleverness to my mysteries--otherwise, what motivation do you have  to keep reading a not-particularly-well-written 1500-page series?3) Reckless Manslaughter. Like George in HP, a sibling of a supporting character dies in the final book. However, this series wasn't brave about it: the character is so minor to the plot as to be useless; its removal more of a hiccup than heartstop--and the motive for doing such an obvious attempt at evoking pathos that I almost laughed...then got angry (see Tweet proof). The poor kid's role--who, unlike George, we never get to know and love--is reduced to something like a cute puppy who gets bopped on the head to make softhearted girls go \\"awww!\\" Truly, this piece of the narrative was ridiculously clumsily pulled off (enough to deserve two -ly adverbs!). If the writing's good, it will evoke tears through its art--not by stabbing the reader in the hand with a fork.    4) Clamoring Clichés...and a lot of familiar motifs. There is a chunkton of rather unoriginal material in this series. I don't necessarily mean the demon/angel/etc lore--but in actual motifs of the storyline. (Those spoilers I told you about hit most here.)    Brother-sister a(ttra)ction (Starwars)  --> Sociopathic, racist villain whose name begins with \\"V\\"--every mention of which name strikes fear--whom the adults of the book went to school with and knew as a \\"less than purely evil young man,\\" and who plans the purification of the world from inferior races by means of 3 magical artifacts...(Need I go on? Of course, I do mean Voldemort.)  --> A triumvirate of mystical objects, which, when combined, achieve world-changing ends. (Harry Potter series; His Dark Materials trilogy)  --> Heroine who has the power to write or read magical runes/glyphs/letters that alter reality. (the Dreamdark series; His Dark Materials trilogy)  --> Protagonist who discovers they have a powerful parent they've never known when they go off to a haven for their \\"like kind.\\" (Percy Jackson series; His Dark Materials trilogy; Fever Crumb series)  --> Heroine who is small/weak, and needs protecting by the tall, cold, quiet heartthrob. (Twilight series)  --> Tall, cold, quiet heartthrob with burning golden eyes and slightly jealous siblings. (Twilight series)  --> World with a somewhat malevolent group of specially powered rulers, sitting in a remote European corner of the globe, unbeknownst to the rest of society. (Twilight series; Harry Potter Series; Percy Jackson series; Vampire Academy series...)  --> Death of a supporting character's sibling. (Harry Potter series)  --> Etc.    Now, I'm not saying I believe much (if any) of our contemporary literature can claim full originality--it's just not possible, nor would it be much fun. The art of storytelling for the entire history of man has coincided with the art of borrowing. (That was, actually, my masters thesis in a nutshell.) And, J. K. Rowling is a primary example--her work is a virtual collage of borrowed mythic and literary artifacts. However, her story is also extraordinarily complex and subtly original in its own right. The Mortal Instruments books, however, don't have the same complexity by far, and thus their recycling comes across as rather obvious and forced than intriguing, clever, or allusive.    *     *     *    *     *    All in all, if you are looking for an easy, fast, rollercoaster ride through romantic conflict and paranormalcy, I do recommend this trilogy. The love story (and hunka-hunka hero) was enough to pull me through. And, pull me it did, I must admit. I was dying to know what happened to Clary and Jace at the end. But, if you find yourself groaning at the obsessive hint-dropping, see-through emotional triggers, and overall mundaneness of style, don't say I didn't warn you.    [...]
B0007KLH1Y|2.0|Honestly, I'll say it...these are not the funnest blocks in the world.  I personally find them frustrating, unforgiving and rather limiting.   I don't find that they help to spur the imagination much.  Give me and my kids plain old blocks any day, or a nice construction toy like K'nex to play with.   These are an okay block if you don't mind precision fidgeting and constructions that fall down like dominoes, I suppose, but neither me or my kids enjoy that.

0307739961|1.0|You think you are buying the book illustrated, but you are not.  I purchased what I thought was the Vintage Crime edition and instead received the \\"Quercus\\" edition.  Same book?  I suppose, but it doesn't match the others I have own.<br /><br />As for the story itself, Larsson is going off the edge a bit in his depiction of police incompetence and corruption.  You have to suspend disbelief when politicians say that they do not have the power to stop illegal practices. Unbelievable, but still fun.
1416914285|2.0|(This review refers to all three books of the Mortal Instruments Trilogy. It was written for a blog, so excuse the hyperlink references.)    Titles: City of Bones, City of Ashes, and City of Glass    Clary lives as normal and uncomplicated a life as anyone can in NYC--bohemian mom, quiet best friend Simon, father-like family friend Luke... There is nothing more to Clary's world than the everyday--until reality comes crashing through the thin veil of her mind late one night in a sketch downtown club. One glimpse and Clary's mundane life becomes utterly complex: mother's missing; Simon's hopelessly in love with her; angels exist, so do demons, werewolves, and vampires (aka \\"downworlders\\"); and the only person who seems to know what's going on is the single most arrogant, cold, and freakishly HOT guy Clary has ever seen. His name is Jace, and he calls himself a Nephalim--half human, half angel.    Before she can even remember to object, Clary is thrown headlong into a serious interspecies conflict led by a rogue Nephalim--Valentine--whose very name inspires the shivers. As the whole shadow world struggles to decide whether to combine forces and stop Valentine from claiming the 3 powerful Mortal Instruments or to give in and allow him to fulfill his diabolical plans, it slowly becomes apparent that Clary is the unsuspecting lynchpin.    In order to stop him, she must face a host of challenges--physical, psychological, and romantic--before confronting the ultimate choice to sacrifices what matters to her most, or live with the devastating consequences.    _______________________________________________________________________________________________    .  **--Spoiler Alert--**    (I won't give away whole storylines, but will hint at things that aren't revealed until bk 3.)    I knew that sooner or later it'd have to come along: my first negative review. However, please bear in mind that I'm not saying not to read these books. Though I got frustrated and sometimes put them down (for the reasons outlined below), I wouldn't have not finished them. Hence the 3 stars (where I was tempted to give 2). I don't think that I will pick up the new *surprise* book 4, City of Fallen Angels though...and I don't really think back on the ones I did read...at all.    That's because this trilogy falls firmly into the group I'd call \\"cotton candy\\": look pretty, smell pretty, melt in your mouth and are gone. They are, seemingly without remorse, a very cheap thrill--a la Twilight & Co.--and for that reason, very hard to put down. I found myself alternatively groaning with gusto and sighing with teen fever.    If you're interested to know the details of why I wasn't so keen on them, keep reading. If not, skip to the next set of stars.  .    *     *     *    *     *    In particular, these 4 things bothered me:    1) Simon. Love triangles are common enough that I've devoted an entire category to them here. But, some are achieved more or less annoyingly than others. This was not in that group. Simon, Clary's friend-turned-gaggy-crush, doesn't stand a chance--he's a clear 2nd best to the cold, heroic heartthrob, Jace. Although, there is one \\"turn off\\" about Jace that is supposed to make us doubt his destiny to be with Clary, it was so un-deftly played that I never bit. As a result, Simon ended up looking even dorkier than intended, and, well, just grated on my every last nerve.    2) Incessant Foreshadowing. A literary device full of potential, it became something of a dead horse in these books. I knew the answers to the \\"burning\\" questions (and was 100% confident about them) some 500 pages before they were answered. This was, in part, because the narrative was a little too transparent, but also partly because the author spent so much energy trying to keep the questions burning that she smoked the answers out. I like a little more cleverness to my mysteries--otherwise, what motivation do you have  to keep reading a not-particularly-well-written 1500-page series?    3) Reckless Manslaughter. Like George in HP, a sibling of a supporting character dies in the final book. However, this series wasn't brave about it: the character is so minor to the plot as to be useless; its removal more of a hiccup than heartstop--and the motive for doing such an obvious attempt at evoking pathos that I almost laughed...then got angry (see Tweet proof). The poor kid's role--who, unlike George, we never get to know and love--is reduced to something like a cute puppy who gets bopped on the head to make softhearted girls go \\"awww!\\" Truly, this piece of the narrative was ridiculously clumsily pulled off (enough to deserve two -ly adverbs!). If the writing's good, it will evoke tears through its art--not by stabbing the reader in the hand with a fork.    4) Clamoring Clichés...and a lot of familiar motifs. There is a chunkton of rather unoriginal material in this series. I don't necessarily mean the demon/angel/etc lore--but in actual motifs of the storyline. (Those spoilers I told you about hit most here.)    Brother-sister a(ttra)ction (Starwars)  Sociopathic, racist villain whose name begins with \\"V\\"--every mention of which name strikes fear--whom the adults of the book went to school with and knew as a \\"less than purely evil young man,\\" and who plans the purification of the world from inferior races by means of 3 magical artifacts...(Need I go on?

B004ZZLX5W|5.0|I already own the first release, and I didn't mind purchasing this version one bit. They deserve it, so if you have the cash to spend, pick it up!
B004G6009K|5.0|After being kind of dissaponted with Princess and the Frog, i didn't have much expectations with Tangled, BOY I WAS WRONG!! This is THE BEST princess movie Disney has produced, and yes, that includes all the classics... Snow White is a beautiful movie and was an exceptional achievement for it's time, but if you leave outside the \\"this is the untouchable all time classic princess story\\" factor, you will find that these two musicals are similar in many ways (the hilarious and visually stunning singing act performed by the criminal gang in the Little Duck resembles so much the Silly Song act), the biggest difference being that Tangled ads an adventurous side to the story wich makes it both appealing to girls and boys, my four year old boy gets bored with Snow White but enjoys Tangled from start to end. All the singing acts are excellent and deserve to be staged in Broadway (no kidding). It simply haves the perfect balance between excellent storyline, caracter development, humor and stunning visuals (you really have to see in 3D the scene where Maximus destroys the dam!!!!). It's so sad that a poor handled promotional campaign prevented this movie from achieving the success it deserved with the only upside being that the 3D combo comes at an excellent pricing, i really, really, REALLY recommend this movie to everyone.
1451629184|5.0|Very great book, but also not for the younger readers as it is very graphic.  This story needed to be told.  America (and the rest of the world, for that matter) needs to hear this story, too often rape gets swept under the rug and the raqpist gets let out on parole after a few years for \\"good behavior\\".  This was a very fast read, and this was the only book I have ever cried while reading.  They were not sad tears, but joyful for when she was recovered and was waiting to be reuinited with her mother.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|\\"It works better when you're smart to begin with,\\" (or something like that). This is one of the great lines in the movie and pretty much sums up the movie in one sentence although for me it goes more like this:<br />\\"The movie works better when you're not too smart to begin with,\\" (or something like that).<br />The reason I say that is because first of all the initial premise of the movie i.e. you can utilize 100% of your brain is flawed. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that we use only 10% of our brains. We already use 100% of our brains! The 10% statement may have been started with a misquote of Albert Einstein. If we didn't then we wouldn't have all these people that are crippled for life after a bullet to the brain or any other brain trauma for that matter since most of it isn't used anyways! Anyways, knowing this I still gave the movie a chance since it seems to be pretty popular so it must still be worth watching I figured.<br />And it is worth watching for the entertainment value it provides and the special effects.<br />I really dug how they did the drug effect's. Anyone who has come down off of a caffeine high, smokers high, or any other non natural drug should be able to relate to how Eddie Morra feels and the associated withdrawal of coming off drugs. Although, some of the effects did enter LSD/peyote territory with strange future like flashbacks.<br />The film did a pretty good job of portraying what it feels like to be considered highly intelligent. Like they say knowledge is power and it's just like in the movie when you are smarter than all those around you first of all your confidence it greatly improved. If someone is trying to kill you as we see with his girlfriend in the park you don't cry like a baby because you see 10 different ways to defend yourself using your brain and instantly jump into action. You become fearless to a certain degree. Intelligence will tell you in 9 out of 10 cases best thing is to run away. That is why the fight scenes with Eddie weren't realistic at all because even if he knew all the moves from reading or watching movies he would still need practice to skillfully execute the moves. It'd be like being able to read music and know how an instrument works doesn't mean you can actually play one! Learning multiple languages was not far fetched since he would have the memory recall and mental speed to pick it up quick. Once again he would not come off as smooth sounding as in the movie unless he lived in those countries learning the language because there are some things you just can't pick up in books. For example, when I lived in Japan I decided to learn the language from a book it was easy enough but when I went out in the street and actually talked to the Japanese they thought some of the stuff I said was funny or archaic since it's not used it everyday speech. I guess a  As we saw with Eddie at a cocktail party no topic is off limits because your superior intellect allows you to store tons of vast amounts of useless but entertaining information. It can come in handy sometimes though like with the law school girl in his apartment complex and yes you are able to recall information you've skimmed or seen on tv years ago although sometimes you do have to dig a bit and it may not be as accurate as portrayed in the movie. The again the thing with being highly intelligent is that others rarely question your information because their limited recall of facts and figures rarely allows them to dispute these vast stores of information in your brain. I didn't find the whole getting laid due to intelligence credible in real life but in the movie Eddie is not only good looking but intelligence so I guess it's a win win situation for him.<br />The other part I found believe and liked was how the movie showed that even though this guy is now super intelligent it doesn't mean he's going to take over the world nor does it even guarantee any sort of success at all. For example, just like in real life he has to go out and try to find someone willing to loan him some cash to really get his feet off the ground and if he was really smart I can't imagine him going to a shady person for it unless he did the risk/benefit ratio analysis beforehand and even then I don't think any benefit is worth getting cut at the waste as having your skin tied around your head as the Russian mafia guy mentioned. Also, later in the movie the DeNiro character mentioned gave him some wise advice and tried to show him intelligence is only a tiny part of the picture in being successfull in business telling him how backroom deals, networking, etc also play a big part.<br />Now the downsides to being smart is that you see flaws everywhere and this is how it ties in to this probably being a better movie for those that aren't too smart because first of all you'll fall for the 100% brain thing and think geez wouldn't it be cool to be supersmart? Yeah it can be cool at times like I mentioned but then there are the downsides like the flaws which you try to ignore but cannot since they stick out like a sore thumb. It's just like when Eddie was looking over the documents DeNiro handed him in the limo and right away he was able to see all the flaws and errors. So it's the same when watching the movie. They aren't too bad but the twists don't work too good though since you already know way ahead how things will end.*** SPOILERS ***<br />For example the lawyer stealing the pills out of coat.<br />Other mysterious guy coming out of nowhere also taking pill.<br />DiNiro character asking for favor.<br />The film started off strong and did pretty good at being consistent till near the end where it seems that the writer got in over their head and so they started inventing stuff to conclude it. For example, Eddie almost killed by Russian mob because he ran out of pills but someone at last minute he stabs guy and drinks his blood and saves himself. Don't know how they left this flaw in film since even Russian guy explained that shooting up drug more faster since it goes straight to brain. Licking it up off floor would be same as swallowing tablet! Even after all this Eddie shrugs off all deaths in apartment as done by previous tenants although if cops even did basic job they would find his blood prints on knife, etc. which would easily implicate him in murders!  And after all these questionable deaths surrounding him he's still able to get himself elected to the senate? Finally, biggest flaw in movie is that we saw earlier in movie that anyone taking the pill would have shortened life and yet he comes out that oh yeah I found a way to keep myself smart without using the pill which isn't fully explained. Then again that's more how real intelligence works there is no off switch like a pill. I guess you need to read the book as someone mentioned to fill in the gaps.<br /> Finally, primarily because of Western cultures lack of esteem for intellectual values, Eddie Morra wouldn't be so happy and tend to be unhappier than average. I mean he loses his girlfriend and doesn't seem any the sadder compared to the start of the movie!<br />Speaking of his girlfriend she seemed to be one of the more believable and sane characters in the movie. I mean she basically dumped him when he admitted he was doing drugs and didn't see anything wrong with that and using that to get ahead in life. Sort of like the recent string of steroid scandals. Looking back I guess some people could argue that the movie was just one big/long ad like those you see on television for anti-anxiety, viagra, etc.t and try to find someone willing to loan him some cash to really get his feet off the ground and if he was really smart I can't imagine him going to a shady person for it unless he did the risk/benefit ratio analysis beforehand and even then I don't think any benefit is worth getting cut at the waste as having your skin tied around your head as the Russian mafia guy mentioned.

B002ZG983M|3.0|Basically as has been mentioned this is either a movie you will love or hate and I almost stopped watching after all the violence hit girl committed. I guess ratings have been relaxed since Kill Bill, a movie that has some similarities, was released. I thought some of the bloody scenes in Kill Bill were toned down with the use of black and white to get an R rating. Obviously, not required for this movie since you see all the bullet exit cavitation holes in glory detail in high-def so those without a strong stomach might get nausea watching this film. Anyways, if you can repress the repulsion at seeing an innocent way too young girl turned into a cold blooded killer like in Kill Bill, The Professional the visuals are very well done but that's about it. It seems as the write for the movie basically stole parts from the Matrix, Kill Bill, The Watchmen, Spider Man, Toxic Avenger, The Professional and make a mash up of them. Also, some references in the movie like MySpace, Lost, etc are already outdated thus making the movie stand the test of time even less. There was also some totally unnecessary masturbation and hot for teacher scenes at the start of the movie which added nothing to the movie. One of the problems I had with the movie is that it doesn't seem to make up it's mind if it's a comedy or not. I didn't laugh very much if it was supposed to be funny. I guess it must've been dark humor they were aiming for?<br />Ass-Kick is in reference to what the Watchmen Batman copycat Nic Cage says to his little girl. He tells her that Kick-Ass should change his name to Ass-Kick since all he seems to do is get his butt kicked LOL. Now that was funny! But then there are parts where the movie gets all serious and even depressing when one of the main super-hero's get killed and even Kick-Ass himself seemed to get physically ill as this movie almost made me feel when he saw all the death the little psycho hit-girl unleashed. He wasn't the only one, even Red Mist almost threw up, after seeing all the blood and guts in this movie! This should be an obvious strong warning to anyone sensitive to blood, guts and gore!<br />In the end I did see enough redeeming qualities in this movie to recommend it to those with a strong stomach. I could go on with all the bad stuff I saw dragging this movie down but then again like I said if you don't like it from the start all you're probably going to notice about the movie are it's flaws.er seeing all the blood and guts in this movie!

I would recommend buying all the books in this series together so you can get them all hardbacks for the same price.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|If it weren't so pretentious and boring, Babel would have been a good movie.  A Japanese guy takes his rifle - which may or may not have been used by his wife during her suicide - to Morocco for a hunting expedition.  He gives the rifle to his guide as a gift.  For about 50 shiny rocks and a goat the guide barters his rifle to a completely irresponsible goat herder and father of two young boys, one of whom enjoys pleasuring himself while fantasizing about the moments he goes all Porky's on his prepubescent sister while watching her undress.  This, of course, leads to a potential international terrorism scandal when the goat-herder's young onanist tests the weapon's muzzle velocity and trajectory, fires a single round at the front of a tour bus, watches the bullet take a few JFK turns, entering the driver's side about ten rows back, making contact with the shoulder/neck of an emotionally dead American woman who, along with her husband, are on a Moroccan vacation (shortly after their newborn died of SIDS) and in sudden, desperate need of competent medical attention covered by their HMO while their two, spoiled young children are in the incompetent hands of their illegal immigrant nanny who, driven by her irresponsible relative, needs to travel illegally across the border - again - to attend her nephew's incredibly long and inconsequential wedding in what is presumably Tijuana while the original Japanese gift giver's deaf, mute daughter is going commando throughout the day, flashing her unshaven pubic region to every effeminate Japanese man she can find - there are plenty - and attempting to seduce her middle-aged dentist by licking his face.<br /><br />Speaking of dentists, don't let my first paragraph fool you; the film is brutally long, disconnected, and painful, just like each visit to the dentist.

Not so fast, the pace is so slow that travels that in the other books take from POV to POV of one character now last an entire book. Save yourself, these two books are not worth the money. No mayor action takes place, really. You can confirm this from a couple of forums, and better reviews than this one.

Hate, murder, power, the dead, and a touch of romance all play a part in this enjoyable forth installment.<br /><br />ssbookreviews(dot)blogspot(dot)com

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I am a gamer; always have been and likely always will be.  I carry a gaming laptop with me everywhere I go and get lots of use out of it, but I have always liked playing my Xbox 360 more than my computer.  The G155 has pretty much replaced my need for a gaming laptop.  I use this everywhere both for gaming and Netflix! My kids love it too. We are going on vacation for a week and this is definitely going with us.
0307245306|4.0|Imagine finding out that myths are actually history, your father is really a Greek god, and there's a host of mythical monsters out to kill you. Well for Percy Jackson that's reality, and on top of that, he's right in the center of a dangerous controversy between the gods. If he doesn't do something quick, countless innocent lives could be lost.<br /><br />Engaging characters, surprises at every turn, and a melding of mythology and our everyday reality combine to make The Lightning Thief a thoroughly enjoyable read. It does contains some very mildly disturbing images of torment in the underworld, cursing in ancient Greek, and various combat related wounds/death, but the content is otherwise clean and the tone light.<br />[...]

0062004352|5.0|I just finished reading this book on my Amazon Kindle and completely loved it, I have even ordered the next one in the series, I love Hollywood. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy read, as its girly but really funny.  A must-read.
142312166X|4.0|Are you itching for more Percy Jackson?<br /><br />Monsters, minor gods, a titan, a dragon, and even a trip to the underworld make up the three action packed adventures in Demigod Files. These three short stories take place between Battle of the Labyrinth (Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book 4) and The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book 5) and while fun, are not crucial to the Percy Jackson series. However, they do provide useful background for the Heroes of Olympus series which takes place after the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. The book contains non-graphic violence, injuries, and hinted romantic interest in the same manner as the Percy Jackson books.<br /><br />ssbookreviews(dot)blogspot(dot)com
B00003CXA6|5.0|A must see for an fan of history and/or the Civil War.  The movie does an excellent job of showing different soldiers were fighting: some to free slaves, some to perserve the union, others states' rights and some to free themselves from what they viewed as a trynical federal government.  The battle scenes are excellent and without the other top blood and gore one expects to see in modern war movies.  The movie does an excellent job capturing the emoition and choas of combat.  The scenes involving the lead up to and the acutual Picket's Charge are worth the cost alone.  An all star cast does an excellent job of bring to life their Civil War characters and even look the part as well, another one of my favorite parts of the movie is where they show a black and white of the actor and the person they are playing side by side during the credits.
0553801473|2.0|I really am a big fan of the Ice and Fire series, but believe book five is somewhat slower compared to the others in the series. I agree with the other reviewers that although the writing is well done, the plot goes round and round with little resolution. While reading the other novels, I couldn't stop! I wouldn't sleep, go outside, nada - I was so absorbed in the Ice and Fire world. This novel, not so much.  I'm struggling every evening to make it through a chapter.  Not that I expected the story to end, but many chapters seemed \\"borrowed\\" over and over. Maybe Mr. Martin's ego has final permeated into his books. I've read his interviews and for whatever reason - seems to be very \\"I don't care what you like...\\" But there was a part of me that hoped as a writer - he really wanted the ALL the books to be the best ever. The Game of Thrones - undoubtedly one of the best Sci-Fi novels written. Too bad the books have become (what seem to be) \\"ego-centric,\\" because Mr. Martin really is one of the best talents.<br /><br />Well thank goodness for the mini-series.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I was fascinated by the twists and turns of this novel. the story roped me in making the book literally impossible to put down. the complex web of symbolism interwoven in the novel helps the lost symbol rightfully earn its place alongside the other robert langdon adventures.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|A nice td game.  graphics and sound are good.  music can be muted if needed.  fairly easy for the first few levels but gets progressively harder.  One thing I liked about this game is the fact that it is light on battery consumption, compared to most games.  Droid inc,  2.2. (Gimme gingerbread!!!)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite book I have selected to read over the past 5 years out of roughly 100 books. it was nothing short of mezmorizing for me. Full of colorful descriptives and fine detail and bits of history and science with just enough of a romantic tinge to not make it sappy. I yearn for the second book in this trilogy to be completed. this book does start out slow but with very good reason. I wont go into details of the plot after all that is what the experience of reading is for but it was the ultimate in escapism! FANTASTIC!!
B001DHXT20|5.0|I know a lot of people who despise the Hulk as a super-hero but I throughly enjoy watching his green-enraged-awesomeness. Actually, I enjoy the storyline following Bruce Banner more than the actual Hulk's because Banner is a very likable character. This movie is quite good and the cast supports it very well. I wasn't unhappy with the Eric Bana version a few years ago, but this was a well-done reboot and I was quite impressed with Edward Norton's performance. The final battle is quite epic!
0307716511|5.0|An excellent deput book from the author.  You could feel the bound between the two sisters.  Not the glorious I will die for you screaming love, but the little everyday things the two had shared and experienced together.  It's bittersweet.  The belief Bee had on Tess was unbreakable.  It's that belief that kept Bee/the story going.  Spoiler:  I wish the part with Mr. Wright was real.  But who knows?  Maybe it is.  Bee deserved to be set free and be happy.  I wish I could read a chapter of her in the future.  Can't wait for the next book from the author.
B000002GWJ|5.0|Blue Valentine was my introduction to Tom Waits. For me 1978 was the time of Graham Parker, Elvis Costello and The Clash. Yet, as different as this was from the music to which I was then listening, I loved it instantly, from the opening chords of Somewhere to the closing notes of Blue Valentine. This is listening music - the lyrics are eclectic in the extreme and demand your attention. I don't often consider the lyrics to the music that I enjoy as poetry, but these songs are poetry set to cool, jazzy yet edgy arrangements. As I listen to this music I really do see the images that the song writer is describing.<br /><br /> I've listened to the LP, and now this cd, on a great many occasions. As Waits finishes up Christmas Card with \\"I'll be eligible for parole come Valentine's Day\\" I know that Romeo is right behind. These songs are so familiar to me that they sound mainstream. However I suspect that were I to play the cd for friends (I don't - I'm past proselytizing) most would look at me quizzically and ask \\"what is this?\\" and not necessarily in a positive way! Anyway, after 33 years Blue Valentine still sounds as fresh and brilliant as ever. From time to time I've bought other recordings by Tom Waits. None is played as much as this one.<br /><br />Kentucky Avenue is amongst my favourite songs ever. This list has now grown to well over two hundred; not so many when amortized over 50+ years of record collecting.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Eminem and Royce the 5'9 takes listeners on a lyrical blood bath assault over dark and dense head nodding tracks. Nobody can spit along side a lyrical beast like Eminem the way Royce the 5'9 can. I waited 12 years for this record and it was more than worth the wait.

B0000AK7AB|5.0|Years ago when I first saw \\"Babe\\" in a movie theatre, it was sort of ho-hum.  After viewing it again as a gift to my nephews (ages 5-7) I finally \\"got\\" it! Since the days of Aesop writers have used animals to make statements that are too profound for acceptance by adults.  Now I would like to offer my best friends who are going through life's challenges, the gift as expressed by the farmer to Babe.  \\"If I had words to make a day for you.\\"  Wow!  Just unsophisticated love.

B0056BMK6K|3.0|Locke may have sold a million books, but he violates a basic principle of writing in this book. He could have told his tale in less than half the pages he filled. That being said, I started a Twitter account and found out thousands of writers are using his principles to try and sell their books. One cannot argue with success. It was worth the five bucks to share  the dream for just a little while.
B00005JOA0|5.0|One of those period dramas you will wait for a dark, rainy afternoon to watch again.  Real Scottish Moor scenes and architecture, authentic moor ponies with hooves the size of pie plates, stocking legged matched teams pulling carriages, sheep herds with their attending border collies, and even a handsome shepherd. Classic period drama with attention to detail, great acting and believable sets. Story is very realistic and true to the book. Definitely a great addition to any Period Drama collection.

0345529057|5.0|Hello guys,    On May 5th I order these books, unfortunately the package was lost, but thanks to the great customer service of Jovarie S., Randy D. and Amazon in general, I got my package on August 1st in perfect condition. I can safely say that I'm very satisfied with Amazon and will continue to buy books and all my worldly needs from Amazon, until the end of days.    The books are great I have been a big fan of George R. R. Martin ever since I went on a reading binge in a vacation week in April and read all four books, coincidentally I lost 10 pounds. I found that these books were everything I wanted, very good diplomatic battles, as well as actual battles, intrigue at every turn, jaw-dropping twists, mad-theories and a giant complicated new world that I came to love by chapter 3, I've read A Game of Thrones 3 times, I'm a person that loves intricate and complicated things and this is one of my absolutely favorite books beside Shogun by James Clavell and The Rise and Fall of The Great Powers by Paul Kennedy.    At any rate: Tip top job by the author, the supplier, the carrier and the publisher (All Hail the All Mighty Random House, the First of its Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm)    I hope you guys enjoyed this review and I highly recommend this series.
B004RGEOXM|1.0|If you are a Verve fan like myself then this album is not for you. Ashcroft has a great voice but that's where this ends. The songs seem like they were written over a cup of coffee in the morning and produced before noon with a make-shift band. No creativity whatsoever. Oh, and the obnoxious drum machine.... nice touch Rich.<br />Let's only hope he can patch things up with his former band because this is trash.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Sad to read, and sometimes difficult to read.  At the same time very inspiring because Jaycee did survive.  Short book - can read in two sittings.
B002UPA4ZY|4.0|Let's just get to it. The Singapore Special Deluxe Edition contains BOTH the CD AND the FULL LENGTH DVD. The booklet is a hybrid of the standard CD with extra pages devoted to the DVD.  The DVD is chock full of collaborations. Firstly, there are the various children and young adult choirs. Then there are the divas like Natalie Cole, Reba McEntire, Mary J. Blidge and Katherine Jenkins. And then THE DIVA of all divas Miss Piggy with the Muppets. And an out of this world performance with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. There are no highlights here. The entire DVD is in itself a highlight.  In the making of My Christmas, David Foster &#34;suggested stupidly&#34; changing sets to give it that 60s TV feel. I like that self deprecating humor. As in all shows with Bocelli, Foster's always vying for a share of the spotlight. Objectively speaking, the set changes give the TV special a warm and fuzzy feeling. Very nicely done. So no reason to feel insecure Mr Foster.  The difference between the DVD and the CD is that the DVD contains performances of Ave Maria and the Holiday Piece Intro not on the CD. The DVD features Reba McEntire on Blue Christmas and Courtney Blooding crooning softly on the CD.  I got this CD/DVD at a single CD price last Christmas. I'll have to say it is one of my bestest buys, given that I can hear and watch the maestro in action! Bravo Bocelli!
B004I2K4DY|1.0|I am watching the DVD now and I don't think I can finish it.  It is just terrible.  All the singers were just screaming rather than singing.  There is absolutely no musicality in their voices.  Lea Salonga's voice has a wobble so big you can drive a truck through it.  Please save your money and your time, don't watch it.  I will turn off the DVD player as soon as I finish typing this review.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This app is very addictive and unique. You start putting plants in the path of the mindless zombies, with each new plant and zombie giving you new challenges. Then you have a few minigames to keep your interest. I like the mobile version over the DS.
1451629184|3.0|this was such an anticipated book, yet when i read it i found myself very bored and couldnt finish the last 20 pages. i really feel for her for what she was subjected to and cannot even comprehend how she survived the first few years, but from the way she told it she wasnt deprived of the essentials to live. yes she was imprisoned for 18 years by a sick and twisted man but she went out in public and had a great deal of freedom for kidnapped individual. all in all without completely boring everybody with my opinion this was an attempt of sharing a horrific ordeal in her life, but it could have been written so much better.
0316098329|5.0|Five year old Jack doesn't know anything of the world but Room. He was born in the eleven by eleven foot space and has never set foot outside of it. His Ma was kidnapped by Old Nick seven years ago and has been held captive in Room ever since. Ma has worked hard to make sure that Jack doesn't suspect that Room is a prison but she doesn't know how much longer she can take being held hostage.<br /><br />This book was wonderful for so many reasons. I will admit when my book club chose it for one of our monthly selections, I was not looking forward to reading it. Since having kids of my own, I don't have much of a stomach for reading books in which bad things happen to children. Room pleasantly surprised me - as far as Jack is concerned being in Room is not all that bad. Because it's all he's ever known and Ma has carefully sheltered him from knowledge of the outside world, he's actually a pretty happy child. There are definitely some parts of the book that are tough to read but it wasn't as wrenching as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I really appreciated the attention to detail the author had when writing this book. She actually had her brother-in-law design a scale CAD design of Room and all its furnishings so that she could get an accurate feel for what living in an eleven by eleven room would be like. You can find this design on her website. She did a great job of realizing the many aspects of Jack's development that would be affected by growing up in Room - physical, emotional and intellectual. He was affected in ways I never would have considered myself but that made total sense.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of hearing Ms. Donoghue speak at an event put on by my local independent bookstore, Rainy Day Books. I can't really get into what she talked about too much because it would spoil the story but it definitely added to my enjoyment of the book to know why she made the choices she did with the direction the plot went and with the way characters were portrayed.<br /><br />This book led to one of the most robust book club discussions my club has had. The story was so intriguing and thought-provoking; there were all kinds of issues to talk about. I highly recommend this book.of the most robust book club discussions my club has had.

0439023491|5.0|Just as its predecessor, Catching Fire did not disappoint in any shape or form. I think I have found a new series to love and drool over.<br /><br />I loved how this novel kicks off so easily. The story and the characters are just as, if not easier, to get into than in The Hunger Games. You find yourself immersed in this crazy world and, as a reader, you don't want to get out. After each chapter I finish, I just want to keep reading and it's like my brain is nagging at me until I open up and continue to read on.<br /><br />This book has some serious heart wrenching moments that almost made me cry. There is a little more romance to this story that the last, actually quite a bit more, but it works for the story line so well, that it's not an issue. Suzanne Collins has done an amazing job at writing a series of novels that you just cannot figure out.  I've read some other reviews about how the reader thought certain things were going to happen, and those things seemed likely. But alas, those things did not come to pass. I love that about these books. You never know what's going to happen until you read on.<br /><br />There's just something about this book, about the entire series that keeps you reading. Everyone should read The Hunger Games...and then re-read them.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.<br /><br />I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.<br /><br />Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.<br /><br />Enjoy your reading!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I just finished this movie and here I am writing a review on it! Whether you are a Christian or not, you should see this movie.

Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt and AnnaSophia Robb all do a great job of telling a wonderful and emotional story. Watch it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book. Sometimes the 2nd book leaves you wanting, not this one!<br />I couldn't wait to finish and get to the 3rd book. As amatter of fact I didn't<br />even take the time to write this review until I finished the 3rd book. I just<br />couldn't wait to see what was going to happen! All of the books are well written<br />and you feel so close to the characters.

I did listen to it right away when it arrived and wasn't super impressed. It just seemed weird to me. The thing is, i've listened to it many times over the last couple weeks and it has blown my mind. It is so freaking good. Maybe all the songs aren't great, but with 36 songs, you can leave a few out and still have a classic album.  They mix it up so well and sing about real things and the real world. They aren't afraid to tell it like it is and know how to be fun at the same time. I'm a farmer and was dancing in my garden listening to it. Buy it, you won't regret it. Long live the clash !

B004EPYZSK|4.0|This movie in itself , while it does not portray anything     new in terms of visual or sound effects as in most movies     these days, it does tell a nice story. The story told here can     be related to those kind of stories that you can here only from people     who often claim that they were once abducted by aliens. Except that     for Cowboys & Aliens, this stranger(Daniel Craig) who was     abducted returned to earth with a metallic bracelet around his wrist    completely ripped off of his memory. To him has landed on a new soil,     but to residents of this New Mexico territory, especially to Colonel     Dalarhyde (Harrison Ford) this man is a robber who has to be punished.     It only took a short while for the town to realize that their hero has arrived     as aliens' planes begun to fly all over the town destroying everything in     their path. Somewhere in between this battle, we have some themes as love,     friendship, courage and unity taking their shapes[[ASIN:B004HD62LM Cowboys and Aliens]]
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This application has easily become my favorite keyboard to type with. It&apos;s honestly mind blowing that the predictions are so incredibly accurate.

I love that the keyboard also supports multiple languages. Overall 5\/5. I&apos;ve used many other keyboards and this is the best hands down. Evo 4g

B001KVZ6ES|1.0|A surprisingly shallow way for Clint Eastwood's cinematic career to draw to a close, Gran Torino may have been better served with a more thick-witted title, something along the lines of \\"Bitter Old Man Points Guns at Minorities.\\" Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time stalking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right. A plodding, incomplete picture that will only be remembered for the single quotable line heard in its trailer.

B000PC6Z48|2.0|Just your run-of-the-mill spaghetti western also-ran, complete with a joltingly simple plot, one-dimensional characters and the worst dubbed dialog this side of Pulp Fiction's basic cable edit. Django himself, an opportunist without much in the way of personality, is only likable in direct comparison to the cookie-cutter roster of villainy he mercilessly cuts down at every opportunity. Even the scenery, which normally delivers a heaping portion of a western's aura and mystique, falls flat in Django. Here the wide-open promise of a broad, sweeping landscape is reduced to dreary patch of mud, a fistful of thin, trail-weary horses and four pathetic, lifeless wooden shacks. If a steady diet of ricocheting bullets, heavy drinking and utterly pointless double-crossery is what you're hungry for, by all means chow down - this is ninety solid minutes of just that with little variation. Those with an appetite for more filling material, on the other hand, should just keep on walking.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is an awesome thing to own! It makes the coolest sounds, and the light is fun. I love bleeping everything in sight, and I tried to fix my Netflix connection with it (didn't work, but then again, I'm not the Doctor). It is so much fun and very realistic.<br />My two-year-old niece has played with it (under my watchful eye), and it stood up to her grabby hands. So far, only a couple of things have disappointed me.<br />1. The UV pen that supposedly writes secret messages doesn't work unless pressed really hard. I'm thinking of wetting it a bit and trying it again like the instructions say. (I love the little English words. \\"Nib,\\" haha. I had to explain to my brother what a \\"sharp knock\\" is.)<br />2. The regular pen isn't working too well. I tried a bunch of stuff, but it's barely writing. It could just be my particular screwdriver because I saw some raving reviews about the pen earlier.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really great and fun thing to have. I'm going to buy a case and carry it in my purse (it's a pen, I swear, I have an excuse!) because I wouldn't like it bouncing around on the bottom, and I don't have any pockets in my purse. I just wish there were more fans of the Doctor in America. Oh, well; it's fun to explain why I'm bleeping them with a UV light :)

B000AWYOGE|3.0|The movie starts out slow. Jennifer Connolly and her daughter(Ariel Gade as Ceci) move into a new apartment due to her recent separation from her husband. The apartment is run down (you can almost smell it) and has numerous leaks. Her daughter develops an imaginary friend and Jennifer is haunted by her past, i.e. a terrible relationship with her mother.<br /><br />The landlord landlord (John C. Reilly) and super (Pete Postlethwaite) do what they can, but they are not overly helpful. The ex-husband visits the school and hires a lawyer for custody. Jennifer is forced  to hire a lawyer too. Meanwhile Ceci's relationship with he imaginary friend intensifies as she tells Ceci things that makes Jennifer unsettled.<br /><br />The movie finally gets to one climatic scene and afterwards you feel empty. Is that it?<br /><br />The acting was fine. The slow build-up was good, but it took up too much of the film. The climax scene needed to be longer.<br /><br />No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. A horror movie you can watch with your little girl right before you send her off to your ex-spouse.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|The film starts in 1845 and by the time the credits is over, it is up to date. Wolverine and his brother are recruited to fight in a special mutant force. The mutants are never introduced. There is an assumption you know these characters from previous movies or comics. I would not recommend this film as an introduction to X-Men.<br /><br />The special forces are more brutal than what Wolverine wants to be. &#34;This isn't what we signed up for, &#34; he says as he walks out. He becomes a Canadian and lives quietly like as a lumber jack. His brother is on a rampage...and Wolverine's life becomes disrupted. He must once again fight, only this time he is stronger and is more of a killer.<br /><br />The movie ties in nicely with the other 4 X-Men movies, which should be viewed to get an overall picture, which is difficult to obtain in this film alone. The acting was sufficient. Good CG, super action and fighting. It has plot twists, so pay attention. The movie sprinkles in the right amount of humor, drama, and truisms into the dialogue to make it a fun watch.

B003O86CJS|2.0|I purposely bought the \\"Clean\\" version as a 13th b'day gift for my daughter who was thrilled beyond measure to get her own K.P. CD.  Today we listened to it for the first time, together with her girlfriend while en route to the mall. Had to skip several tracks and then finally turned it off completely.  \\"Clean\\" - absolutely no way!  Menage a trois, losing virginity, some lightweight swear words...and don't even get me started on Peacock. I have nothing against Ms. Perry's choice of lyrics and topics - some of these songs are great fun and make me rock in my seat.  But this so-called \\"clean\\" album is not for a 13 y.o. - at least, not my 13 y.o. This \\"clean\\" designation is completely misleading and just plain wrong. I have actually listened to samples from this one & the explicit lyrics album and I can not find anything that was cut to \\"clean\\" this one up.  Guess Mom gets to keep this album for herself if Amazon won't take it back for misleading advertising.

1402217722|5.0|This is one of the most unusual of Heyer's Regency romances. For one thing, it's not even set in the Regency period but a long generation earlier, during the 1770s. For another, the plot is much more sophisticated and the characters, both leading and supporting, are far more multidimensional. And there's far less dependence on impenetrable sporting cant -- except for the highwayman, of course, whose jargon confuses even some of the young gentlemen.<br /><br />The story opens with negotiations between the Earl of Rule and the Dowager Viscountess of Winwood for the hand of her sweetly beautiful eldest daughter, Elizabeth (who is fifteen years Rule's junior). Only Lizzie is downcast because she's very much in love with young Lieut. Heron (newly returned from the war in America), whom she has known all her life. Still, the family needs money desperately, Rule is extremely wealthy, and it's a daughter's duty. But Lizzie has two younger sisters, including Horatia, only seventeen (with a monobrow and a stammer), who thinks she can fix things to everyone's satisfaction by visiting the earl and offering herself to him as a wife in place of her sister. Rule accepts on the spot -- and that's really the only unconvincing part of the plot. So Lizzie gets her lieutenant, Rule gets an even younger wife, and Horry gets a title and a very large allowance. Then (naturally) things get complicated. Rule's presumptive heir heretofore has been his excessively foppish cousin, Mr. Crosby Drelincourt (\\"the Macaroni\\"), who has come to think of Rule's fortune as almost rightfully his own -- so he isn't happy about the marriage and the prospect of other heirs. Rule also has a dedicated enemy of long standing in Lord Lethbridge, who will go to considerable lengths to embarrass the earl and cost him his prospects for a family by subverting his young and naïve wife. Heyer practically has Lethbridge twirling his mustaches as he plots the downfall of Lord and Lady Rule, but in no way is he a laughable villain. In fact, the author includes in the story a duel in deadly earnest, which is the only occasion for serious bloodshed that I can recall in any of her books.<br /><br />The bride also has a brother, Pelham, the current Viscount Winwood, a likeable wastrel and gambler (which is why the family has become so poor, but the whole family apparently is prone to the Fatal Tendency, including Horry) who, with the assistance of his friends and the now Capt. Heron, will do his best to come to his sister's rescue, . . . if only he can stay sober long enough. And those efforts provide sixty-odd pages of an almost Marx Brothers style of careening, pall-mall comedy that is also quite unlike anything I can remember in any of the author's other novels. This is one of Heyer's most enjoyable books.ble villain.

1451629184|5.0|. . . and had difficulty putting it down. It was difficult for me to separate the fact that she's not a professional writer, per se, but rather a storyteller recounting her experiences throughout the years. When taking that into consideration, this book works well. It surprises me she was able to write this book so soon after her rescue, to be honest, considering how fresh and uncertain everything really is for her and her daughters. That shows so much strength and courage.<br /><br />I hope, in the future, she'll write another memoir. I'd love to read her thoughts after she's been out of the situation for awhile and living free without worry (aside from the regular day-to-day worries we all experience, of course).

0316113506|4.0|I agree with some of the points in the negative reviews.  You could get the info you need from this book if it was just a magazine article.  But what this book says is SO important.  Everyone who's not wholeheartedly and consistently committed to regular exercise NEEDS to know about this.  Problem is, if you just tell someone that exercise will improve pretty much every aspect of their life, even things they thought couldn't be improved, they are not likely to really embrace this new knowledge, even if you have an MD after your name.  But if you give them nearly 300 pages of information backing up your claim and explaining the molecular processes behind it, maybe, eventually, a light bulb will come on.  It did for me, and I'm looking and feeling much better, mentally and physically.

161720238X|4.0|I've been reading many books on mysticism (especially Eastern) and personal transformation, including Osho, Tibetan Buddhism, Jungian Psychology, shamanism, etc..... I am enjoying learning about the inner potential, or inner wisdom and power, our buddha-nature, Christ-nature, etc.... Just seeing how being in control of our minds and taking responsibility of our lives can totally change what happens. A large part of the journey towards wholeness and joy is being able to create the future one wants and live to the potential one naturally is. This book does a good job discussing our inner potential brought through the subconscious, discussing sleep-like states, hypnosis, trance, etc. It correlates well with practices in shamanism, the powerful impact that symbolism, ritual, mantra/affirmations, etc can have. A lot of religious ritual (western, eastern, primitive, etc) is based in the use of symbolism to tap into our inner wisdom/perfection. What I like about this book is how it reveals a link between what we think/feel and what we become capable of.     The book oddly does not discuss anything of Eastern spirituality, perhaps because it was written in 1962 by a man who was already 64 years old. It somewhat predates the hippie generation, and Tibet was just barely overtaken at that point. It has a great mystical premise to everything, as much as it is disguised as a psychology/self-help book. If you're familiar with shamanism, eastern spirituality, mythology, Jungian psychology, etc or any other alchemical/transformational arts, this book fits well within that realm.    I'm a bit skeptical about some of the 'law of attraction' undertones in the book - that genuine faith alone can bring you what you desire. I believe that the power of faith/belief is true, in the sense that truly believing something can unlock a powerful/indestructible confidence that will give us the energy/ambition to MAKE things happen, to learn, to have that motivation to do whatever is needed to make things fall into place as we'd desire. I think that what happens in our lives has some part due to environment and likely possibilities. In that sense, when we have the tools and resources we need to achieve something, subconscious faith/belief can most definitely pull us through. But I still do believe that we have to play a part in that happening, that it cannot happen passively.
0307474275|4.0|I would agree with a number of reviewers - the book is excellent.  Read it, enjoy it, discuss it at length.  Remember always it is a work of fiction - the author used ELEMENTS of the history of the church to weave a story.  If you want to condemn Catholicism do some independent research first - the church has a regrettable history in it's treatment of women, Brown brings the discussion front and center.
1451629184|1.0|You should buy this book to support the author.  Although, I think Jaycee should hire a ghost writer.  Jaycee lacks the ability to convy her experience in such a way that the reader connects with her.  I stopped reading because I was angry with Jaycee, but this is a result of her writing not her experience. A ghostwriter would be able to connect with readers and allow them to connect more with Jaycee.  I applaud her for her efforts and recognize what a struggle this must have been to write....but.
B000001ELR|5.0|With Kiss there is always something that needs to be pointed out. There are a certain number of fans (and they're quite vocal) that only like Kiss with makeup on and only like Kiss when Peter Criss and Ace Frehley are in Kiss. For them nothing else will do and really it's all about 1974-1978 for most of this crowd (Criss was gone by the summer of 1980 and Frehley was out in late 1982). If you're an objective minded person when it comes to Kiss and hard rock bands in general then Creatures Of The Night is an album you should purchase. Immediately. This album is as good as anything Kiss ever did. It's easily the heaviest album of their career (thanks in large part to Eric Carr and the production team on the album). Carr really powers this album sonically but make no mistake, the songs on Creatures are well conceived and well written. The only possible track that could be considered filler (which all Kiss albums are littered with to varying degrees) is Killer. Other than that the album is full of memorable riffs and drum rhythms/fills which fit perfectly into stellar heavy rock song writing. From the title track to the crushing riff of War Machine to the anthemic blast of I Love It Loud this album is Kiss at arguably their best. Kiss had something to prove after 1981's poorly received concept album The Elder and they certainly made the point loud and clear that Kiss were still a heavy rock band with the release of Creatures. Unfortunately the album was met with a lukewarm response due to Kiss' many sound and image changes over the previous 3+years in addition to a changing musical landscape and the band no longer being able to claim it had all its original members anymore (which almost always affects every bands commercial appeal). Kiss had a resurgance after removing the makeup in 1983 and their albums routinely started going platinum again. In 1985 they re-released Creatures with a new cover sans makeup to generate interest in an album they obviously felt was sorelyoverlooked. Though some fans didn't like the move it did renew interest in the album and Creatures would eventually get certified gold in sales. It could be validly argued that the non makeup cover attracted fans who might not have taken it as seriously if they had never re-released it. No matter what ones view on the cover situation is (Kiss eventually re-released it yet again with the original cover)Creatures Of The Night is a musical onslaught from Kiss. They never sounded this hungry before or after. The album has grown in stature over the years with many heavy rock fans and Kiss played several songs off the album throughout their 80's concert tours. Because Ace Frehley's participation was minimal at best on this album 70's only Kiss fans will commonly dismiss the album as being mediocre but don't pay attention to that, this is Kiss at their loudest and hungriest. An excellent release.

B002RI9XHO|3.0|I consider 1984 among my favourite books.  I also enjoyed Animal Farm.  Given my previous experience with Orwell as an author, I was really excited to buy Homage to Catalonia to read during my trip to Spain.  In the end, though, I'm not the right audience for this book.    I enjoyed the references to a region I was visiting, and I was able to visualize some of the references to specific places in Barcelona.  I thought a comment he made about the Spanish early on the novel was characteristic Orwell and very insightful.  Still, I didn't end up finishing this book.  I don't read a lot of non fiction because it ends up feeling repetitive to me.  I thought this would be okay as it was somewhat biographical in nature, but Orwell focused much more on things like weaponry than his fellow soldiers.    I made it about halfway through this book before I set it aside for something else.  Orwell has a strong narrative voice, and I think this book is well written.  I think people who are interested in war and journalistic writing would likely enjoy this book, but I prefer a more human element to what I'm reading.  I'm sure if I stuck with it I would get more into Orwell's personal growth over the course of this war, but I can't bring myself to slog through pages describing military attacks and weaponry with so little dialogue.  Orwell's style saves this from being as dry as I find a lot of non fiction, but it's not enough to help me resist the lure of my many other books waiting for my attention.

Arms and legs, while very articulate, are also very soft causing it to be too weak to stand on its own.

0345529057|4.0|Truly enjoying these books.  The detailed descriptions and incredible character development help you to see the story developing, although you will not be able to guess what is going to happen next.  There are surprises and plot twists at every turn and GRRM's suspensful style will keep you hooked.  The language contains a mix of olde english vocabulary that will have you guessing what some words mean, at first, but you will understand all if you just keep reading.  The books can seem long, but you won't get bored with the story - I find that I can't put them down.  Amazingly intricate storylines.  This is not realy 4 separate books, as much as it is a story told in 4, (scratch that), 5 volumes.  The new Dance with Dragons is the second half of the 4th book.     Many people have compared this to the Lord of the Rings series.  They are at least as good, but not as ...wholesome.  I personally would not recommend the Song of Fire and Ice series for younger readers.  Some parts are pretty grafic, and there is quite a bit of sexual innuendo, rape, etc.; I would consider them adult material - hence the 4 stars.  As a literary work they are as good as I've seen.    The set is a great deal. You won't be able to read just one of these books and the set is priced about the same as buying three of the four.  Buy it.
B00005R87Q|5.0|A lot can be said for the ridiculousness that surrounds `The Fast and the Furious' or the fact that Paul Walker may possibly be the worst `successful' actor of all time, but at the end of the day there is no denying that every calibrated inch of this film is high octane fun and that accounts for a lot.  Sure, it isn't smart cinema and it certainly has its fair share of flaws but those are forgivable flaws thanks to the dripping wet charisma and brute machismo that explodes in every scene.  Even the chicks exude that tough kind of sexy that makes a man smile.  This is movies made for teenage boys looking for an adrenaline rush, and `The Fast and the Furious' succeeds on all levels there.  From the fast cars to the big muscles to the tiny framed, scantily clad women; this film has it all and then some.  The general plot surrounding an undercover cop, some highway thieves and drag racing feuds is ultimately farfetched and unintentionally funny, but like I said, it doesn't matter.  Vin Diesel is the manliest of men, Paul Walker is cool even if he can't act, Jordana Brewster is an overload of gorgeous and Michelle Rodriguez can bully me around anyday.  Oh yeah, and those cars are pretty awesome too.  Five stars for sure!  I have never had more fun in a theater (yes, this came out when I was the ideal target age) and I can honestly watch this film on loop for days and never get tired of it.  It's a shame they wore out their welcome with this franchise, and yet even as the films get dumber and dumber they are all still so entertaining (sort of).

B00005JKL8|3.0|There is something about `Behind Enemy Lines' that feels slightly off from intention, and I'm struggling to put my finger on it.  From a technical standpoint the film is very well done, and despite some unrealistic moments, the script is also well thought out and nicely handled by director John Moore.  The action sequences have a nice balance of gloss and grit to create a realistic yet entertaining effect, and even the acting is nicely done.  Owen Wilson is not the type of actor you'd initially attribute to `serious cinema', especially since he can't seem to do anything but mug the camera for laughs (he often seems so insincere to me, which occasionally works, like in 'Zoolander' where it benefited his character), but he actually does a really good job here, handling a conventional character in an unconventional way.  I think another reviewer said it best when he said that Wilson played this character like he were an average Joe; an every-man sort of man and that really plays to the advantage of the film.  And yet, with a film that is this serious in tone and subject there is something off that makes it feel cheap.  Not in that `poorly made' fashion, since it certainly isn't poorly made, and not even in that Michael Bay `dumb action movie' fashion since it isn't really dumb (except that ending, which is so banal and unrealistic I couldn't help but bow my head in my hands in surrender).  Maybe there is something about Wilson himself that is hard to take seriously, but at the end of the day there is an air of clich&eacute;d summer blockbuster syndrome that corrodes the core of this film and makes it less than desired.  It is palatable, but also a tad forgettable and when all is said and done this is not a movie that will stay with me.  This is a tricky genre with me though, and I am not ashamed to admit that I often dislike major players in this genre (I found `Saving Private Ryan' expertly directed yet fundamentally stupid, and `Black Hawk Down' is an infectiously stirring pot of empty characters) so take my review with a grain of salt.  It's just my personal perception, but there are many who feel otherwise, and you may be one of them.pot of empty characters) so take my review with a grain of salt.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|Though I recently added the Season 4 DVD to complete my Ugly Betty collection, I never saw the first season of Ugly Betty on TV, so I've not yet seen how the duckling found herself in the on-the-surface shallow world of high fashion, working as an assistant at Mode magazine. I also have no interest in tedious, maudlin and repetitive traditional soaps, but this series had me hooked from the start of season 2 because it's anything but traditional. Really, it seemed to come into the world as a spoof, with over-the-top caricatures in expensive suits, mortgage-your-house shoes and champagne for breakfast - all just a cover for the gold hearts that beat truly behind those designer labels.<br /><br />Betty, who the shallow fashionistas label Ugly from the beginning due to her lack of sophistication and down-to-earth goodness [Wilhelmina's botox-laced face would attempt a sneer at that word], has the brightest heart of all. Helped by the support of a caring family which has instilled in her the values of compassion and open acceptance of those who are different, her practical persistence in the face of constant rejection sees all around her eventually succumb to their better nature. By the end of this final season, Betty is seen as beautiful and, most significantly, valued by everyone.<br /><br />Don't think, though, that this show is syrupy sweet [remember my dislike of soaps!] - it is only sometimes serious and sad, but mostly it is fun, exaggerated, dastardly and clever - filled with meaningful glances, expressive eyebrow raises and catwalk-worthy struts through the fashion magazine's  pristine offices.<br /><br />Betty's journey from ugly duckling to beautiful swan is one to enjoy, and the final season presented us with a perfectly wrapped ending.
0439023513|2.0|Review of Mockingjay:    Over-all, this was a disappointing conclusion to what had been a stellar first two books (personally, I liked the first one the best). The book didn't really even get interesting until there were 100 pages left, and even those pages felt rushed and not very well fleshed out. In fact, the only parts of the books that grabbed my attention were (spoilers ahead!!!):    -The underground chase (although confusing at times)  -The overheard conversation between Peeta and Gale about which one Katniss will chose  -Katniss' conversation with Snow about how he didn't kill Prim and her subsequent unrest    I think Suzanne Collins needed to consider this a draft and then trash it. A better version would have gone like this:    Immediately, they rescue Peeta who has not turned evil, or perhaps he is just a little bit dinged up. The rebel forces already have the Capitol surrounded by page 75. However, there is an impenetrable wall surrounding it that kills you if you touch it or try to dig under it. There is a stalemate. The Capitol's citizens are dying of hunger (no pun intended) and the rebels are getting restless. President Snow creates an ultimatum - a final Hunger Games.     The remaining Victor's from the rebels will be allowed to enter the Capitol to battle an equal number of the Capitol's finest warriors (the citizens have been shepherded to underground shelters). The goal of the rebels is to penetrate the Capitol, get to President Snow's palace, find him and kill him. The pods will still be active. If President Snow survives, the Capitol retains power. If he dies, the rebels can have it all. All kinds of mayhem ensue.     That's how the book should have been written, instead of 300 pages about what they eat for breakfast in district 13.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Alarm Clock Xtreme is the first app I ever bought for Android almost two years ago, the day it came out. Over that time it&apos;s received innumerable updates and improvements. It started out as a reliable alternative to other alarm clock apps as well as Android&apos;s sometimes shady built in one. It&apos;s now the most feature rich alarm on any platform.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use the free version of this app for a long time and eventually paid for it, I liked it so much. The developer is responsive and the app works perfectly. \n
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Okay, I've read enough of this series to expect characters that I like to die, but GRRM is killing his fans by drawing out this saga. I know that the timeline is concurrent with the previous volume, so I expected some re-hashing of the storyline in this book.<br /><br />I suspect that the \\"Ooh, let's surprise the reader by killing a main character\\" gimmick has become Martin's trademark. But I think he's now expected to do it at least once per book. It's a shame, because I think now fans are betting on who lives or dies, a d have forgotten what the series is all about.<br /><br />Any series where 90+ pages of the book are devoted to telling you who the heck all the characters are is just a page or two away from collapsing under it's own weight.<br /><br />I'm not even sure if I care who ends up on the Iron Throne, because \\"Winter is Coming\\", and it'll probably kill everyone.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|i just wanna say wow amazon wow. 6 weeks of having the amazon app store and finally an app i can actually use... been using the free version for a couple weeks now. love it! it lets me use my music to wake me up  instead of my annoying rooster crow. there is even other features too but i havent go around to using them. only thing i dont like is if you turn your phone off to charge nightly, the alarm wont work like the built in one. and the math to snooze and dismiss is a good idea but  if anyone is like me 6:30a.m. is too early for thinking about math. great app! also look to the free version for more reviews so you dont have to deal with the retard faotd 1 staries
B002IITP5I|2.0|I bought this product for the digital copy, but when we opened it, there's a piece of paper that says the digital copy was only available through July of 2010.  That was nowhere in the description or on the outside of the box.  Now I can't return it because it's opened and I feel cheated. \\" + Digital Copy\\" is misleading and should be removed from the description.
0553801473|1.0|I am new to the series and was instantly hooked with books 1-3. But this was terrible. Book 4 was 'eh -- this was even worse. Just the simple truth.<br /><br />Other than the last 1/3 of the book, literally nothing happens. It just goes on and on and on with location details and food details. Oftentimes it was painful to read. New characters that had NO EFFECT on the storyline were introduced, then removed. After putting me through chapters of boring info -- for what? Nothing.<br /><br />The worst part is -- I wanted to like it! I pre-ordered it for Kindle and the formatting was TERRIBLE, made it even worse than it already was.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. I think this series should have ended at Book 3 and when I recommend it to others -- I tellt hem \\"Stop at book 3 -- don't pay a penny for the rest.\\"
B000W7JWUA|3.0|Other reviews have done a great job illustrating what a truly excellent game this is, from a strategic and tactical, as well as social, perspective.  The problem is, in the six months I've owned this, all my little cardboard tiles have gradually become quite warped, and no longer fit together properly.  The tiles that make up the perimeter do not sit flat against the table, allowing the hex tiles to slide underneath.  The hex tiles, for their part, either rock in place or form arches.  This would be fine if there weren't lots of small pieces that sit on top of this uneven mess.    I'd imagine this problem would not occur in a windows-closed, climate-controlled environment.  But in my house, the game is sadly no longer playable.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Love all the features this app has. The stock android alarm should&apos;ve been like this. The fact that you can set it to wake up to any random song by any artist or playlist is awesome.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|This has been my go to alarm clock for years.  Every once in a while, the alarm ringtone resets itself but the alarm never fails to go off on time.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Played this for just a little bit to try it out, and so far so good. The character artwork has a definite Squaresoft fanfic feel to it, but the graphics are clean and well drawn so no complaints there. The controls are not bad, tho one suggestion to the developers might be to use a 'floating joystick' control where you can press anywhere and drag and a joystick appears without taking up permanent space on the screen, (Square did this on FF3 for iOS). The ability to turn off the joystick and use touch controls like Inotia is a big plus.    The classic game mechanics are all here, with the usual magic and special attacks thrown in to keep with the classic rpg feel. An auto button will keep minor battles from becoming too monotonous, and you can walk around and sneak up on monsters for preemptive attacks, so there is some level of strategy involved. For us item hoarders, I'm sure I'll find the usual gamut of magical weapons, armors, and usable items to equip or sell, tho I have not played enough to find any advanced systems of upgrading or enhancing equipment.    The only real drawback is the dialogue and how the story is told, which for an rpg is kindof a big deal. Character dialogue feels a little forced, and like it has been translated not the best into English. The story itself is classic rpg over-dramatic with your team meeting up with a princess whose kingdom has recently been overthrown, but I felt the main character spent more than enough time lecturing his colleague about golems having feelings and how he eats, and not really connecting with the newcomer he so readily admits to the party without any obvious ulterior motive. This gives the game a somewhat clunky feel, but doesn't kill it either, making this a solid four star app, and it is a bargain for three bucks.
0553801473|2.0|I was extremely excited for this book to come out and had high hopes for another great piece of an amazing series. Like many others, I excused the mediocrity that was \\"A Feast for Crows\\" because he focused on the less interesting characters, or thought that he was simply on a slump. This one was supposed to be the real sequel to Storm, and would offer more of the great story telling the the first three books. While this book was not horrible, I get the feeling it is just another thousand pages of filler.<br /><br />Not much actually happens with any of the major characters. The plot is not really advanced, and in some cases, it actually goes backwards. Many of the major characters story arcs (ie Tyrion, Dany and Jon) are rather boring to read and do not really accomplish anything. The book is still however very well written, and is clearly Martin's work. It is not a chore to read, but there is simply too little substance.<br /><br />Of the big three, Jon's arc is at least acceptable, as we get to look into what it is like to command the the night's watch and at least some noteworthy changes occur. There is still way too much repetition, and the ending to his chapters is just bizarre. Tyrion's chapters are literally just one long journey where he never reaches his destination. Imagine instead of having his normal story in AGoT, there just being a description of his journey from the Wall to the Vale. Dany's chapters consist mostly of her sitting in Meereen acting like the little girl she was at the beginning of AGoT without making any real progress anywhere, whilst dreaming of getting laid by some pretty boy.<br /><br />Some of the other character's stories were actually pretty interesting and fun to read. Arya, Theon, Selmy, Davos and Bran's parts were very well done and refreshing to the overall pace of the book. Unfortunately, other character's chapters were completely pointless and their parts could have been removed entirely.<br /><br />The other problem I have is Martin's reliance on cliffhangers and shock type endings to chapters. I lost count of the number of times a character is supposed to die, but turns out to be fine a few chapters later. This is exciting if you do it every once in a while, but when it happens to every other character, it just seems desperate. Also, all of the story arcs end right before the climax of the tings that were supposed to happen in this book. The all end with a cheap cliffhanger and no conclusion. This is particularly annoying when considering that the next book will come out (if it comes out) in at least another five years. If it follows the same pattern as the last two, there will just be more stalling with no answers to the questions raised in this book.<br /><br />I am greatly saddened at the demise of the series as the first three books literally blew me away. There is still hope for a comeback with books 6 and 7, but considering it took him eleven years to produce the last two, that hope is very slim. Honestly, if he has lost interest in writing A Song of Ice and Fire, I would rather him just admit it and stop the series, or write a short conclusion to wrap things up rather than playing with his readers hopes like this.
B003Q7B78S|5.0|I first saw this film on video back in the mid nineties and have always remembered it. Seeing it again nearly twenty years later on DVD is a breath-taking experience. Sally Potter certainly got her money's worth (and ours) from her hard won production budget. What might have seemed a willfully arch style at the time of its release holds up extremely well with the passage of time. In fact the whole film has actually improved over my original memory. Other reviews have supplied the details better than I could, but the interview with Sally Potter is certainly worth the small extra cost of the 2010 \\"Special Edition.\\" Her remarks on the difficulty getting financing for a woman director remain all too true. Having recently been exploring the oeuvre of Lisa Cholodenko, another film maker I wish had made more films, I now add Sally Potter to my list.
0307716511|3.0|This was somewhat of a disappointment.  The writing was quite nice, included some lovely imagery, but the plot left a lot to be desired.  The ending felt contrived, to put it mildly.    I will look forward to her next book for the writing.
B002IVLH60|5.0|Pearl Jam's ninth studio album Backspacer has probably grown to become my favourite Pearl Jam album to date, I did like it initially, but even so it just grew on me more and more with every listen. The album was released in 2009 and saw the band strip back their sound to deliver a light a fun set of rock songs with a new wave influence alongside some wonderful ballads and quieter moments.<br /><br />The album is fairly short and easy to digest, there isn't a great deal of complexity in the songwriting, no overly challenging artistic tracks can be found either. Rather than make for a dull and forgettable record, Backspacer is a revelation because of this; one of the tightest and most concise records in the Pearl Jam catalougue that delivers good time vibes and tear-to-the-eye moments in equal measure.<br /><br />Standout songs include the fun `Johnny Guitar,' and `Got Some,' as well as the powerful `Force Of Nature,' and `Amongst The Waves,' but in fairness, every single track is good, this is a thoroughly consistent album, bordering on the flawless.<br /><br />If you really liked the direction of the previous three Pearl Jam records, Backspacer may be something of a shock, but give it a fair chance and you'll be rewarded with one of the band's best works to date.<br /><br />I highly recommend Backspacer. I haven't listened to a Pearl Jam album so frequently for so long after its initial release in years. Its not big and its not complicated, but it is pretty much a perfect album nonetheless.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I love this movie! I had a VHS copy that I had recorded from live TV years ago. Now I'm finally upgrading to the DVD version. Can't wait to watch it over and over again.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|In hindsight, the four glossy photos enclosed of each member of the band is a dead giveaway. The music inside pitches the prospect of individuality. Two or three-part harmonies are practically nowhere to be heard amongst its thirty bands of song. Not everything scores - \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"Piggies\\" are hideous and I don't much care for the hollow-reggae confection of Paul's \\"O-Bla-Di-O-Bla-Da\\". He does compensate by rocking strongly with \\"Back In the U.S.S.R.\\" and the irresistable throwaway \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?\\". Paul also earns his rightful place with the laid-back charms of \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"I Will\\". George burns brightly on the humorous \\"Savoy Truffle\\" and especially as the mystic in \\"Long Long Long\\". John reinvents himself through a gallery of changes resulting in the most fascinating and satisfying music found here. He supports Mia Farrow's sister whilst trouncing on the Maharishi and he gives a remarkably nuanced vocal on the reflective \\"Julia\\". But it's when he's rocked by personal and social turmoil - \\"Yer Blues\\", \\"I'm So Tired\\", \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" and \\"Revolution 1\\" - that he really focuses the lens inside of him.<br /><br />Another curio to the album is that random doodlings of Spanish guitar or scraps of violin are placed between cuts. In a flawless sequencing, they incorporate a haunting aside \\"Can You Take Me Back\\" before it dives into the chaotic oddity \\"Revolution 9\\". This most individualistic piece of all employs cinematic technique to create an eight-minute non-musical soundscape that must be heard.<br /><br />They've scaled back from \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" ambition with instrumentation far more skeletal but the band-backing empathy remains intact. In keeping it as artfully arranged as possible, Ringo gets the last word on \\"Good Night\\" that's as appropriate an ending off after the world has ended.
1569242739|5.0|I love this cookbook!  I am vegan and I love to bake for just about any occasion.  Whenever I have a work function or a get together at my house, I pull out this little cookbook and whip up something fabulous.  I've also found, that non-vegans can't even tell a difference between these cupcakes and regular ones, and some people have told me the vegan cupcakes even taste better than non-vegan!    I got married about a month ago and I used a recipe from this book (coconut lime cupcakes) to make our wedding cupcakes - and they were definitely a hit.  This cookbook is a little gem - definitely worth getting!

0800177177|2.0|Grossly overrated, historically inaccurate, and rather tepid film-version of the classic written by Bram Stoker. It has brilliant actors and suitable direction that helps the movie to become watchable, but it has neither the primal horror evoked by the novel, nor the distinction of becoming the best dramatisation of the said novel. That honour rests with [[ASIN:B000R7I48G Count Dracula (BBC Mini-Series)]], whcih I strongly recommend to all those actually interested in Bram Stoker's Dracula. If you wish to delve more deeply into the legend of Dracula, then you may find good old Norton Critical edition of the novel helpful. If you wish to go through a thrillride of watching the emergence of the character Dracula through the lens of fictionalised history, I recommend reading Reggie Oliver's \\"The Dracula Papers\\". These are classics, and would be appreciated without the association of so-called big names.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is an amazing alarm, works functionally as your classical alarm clock, but if your feel you think you need more help waking up, there are snooze button enlarging (so you don't accidentally dismiss the alarm)or math quiz to get your mind churning before that ringing ends! I'm just upset this app became free after I paid for it. Oh if only I waited an extra 2-3 weeks.
B0040JHLM2|5.0|Hello i have had the lunar glide 2 for only three months and am getting this burning pain around my knees.... never had this issue with the first lunarglides. I have been looking at this brooks shoes would you guys recomend this please let me know....
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I have not actually used this app yet as I am already awake, but I LOVE the concept! I am a really sound sleeper and tend to sleep through other alarms. I am hoping that this will help me get up to see my son off to school since my other alarms do noting to ensure that I am waking up.\nI am just curious why people are rating it again, which they themselves seem to not like since the claim there are a bunch of fake reviews posted by the &quot;same guy&quot; just to make it look better. If you rely on the reviews of an app, or anything for that matter, to decided whether or not to try something then you are missing out. You are missing out on using your own brain, on the gratification of being a big boy and making your own choices, on being unique by not following the crowd, and on the app or thing itself. I also look at reviews of just about every service I use and product I buy, but then I also read magazines, companies product discriptions, competitors&apos; product and do some research.\nYa&apos;ll don&apos;t need to grow a brain, just start using the one you have... and maybe learn some compasion and start caring for others along the way.\nAs for it being free again (and the people who posted low reviews just for that) I didn&apos;t have my phone the first time it came around, I am personally glad it is free again. Did you ever think that maybe it got a lot of really great reviews and Amazon is thinking about their New customers? Life does not revolve atound one person, and maybe we all need to stop thinking it does and think about other people and their situation before you run off at the mouth, spouting dribble that only makes sence in a &quot;all about me&quot; universe.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm clock likes u to pick many different audio options, and the turn off feature is math from easy 5-2 to complex algebra, some of it is very hard especially when you are half wake! Love!<br /><br />EDIT: i STILL use this everyday!!!<br />best money i have ever spent! PS since getting this app i have not been late for work or slept thru an alarm... i use the advanced math setting. THANK YOU SO MUCH !
0345529057|5.0|Great books. Very dense but the format is a fresh change (each chapter focuses on a different character) from the norm.    Only complaint would be that the covers are all pictures from the television series, would've liked original covers, but couldn't pass up on price.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game certainly reminds me of the Final Fantasy series. I'm roughly one hour into the game, I'm very pleased with the quality of the story, graphics, and music. I didn't really expect this level of quality for an Android game. Highly recommended if you like old-school RPG's.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|i got this as a free app.  I dont see much of a difference between this alarm clock and the others out there. This one gives alot of snooze options.  I was looking for one that rang loud.  This one doesnt either.  good app if you like to hit snooze but average if you want o ne that wakes you up right away.  also timer doesnt make a sound when time is up quite unuseful._

1572814349|4.0|The Golden Tarot deck is fabulous. I connected with it right away. The images are easy for a beginner to interpret, but lasting enough for me to use this deck for a long time. The only downside is how freaking stiff the cards are! The laminate over the cards makes them so difficult to shuffle that I gave myself blisters. I spent last night running the cards over corners on my table to bang them up a bit so I could handle them. I've bent them every way possible. The good news is, they still look great. The bad news is, I don't know how much it helped. Oh well, back to shuffling!
0553801473|3.0|Maybe my expectations were too high - I was hoping for resolution of some of the arcs, or  more conflict or... SOMETHING.  When I got about 3/4 of the way through, I realised there weren't enough pages left for what I was hoping to happen to happen.  Aside from a handful of very good chapters, the rest of it was like watching a very slow chess game - just waiting, waiting, waiting for the pieces to crawl into place.  Fingers crossed the next book isn't another 6 years in the making... a lot needs to happen in the next 2 books because, after the relatively fast pace of AGOT and ACOK, nothing much really seems to happen in this one!  Having said that though, I still enjoy Martin's writing, I still love this series and I will still buy and read the next 2 books.. but I'm starting to fear Martin may have peaked a little early.  Will anything ever be as gripping as AGOT?
