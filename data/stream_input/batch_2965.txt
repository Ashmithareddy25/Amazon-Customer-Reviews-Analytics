B0063M22QO|5.0|It's great! The more games you conquer the greater the challenge. Keeps the brain thinking!  If you lose a game they give you the option to shuffle the tiles and complete the game but I prefer to start over and win the game on my own.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is an okay game but like I said not my favorite in the whole wide world. Could by better.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|You keep flipping the pages.<br /><br />One of the best books by John Grisham after The Client. A very captivating book that i would recommend to any reader.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoy the series a lot.  What I did not like about the season 2 dvd was that it hung up at one point and we lost several minutes of conversation.  Then the last two sessions on season 2 were the same show.  How disappointing that a new DVD was not in perfect viewing condition! Not sure what to do about that.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game! My son loves playing this... even downloaded it to his nabi so he doesn't have to play on my phone.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A very poignant story! An excellent novel. It was hard to put down once I began reading it,  thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I don't usually get into games, but this one can really draw you in... my 3yr. old plays this game and kicks my butt, but I still love playing!
0762445262|3.0|It works but light can only be so bright since its small. Looks like a piece for something batman related that it could connect to.
037582913X|5.0|This is one of our favorite books! My kids saw an app of this, which was amazing. They quickly learned it almost by heart. Now they can &#34;read&#34; it themselves. It's great fun to read aloud and would also be great for a child just learning to read, because the total number of words it uses is small. And a great concept book for kids who are dealing with fears. Fantastic!
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Entwined with You is the third, supposed final, installment to the Crossfire Series.  While I did enjoy this book, I have to express my disappointment. This series was presented as a \\"Trilogy\\" and what the reader finds out only after purchasing and reading the book, is that it's no longer a Trilogy (obviously, for the story is nowhere near resolved), there is going to be another book and who knows how many after that?  As the reader I now find it frustrating not knowing when this story is going to be completely resolved.<br /><br />While I had anticipated plot resolution from this installment what I received was far from enlightening.  I was actually left with most of the loose ends untied and presented with new information, which I assume is to cater to new sub plots and crisis for the two main characters of Gideon and Ava to explore in the upcoming books.<br /><br />The highlight of this book for me was the character development taking place within Gideon and Ava.  Both protagonists really matured in this installment, not only in regard to their individual insecurities but as a couple as well. Ava became less annoying and Gideon became more loveable. They feel stable at the moment but I don't know how long that will last, as I am sure the next installment will test this greatly.<br /><br />What I hope for in the next installment are answers and plot resolution - I don't want this series to drag! I want resolution regarding Gideon's past - including whatever confrontation is to come between him, his mother and his family.  Overall, I think we are due for a more direct focus on Gideon's back story as we have seen enough from Ava.  I guess we will just have to wait and see where this next installment will take us - fingers crossed it's not a letdown.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie is slow, obtuse, and without any features that might keep one's attention. What plot there is gets lost in bogged down inaction and empty dialogue<br /><br />Both Murray and Johansen are exquisite actors and I must say was surprised and badly disappointed by this piece.<br /><br />John A. Leraas
B00CMQX84A|5.0|This is a great addition to the movies and entertainment offered by Disney. My kids are 5, 8 and 10 and they LOVED the movie! Ross Lynch, Maia Mitchell and cast are wonderfully cast. I would hate to see a remake. Wet Side Story ..so fun, the movie has overtones of many of those born prior to 1970 - so it's nostalgic on some levels for the mature viewer. My childern love the songs, the dance and the story.<br />In several words: FUN, entertaining, exciting, engaging! - appropriate for all ages 5 - 105!<br />Like all great musicals: you will find yourself singing along, humming the tunes and just glad you had the opportunity to be part of the magic of the movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This truely is the masterpiece of all books . I wish that there were100000 volumes and each 1000 pages long
B0044WSGXI|5.0|Ah, life was good in the day.<br /><br />If you want to show your kids how good life was before the Internet and cell phones then this is the movie to see with them.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|It is worth the $16.95.  I had been frustrated with the free version which would only randomly access my computers in a different network.  With this I have no problem with any WiFi network or my 4G.
B005LAII80|5.0|I'll just start out by saying I LOVE this movie.  I watched it three times in the theaters, and have watched it a dozen times since I purchased the Blu-ray.  That being said, this movie isn't perfect. None of them are.  But for staying true to the source material, and absolutely NAILING the character (Karl Urban IS Dredd), this movie does it right.  This is NOT a remake of that travesty \\"Judge Dredd\\" done by Sylvester Stallone.  It's fine if you like that film, to each their own.  But those that feel this movie was bad because it wasn't like that film, understand this...it's not SUPPOSED to be like that film.  I hesitate to even call this a reboot, primarily because you have to acknowledge that the Stallone version exists to do so.  To those that can't stand this portrayal of Dredd or the fact that he never removes his helmet, I URGE you to do some background checking on the character.  Judge Dredd has been running continuously since the 70's, and the one and only time he showed his face, they censored it.  Which means he NEVER shows his face....EVER.  To truly enjoy this movie, I believe that knowing something about the character and the world he operates in is important.  It is possible to enjoy it without that knowledge, but you'll miss out on some of the nuances.  If violence and blood and a stoic main character don't appeal to you, then this probably isn't the right movie for you.  But for those with a heartier constitution, and especially ANYONE that has a remote interest in the Dredd universe, SEE THIS FILM.  It was such a shame that this movie didn't get the attention it deserved when it was in the theaters.  But it's not too late...
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game was a little disappointing. I guess I expected to much because of the reviews. Was it just me or was it a bit short and confusing?!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I got hooked up to this show after i saw once episode. It is very fresh, full of action, suspense, and thriller all at same time.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Beats the released version of self portrait hands down.<br />This material is much better.<br />OK  &#34;Tired horses&#34; is still bad
B009LGO88E|4.0|Got this because being lefty I was having a hard time playing Monster Hunter with the screen, after I ordered this they announced that is was coming to the US so I paid more to have it sent to me than if I had just waited.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because of the many truths by way of humor is so right on about living in America. Everything from shopping to the loss of main street and the numerous choices for coffee served to waiting in lines. I understood every piece of life in America according to Bill Bryson. I shared some of this humor with my husband and he liked it, too, because there is so much truth in what the author is saying.
B004PIKPTY|5.0|I use these all the time, whether it is listening to music or chatting with friends these headphones give a crisp clear sound and the bass is incredible, will more than likely get these again if mine give out ever.
1481278738|5.0|Love this book.  It simplifies many of the needed instructions.  I am still struggling with using the MP4 files to make my video projects. I will not give up.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Gave this DVD to my husband, who loves the Eagles, for his birthday, he said it was the best birthday present ever.  He has watched it numerous times.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|This is such a great toy for toddlers.  It is easy to open for little hands and there are no small parts that have come off since we've had this (a few months).  I really enjoy this playmobil series for the little kids as they are well made, imaginative and have a really simple design.  Highly recommended.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I wish they had not done this as a zombie deal and figure out some other way.<br />I like BRad Pitt and overall it was a decent movie but it took to long and it would have been more interesting to see how they went about wiping out the zombies and starting over...
B005544TRQ|5.0|&#34;Just love it &#34;............ What can I say !<br />I wish USA would have picked up<br />&#34;The New Normal &#34; The wrighting and acting so on point , and shows like these need the time to develop and bild the fan base each year more Fans are comeing to the fold !!<br />  Excellent
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story line is excellent as well as the actors. I cannot wait for season four..what will happen next to the families.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I have found angry birds 2 somewhat of a challenge.  Haven't spent much time playing it but have found it is going to take a different touch.  And different birds make it more appealing.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Fun game ,enjoy it alot! Play it to relax and it does the trick, helps keep me alert and ready for the day and try it you'll like it for sure!
0689835604|5.0|I think there are a few of these Karen Katz books with the flaps so if you like this keep that in mind. Bright colors, cute book!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I fell in love with the show the first time I saw it. It is an amazing show, the characters blend really well with each other making the show great. I love everything about the show
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is a must read!!! You will fall head over heels for Travis!!!! Could read over and over again &#60;3
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season! I enjoyed the expansion of the back stories of the servants - some of the better highlights of the season.Highly recommended!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I thought it was absolutely marvelous my all-time favorite movie . love the Darcy , he is such a gentleman
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I love the Die Hard series - Bruce Willis doesn't seem to age....this was great.  I hope he continues to make more.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|Great children's classic. Perfect supplement to my  grandson's current literature study in his preschool class. He enjoys reading the story to us over and over.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Poorly done - acting was terrible, plot was strange and all over the place.  Don't waste your time or money.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love Mahjong, after playing all the free games I have bought the full version.  It has 168 different puzzles, so this will keep me &#34;in the game&#34; for a long time, and the price is wonderful for those of us who need to watch all our penny's!  Happy Gaming.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|No depth - just another telling of the same story.  The special effects were great but the main characters and script were stale.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|solid writing, good acting  it's similar to watching a mini movie like j j abrams as the creator nicely done
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I really liked this but didn't feel that Cruise was really into the character.  He didn't seem quite invested.  Given that it was witty, action packed and very entertaining.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Scary Movie! Great Price! Great Picture. You can't go wrong with the film OR the price. I'm very happy with purchase!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good movie - would highly recommend.  Lots of quick turns in the plot.  Kept us entertained and guessing next moves.
B0055S348W|1.0|I downloaded it and experimented with it and it's not for me.<br />Might work for other people who need such a item
1589946634|3.0|Before I break too far into this review, a an item readers should know: I have not played this game with anyone, just the single player version so I cannot speak to larger games.<br /><br />I happened to be walking through Barnes and Noble one day and saw this card game in their clearance bin for half off. Hearkening back to the old days of Space Hulk (a board game I loved) I couldn't help but pick it up, especially as it is made by Fantasy Flight, a team that makes some solid games these days. Unfortunately, I have been a bit disappointed by this purchase.<br /><br />My main problem with this game is how confusing it can be. Keep in mind, I have never played with anyone who has extensive experience with it. Regardless, the instructions are not very well written and are extremely confusing, a trait I generally don't assign to games made by Fantasy Flight. After my third time through the instructions and still feeling no clearer on how to start playing, I hit the internet to find any kind of an instructional video. Luckily, I came a across a couple of decent series videos on Youtube showing how to play step by step.<br /><br />The game is alright, but not as much fun as I was hoping for. If I were to make the decisions again, I would save the $10 and pick up Elder Signs or a themed Fluxx instead.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very sturdy and works great. I recommend this product.  Surprisingly great sharpener considering its size.  I may buy more as Xmas stocking stuffers.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|I love Edward Rutherford's writing excellent historical novel well researched  looking forward to reading the rest of what he has written
B002RPR6DU|5.0|One of my all-time favorites.  A classic!  A perfect role for Bruce Dern.  During a recent viewing, I was just as affected by the importance of the message in this movie as I was the first time I watched it when it was first released.  Highly recommended to anyone who cares about our planet and the future.  Sci Fi fans should enjoy this.  The little drones are adorable too!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I am rarely creeped out or shocked by the formulaic schlock that Hollywood produces, but this film is the rare gem that we horror fans long for.  This film is not to be missed, most especially if you are a fan of the genre.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have had tinitus for most of my life. It is nice to have different background sounds to circumvent the tinitus. I have found the urban rain also helps me get to sleep better than just a fan going.  Glad my daughter found this. Thank you.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I am down to the last episodes of the show and will really miss it.  I rarely watch television shows more than once but Fringe has so endeared itself to me that I will likely give it multiple viewings.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I was unemployed for nearly 8 months after I graduated from college.    I had a lot of time to think.  A lot of time spent in my running shoes.  Many hours laid out on the back patio with my Kindle.  And even more time flipping through channels in my parent’s living room, laptop open, impatiently waiting for an email from any company I had applied with.    And thus, one early morning, I flipped to TNT and came upon a show called \\"Supernatural\\". Now, I love all things paranormal. It scares me s***less, but I like it. And to see two sexy ass men traveling across country, fighting ghosts and shape shifters, was pretty much all I needed to see to be hooked like a fish.    The first episode I ever saw was “Ghostfacers” (which is somewhere on this season) and I completely fell in love. I probably shouldn’t have watched it out of order, but I was broke and couldn’t afford to buy the seasons. (Flip to almost a year later and I’ve compulsively bought almost all of them consecutively within a months’ time). I was confused as hell, but I couldn’t stop watching. It’s an addiction.    This TV series has easily become one of my favorites, if not at the tippy top of the list, it’s definitely worth the time.    Dean and Sam. Cas and Crowley. Ruby and Jo. Bobby.    It's all awesome.
1449437524|5.0|Was a gift for my Mother in law! she loved it! Great Gift great book! hope they make more books!
B000UIVRXG|5.0|Hot Fuzz is the second movie in the so-called Cornetto Trilogy and it's comedy gold.  These guys know how to write.  It is one of the most finely crafted comedies, let alone movies, I've ever watched and it just gets funnier and funnier to me each time.<br /><br />Yes... the plot is far fetched (shocking in a movie, I know!) but the acting, the callbacks, and the editing make this one of my all time favorite movies.  There's gore, silliness, explosions, the fastest car chase ever, cop movie homages, sex jokes, and a bevy of incredibly talented English actors who round out the cast: Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, Stephen Merchant, Lucy Punch, Timothy Dalton, Olivia Colman and so many more.  (Be on the lookout for an uncredited cameo by Aussie Cate Blanchett, too, btw!)<br /><br />I have friends who aren't as enthusiastic about this movie (or Shaun of the Dead, #1 in the Cornetto Trilogy) as I am but it fits perfectly with my sense of humor.  If you liked Super Troopers, you'll find this movie is even more finely crafted, hilarious, and FUN.
B004GYY714|1.0|I wanted to turn my iphone into an AM/FM receiver.... this is not that app. I have no idea what I'm connecting to. If you have a data plan, kiss it goodbye.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was glad to stay with this book, the beginning is confusing but as you stay with the story you say wow.
B0058W74UY|1.0|It does not work for Kindle Fire as advertised. Unable to find a flash player that does work with Kindle Fire.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I wasn't aware it was a young adult book &#34;20's&#34;. It kept my interest and<br />Was uplifting. God knows we could use something<br /> Uplifting in that age group
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Need Adobe Flash Player for Kindle Fire but am unable to find it. Some applications require that are supposed to work on Kindle Fire require the player.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|I was looking for a good heist movie. This did not fit the bill. I felt this CGI-fest was a bunch of fantasy magic (i.e. make up whatever you want) doing its best to proclaim itself as reality-based magic (Copperfield-style illusions). I found many of the visuals and plot elements to be so absurd and distracting that I could not enjoy the movie.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I rated this so high not because it is a film that will change your life, but because it provided elements that I was looking for and very few other films can provide these.<br />I used to be a fan of urban, psychological Scorsese-esque thrillers but sometimes: enough is enough and you want to encounter fantastical green and growing elements with a creative plot that does not take itself too seriously yet is mature enough to hang together.<br /><br />I recommend it if you are feeling nostalgic for films like Willow or Dark Crystal with a bit of the epic-ness of Lord of the Rings.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best alarm I've ever had.  It rings until you turn it off. I have left my Kindle at work on my desk and come in the next morning and find it ringing.  Love it!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was suspenseful and you kept trying to figure out the mystery person. Totally shocked in end on who it was. Good movie.
B00DURHYWC|2.0|I am a loyal fan of the group, and have all the records. Have ordered this one from Amazon to coincide with the date of UK release (Amazon delivered). Disappointed in the CD. The impression is that they tried to get a scheduled release under their contract, no matter what, and listeners be damned. Ethnic songs not interesting, you will be better off buying any disk from the Putumayo production. The first song is more or less fine, but would be a mediocre offering on earlier disks. \\"Sway\\" is ludicrously rendered, especially bearing in mind the superb version of Buble. It is hard to spoil a Rogers-Hart song, but they pull it off. The last song is a repetition of the disaster with Chavela Vargas from their previous album. Puerile voyeurism, not a tribute to a great artist. Is that it? The end of a fine group? Sad.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Awesome piece of read! Vintage Forsyth! Real dessert is in the details! Very contemporary and very we'll written! If you liked The Icon, you will love this one too!
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|This is horrible.  It is a bad influence for kids. And I'm a kid!  Why, why,  WHY WOULD YOU ENJOY THIS?!?!<br />Most sensible people would see it as horrid.  I guess people aren't very bright these days.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great show, saw it at the theater. This is the second time to watch after it came out on DVD. Uplifting story.
B001ENS0BI|3.0|The show seems to have run out of ideas and is just going on it's early popularity.  It's still decent but not nearly as good as earlier seasons.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Surprising twists and turns. Excellent how the author intertwined all the lives of the characters though the flash backs were a bit confusing.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|When this show was on tv, I didn't want to like it let alone love it.  But, gave it try with season 1 and bought season 2 because I was hungry for more.  Addicting television series and I now know why this was a big hit!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Simple but sometimes challenging.  No fireworks when you complete tho.  That would be nice.  I also did not notice any easter eggs.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I really enjoyed The Lord of The Rings movies but, I never thought the Hobbit would be better than I thought....It's my favorite so far!!!  It's even neat to watch the lord of the rings again after watching the hobbit....LOVE IT!!!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Truly an enjoyable game. There's a nice mix of easy to more challenging puzzles. I was only going to give this app a quick test run and move on with my day; that was 3 hours ago. Recommendation: carve out a few hours in your schedule, grab a cup of coffee,  and relax with this app.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|Can't believe I found this classic on here!  This is one of my favorite Madonna movies...and I really don't like hardly any of her movies. But this on is a funny and outrageous comedy that I can watch over and over.  If you haven't seen it then you are missing out, my friend! :)
B00008DDSC|5.0|Love this movie so much.  It is a classic love story with a  super hinky twist.  It comes with high recommendations.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Walking Dead is a creepy show....and season 2 is even creepier than the first!  Everyone (that's left) follows Rick's lead and trys to stick togeather and make it out alive.  This season was a little slow at first with not quite as much zombies until the last couple of episodes.  Ready for season 3...I think. ;)
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love the flippix apps so much! I liked this version the best of all so far because there were more portraits with more puzzles per page. It was great! I never wanted it to end.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Game of Thrones is one of the best shows on television and season 2 was even better than the first one if you can believe that.  Can't wait to pick up my season 3 copy on here also!
B0052ZQMLO|5.0|Product purchased as I like to read German Books on my Kindle to try and improve my knowledge of the language. I had no difficulty in setting up as the default dictionary. I was delighted to see that the dictionary recognises many declined verbs and composite nouns and those that it does not recognise in reading mode can easily be looked up in dictionary search mode. I am very pleased with this product and consider it well worth the money
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural never seems to let me down...love it!!!  Better yet, was that I bought season 7 brand new at a super low cost!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game rocks it is very well done and has great play would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes logic puzzles
B0090SI4LU|5.0|The book of coarse is better but, compaired to the Twilight Saga this movie was alot closer to the book.  What great acting from everyone in the movie especially Saoirse Ronan!!!  I can't get enough of this movie and my boyfriend really enjoyed it too!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Got this as faotd. Great concept. Complete scenes by solving pictogram logic puzzles.  it's obvious that the developers hope you will buy the other packs.  I just wish there was a larger, &quot;super pack,&quot; that would have them all for less than the price separately.  But I will probably buy at least one more.<br /><br />I also wish there was a menu where you could track how many puzzles / scenes you have left to complete in a given category. You can only cycle forward or backward in each category, hard, medium and easy. There's also no pause / exit button which means app must be fc to prevent it running in background and draining battery.<br /><br />5 stars for gameplay less one star for lack of menus, exit button and cost when compared to other simular apps like &quot;Cross Me&quot;.
0553801473|5.0|The whole saga of A Song of Ice and Fire is so addicting and book 5 was no exemption.  George R.R. Martin is such a great author, I just hope he hurries and gets book 6 out on the shelves.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you like solitaire games, than this is a game worth trying. simple and basic. good for any skill level
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie was such a great movie!!  The previews were good but it is a must watch for sure.  Love it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Had lots of fun figuring out this puzzle.  Challenging and thank goodness for the help button.  Not my normal adventure game playing, was looking for something new.  Can't wait for the second one to come out.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I can't believe it is 2013 and I'm just now watching this movie!  Where have I been?  This movie is worth the watch!
B006PFC2FA|5.0|Love this movie. It's good for a girl's day. Love the music and dancing. Very fun to watch, even if it's by yourself.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|If you love the new star trek movies, this one is a must see from the original cast! Character development in the new movies are right on with this cast!
B00DU74U74|4.0|Surprised by this movie. After hearing &#34;from the author of twilight&#34;, I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a new, cool take on alien invasion.<br />Helps that Max Irons was the leading man...
B006LSZECO|2.0|Started off good but deteriorated as story went along. Enjoyable read but not great writing. At times suspenseful.  Have read other books with solar themes but better written and more plausible.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very entertaining.<br /><br />Some may be put off with the way the author weaves her story by going back and forth between all of her character lives.  I enoyed the dance, as I enjoy multi- tasking.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Best app, need to download it ASAP! And its free! It helps maintain and clean your system for the best performance
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I like it but prefer bubble witch saga both are fun nice graphics crossbow a bit difficult to aim with
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It fun to play I really love it. It's really age appropriate for kids that like disposable me the movie.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I have used several of his techniques to get my life in order and streamline areas so that I can live my life to the fullest. I would recommend this to anyone.
0385732554|5.0|I've read The Giver a couple of times now, and I am always kept interested. Lois Lowry does a great job of keeping the plot interesting, because there are usually great twists. SPOILER ALERT: In this particular book, she keeps the reader intellectually involved by presenting a whole different reality that one thinks could never happen, but leaves you wondering.... I hope to read the next books in this Trilogy! I hadn't even heard they were in existence! Hopefully they answer the question that arose in my mind while reading this book... =p
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I liked this novel and was surprised that I really like Jack Ryan Sr. coming back. I would like to see this series continued with the new characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was amazing but can I read before I review please thank you and have a nice. Day!! Bye family
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved the movie and the scenery was wonderful. It is not really for children but teenagers and adults, makes you think about your spiritual life and just your everyday life.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I was not expecting much but this movie was a very enjoyable sci-fi action movie, with a good plot and acting and great action. Much better than I remember the first Judge Dredd movie. You won't be disappointed.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Oh, yes, it has helped me learn to Eat that Frog as I am going through my todo list everyday. I think that it should be required reading for anyone going into the business world, stay at home mothers, students. Great time management.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a replacement disc for the worn-out one I owned for years. My kids still get sleepy when I play it, and I find it soothing.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I love everything Eagles, so why would I not like this 3 DVD history of the band? It was worth the price.

B008YW5RH2|2.0|I downloaded the app and when I tried the first Demo my Kindle went blank. It was totally locked up. I could not do anything.  I finally found on a message board how to to a hard reset on the Kindle. When I was able to get back I I deleted the app.
0316286850|5.0|I love the detail that he goes into although I do wish that he would share a few product names as the red flesh toned lip pencil is hard to find.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Kind or boring - Maybe I will play more and see some big winnings.  This is just a game to pass the time.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Definitely improved the sound, especially when using it with my Tork X-pro helmet speakers! Charges easily and fits into my tank bag.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I watch all Star Trek and have liked them all.  I own all the movies and games that are Star Trek based.
B00006RAKP|5.0|A great collection of classic Elton John songs, this two disc set truely captures all of his great hits, not just some of them.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This movie kept our attention and we found it to be entertaining....not the best science fiction movie we've ever seen but decent enough.
0865479410|5.0|This read simply provides a much needed perspective on the contemporary persuit of ”happiness”, whatever that actually is, being properly watered down throughout these times. You may not indeed be able to change the outer things bothering you in life, but there are surely other ways to approach them than utter negativity or its much scarier counterpart.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it, love it, graphics are so good, like your in the movies recreating.  Just wish it was easier to receive acorns.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Having got this as a free promotion from Amazon, this game definitely got my attention and will make me look at other games by the same developer.  Well crafted and polished. Some minor things seem like they might be wasting a tiny bit of CPU time, but otherwise a very well-written program.  And another person mentioned, the single permission being network access means you don't have to worry about security.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|And I love it.  I can now read on everything ...  my PC, my laptop, my Kindle and My Galaxy Tablets
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Heard/read all the bad reviews but watched World War Z anyway. Was pleasantly surprised! It's actually a good movie with a great storyline, character development, suspense, and awesome special effects. Give it a try!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|like it much better than candy crunch.  Would love to see more levels and more themes..maybe pets or farm animals?  Love ability to swipe in all directions and diagonally.  Will look for more games by this company for sure!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this crazy story and wanted to read even when I didn't have the time for it. It was quite a strange tale.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|loved the movie and really like the music. have listened to it a lot and service was great.my daughter<br />liked it so much sh ebought one
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Another great movie by Tarantino.  It is not for everyone but if you like some of his others you will like this one.  I will probably purchase it now after renting it.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Just a really fun romp all around. Great casting, good writing, and lots of action. What more could you ask of a summer movie? I can't wait for the next installment.
B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|This is the THIRD time I have ordered a song fron Amazon & the WRONG SONG was downloaded! Once isnt good, twice is bad, a THIRD TIME is a bad pattern! I've contacted Amazon about this problem & haven't gotten a response yet. If it isnt rectified it'll be the LAST TIME I ORDER FROM THIS SITE!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This weather channel is the best there is out there. You can check the weather for any city in the world and save to your favourites to recall any time. I've had this for many months on my Kindle and it is great for  business travellers or vacationers. I downloaded a similar channel on my iPad in Canada, but iStore gave me junk and now I want to put this particular one on my iPad.  Wonderful app.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|This was just great.  A real life look at the hard work that a truly dedicated woman puts in to make her dreams come true.  This shows that not everyone is perfect, there are struggles and pitfalls, but anyone with ambitions can reach their goals.  Great.  Love Katy Perry even more now.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's a fun addictive game to play. Makes you think and the pictures are okay too. Fun for a free game, think I,'ll keep the app.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|ok this is my second time complaining about this game every time I try to get to my frenid right then I tap on it and it now has crashed my kindle fire five times five times and its not just his account its other I'm getting tired of this if this does not get fixed I'm not going to play world at arms anymore.  Ps the first time it did it then the 2 and 3 I just am getting tired of this it had to come to this point Omg. :( no :) just :(
0385340990|5.0|My book club was looking for a light-hearted book and this was wonderful - even though it dealt with occupied Europe in WWII. Very charming, yet not complete fluff.
B00B19G01C|3.0|This movie had potential to be so much better but did have some really creepy moments that are worth the wait.  Not too bad but could have been better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pintrest, I get lost for hours and yes I actually do make some of the projects and recipes, so nice to have a fun and interesting place to go that is not negative and hateful.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was an excellent novel with a completely surprise ending. It was a story well told of a time in history that must not be forgotten. We often see the pictures of adults in concentration camps, but rarely see the children. This is definitely a story worth retelling.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Maybe Aphrodite was not the most appropriate title to this cute little Kylie album. It sounds a bit too sophisticated. But I do know that I love Greek Mythology. And I know I especially love Kylie! I got this album for Christmas several years ago and it is still a fun and addicting listen. Kylie has the voice of an angel and all of these songs are a joy to listen to. She is not really breaking any new ground but that is alright with me as long as her tunes are this danceable and this classy. My favorites are All the Lovers, Aphrodite, Better Than Today, and Looking for an Angel. While this might be over exaggerating just a bit, it reminds me of when I first started listening to Prince. His pop tunes became more addicting and more effective with repeated listens. This album does the same.<br /><br />I love Madonna's older music and consider her to be the Queen of Pop. She paved the way for artists like Kylie and broke the old rules and set new ones all at the same time. But Kylie knows how to stay consistent and keep the party going. Unlike Madonna, she has class and is not out there just to strike controversy. She is here to have fun and bring life into our world with her cute music. Keep it up, Kylie! I will for sure be purchasing her next album and be keeping her music in my collection for years to come.
B00874T02K|5.0|Easy to use, built in times and mid workout reinforcement.  Perfect for me who was looking for something to get me moving again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great Book....loved the trilogy! The layout of the E-book is simple and easy to use on my I-pad. Looking forward to seeing all the movies that go with it!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I loved this book. The Harry Hole character is a well drawn and nuanced character. The plot unfolds in various interconnected threads that keep the readers interest going. It's hard to put this book down.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I've been waiting for this to arrive. Fun movie. I hope they make more.<br /><br />Loved seeing the Enterprise go where it has never gone before.... That was exciting.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|This is the best! I'm a diehard fan and only the original will do. Sooner or later you need this so stop jonesing and get it :)
B000NMZFKK|5.0|A great movie showing the demons some must burden and deal with their whole life. Finding and fighting the feelings of love are also great points made in the movie. A wonderfully written movie, I can watch time and time again.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I've always wanted to travel to Australia so this book was the next best thing.  I felt Mr. Bryson covered the entire country very well.  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is one of those series that makes you want to watch 3 or 4 episodes per sitting.  Very good writing, directing and acting, characters are fantastic!!  Hope it lasts at least 5 more seasons!<br /><br />Gary
B008D28HYS|4.0|Great game.  I've used other versions and really enjoy this one, although it can be difficult to control with a smart phone, even though I have a pretty large screen.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It was hard to pull away from this show. The characters worked together great and I liked the story line.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A perfect follow up to \\"The Shining\\"  I read this book in a couple of days (even though I continually re-read some amazing passages). I really could not put this book down.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|entertaining and fun good family movie. fast paced, good change from our regular movies. The actors breathe life and intrigue into this film.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|There is no better couple. Gideon and Eva are meant to be together but this book wasn't nearly as good as the first two.  I thought it was a trilogy but it's continuing, not that that's a bad thing.  I need my Gideon fix.  I had my ideas of how this book would go and it didn't happen.  I can understand why but the writing seemed more 50 shadeish than the other 2 books. The focus on the intimacy was there but I care more about what they're going through and how they need one another to get through it in the end.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|We loved this .thought it was a great movie. I know other didn't rate it well but we really enjoyed it. We weren't trying to compare it<br />to anything else. We thought this movie was great on its own and a worthy addition to the new star trek movie.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This star trek movie was a great production.  The cast and plot of the story was done really well and the action scenes are awesome.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun and addictive these puzzles are!! Found them to be a great logic teaching tool for my grandchildren.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|This movie is nothing like the book.  That being said, the movie was really good and scary and what I would think a Zombie apocalypse would be like.  The book was in 'documentary' form and was written 15 years after the zombie apocalypse taking in people experiences.  Some parts of the book were boring as !#!@# but there was one retelling of the zombie apocalypse that reminded me about The Hunger games and surviving in the wild.  That part of the book was worth suffering through the rest...oh but the Movie..yeah...watch it.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Honestly was not expecting much from this movie based solely on previews I had seen, but must say I enjoyed it. It isn't really scary or anything like that, though it was a few scares in it. Really more of an action thriller than anything else. Keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and never really lets up. Decent twist on the zombie genre too. Ending was kind of abrupt, but fitting. All-in-all a good flick.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This is a good movie watch...very close to the book, but the book as it usually is, was better.  :)
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game and a good way to kill time when sitting at home sick. Some are super simple and others are more challenging.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Chris Evans really showed what a great actor and his potential to be even greater in this movie.  I love his funny, witty portrayals he does in other movies, but here he really took the cake.  The cast in this movie is really good as well.  Loved it.  If you're thinking of watching The Avengers, I recommend you watch Thor then this movie next to have some background on the plot in The Avengers.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I'm really enjoying this series, action packed, very believable, hard to put down, ready for the next one!  Off to the library!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I would love to play a recording of Chris Hemsworth voice before I watch anything. haha This movie is really good.  Natalie Portman isn't my favorite in the movie, but the rest of the cast is worth watching.  This movie is pretty much the story plot for The Avengers so if you have to pick any of the marvel movies, I'd start with this one then Captain America.  Looking fwd to watching Thor the Dark World in theatres Nov 8th 2013!!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Love the Duke; and watch them over again when I have free time and always enjoy Amazon Prime's easy access.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I don't know but Tom Cruise is just not the same.  The movie was OK, the plot was good, the action parts are good, but the movie was just OK.  I always just picture Tom Cruise jumping on the couch on Oprah and can't take him seriously anymore.  Sad.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|I don't use it at all you need to be close to wifi, and it is to difficult to utilize.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Chris Pine and Zachary Pinto have as good a TV rapport as Brad Pitt and George Clooney.  I hope they get thrown into doing more movies from here on out.  Great watch and nice continuation to the first Star Trek movie they were in.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|No need to pay the Apple Store mark up.  This case is great.  If I change my mind, at this price point, I'll try something else... or just a different color.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|This girl is really good.  The plot was fun, and the action scenes were exhilarating.  I enjoyed renting this movie.
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|Rumours is not only a Classic rock album, of a time gone by - its also a GREAT album. Every song is great - except for that creepy Oh Daddy next to last track but that's a good song too, its just creepy. One thing that too many people do is dismiss FM and this album as pop-hits, which is wrong. These are well written, well performed songs from a band that had more depth and talent then most of their contemporaries, and would if they were around today shame 99% of the popular &#34;bands&#34; out now.<br /><br />If you listen to the structure and just the playing of the artists on this album you will realize how much is hidden in this classic gem. Sure nearly every song got a lot of airplay back in the day - and still do  on the remaining classic rock radio stations, - but when played in whole, like the old days - you can't help but be stunned by how the band put that many great songs on one album. All while under great internal and external pressures to knock it out of the park.<br /><br />Some FM fans will decry this collection of artists as the too poppy, too commercialized, etc missing the older lineups, the more bluesy songs, etc - but to do so is to be dismissive of what is simply a GREAT album, at a time when Rock was about to go all kablooey, and be purely governed by The Corporate machine. A time when bands worked it all out in the studio, day after day, playing the songs live, till it was right. Not today where the players &#34;mail-it&#34; in, and rely on the mix.<br /><br />If you don't own this FM album you should...its simply too good, too classic not to own. But its also worth it because the songs are great! Timeless.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this is a very fun game. it is addicting after you get the hang of it. I would like to see more pictures
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great<br />You will love it<br /><br />Here is some info you will create and own your own fight you will get people in your city I am a level 13 but it takes a while to level up<br /><br />Thank you
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love Downton, one of the best does on tv. Season 3 ends very sad however, I was a big mad at that ending.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great plot and character development. Very intriguing, romantic and humorous.<br />The story involves real life situations. Keeps it coming I am looking forward to the new Law Firm.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I love this app! I can print from anywhere in the house. It was simple to set up and very easy to use!
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Whether one likes this version depends, entirely, on whether one buys it for the music or for the sets.  The sets are quite good, from the statue of the elephant that opens the movie, to the final scene, in the convent.  There is the breath taking scenery of the mountains, when the yellow passport is cast away on the wind.  There is a view above the river when Javert, his tiny feet precisely on the edge of the wall,  tries to reconcile his lifetime philosophy of strict adherence to the law with Valjean's mercy. There is the funeral parade, with its rede uniforms, black horses, and waving flags.  All bring color and life to the movie.<br />On the other hand, I go to a musical (this is really light opera), for the music, and that is not very good.  The truth is, Russell Crowe sings like a crow--a crow with a sore throat.  Not since Mama Mia!, when I heard Pierce Brosnan \\"sing\\" have I heard worse.  This is one of the cases when the West Side Story gambit should have been used.  Anyone who has heard Norm Lewis in the 25th Anniversary Edition will know what I mean.  Not only does Lewis sing it better, he looks better in the part.  He is taller appearing, has the ability to look down his nose and has the kind of precise neatness that a Javert would have.  He is the quintessential obsessive compulsively neat freak.  Crowe is slovenlyk fat, and unshaven.<br />As for the rest of the cast, with the exception of Samantha Barks, who played Eponine in both productions, the singing and acting was far better in the 25th Anniversary edition and one would be far better off buying that version.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Made me realize just how good I have it at my IT job. Also gave me a few ideas for improving it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|for anyone who never saw this movie, whats your problem? Fun and moving entertainment that keeps it coming with laughing and action scenes.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This is what music, and music writing was years ago. Many bands seem to feel that the music they write is what the public<br />wants to hear. The radio &#34;force feeds us&#34; with the mainstream music producers with deep pockets wants the public to<br />listen to until we &#34;submit&#34; to their artist that they have signed. Enough about my rant, The Winery Dogs have achieved<br />what many band wish they could, chemistry! They have established great music/ lyrics to all there songs on their debut<br />album. OUTSTANDING!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i saw this originally at Imax, and still feel this is the best 3D movie. Now owning it on blue ray 3D puts me right back into Imax.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I found it oddly refreshing to hear the story of someone kept as a sex slave told from the point of view of an innocent child. Emma Donoghue managed to take very difficult subject matter and create something a little easier to read while still keeping it realistic. Donoghue did a wonderful job of keeping the voice of the 5-year-old narrator authentic and of creating a believable story. I really and truly enjoyed every second of this book. I couldn't put it down
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Just started playing, addicted already. This is so good! It's way worth a buck. I'm not going to get anything done because of this game, and I don't care. I can't put it down, not even going to try. Love it
B00005V9IL|3.0|Interesting undersea sci-fi tale.  Typical James Cameron film; ambitious story with some scenes lasting way too long and the film itself too long and too busy. Weak, gimicky, and less than satisfying ending. A decent movie that could have been much better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging, very addictive and a lot of fun. Highly recommend this app. Wish there were more levels, more games!
140006922X|5.0|I've read more than a few accounts of the historical Jesus from Meier to Verhoeven and this, for me, is the best so far.  On Fox news I guess a journalist lobbed a question at the author - if there was a bias or reason why he would write a \\"historical\\" book about Jesus, but I think it was a fair question.  If a Christian professor wrote a book stripping the myths and legends of Mohammed's life, a question or two from a journalist would I'm sure come his/her way.  Anyway, Aslan is a very good writer and I just could not put the book down.  He has opened my eyes to many parts of the gospel stories that I could not quite get my mind around.  By explaining the world in which Jesus lived it opens up what Jesus might have thought of himself and his message.  Far from being biased Aslan goes out of his way to be respectful of the mystery of Jesus as both Christ and as a man.  Excellet book and I'm sure I'll read it again.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game is awesome! I have played it so much that I have acquired the mini gun. For all you people who are complaining about the ammo crates, here's a tip: when you start running in the beginning, look in the sky for the ravens flying in circles, move in that direction. There should be an ammunition crate under them,on the ground. I think that it is just SAD that a lot of you are adults and you couldn't figure that out. I'm 13 and figured it out on the second time I played this game. Also, like I said, I played until I got the minigun, speaking of which, here's another tip: for all the people out there that are wondering about how many rounds the minigun can hold at its maximum capacity, it holds 450 rounds maximum. I play this on my kindle Fire, and it NEVER, EVER, EVER lags, pops ads in my face, crashes, bugs, and best of all, it NEVER glitches. Can I give ten stars? Because this game deserves them! THIS! IS! SPARTA!!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this puzzle game. For me it really makes me use another part of my brain. I also really enjoy the graphics.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Excellent series with a beautiful story and a good philosophical message about life.  It is well written and acted.  The cinematography is wonderful.
B008XJ8WE6|1.0|this is a review of the BLUE RAY DISK -<br />We got the DVD in 2000 and 13 years later we get this CRAP?<br />WAKE UP PEOPLE.<br /><br />This is NOT Blue Ray quality. I did a side by side comparison.<br />The video quality is very slightly or equal to the DVD quality from the 2000 year release.MAJOR RIP OFF, THIS MUSICAL IS NOT THAT OLD. GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE WIZARD OF OZ . ARE YOU TELLING ME THE SOURCE MATERIAL FOR JOSEPH WAS WORSE THAN A MOVE FROM 1939?  WTF?
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Truly amazing artist. Every song is captivating and unique!! Thanks so much Lindsey for awesome music!! Wish I could purchase all the songs.
1490313370|1.0|I can't believe that James convinced anyone to say anything good about him or this rambling, empty book. The writing is disjointed. The organization is absent. And the useful content is nearly non-existent. Don't waste your time on this book.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|This television series drew me in to watching. I look forward.to seeing every episode. What will Brody do next? I purchased season 1 and 2 to watch between seasons.
B00632HWOG|5.0|What I love it so easy to read your e- mail  and able to delete so easy anything you don't want. You can go through your mail so much faster. I enjoy it so much better.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This television series drew me in to watching. I look forward.to seeing every episode. What will Brody do next? I purchased season 1 and 2 to watch between seasons.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book will teach you something about yourself, about your partner, and about people in general. Prepare to be enlightened. It made me feel more hopeful about change and growth in a stagnant relationship.I would recommend this book to most people.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved the book!  Couldn't put it down!  However, I did think it could have been more than one book!  Many interesting characters; many intriguing stories!  But I love this author and the way he presents a different culture in a very relatable way!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was A-MA-ZING. The plot twists, character development and story line are unparalleled in creativity and cleverness. Fresh and Incredibly well thought out. I was recommending this book to friends before I even finished reading it! I flew through the book in a feverish frenzy, going damn near out of my mind as I raced through the pages, desperate to see where it was all going and what it was leading up to.<br /><br />BRAVO! An absolute masterpiece!
B0098QAAAC|4.0|A raw but very touching movie. Benedict Cumberbatch shines in this movie. He is completely believable and the friendship among the men is well portrayed. It is not predictable and although does not have an action-filled conclusion, it is still dramatic in a quiet and thoughtful sort of way.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|able to track and view market information easily on my kindle. also has links to the latest news affecting markets.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Makes the Kindle Fire HD feel like a real computer. More easy to manage with file folders. A great and logical app.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A quality program. It has a story, great scripts and superb characters. I have watched this show from day one. It only gets better.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy playing this and there are several options.  Some of the symbols are a little confusing but overall I am enjoying it.
B005L193RO|4.0|This book is full of enjoyable stories that illustrate the seven principles of the<br />Happiness Advantage, as well as a wealth of references to studies that back up the author's claims.  The central thesis of the book is that happiness does not revolve around success but that success actually depends on happiness.  Most of the book is then spent on elaborating ways to apply the seven principles of happy people.  Acher does an excellent job of synthesizing heaps of<br />research and distilling it down to accessible and enjoyable language.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works like a charm. Really easy to set up and configure with WLAN. However, at time the audio wont stream, so I have had to disconnect and connect again (might be my wifi??).<br />Other than that, I am really pleased with the product.
159562015X|3.0|I got this for a class but the book did not particularly help me at all. Maybe it will help someone though!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A fast moving action film that works surprisingly well - the action certainly conveys the sense of a remorseless and overwhelming enemy. The reaction of both civil and armed forces seems unusually rationale for a Hollywood film. The film does feel rushed towards the end and leaves quite a few loose ends unresolved. Was this supposed to be a longer film? Or the first of a two part series? Either way, aside from the scrappy and rather abrupt ending, the film is very watchable. This isn't a blockbuster but it is a very decent zombie flick.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|ANother winner!! Love the acting, the setting, and cannot wait for more and more episodes!! Keep this quality of program coming-and put it on PRIME!!
B00F5I344G|5.0|Gov't mule is the band...been a fan for years and they've never been about radio music..it amazes me when I'm in a bar and play them on the jukebox people ask &#34;who is this?&#34; Warren Haynes is my hero...Always will be....and the mule is real!!!
B00000JFV9|5.0|The soundtrack to the movie \\"Superfly\\" by Curtis Mayfield is a classic blend of soul, blues and funk all rolled into one. Out of all the great music Mayfield wrote and performed during his career this album just has to be the highlight of that career. I have never seen the movie \\"Superfly\\" itself and I am sure it is probably a good film but I have listened to the soundtrack for that film many times and it is always a pure joy to listen too. And really you don't have to have seen the film to get down with the groove and soul of this album. All the songs on here stand up on their own without needing a movie to justify what the songs are about. Whether you have seen the film or if like me you have never seen \\"Superfly\\" I can highly recommend this album as pure enjoyment to listen to.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The young boy who is snatched from his childhood to train for the military is warm and real. He reacts to the life as it comes to find solutions to a grown up puzzle. Supposedly the adults know it all but do they?
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|This book doesn't even deserve a star, it's a real zero. Anyone giving it more than a single star has to be a big fan of comic books. I tried my best to finish it but couldn't get past the 80% mark, it's awful.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I accidentally deleted kik and now I try to log back in and out won't let me I even tried to make a new account and new password and it still won't work
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|This was a great season and one that I will not forget. I loved the build up in Season 8 to the final season. The DVD was well put together and had some great special features. In particular, I loved watching both the The Making of \\"P.S. I Love You\\" video and the video itself as this was a great addition (IMHO) to the season, among many others. As you can see I am a big fan and I am going to be sad to see the last season end! If you missed any of Season eight or if you are just a huge fan of the series, this is a great addition to any DVD collection!<br /><br />*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|The overall album is good but not great. The songs are well arranged and properly mixed and everyone in the band seems to put a little extra something at different points of the recording. However, as a long time DT fan I feel like there is some lack of creativity in this particular album. It seems as if they were aiming to sound somewhat like Majesty, but ultimately I don't grasp anything new coming out of this album, but what really puts me off about this record is the poor production. The amplitude on this recording seems to be off and I can hear compression coming out of Mangini's drumming. Not sure if this was done on purpose or what. But if this record can't sound good on a Mcintosh amp and a pair of B&W 804 speakers then what can you listen to it from?
1593275080|5.0|An amazing array of beautiful lego creations. This book is more that just a collection of legos, it is a work of artistic genius. You look through the images in this book and have to simply be amazed that what you are seeing are actually legos. I know I for one caught myself saying, \\"no way\\" numerous times, but as you look closer, you can see the legos that are definitely there. If you love LEGO as a company and either used them in the past or present, this is a book that you will want to have out at your own home to share with others, while giving you ideas for your next amazing creation!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The idea of the star ship without weapons, and relying on the crew to sort things out rather than than just blasting things to bits, is refreshing.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|I started watching this series late last season, so I missed a lot, so it was nice to be able to watch all 25 of the episodes from season 2 and get caught up (I had already watched season one from the library). This is a well written, witty series and if you have not watched it, you should as it is one that will make you want to come back for more. Not only is the writing strong, but they did a great job at casting the series, and all do a tremendous job making their characters real. I felt that the series is not forced, and moves at a pace that you would expect, and overall, it is a series that I hope continues for some time to come.  One final comment on the DVD itself... there were some great extended version of the Virgins episodes which was great and the deleted scenes are always ones that I enjoy watching!<br /><br />*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*
B008Y212PI|4.0|Loved it. My daughter and I had a great time learning to play this game. Fun for adults and children.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|OUTSTANDING! A LITTLE SLOW STARTING, BUT THEN IT CAN'T BE PUT DONE UNTIL THE VERY LAST WORD. THREE MORE WORDS! LOL
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Bought this for my girlfriend who prefers the Xbox 360 controller over the PS3's. Having this controller sitting side by side an actual 360 controller, you can see some differences obviously but the sticks and the feel to the controller are almost identical. Neither of us have experienced any lag when playing any games, was easy to set up! I can understand some people are unhappy that there is a USB dongle that takes up one of your ports to be able to use this controller but I feel that is a minor flaw with as good of a controller as this is. Only complaint I have is that this controller is unable to turn on the PS3 when pressing the PS Button (Home button on here). Again, not too big of a deal since my PS3 is right next to where I have my controllers sitting. Would highly recommend this product to anyone that wants an Xbox 360 like controller for their PS3!<br /><br />On a quick side note, I had purchased a Warehouse Deals: USED GOOD CONDITION item and the controller looks brand new! Packaging was clearly opened but item was all there and clean! Just in case anyone was worried about going on the cheaper side of things!
B0042FZOFU|3.0|I guess I shouldn't have paid attention to the reviews because I thought I was getting the blu-ray and DVD and digital copy, and this set only comes with the blu-rays.  It figures it was too good to be true for that price.  I thought I was getting an amazing deal.  What I got is 3 a case and disc for each movie, and a bonus disc for Toy Story 3.  That's all.
B00D2I8E28|5.0|Take the title of my review as you will, I am an Elvis Costello fan and have been for years. I'm not the kind fan that thinks he can do no wrong, but I tend to be happy with his releases more often than not. It took me almost a week after it's release to get the vinyl album, but it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />I won't get into a track by track breakdown, there are plenty of other folks who will. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire record. There really is a place for his voice along with the funky grooves of The Roots. I was a bit hesitant as I didn't care too much for The River In Reverse (but now I might get that one back out), but musically and vocally this is a solid record.<br /><br />The vinyl sounds fantastic, (two discs) and includes a download of the 12 track album (which I was trying to find out before hand, but couldn't find indicated anywhere). I downloaded the three bonus tracks from Amazon, and can understand why they are extras. They aren't bad but have some weird effects on the vocals, and they just didn't do it for me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Did not want this book to end!!!!  So good!!  Waiting (not so) patiently for his next!  Sequel to the sequel perhaps??
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|This book is incredible!! It is everything that I have pinned on the inside of me and try to convey to the people I lead. I now will hand them this book. Each chapter is wonderful and each page insightful. My only problem is I found myself wanting to highlight everything.<br />As with Tribes this will make you look at your leadership role in a different way. Where Tribes made you see the people you are leading differently, this book makes you look inwardly. In this book Seth's desire is for you to awaken to a greater life. There is more to be had then what you are experiencing!<br />Buy the book you won't be disappointed!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book. Make sure u read all three! I didn't think after reading 50 shades of grey that anything could be as good and these books are right up there with it. I can't wait til the fourth one comes out.
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|Very slow moving......not good acting.......can't understand half the words they say due to the over emphasized strong Southern drawl.  Forget it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My comments are already listed.  Same for all three books.  The story line is well thought out and good to read.  The sexual side...too rough for my comfort zone.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Fabulous renitions of all genres of song, extremely talented musicians with a touch of whimsey, creativity, class...bought several releases by these guys
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was very uncomfortable with the explicit sexual scenes.....but the story line was worth it to me to finish all the books.
B00338QENI|5.0|Nice look at an untold piece of medical history, well written, enjoyable, interesting story about a fascinating person and her legacy
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Okay.  Not great. Not too bad.  I don't want to write anymore about this book.  Gosh. that is a stupid guideline to get someone's opinion.  It is a pain.
B002DPRLEI|4.0|I believe this may have been the third and last of 3 movies starting Randall, Day and Hudson.  It's a good movie, but not as good as the first two.  My favorite is still Pillow Talk -- which I highly recommend.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I just love this CD which I purchased after seeing Keith live in concert at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.  It's probably a bit more pop than country but I highly recommend it.  My favorite song is &#34;Kiss the Girl&#34; - catchy tune that is easy to listen to over and over again.
B0055B7IPE|2.0|Not sure why I was expecting this movie to be good.  I had heard good things about it -- so perhaps I had set my expectations too high.  It had a few funny and even touching moments, but they were rare -- and did not justify the time spent.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|What can I say, more than it's The Hunger Games?<br />It came in on time and in great condition. I bought the 2 disc because it's such a great movie.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Frederick Forsyth never fails to deliver a tightly constructed tale full action and thrills.  I recommend this novel wholeheartedly without reservation.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|It is similar to the Angry Birds concept (using your finger to fling a tennis ball in place of a bird), but still fun with an interesting storyline.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great new graphics anf themes. Kids love to play it all the time. Looking forward to what comes next in Angry Birds.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Both my young kids really love this.  There are many very tiny parts, so it has been a challenge to keep it all together.  However, it's a nice tradeoff to have the kids play with this instead of always on the computer... works their imagination in different ways.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|.....into yawning mediocrity. This review will not be a long one just to the point. The acting was good though not great. The story line was bad so I think the actors did the best with what was given them. If we are recreating a series then do it just like you did the first film in this line. Borrowing from the old Star Trek is a bad idea because none of today's actors or director are capable of achieving that highest level of performance established by the old crews. I pre-ordered this thing on Blue Ray and immediately handed it to my son as a gift after viewing it the first and probably last time for me. The CGI is way over done probably to compensate for the poor script and mediocre acting.<br /><br />I found this movie to be a slap in the face of the cast, crew and fans of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. It is geared toward the teen aged market that cannot imagine anything past the video game console in their bedroom.<br /><br />Mr. Abrams you need to either get writers to crank out new adventures for this crew, stop dipping into the past or just don't make another one. I would rather see Star Trek come to an end than see it destroyed like this.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|I guess I was looking for Office Space type humor. I didn't get that at all. Most of it I found boring and dull. If you are looking for another Office Space you will be very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really fun some people have told me that it is a bit similar to temple run but it is a bit different u have to unlock the different levels to the different places but u have to buy tokens to get certain things however I would recommend this game to anyone who likes despicable me.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I love GI Joe, but I'd prefer not to see the rock or Bruce Willis. They did nothing for the movie but take up space.
B00594XOZU|3.0|It won't let me log on anymore through my kindle fire. It was a great app but now I can't go on any more. I hope it works soon then I'll give this app 5 stars
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This movie is just a fun movie. Don't spend time really analyzing it or making it into something it's not. It's fluff cinema and sometimes having an escape from reality is fun. Plus, a lot of stuff gets blown up. You can never go wrong there.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Of the Bingo games I've tried, this one's the best.  Just wish the power ups were not so 'expensive'.  You don't get much for the amount of credits.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Welcome back JT!! I've always been a &#34;radio&#34; fan of Justin Timberlake (meaning I've never bought an album of his but enjoyed his radio hits) However THIS album has totally sealed the deal for me! I absolutely LOVE this album from the beginning to the end. Most albums I have to listen to at least 3 times before I give it my listening ear of approval. However the first time I put this in the CD player I adored it! Timberland has smeared his style all over this album and JT does what he always does, SANG! LOL This duo never disappoints in my book and I hope they continue to make bangers like this album. Put it this way, this was my second purchase of the album cause my older cousin (63yo) took my first after listening to it in the car with me.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|The show is somewhat hard to follow if you don't watch the entire program, even then sometimes.  A fair amount of eye candy for both sexes though, perhaps this is the only intent.;)
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Great story, as most animal stories often are.  This gives one a personal look into people with drug 'problems'.  My hat is off to each able to get 'clean'...with prayers to help them stay so.  Bob has certaily done his part to help his two-legged team-mate.  Definitely a good read!
B008D28HYS|4.0|I don't like many games. Few are really that clever or well executed to get my money, or even stay on my phone if I got them for free.<br /><br />CrossMe Color is great. The puzzles are  tough, but doable with patience and perseverance. That is want out of an app - quality, challenge, and longevity.<br /><br />I got the app for free. The price seems a little steep for someone not willing to take my word for it, and I'd rather be able to buy more puzzle packs than a large price up front. Thus: 4 stars. Otherwise, great game - and I really am not one to give that praise.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I enjoy historical dramas set in dramatic buildings and grounds. I like to imagine how past customs, events, and technologies led to some of what I experience today; also fun to imagine that parts of human life are perennial as the grass regardless of all the rest of it--falling in love, having babies, relating across social classes and generations.  Downton Abbey delivers in those ways, yet falls into a bit of the 'soapy' realm in the screenplay. I watch, I enjoy and I look forward to Season 4 though Season 3 fell a bit short quality of the writing.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Excellent. The world around these characters is set up perfectly. They outrageous premise seems perfectly reasonable by the end of the first hour. Every bit as good as they say
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|We love Mumford and sons. They have an incredible sound that immediately draws you in and soon you find yourself singing along at the top of your lungs.
B00915G6R6|5.0|This is a show that if you don't watch every minute of it, you need to go back an watch it again to know what it going on!
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is one of my new favorite  type of hidden objects . The. Graphics and. Interaction makes this a well thought out game. I love this game.if you're looking for something different try this one. Thanks Sheila w.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|As any book that's turned into a movie, the movie is missing so much detail.  They did a good job with the movie, but I'd read the book first.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is fun to play very easy but enough of a challenge  only thing that is a problem is that it freezes up every time you get to a certain point says game is paused but you can not get it to resume so you have to start over
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. Once you play it you never want to put  it down. This game is so fun. I looooooove it
B00ECLU346|3.0|It was above average this could've been a classic. It seem like da director got too smart and left out the comedy.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Excellent. Very well done. Multiple choice locations. Very easy to use. Very attractive.  Probably the nicest weather app I have seen. I recommend the app.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting read. Makes you wonder how lies will change peoples lives. Loved the way the author wrote from each characters point of view.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|Suspense and great characterisation.  Gives an excellent sense of place.  All in the context of an un likely blossoming romance.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I wasn't to sure about downloading this game but I am glad I did.. I have been trying for days to stump it .
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game.....Good introduction to harder crosstic type games. Gives you a good feel for how the game works. Three levels of difficulty so you can practice harder levels as you understand how to do it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is simple and creative- it is fun for me to play with my son.<br />My son is four and we just relax sometimes with it- the graphics are great.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it to others. I will read the next book. I didn't care about Todd's jealousy. I hope he works through that.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's amazing. I read mountains of PDF on my MBA courses. It helps a lot, especially the on-line saving function.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Finally 11 years after the release of Vapor Trails I've listened to it all the way through<br />I agree with nearly every comment to date on this remix in that if you bought the original mix in 2002. You owe it to yourself to buy this<br />Muggy and loud is replaced by crisp and clear<br />You'll hear much much more in the songs than has ever been apparent before<br /><br />A classic album has been released that is as good as Counterparts. IMO the best Rush album since 1981<br /><br />And for the first time ever I've listened to the last song Out of the Cradle,,,I've never ever been able to get that far, usually giving up after Earthshine<br /><br />Don't hesitate to give this another chance
B008Y212PI|2.0|This is not a new idea and this is the most complicated and confusing one of a simple puzzle.  Look elsewhere and avoid the data collection of this app.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|Saw Gary on one of the late night talk shows and was impressed by his guitar work.  Thought I'd give his cd a try, it's not a purchase that I regret, my favorite song is &#34;When my train pulls in&#34; in which he shows off his guitar wizardry.  I enjoy some of the other tracks as well, I guess I was hoping the album would focus more on his guitar playing.  Perhaps a &#34;live&#34; release in the future?  This cd will go in my rotation behind Dave Alvin's  Eleven/Eleven (a must have!!)..
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Loved it. It was a little slow UN the beginning but so worth the wait. Cath is my favorite ever.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game and it makes you think.  You have to use your logic to connect the dots.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|This was great book, even after having seen the movie, it was still a page turner for me. Sometimes I like reading a book after the movie better so you don't a perceived notion of what you have made the character look like in your head and then be disappointed when it's not right. It definitely keep my attention to where I didn't want to stop reading it ever. I did start to hate the fact about Cain is for Delta so much but it is rather a big part of the series, so you kind of have to have it there. I'm half way through second book and this one was so much more of an easier faster read.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I use an Android smart phone, and my husband uses an iPhone.  Because this adopter charges both simultaneously and each port is optimized for my Samsung and his Apple, this adopter works perfectly for us.  It fits well to my Honda Civic, too.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Nice, but didn't wake me up today. Tried to test it later again - same problem. Deleted. Sony Xperia Z.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|At times confusing  because of  all the different  families  this is like  a real life drama. We all live at least 2 lives, 1 that  the world sees  and  the other that only we see. This book handles the subject in a new surprising way.<br />Not your  ordinary background.
B000002KOQ|3.0|I ordered this CD after falling in love with Court & Spark. This one is good, but very simple, and not at all like Court & Spark. I like the jazz of C&S, and this one is more folky. For anyone out there that likes a CD with a little more production, this is not the purchase to make.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|Great album!in haven't stopped listening since I got it. 305 to my city, own it , Tuscan leather, wu tang forever, very impressed with this work.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Jimmy Stewart is amazing, and the rest of the cast is hilarious.  I miss the simple, great, sweet movies - nothing vulgar and no insane special effects - just a wonderful story.
B003U4ZQUM|4.0|Okay, first I want to say that I am shocked that I could watch 6 seasons of such a looney show, I mean, really, I should get a life. That being said, Season 5 was the weakest link. It seemed like the writers were just making stuff up to fill in plot line and back stories. Lots of redundancy and a baffling plot, but, I watched it anyway! My mom used to say, &#34; in for a penny, in for a pound&#34;, which is relevant only in that there are a total of 121 episodes. Once I finished 4 seasons, there was no way I wouldn't watch the rest. But, Season 5 did not do any credit to a series that was riveting in other seasons.qw
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Better than subway surf and temple run combined. it is super fun and you can compete against friends. also there are four settings to run in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My children and I love to play this game so much! Keep making more!! I am also very happy it is a free game!!!
0718157834|4.0|This was the first Jojo Moyes book I have read.  I enjoyed it enough to order another one.<br />I understand the book was sold for a movie ... can't wait to see it.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The imagery created by the author is incredibly detailed. You can almost taste the food, see the decorations and see the acts.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I was pretty upset my TV service and internet went out from a storm and I thought - Oh no!  I'm glad I had just downloaded free ABSW.  It's been fun and saved me!  Now I'm hooked.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|What a mature and insightful writer. This is not popcorn quasi-thriller trash that bombards modern literature. It is a classy, layered, intelligent work. Looking forward to to reading more from Mr Hayes.
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|Boorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring. Really really boring. I can not understand the high ratings for this. People must be mesmerized by flashing lights and bright colors to the point of exhilaration. JUst really lame.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great application! The ads are not disturbing because they just appear before each game and you can just close them without waiting or anything.
B008Y212PI|1.0|How lame... rate to unlock content... like on facebook to unlock content.... to easy to begin with... faotd is the only reason to get this one.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Easy to understand and follow.  I've tested the advice given and it really works.  Thanks so much for sharing your knowledge.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think this is an interesting game but different than any version I've ever played. I like it to pass the time
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|really great game with a lot of detail. my five year old loves it and i cant stop playing it
B009AJDET6|5.0|A faithful reproduction of all the music on those vinyl disks that I thrived on all those years ago. It reminds me why I loved the music of Chicago in the Terry Kath era so much.
0671449028|4.0|I like the book, and always enjoy Sandra Boynton's clever drawings - had to deduct one star though because why do they take a bath and THEN do exercises?  Sandra, that's just silly...
B008Y212PI|5.0|Nice relaxing, challenging enough, the more you play the better you get. Fun to go on speed mode.  Press the hammer by mistake and have to start again. Great fun
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I am thankful for this plug because it charges the kindle that my daughter uses, however, maybe an oversight on my part...it doesnt come with the plug to go into the wall. Only comes with the cord so we had to plug it into the computer to charge which isnt very convenient.
B008Y212PI|1.0|The five star reviewers who claim that the devs aren't data mining are either working for them, lying, or just plain wrong. Want proof? Download the game and try opening it with your WiFi off. Paid apps should not spy on you. Disgusting.
B00E3IZIM0|1.0|Just dreadful. Every Character is cardboard with a cliched back-story. The average 10th grader could have written the dialogue. How can you spend so much money and come up with such a predictable brain dead film with not a single character anyone will remember tomorrow.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I bought this case as a present for a friend and he loved it. It is just the right amount of protection for an Iphone without adding bulk. It is also a great combination of a hard/silicone case where it does not get caught inside your pockets but it still feels thick enough to protect your phone from small falls.<br /><br />I am really contemplating getting one for myself.
B000RLFJQ2|1.0|I know the movie itself is great but this is the first time the streaming of it really sucked.Kept repeating the same scene over and over.It would not correct itself,very poor indeed.
B001AG52AG|3.0|When I watch this movie, I get both happy and irrationally angry at the same time.  Happy, because I think it was beautiful to look at and interesting.  Angry, because I know that since it didn't make any money, there won't be any more sequels to finish up the book series.  And also angry, because bowing to pressure from religious organizations, a lot of the book got cut out of this movie.  With said religious organizations probably being another reason the sequels were not made.<br /><br />Based off the of the book series, The Golden Compass covers most of the first book in the series by Philip Pullman.  Lyra, a young girl who is a ward of Jordan College has a pretty carefree life.  She studies, runs around with other young kids, and has fun with her Daemon.  Oh yeah, Daemons, this is an alternate universe, where every human being is accompanied by an animal spirit.  One that can change shapes until the human matures.  But everything isn't fine in Lyra's world.  Children have gone missing and the only thing they hear is about the mysterious Gobblers who take them.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Dakota Blue Richard: Lyra Belacqua<br />Freddie Highmore: Pantalaimon<br />Nicole Kidman: Mrs. Coulter<br />Daniel Craig: Lord Asriel<br />Sam Elliott: Lee Scoresby<br />Ian McKellan: Iorek Byrnison<br />Eva Green: Serafina Pekkala<br />Kathy Bates: Hester<br /><br />This film has a heck of a cast.  Almost all of them are very well known.  But you know, Richard as Lyra outacted all of them.  She was great and had the right amount of arrogance and pride and bravery to really play Lyra to full effect.  I can't say I'd pictured Lyra any differently.  Kidman put in a solid role as Mrs. Coulter too.  Like sweet poison, she manages to be both abusive and loving at the same time.  Craig was barely in the movie, so I can't comment on him too much at all.  McKellan and Bates also played smaller roles.  And Pan, with his voice actor of Highmore, wasn't what I expected.  I realize they wanted to use a younger voice for him to make him the same age as Lyra, but I just didn't think the voice fit.<br /><br />This film didn't follow the book entirely.  There were a lot of differences, such as the order of some of the scenes, the demphasis on the Magisterium, and the ending.  And some of the background that let you know who these characters were was left out.  The pace was also rushed a bit more.  There was a lot of controversy surrounding this movie (and the book admittedly) because of its approach to religion.  However, the movie was much more mild than the book is and it shows.  All that controversy and ideas that make the book an eye-opener are noticeably missing in this movie.  And that's because it had a lot of opposition even before it came out.  Which I don't understand.  If you don't agree with it, why watch it?  It would be like me watching \\"Prince of Egypt\\" and hating it because of its thoughts on religion and demanding that it not be made rather than not watching it, or if having watched it, weighing it on its filmography, storyline and script (I actually did enjoy Prince of Egypt by the way).<br /><br />And you can't really deny that the special effects and animation in The Golden Compass are well done.  The way they show the Daemons, the colors, the Ice Bears, the witches.  Just everything is animated quite well.  It looks realistic but still magical at the same time.  And even the violence was a bit surreal.  There is an Ice Bear fight that can get kind of graphic, but it was a smaller part of the film as a whole.  The music in the film was, like most, instrumental, and was neither distracting or fantastic.  It was just there in the background where it didn't effect much.<br /><br />It's sad to know that we won't be seeing more of this series on film, at least not with the same actors (as they will have aged out).  It was very nice visually even if the script didn't give the full satisfaction of the book.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 201313
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is one of those faotd that you go &quot;well, I`'ll give it a try, probably won't like it but I will play it once or twice and see&quot; well!!!!! now I'm addicted 4 hours later and still playing it. I love to test my olddddd brain! Very enjoyable game!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in this series and can not wait until new installments.  A great read for those who want something a little like Twin Peaks or Twilight Zone (a bit of a sci-fi/horror mix).
B00CWV8X04|4.0|nice and suspenseful, never would have thought it ends like it does. I am very Hard to please and very eclectic so that is why I gave it 4 stars.
B00F91H666|1.0|I ended out renting the dvd. It was hard to get the full effect because it was blurry. Otherwise, it's a food movie. Had seen it in the theaters and wanted to watch it with my sons
B0083GQVOC|5.0|The book is better of course but this movie is terrific with symbolism everywhere.  I never thought that a woman might have misgivings about her own fetus inside her.  Really good acting I watched it 6 times, of course i made my neighbor watch it with me, he is 30 something and he liked it.  Both my teenagers loved it, I think because of the Middle character of Kevin was such an Ass of a  kid they couldn't believe children could cuss to their parents.  Highly recommended.
B000V6AD46|5.0|Amazing band! I wish they were still around.<br />Purchase was easy and convienent. I like the android app. Works gerat.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Not what I thought it would be.  would like to delete places it picked on its own. three more words
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book is not nearly as gripping as his other ones. I read the entire book waiting for something to happen. It is a sad story but that's really all it is, a sad story.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|I'm only a few rooms in, but so far it is fairly easy but fun too.  I'm hoping it gets a little more challenging as l move on.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is by far the best cleaning app out there. It works perfectly to cleann and add more memory to your device.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I like the characters and most of the story lines.  This is an easy way to spend a few minutes without using too much grey matter.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The one thing my KFHD lacked was a calculator. I finally found one that's simple and FREE! The calculator fits the entire screen so that's makes it easier to use mistake free.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|While I have not read all of the works included in this collection (I'm currently working through The Pickwick Papers), I've had a chance to peruse the collection using the table of contents.  The table of contents used in this edition makes it extremely simple to navigate this behemoth of a volume. I've not had any issues with formatting and the like, and am very excited to be reading through this particular collection on my new Paperwhite.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. Too bad I'm not the kind of person that can reread a book like this! I do highly, highly recommend it and I'm an adult reading this series!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Will always find myself listening to this cd and singing along every chance that I get!<br />Will be a Gorillaz fan always.
B00DYEBM2Y|4.0|I like the album quite a bit and the 4 star rating is for the music content, not the product. On the first few spins it sounds perhaps a bit too stripped down, but it's growing on me and I'm sure it will continue to do so with repeated listens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems this vinyl pressing was handled poorly or at least very inconsistently, as others here have said they've received good pressings.<br /><br />I've purchased a copy on Amazon and a copy locally and both are beyond reasonably warped. Both copies also have lots of noise (non-fill) issues on all the lead-ins as well as tons of random noise throughout all tracks. There is also an issue with a distortion/sibilance/warbling sound when Hope is really pushing her voice. This is not present on the CD or the downloadable .wav files. I'm used to a bit of surface noise here and there, but both of my copies are well beyond acceptable with constant popping and ticking. I've cleaned the discs with Mobile Fidelity Super Deep Clean and a Mobile Fidelity brush and have used a Zerostat to eliminate static, the noise is unchanged.<br /><br />Hopefully I'll get lucky and one of my replacement copies (they're both going back to their respective places of purchase for exchange) will be more enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />My system is:<br />Pioneer SA-9500 integrated amp<br />Pioneer PL-550 turntable<br />JICO SAS equipped Shure M97XE<br />Pioneer HPM-60 speakers
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|This is truly Justin Timberlake's best work. The album certainly does need to be listened to as a whole, and I'm not going to review each track for exactly this reason. I will, however, say that Pusher Love Girl, Suit and Tie, Don't Hold the Wall, Tunnel Vision, Spaceship Coupe, That Girl, Let the Groove Get In, Mirrors, Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want), True Blood, Cabaret, Take Back the Night, Murder, Drink You Away, and Not a Bad Thing are all notable tracks. I realize that I listed nearly every track on the album, but that should be an example as to how amazing it really is. The ones I did not list are also absolutely fantastic (would not change a single thing about this album) however, I am merely trying to add some perspective. The ones I did not list are amazing and the ones I did list are some of the best pieces of music I've ever heard. Keep in mind this review is not coming from a fangirl. In fact, I'm a fellow music composer (male) who simply appreciates good music. This is without a doubt the greatest album in existence.
B00EVCD9HY|4.0|Fun and funky with good solid vocals. Love Monae's crazy energy. The android theme is starting to wear a little thin now, though. Still a lot of fun.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I enjoy it very much.  Helps pass the time. I recommend it to anyone.  Simple concept. Just wish at times I had not  lives lol.
B004YXE438|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this puzzle game! It is different from the other games I have been playing. Lots of fun.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love the games for the kindle it is something that makes me want to play with the games so much and I hope you enjoy it to
B007IXWL2C|4.0|So bummed it's over! One of the best series of books I have ever read. I believe it could have gone on and on and everyone would still be engrossed.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|This movie is just as good today as it was years ago. Hard to go wrong with Cary Grant and A H.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Julianna is spectacular!  Every woman could learn something from her, being a good wife, great Mom and exceptional attorney. Love it!
B00E9P959O|5.0|The material has always struck a cord in my soul and to have it now so clear and the way these songs were meant to be heard makes me deliriously happy. Now, when I hear the the opening chords of \\"Vapor Trails\\" and then Geddy's voice come in so clear, it brings tears to my eyes. I can hear instruments and vocals throughout that I couldn't distinguish in the original. I am listening with amplified  Sennheiser HD 650 headphones ripped with Apple Losseless format , but I suspect that even in the lower bit rates with decent ear buds you hear much improvement. Will have to try that later. :-)<br /><br />If you love this album you owe it to yourself to hear it as it was meant to be heard. Buy it. I promise you that you will not regret it.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Although I was bummed that most the the Joes died in the movie, it was a great movie overall.  Lots of action!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Was skeptical, but King delivers again.  Exceptional telling of what happened to Danny and the role of familial legacy.  Excellent read.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|If you like action movies, this is one of the best.  All the best actors and tons of action.  So great!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|A fantastic take on the 4 elements and how cooking defines them. Pollan as usual delves deeply into his subject.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It has great music, great actors, and an amazing story.  I actually had this movie before, but lost it so I had to buy it again!
0470901071|5.0|Todd shows his experience and expertise very well in this book. The writing is very engaging and there are many practice questions and scenarios throughout--if you go through all of this material and do the practice work, passing CCNA should be no problem.<br /><br />I am in the middle of my study phase and have yet to take the exam--so I will post an update after I pass.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is very well-written and well worth the money, even if only as a reference for your shelf.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I love it. I love that I can get sooooo many extras for buying the DVD!  Of course I am a huge fan or Iron Man, so that doesn't hurt either!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Well presented and written.Pam Grout has sussed the working of the universe and writes an easy to understand way of making life nicer!
B00821OX98|5.0|Wow this show is really cool love it!!!!!! Can't wait for the next season to come on 2014 kinda got a whole to go
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|How much can really be said about a calculator? It's big, full screen. Easy to use. Installed easily. No glitches or hangups. Works well and handy to have on the kindle.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Omg it was awesome love the show but love the book more the book has more than the movie I love  it
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Still funny after all these years. Worth watching again. Why do I have to type so many words just to review something? If it was a little easier I might do it more often
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was awesome cause he described every event with detail.When i read it i couldn't stop reading it over and over again
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was a great surprise. I find myself drawn to the time of beautiful suffering..The second great war and the Chinese cultural revolution. This book exceeded expectations and even though I know this journey can never be repeated, it is one I will cherish for the rest of my days.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love the show and the picture quality is excellent. I just want to watch the next couple of seasons on my Prime Membership also. Thanks for the programs we do get to watch on Prime.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great movie, lots of adventure and laughs for the whole family! Fun for anyone of any age. The kids watch it over and over.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|The movie was entertaining, and pretty good acting.  However, the whole \\"magic\\" thing was overblown.  Had better potential than what it ended up as.  Don't want to spoil it, so I won't go into any detail, but it did leave you hanging on who did it for most of the movie.
B00F5F0208|5.0|All of me is by far my favorite. But the Album is so good. Get the deluxe version its worth it
B00BEIYP1W|4.0|\\"Rush\\" (2013 release; 122 min.) portrays the rivalry between legendary Austrian F1 driver Niki Lauda, and British driver James Hunt. As the movie opens, we see how both Luda and Hunt are rejected by their own families when they choose to become a professional race car driver, yet both persevere and manage to break through. Their rivalry starts at the F3 level (call it the minor leagues of F1 racing) in 1970. It is not long before we see them competing at the highest level, and it all leads to the 1976 season, where things would come to a head. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first and foremost, director Ron Howard deserves a ton of credit for faithfully and painstakingly recreating what life was like in Europe in the early 70s, both on the race track and off the race track. I mean, it is spot-on. Howard also manages to overcome the challenge of how to bring a riveting sports movie when you already know how it all ends (maybe not so much in the US, where interest in and audiences for F1 racing are not nearly as big as the rest of the world). Second, the lead actors Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Br&uuml;hl as Niki Lauda are terrific. I am floored to see that only Hemsworth (as Hunt) is on the DVD jacket of this movie, as it is as much the story of Lauda, if not more so, than Hunt's. Apart from these two, there are several smaller roles that are worth noting, none more so that Olivier Wilde as Hunt's girlfriend/eventual wife. There is also a very nice soundtrack for this movie, including the original score (by veteran Hans Zimmer), but also plenty of early 70s music which you will immediately recognize if you grew up in that era (such as Mud's Dyna-Mite, Slade's We're All Crazy Now, Thin Lizzy's The Rocker, etc).<br /><br />Can this movie appeal to a large US audience that is not necessarily interested in or familiar with Formula One racing from 40 years ago?  I am not your typical US movie goer, as I grew up in Belgium and seeing this movie was like being transported back in time. I turned 16 on the very day of the N&uuml;rburgrin accident (I will never forget that). That said, I was (pleasantly) surprised that the screening I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was packed! On top of that, there was applause from the audience when the end credits started to roll. I'm not sure if this is indicative of the overall box office chances but I sure hope so. If you like a riveting sports drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end, you cannot go wrong with this. \\"Rush\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!years ago?

0670024813|4.0|While Diamond's obvious liking for his friends in the tribal societies he's studied occasionally seem to bias him in their favor - still, this book generally serves as a valuable counterweight to a lot of previous anthropological studies (from Margaret Mead up to the present) that have portrayed such societies as being totally peace-loving, benign, and superior to Western society in every way. Diamond doesn't sweep under the rug the cruelties that he found endemic to such societies as the New Guinea groups he got to know.<br /><br />He contrasts these technologically less developed societies with hi-tech Western societies in five principal areas - conflict resolution, child-rearing, religious practice, diet, and linguistic adaptiveness. He also touches on such societies' degree of risk aversion, but Diamond's treatment gets a little muddy and maundering on that subject. For example, he recounts his eerie but ultimately rather pointless experience of finding a stick protruding from the ground, and then ponders at some length how paranoid he should rightly have been at finding such a possible signal of an enemy clan's surveillance.<br /><br />The book is at its best contrasting levels of violence in tribal and larger State-run societies. Contrary to those other anthropologists' bright and happy projections, Diamond often finds chronic and murderous warfare to characterize the smaller societies. Instead of places such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York, deserving their titles of \\"the murder capitals\\" of the world, that title might more justifiably go to some of these foraging/small farming societies based on their annual rate of per capita homicide. Without mechanisms of State-sanctioned resolution, perceived offenses in these societies generate escalating cycles of retaliation. It's the Hatfields and McCoy's raised to bloody, unfunny heights. A group's opponents come to be seen as non-human vermin deserving of genocide. Whole villages get brutally obliterated. That's why so many native peoples actually aspire to going to Western urban centers. Not only will they find \\"lots of rice and no mosquitoes\\" there - but they will be much safer!<br /><br />Previous researchers often didn't stay in the field long enough to witness outbreaks of violence. Or they didn't define these conflicts as wars. Or else they turned a blind eye to such aspects of these societies because the researchers themselves had such a strong need to find some \\"better\\" place on earth where all their homeland savageries didn't exist.<br /><br />However, Diamond finds that where tribal elders or chiefs do exercise some authority within a group, disputes are often resolved more effectively than in the West. The goal of these mediations is to restore relationships rather than to achieve some abstract principle of justice. Although these chapters get a little repetitious, Diamond does a good job of awakening readers to some of the often unheralded advantages to living in State-run societies.<br /><br />One topic I wish Diamond had explored more thoroughly is the topic of private ownership. Based on some readings on Native American societies, I had assumed that defense of private property, especially the defense of private plots of land, might be less of an issue in tribal societies. I had assumed an attitude of communalism. But that seems not to be the case. Diamond describes some of the fiercest battles erupting where small farming plots exist and where there's been suspected theft from these meager patches.<br /><br />Overall though, this is an eye-opening book. Diamond describes the good, the bad, and the ugly in both types of societies - with rare frankness.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I started yesterday but I'm still getting used to it<br />It's like dungeon hunters but it's might be a little better
B00F91H666|1.0|Within minutes of the opening scene... our 'expert' protagonist, with years of experience in NATO conflict zones, has escaped a crowded city in chaos...then takes his entire family into a store being looted by a mob...then allows them to split up? The movie hadn't even started and I had stopped believing in the characters and the drama that was being so poorly constructed...<br /><br />This film brings nothing new to the Zombie genre. Lazy cliches include - 'build tension in a scene with a car (RV) that won't start' and the good ol' 'we must be very quiet but I forgot to turn off the ringer on my mobile (satellite) phone' - so lazy, so uncreative...so many ways to do these things right...<br /><br />I'm embarrassed for the film makers...I hope the $ guys made them do it...<br /><br />If anyone made $ on this stinker, I hope they turn around and do some good projects with it... Brad... ;-)
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Still hoping to see another one come out. Disc and case were clean and scratch free.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this movie.  I wanted to add a musical to my Kindle Fire and I picked &#34;Grease&#34;.  The choreography is well done and has a lot of humor also.  Olivia Newton-John has a great voice as well as Stockard Channing.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Needed this movie to complete my series at the time ordered. Disc was cleanand scratch free, and did not me to do any buffing before use
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got this game as a free app of the day and I really enjoy it. Nice and relaxing game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read, very well written. From the moment I picked it up I was hooked and couldn't put it down!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Addictive and educational both. Love the depth of character development and evolution of the individuals represented. Gives good insight into the British &#34;class&#34; system of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just finished my second reading of this book. I read it many months ago and needed to read it again, as it is being discussed in my book club next month.  I was surprised by how much I loved it the second time around. It is a wonderful story!
B001MSMULG|4.0|Good read. Consistent action with an intellectual underpinning that makes the story stimulating and easy to read. The plot is not too complicated, so ok to put down and pick up later.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I love this game, so much fun and so many levels to play. My grandson who is 7 loves it also
1455502758|5.0|This book nearly brought me to tears, I wish i could be even half as eloquent in my day to day writings as The hitch was in his final hours.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book definitely keeps your attention and the characters are well developed. The story line is a bit predictable and cliche. However, I think the book is very thought provoking and causes you to examine your life and choices. Overall I would recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fantastically fun game. It's<br /> EASY TO LEARN. Hard to put down. I am always trying to  beat my best time.
B009APMNB0|4.0|I tried the Spyder brand first but kept getting a blue tint on all my monitors.  Spyder's tech support was lousy so I returned it for this.  This is cheap and there is only one option, LCD or LED backlight, that's it, the rest is done for you.  If you can afford it, get the higher end version of this, however if you don't want or need to obsess over all the minor tweaks and just need a simple and effective way to calibrate your monitor accurately, this is it.  Very pleased that I chose this one.  It works well and the colors on my monitor are finally accurate.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Amazing! One of the best shows out there and is easily accessible on amazon instant video. Highly recommend this show.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|would not work on my pc code43, returned and got a prompt refund. would like to have one that would work.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is great fun. It gives the grey matter some exercise. Not difficult to do, just needs thinking about. Love this.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I requested to have the alarm set so that in order to press snooze, I had to solve math problems. For some reason this has yet to happen with this app :( disappointed.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does anyone very good job at cleaning up your phone and keeping it clean of old uninstalled app and folders they might leave.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|A great read.... Harry's back! Bosch does it again, good plot and characters...keeps you guessing till the end, Harry never gives up...
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I loved the story line. The author had me hooked by third sentence. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a bunch of kids coming together for one cause.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|I haven't watched the actual disc I ordered yet, but I have seen this movie many times before. I really like it. I love having movies of different holiday themes and it can be hard to find Halloween type movies that are family friendly.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Beyond enjoyable, Kingdom Rush challenges the mind AND the reckless. See if you have what it takes to defend the kingdom.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Shrek movies so I wanted to see this. It isn't a bad movie but it isn't as good and the Shrek movies, which would be really hard to do.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game should be easer to get money and better range wepons. but is it a fun and good game
B002CLBJPK|4.0|Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun family movie. It is a fun Disney family movie and good to have for your kids to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good story. Have read all of the books. I think people will miss some of the storyline if they did not read the series. Especially in the book one. Perfect actors for the parts.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|This is a really cute Halloween type movie that is not too scary and something that kids can watch. I also really like this kind of animation I just think it is fun to watch I have always really liked it.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|Finished mission mode in about a week of just casual playing. Not worth the $7.00.<br />Of course now it is .99. Well worth that, but for those of us that paid the 7, there should be update with added missions &amp; to fix the little lag that it has.
6305428042|4.0|This is a really fun Halloween movie that is family friendly and not too scary. This is a good movie to have if you want to watch a Halloween movie but don't like the really scary ones or horror films or if you want something your kids can watch.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Amazing music. Every tune scored here is wonderful in a stand alone world. But the world brought into view here is marvelous! Visuals are beautiful. Acting is utterly charming. Love Levi Stubbs as the oh-so-hungry plants voice! And what a voice! I just want to shout it out: SUDDENLY, SEYMORE.......and there you hqave it.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is a good family friendly movie that is fun for the whole family to watch. I even watch this movie without kids around.
B00EUVG3P6|5.0|This CPU went into a custom server for a client of mine.  The server is strictly providing file, print, and domain services.  With approximately 70 users connected to it, it's average CPU load was around 10%, and that's scaled way down on speed (speedstep).  While this CPU doesn't support ECC, a server standard, it's plenty sufficient for the needs of this company and will provide a long reliable life for the next many years.<br />For fun, I disabled the fan on the CPU and ran a CPU stress-test.  The temps maxed at 71C under full load after 2 hours with no fan running on the stock cooler.  The CPU never scaled under 2.95Ghz.  Without the stress test and with the fan off, the CPU ran along at 45-55C.  Not bad at all.  Without any real overclocking potential in this chip, it makes no sense to use anything but the stock Intel cooler running on low.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This isn't my favorite animated movie, but it is cute and kids really like it. I am always looking for cute family friendly movies and this is a good one to have.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Had watched this movie the first time in July 2013 with  my grandchildren. I have never been a person to take the time to watch a cartoon movie. I loved the characters and the overall story. We went
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Don't expect this movie to be just like the Lord of the Rings films, because it is a bit different, but still good. It is better if you don't go into it expecting Lord of the Rings.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I read Gone Girl and loved it so decided to read this book.  It didn't excite me as much as Gone Girl but the story was very good.  She did an excellent job depicting characters that had dark, twisted sides to them.  I definitely felt for the main character and loved how it shows that some things just cannot be forgiven.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I don't think this movie was a huge hit, and it isn't my favorite animated movie but it is still cute.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I binge watched this season. Fabulous writing and keeping the the central cast members small is ideal for me.  Too many shows mess things up by adding too many characters with too many story lines.  This show is still going strong for me!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie does not have a lot of talking so be prepared for that but it is a really cute movie.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Action packed, great special effects. Had to see again, once on the big screen second time streaming through Amazon Prime.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is a great classic movie! We had it when I was a kid but I was young and I didn't really appreciate it or have the attention span I think, but watching it again as an adult I liked it more.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well written and am excited to read the next book as this cannot be the end of Ana and Christian Grey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game and it is a great pass time for me! Overall this is a great game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just a great show! Can't wait for season 4. Watched all 3 seasons in 2 weeks!!! Careful you will be hooked.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Not a bad movie but not excellent either. The story was slow but did remind me of a classic film 'Stand by Me'. McConaughey isn't my favorite actor but he looked different and actually took on the role for a change. If your in the mood for an independent feel movie you may enjoy this, however it's not for everyone :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait until January 4th for the new season. I have fallen in love with the wile family. Love it!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a pretty fun movie. It was fun working out tricks. I am a fan of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Elsenberg. They were a good team in &#34;Zombie Land&#34; also. The movie kept me guess which I enjoyed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved even the nastiest characters, O'brien is so evil but yet you have. Slight compassion for her on some scenes.
B00F91H666|4.0|Gave this four stars and not five as it could have been better. Sometimes I couldn't hear what the actors said due to the sound from the movie I guess. It's not our sound system as works great on movies and TV shows. Or it could of been the actors mumbling? Who knows. Anyway, always love Brad Pitt. He did a pretty good job. A lot of other reviews have been saying it was unrealistic which is stupid as how would they know what would happen in a zombie war! And if you dislike zombies well just don't watch movies with zombies in them! I would recommend this movie if you love Brad and Zombies! :)
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Scott Jurek puts it out there. I felt this was a frank and honest self-criticism that left me inspired to run, eat more veggies, and keep in touch with family and friends. Good recipes are included.
B008D28HYS|2.0|I found this game far too easy, the grid with the colours just gives you the answer. I was more like fill in the squares with colours than trying to work out what goes where. There is no challenge at all. Picranium Picross is a much better challenge.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|We have watched Pitch Perfect several times now and laugh every time. Some scenes are not appropriate for younger kids, but our kids are teenagers.
B00640UICA|5.0|I love this game. Firstly...its very cute. Second, its a good challenge without being mind-numbingly difficult. One of the best FAOTD so far.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Chapter 2 of 3 in the Hunger Games... The story continues and builds towards the final confrontation. Obviously if you read the first book, you're already bought in to the characters and want to know more abou their fate... The story continues well with Catching Fire. Be ready for a quick and frantic read (clear your weekend for reading - because you'll likely not put it down except for meals and occasional sleep)... Enjoy.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Its a good movie if you're looking for anything to watch on a sunday night. Good concept with a twist.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's not super-challenging to draw lines without crossing...but as the grid get bigger...it is more challenging to get a perfect draw on the first go... I like the free version, its got plenty of boards to keep you busy, and even after you've done them all, going back to do them again it like doing them anew... Plenty of replay without having to buy the full version. The adversiting is unobtrusive. Very well designed and glad it was a freebie to add to the Kindle Fire. Enjoy.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Great read with a very good twist as the plot developes. Bosch shows his true form in this one. One of the best in the series.
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|In the end its a story about man and his creations... Of course if you are a Star Trek fan, this is the start of the motion picture franchise. It's not a terribly exciting movie (especially from today's standards)... But it's about the SHIP (Enterprise) for the first hour of the movie... The second hour of the movie is about the other ship and really goes to demonstrating it's shear scale by how long it takes Enterprise to reach the center of it... The last 20 minutes are the crux of the entire movie... Overall, it's a likeable movie and if you are a fan of the epic space opera, this hits the nail squarely.
B000VX6YCY|5.0|This is my classic casual shoes..... one of this par shoes is all time in my closet. Fit very well with jeans or Khakis. For go around or work.The comfort with or with out socks is nice. The only concern is that i have to wait few years to buy another Timberland par shoes because the quality is insuperable and not damaged very fast.<br />Thanks,
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Better made than the original.with cool action and better graphics. Would have liked to see more of the future. And it should have been played out as several decades in the future (like say a century after WWIII
B009LQKHIO|5.0|what can I say? free is always great...especially when it has anything to do with books! I love reading on my kindle!
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|I will put this album as one of the true Elton John music albums. He is right he went right to the roots to gather the muscle for this one. He put the tempo at the same level all through the album.  There are people here and everywhere else who praise the producer, but you know what, when it comes to Elton John it just doesn't matter, Elton John's music is what matters. It is the wine, all other things are bottle and packaging. Elton John proved it with his solo tours. So even though Elton John is staying true to his music I really don't know if this is an album the upcoming generation (aged between 15 and 30) now want to really listen to. In all probability they will not respond to this album at all. But for a guy like me who loves his music...This is fuel to many more poems.
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|Im not a fan of hers, I got this cd as a gift & I loved every song! Theyre mostly housey and dance! very fun with quality crafted instrumentals! an amazing comeback! give it a try!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Some stories are timeless they reach across the generations and parallel the struggles that some people have to get through, to live a full life.  I like the idea that both of these women remained strong when faced with adversity, and that they could open there hearts to each other.  Even tho their ages are generations apart they could find a link to each other.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Not what I had expected....even better than that. It was nice to read something that was different than the normal book in that you felt for these characters in each situation. Great book.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|For such a serious subject the ending was nice. Alzheimer's is such a terrible disease . The author did a wonderful job of making it real.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|It was suspenseful and kept my interest. Ending was a surprise. I would recommend ths movie. Excellent actors in it.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Over the years, I have collected almost all of Cher's albums, and I can honestly say this is one of her best. The string of danceable tunes are pure fun, and the more intimate, ballad-heavy second half, is so full of experience and heart. All 6 bonus tracks are just as great, too. Not many people in their late 60's can put out albums that are truly current; I think Cher has done just that, and more.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I have not one but two apps of calculators. It will also help me do my homework. Not bad at mathematics.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is one of the best book I have read. There are many things to learn and enjoy from the book. Learn might sound very odd but I did learn to look at people carefully and try to deduce the meaning of it. Try to understand people while you talk to them. Before I thought I was too naive to ignore all this...<br /><br />Book is written beautifully. And I was very surprised to find this is Patrick;s first novel series. It is very well written and enjoyed it a lot. I will recommend it to anyone...

B00FEHXISA|5.0|The dialog in Iron Man 3 is witty and fast.  It shows great scriptwriting.  The cutting is fast and well paced.  Overall, this is a very entertaining popcorn film.
0451418441|5.0|I was almost discouraged from ordering this book because of the review here on Amazon that indicated that the book has its faults vis-a-vis history.  However, I ordered it anyway and enjoyed every minute of the read and was sorry when it was finished.  So, if you are not too finicky about exactly what happened back the 14th century, but enjoy a well-written novel with, in my opinion, good character development (I wasn't an English major), then this book is for you.  Take the leap.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Rivals swype, but I actually like it better. Short break in period where it learns you, after that pretty amazing how accurate
0763644765|1.0|after reading all colourful and well illustrated animal and fish books, my son refused to go beyond the 2nd page in this book.  since then it is sitting on the shelf!  I tried to return but they were charging for return shipping!!  Such a boring and uninspiring and uninteresting book.

B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game for those who like pictogram puzzles.  Good for beginners with small puzzles and the background themes are very pleasant
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I raced through Series 1 and Series 2 is more of the same. The character development is excellent always managing to retain continuity and consistency. There are shocks and surprises along the way, when a character you know (or think you know) does something 'out of character' - looking foward to Series 3 and 4
B008Y212PI|5.0|.It is great visual game.. one that very enjoyable.  Solving the problems keeps both grandchildren unoccupied for quite  a while
B00E9P957Q|5.0|Yes, all of the RUSH album in this box set have been remastered for this box set. \\"Presto\\" sounds amazing. Not louder; more definition. And, the \\"Vapor Trails\\" remix makes it sound like a whole new album. Get this set and dump your Atlantic Rush CDs, except for the live ones.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|This is a very hard to find DVD in stores, so I was very excited to find it here on Amazon for my 2 yr old Grandson.  We watch it basically daily. He loves it!  And the music of Elvis in the story is very entertaining for all.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I have had the pleasure of reading this book twice.  The first time was in Mexico on our first year of sailing.  This time, I've read it in Australia after traveling through and living in various emerging countries.  The reason I'm mentioning this, is the first time I read the book, I cringed at the living conditions in the slum.  Now, with a different perspective, I totally agree with the authour that \\"often those with less are richer in love and depth of life\\".<br />The writing is excellent.  It is deep, complex and so colourful that you can visualize everything.  \\"I asked, pushing a canoe of thought, out into the uncharted water of his ideas.\\"<br /><br />Roberts' characterization is so well done that I felt I knew the main characters personally.  He was able to show different sides of every character, so that they were truly three dimensional.  The angry killer Abdullah said after a little girl gave him a garland of flowers \\"There is no act of faith more beautiful than the generosity of the very poor\\".<br /><br />This book is a work of fiction, based loosely on a true story, with only the imprisonment and escape at the beginning being a matter of public record.  Robert's explains in his webpage and interviews that the book is not an auto-biography.  He wanted to write a fiction book that was a page-turner and also felt like fact.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book even more the second time.  It is the story of a man who turned to drugs and ended up in jail after armed robberies to feed his habit.  Once on the run in India, he was a lost man.  He couldn't go home, so he had to sever all ties.  He was full of guilt over his selfish and destructive habits, and was totally conflicted as a human being.<br />The ending left more questions than answers and keeps us looking forward to the sequel, which is being written now.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to ask life's difficult questions as well as exploring the conflicts in life and emotionally.  Anyone who enjoys well-written literature, stories about other countries and an amazing story of adventure, adversity, personal conflict, love and human relationships would be rewarded by reading this book.<br /><br />Diana Young- World Traveler - currently sailing in the South Pacific for six months and #1 Amazon Best-selling author of Financial Fitness for Beginners.nally.

This is the age it is appropriate for: 6 and up.<br />I hope you have a nice time playing Minecraft.  Goodbye. :)

B006OFN0SE|2.0|I was on the edge of my seat and oh so excited to see the historical life of J. Edgar Hoover brought to life. The movie was mildly disappointing. I suppose the biggest challenge in retelling a historical account of a man's life is condensing 77 years into 120 minutes. I appreciate that a filmmaker would attempt to make a movie that might teach me something, however, even that was limited. There were particular moments designed to draw tears, yet I remained unmoved in anyway. I felt much of the story was lacking and perhaps that is a testament to J. Edgar Hoover himself. He was a selfish and conceited man with a decent fashion sense and a secret homosexual relationship. He was not deeply complicated at all despite what the movie tried so desperately to portray. All in all, it was mighty difficult to relate to his character. Admittedly, the advent of the FBI and the red tape nightmare that accompanied it was of interest. In truth, I would probably be more satisfied watching a documentary on the FBI than I was this movie.

1400079276|5.0|This was the most bizarre Murakmi novel I have ever read. That said, I loved it. I've heard a lot of criticism of this novel from normal Murakami book lovers, and I'd argue it's without merit. I admit it would be more difficult to understand if the reader has not read Oedipus Rex even though Murakami does a nice job of alluding to and summarizing much of the plot throughout the novel. Because it's such a strong plot and one of the lynch pins of psychoanalysis, the reader would benefit from having an awareness of the storyline before reading Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />Readers need to remember that one of Murakami's continual motifs is the way he plays with our perception of reality; he does this in almost every story. In this way, Kafka is able to use his imagination to heal from some of the trauma of his past. Whether or not the characters are who he thinks they are is not important, he assigns a new reality to the mother and sister figures for his own purpose. The power lies in the imagination, which Murakami would argue (through each of his novels) is reality itself.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|None of is ever will know what would have happened if we made a different choice in life. Different career, place we lived or person we married. This book is about one choice made so many years ago that changed so many future events and lives. Enjoyable and thought provoking.
0307476464|5.0|Book 1: It always starts with a rabbit hole. After Aomame's escape from the parking lot that is mistaken for a freeway, she descends a long ladder. After which, her world presents a few scenes that remind the reader of the glitch in the matrix when Neo sees the black cat and calls it d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Something is out of the ordinary. The world has switched tracks. Her character is masculine in her lack of emotional episodes, yet is a likeable protagonist even as an assassin.<br /><br />Like any other Murakami novel, the reader must embark on the experience of reading with a loosened sense of rationale and logical thinking. The proof is not in the pudding, but in the details. The setting is Tokyo, Japan and the year is 1984, or is it? The alternating chapters keep the modern mind and schizophrenic reader enticed and wanting to know more. We meet two protagonists with no families, social status, or deep roots in the world, which is characteristic of the postmodern condition and altogether suitable to Murakami's style.<br /><br />Tengo's storyline is fascinating, if you like the discipline of writing. Murakami reveals some of the greatest tips of the job through his mathematics teacher turned novelist and even sneaks some tips into Aomame's storyline. This reminds the reader that they are participating in the reading of a novel. It creates a hyperawareness of the form that reveals this world and builds the anticipation by assuring the reader that everything does happen for a reason.<br /><br />Book 2: The plot thickens. Reality is no longer a consequence of Tengo's or Aomame's existence. Something peculiar to Murakami is his ability to take something so basic to everyday life and describe it to the point of absurdity. One of these absurdities is the very same element of the novel that creates a clean narrative line from one storyline to the next: there are two moons in 1Q84. 1984 was perfectly familiar and had a single moon with a yellowish tint, but this alternate reality hinges on the fact that the moon has made a friend. A smaller greenish moon rests in the sky right below the veteran moon. Needless to say, I am hyperaware of any mention of the moon here and now in 2012, after imagining a world so distant, yet so possible. Interesting how elements of the novel bleed over into reality so well. Blurring the line between fiction and reality is a consequence of most Murakami's novels, even to the extent that much of what is revealed in the storyline in 1Q84 are thoughts that I have had before about the nature of reality, existence, and the boundless time and space of the imagination. Bouncing these ideas around in my head is one thing, but to see them take shape in the form of fiction is quite another. Did my ideas initially come from reading some of Murakami's far more subtle fiction? It's hard to say, since I have been digesting his novels for nine years now, but these words feels so familiar. It's almost like the novel is enveloped in a heavy aura of nostalgia. If you know and love Murakami, then you will enjoy this mindscape. If you are new to the family, then go slow, and start small. There is no rush.<br /><br />Book 3:<br />Without giving anything away, the ending of this book culminates in all the right ways. The writing is so subtle and the significance is profound. The reader feels satisfied after spending 925 pages dedicated to this feat. The love story here is so subtle it appears effortless.<br /><br />Most of Murakami's stories can be read through a theoretical, literary, or historical grid. The grid for 1Q84 is the religious and cult like tendencies of certain believing groups. It doesn't overwhelm the plot, but the reader can definitely understand the underlying criticism of certain arbitrary rules or designations that accompany religious zealots. Murakami often tries to overturn cultural conventions and hold certain standards in suspense. This book does very much the same thing. Murakami lovers will appreciate this book. New readers will benefit from reading some of his other work before coming to this text. Once you spend some time inside Murakami's head, you feel as though he is reading you. This book managed to stare deep into my soul.. New readers will benefit from reading some of his other work before coming to this text.

B0024Y9EYS|4.0|The series is engaging. My attention starts wavering when the stereotypical angry teenager appears but that didn't last too long. I enjoyed it enough to be disappointed when it wasn't renewed. It had just gotten through the growing pains with some oaken performances (granted, Summer Glau's role is a robot so there's not a lot for her to work with) when it was cancelled.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|I found Lego's Christmas Advent Calendar for my two grandchildren. It was a true hit! They could hardly wait for the next day to see what would be added to their Christmas scene. They are also Lego fans extraordinaire as well. They were 8 and 4. So I will be able to add to their Christmas experience this year as well. So glad.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I recommend that you watch the TV series first to appreciate the characters and then see the movie (Serenity) to find out where all the loose ends are going.  Jos W had a lot of great plot lines to keep this show interesting if it was not cancelled after only one season.  I think the name, Firefly, and maybe not enough marketing were the issue.  That said, in 2003, if the show was not about wizards, it was not getting much audience love. Firefly is like the A-team meets Star Trek (Deep Space 9) done as a Western.<br /><br />Now I have to call it, \\"Castle in Space\\".
B007TK77QE|2.0|If the author's intent was to deal a nasty blow to English society, then she has been successful.<br /><br />Other than that, the Casual Vacancy is really boring, starts nowhere, and ends nowhere.  There is no story line - only more very slow  senseless  and repetitive character description which goes nowhere at all for the first 99% of the book, and then ends up in a last second spirit of tradgedy.  As for the ending: what ending?  It just stops; not even having made an attempt to tidy things up at the conclusion of this non-story.  Lose your concentration?  I'm not surprised; I had to struggle just to finish the &#34;work&#34;.<br /><br />J.K., on a scale of 1-10, I'd have to call this one a -4 and I won't even bother to say &#34;nice try&#34;.  It was awful.  I feel cheated simply because I expected more from you...much more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a great book. It kept being mentioned in my reading circles and I could not get around the title. I mean seriously, Wool?<br />I read book 1 and was hooked immediately. After reading book 1, the title wool becomes realized simply. Finishing book 5 it takes on such a great meaning that you truly feel it with everyone else. This book presented a great story, a strong lead, and such twists and turns I had to take a few breaks to rest. Every cliffhanger I tried to guess the outcome to turned out wrong, in some case totally wrong, and it made me not stop. I just had to keep going. A page turner in every respect.<br /><br />Anyone who has played the fallout games will probably take a shine to it.<br /><br />Read the jacket description, and take a walk to the down deep, hold on to the railing, and remember, save enough for the climb.<br /><br />Congrats to Hugh on the book and movie deal. I can't wait to see the visuals fully realized.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Worth the time for a good read and the movie does a fairly good job in following the book. The movie however is excellent. Take time to enjoy them both.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|This movie is so much fun! Those naughty little minions even make me laugh. My kids quote lines from both of the movies all the time! It is definitely a movie for all ages to enjoy! I love the Gru character because he went from bad to good. The kids softened him up a bit. We can't wait for this to come out on DVD so we can watch it again.
0452295548|5.0|In this real-life, insightful book, we are able to see and experience the intricate relationships of arguably the most complex organ in the human body during a major traumatic event from the victim herself who is also an expert on the brain. Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor gives us a very rare point of view, in the fact that she is the sister of a mentally impaired person, a Harvard trained neuroanatomist, an advocate for the mentally impaired, a published researcher, a victim of major brain trauma, and a recovering mentally impaired person. Through her well trained brain and perspective she gives us a detailed understanding of her left and right brain interactions before, during, and after her hemorrhagic stroke.  This leads to one of the most intriguing neuroscience books I have ever read, which is why I gave it 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />  After Taylor tells her history of becoming a well-respected researcher and advocate for schizophrenic minds with the NAMI, she goes into detail on basic brain anatomy. She does a great job of describing basic neuroanatomy from the cerebral cortex to the aneurysm. The \\"Hemispheric Asymmetries\\" chapter was really interesting where she was able to give the readers great examples to be able to understand the differences between the two hemispheres. For instance, on page 30, she says that our right brain thinks in pictures and our left-brain \\"thrives on details, details, and more details about those details.\\" I was able to use the connections that she made between the two hemispheres throughout the book to keep track of why she could not perform certain tasks during her stroke, which I think was her main goal of that chapter. The pictures, along with her tendency to avoid or explain jargon really well, allow anyone with some knowledge of the brain to understand what she was talking about. It is my opinion that someone who has never studied the brain could get a good idea or understanding of the brain as it relates to stroke so they could follow the rest of the book without missing a beat.<br /><br />  Beginning in the chapter \\"Morning of the Stroke,\\" the reader sees her thinking process and how certain aspects, that is normally associated with the left side of the brain where the stroke is occurring, starts to fade. I find it very hard to believe that she was thinking things like, \\"Oh my gosh, I'm having a stroke! I'm having a stroke! And in the next instant, the thought flashed through my mind, Wow this is so cool!\\" However, I have never experienced a stroke so it could be plausible. I loved how she was able to walk the readers through her thought process. It is interesting to see that she could relate the parts of her brain that were affected based on what motor function she was losing (pg. 39). I also liked how during the next few chapters, she gave the readers examples of how her left brain was taking a back seat to her right brain. For example in \\"Orchestrating my Rescue\\" (pg 52), she says that she didn't call 911 because \\" the neurons that coded 911 were now swimming in a pool of blood, so the concept simply didn't exist for me anymore.\\" And even after the stroke when the doctor asked her who the president of the USA was, she had to think about each word and process the entire question, which took hours. The details from her left mind could not be accessed so she eventually gave up. She said it was because she could only think of pictures that the right mind had and not generate the details that the left mind had. Also, she gave the readers insight into things I have never thought about for instance on page 103 when she says that her mother had to tell her about color before she was able to understand or use that as a tool and the same went for 3-D perspectives. She had to be told that things could be positioned in front of other things.<br /><br />  As someone who had a grandmother who was severely affected by a stroke, the chapters 4-13 gave me a large amount of insight into what my grandmother might have been experiencing that day. I can understand that she had no idea what was going on or what was happening to her because it even took Dr. Taylor several minutes to figure this out. These chapters are great for anyone who know or knew someone who had a stroke. It allows the reader into their shoes, and it allows them to understand what they were thinking during their stroke. This is something that is hard to obtain from any other source. It is possible here because Dr. Taylor understood exactly what was going on during each phase of her brain trauma. This is what makes the book so invaluable to families of stroke victims because understanding what she said in these few chapters could go a long way for families or friends of stroke victims.<br /><br />  The rest of the book talks about how she recovered, how she changed her thinking, and how she found inner piece. My favorite was the chapter entitled \\"My Right and Left Mind.\\" I really enjoyed how she was able to document how her right mind thought differently than her left and how she coped and learned from her left mind as it started to recover. She was about to gain a deep understanding of the characteristics of both sides and then able to learn how to integrate more of her right brain into her everyday life as her left mind healed. It is amazing to see how someone appreciates the brain so much even while it is letting her down to some extent.<br /><br />  All in all, I think that this book accomplished its goal, which was to give a stroke of insight to a wide range of individuals. It is for those who have had a family member or close friend who has had a stroke to researchers who study brain trauma. It is both suitable for the scientist or layperson's mind that will both be intrigued and will gain something from the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the brain during trauma because these same types of processes occur during any brain trauma not just stroke. From the perspective of someone who studies traumatic brain injury, stroke rehabilitation, and neuroscience and someone who had a grandmother who suffered from a terrible stroke, this book has allowed me to appreciate my research more. It made me realize why my work is so important while also allowing me to understand what my grandmother went through and understand what was going on with her during her stroke.  This is a life-changing read.r might have been experiencing that day. I can understand that she had no idea what was going on or what was happening to her because it even took Dr. Taylor several minutes to figure this out. These chapters are great for anyone who know or knew someone who had a stroke. It allows the reader into their shoes, and it allows them to understand what they were thinking during their stroke.

It is amazing to see how someone appreciates the brain so much even while it is letting her down to some extent.<br /><br />  All in all, I think that this book accomplished its goal, which was to give a stroke of insight to a wide range of individuals. It is for those who have had a family member or close friend who has had a stroke to researchers who study brain trauma. It is both suitable for the scientist or layperson's mind that will both be intrigued and will gain something from the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the brain during trauma because these same types of processes occur during any brain trauma not just stroke. From the perspective of someone who studies traumatic brain injury, stroke rehabilitation, and neuroscience and someone who had a grandmother who suffered from a terrible stroke, this book has allowed me to appreciate my research more. It made me realize why my work is so important while also allowing me to understand what my grandmother went through and understand what was going on with her during her stroke.  This is a life-changing read.

B0037VIBGY|5.0|This is one of Tom Hardy's best movies.  It is violent, so not for children.  I never could understand what makes a man like Bronson.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Among Woody Allen's best movies thus far; Owen Wilson's best performance by far. Opening scenes of Paris are in themselves worth the price. Going back to 1920's Paris to meet Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Cole Porter, the Fitzgeralds, Dali, Bunuel, later, Toulouse, Renoir, Gauguin: witty, ironic, hilarious, at times wistful, even poignant. Can one ever re-capture a &#34;golden age?&#34; Film gets every detail right, striking a note of pointed affection for the City of Light.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have tried many different programs to teach myself Spanish. DS games and even a somewhat expensive knock off of Rosetta stone. None of those programs have done what this FREE ( yes, free.) app has done. I have only had Duolingo for two days and I already know 108 and words and it is so easy and fun. I did have a problem continuing on after the first lesson and I had to uninstall and reinstall but, hey it's a awesome free app, I didn't expect it to be perfect.<br />If you are interested in learning a new language give this app a shot. You have nothing to lose and knowledge to gain!!

B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|6 Months after dropping the first half of his musical comeback, JT returns with another solid effort! On part 2, you definitely hear a more up tempo \\"classic\\" JT sound. The album opens up with 2 tracks that are perfect for the fall time. \\"Gimmie what i don't know\\" And \\"True Blood\\" are two tracks that evoke similar sounds of Michael Jackson's thriller. 2 fun tracks that are perfect for Halloween season. As the album goes on it's clear that Timbaland's footprints are all over the album. With the now classic 2 songs in one that JT and Timbaland have produced over the last few albums, it returns once again on part 2. With just 2 features (Drake, and Jay Z) JT has the opportunity to keep the spotlight on himself like it was part 1. JT displays great control over his vocals especially on the track \\"You got it on\\". The last track on the album sounds like a throwback to the NSYNC days. \\"Not a bad thing\\"  pays tribute to the NSYNC era and almost instantly throws you back to that time.<br /><br />Overall part 2 is great in it's own light. It may take a few listens for some people to appreciate it, but real fans will love it instantly. I do believe part 1 is slightly better but part 2 is not far behind. the overall project and comeback was a success. 2013 will be remembered as the year that JT took over the music world. elevating  his legend status even more. The closest thing to MJ this generation has seen.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I've had this mouse for a bit over two weeks and I'm happy to report that I'm very pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />At first I was worried to stray from the more popular choices when it comes to gaming mice/keyboards as I've been a Logitech/Razer customer for almost a decade prior to my first Anker purchase but I happily report that I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Priced well below the competition, Anker does a great job delivering a quality, value-driven product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-nice feel for larger hands<br />-programmable buttons (plenty for casual gamers, sufficient for all but perhaps the most avid MMO-gamers)<br />-scroll wheel and mouse click buttons (L/R) feel well-made<br />-programmable macros<br />-\\"on-the-fly\\" adjustable DPI<br />-adjustable weights<br /><br />Cons:<br />-despite certain high quality parts, the mouse as a whole feels just a tiny bit on the cheap side<br />-programmable thumb buttons don't feel very sturdy<br /><br />The one-star dock comes from the hand-feel of the mouse, the plastic feels a bit on the cheap side.<br /><br />At $40 this mouse competes well with the Logitech G500 and Razer DeathAdder.<br />I'm not claiming that they're tit-for-tat par but at this price point the Anker is packed with features and performs well despite the slightly cheaper hand-feel of the mouse comparatively.<br /><br />I will certainly buy this mouse again assuming it lives just as long as its competitor's products.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I was blissfully surprised when I decided to give this show a viewing a few weeks ago. The acting is unbelievable and Tatiana gives marvelous performances in each role she plays - they're all distinct personalities pulled off flawlessly. Also, one of the things that normally turns me off about shows where 1 person plays multiple roles are the awkward camera angles and 'split screen' visuals that you get. Orphan Black has completely blown me away with how seamless the shots flow together when there's two, three even four different characters onscreen at the same time. I forget that they're all the same actor and am left to simply enjoy the show. I wish I could give more than 5 stars, but I think everyone should watch this.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like thumbing through books.  That being said, I wasn't sure how I would adapt to Kindle's clunky interface.  Now, to be sure, it's still clunky.  There is no substitute for holding a real book in my hands, in my opinion only.  But, after using Kindle about 3 months, I have come to like it, a lot.  I've got about three dozen or so books on my Kindle and counting.  They're reference books.  By carefully managing my bookmarks I can get around in Kindle nearly as easily as a printed book.  So I'm kinda hooked.  It's the best way to keep multiple books in hand while traveling away from the office.

B007THA4FI|1.0|What a deception!, what a waste! It is hard to reconcile that the same author who wrote the brilliant and almost spiritual Harry Potter's books could have written this demoralizing and undignified novel about the tragic and base common lives of the inhabitants of a small English town; a parody of a mediocre and hurting Hell on Earth. It reminded me in some aspects of John Updike's writing at his darkest and most depressive. There is not one single truly loving soul to be found in that inferno...<br />It is Babel revisited...  So, author Rowling gave it a try at imagining how miserable life can be in a small community of resentful and narrow-minded people. I wonder why...? What would be the purpose of this kind of gray literature?

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|As an older adult, I greatly enjoyed this book. (In particular, I stayed up way to late reading it two nights in a row, and then it was done!) I honestly have no idea what makes this book less suitable for adults than Sanderson's other novels.<br /><br />The book stands alone quite well, but there are a hooks for a possible sequel some day. (And if and when such a sequel arrives, I would definitely buy it the day it comes out.)<br /><br />I have seen other reviewers mention that this isn't Sanderson's best work. That is true, but Way of Kings is the best novel I have ever read and so there is plenty of room for a book to fall below Way of Kings and still be incredibly enjoyable.
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|This is my first experience with Schleich toys, if toys is even the right word.  Yes, I'd seen the pictures on line, but out of the box I was amazed at the workmanship on this dragon and rider.  The colors were so bright and the textures-- right down to the scales! -- gave it tremendous depth.  I still can't get over the range of reds and blacks used to create the tongue!  It is just an amazing piece and one sure to spark a lot of imaginative play.<br /><br />Just a note, I was a bit surprised at the lack of articulation in the knight.  Didn't in any way get in the way of the fun, but for some reason I assumed that it would be jointed.  One things for certain, I'll be keeping my eye out.  This dragon won't be alone on the shelf for long!
B000I3UMLQ|2.0|Though I've watched pretty much everything else in the Star Trek continuum, I hadn't watched this particular production until now. Is it the worst Star Trek movie ever? It could be; I have a hard time thinking of anything worse. Two stars, because it is, of course, Star Trek, but beyond that... well, there's not much more to report, captain.
B001LM1456|5.0|His series of movies are all just incredible in the stories they tell.  Edward Norton does a great job in showing all the emotions of this movie, and the stories of how his unique strength has been passed down from his Dad.  The Grandkids all like to watch this one too.  They love the great big HOPS he performs.  It is certainly worth watching.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|This is one of the funnier Star Trek productions; the \\"High '80's\\" fashions puts it over the top! For many scenes, the premise is ridiculous, but the movie overall has a fairly decent plot. Best of all, every once in a while, when it starts to get boring, a hysterical wardrobe or costume design appears and gets you laughing!<br /><br />The notion that the crew could wander about the city streets in their Starfleet uniforms is not as far fetched as it seems today; it was the 1980's and, of course, it was San Francisco. Still, Mr. Spock wearing cowboy boots with a terrycloth bathrobe... well, words just can't describe!<br /><br />This movie is an important part of the Star Trek saga that everyone should watch; if nothing else, the wardrobe will keep you in stitches!

B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|2013 saw Justin Timberlake, work his way into a comfortable position as the self-proclaimed prince of pop, and whole heartedly agree with statement.  As it went with Part 1, The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2  has more highlights than failures and is worth your  money. It's been a while since I did a review where I broke down track by track by review, but Justin has earned it with this album.<br /><br />1. Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\"  - When this song opened up in the first few seconds, I was reminded of Freddie Mercury with Justin's opening ad-lib, however ten seconds into the song the masterful production kicks in and were treated to Timberlands sleek production. Great start to the album<br /><br />2. True Blood - Every Timberlake album has a song that I don't care for and on this album it's True Blood. The song is too long and I felt like the production was all over the place. I can see this song being a hit in the UK but for me it's the worst song on the album.<br /><br />3. Cabaret feat. Drake - After the abysmal True Blood, JT redeems himself with this one. Listening to the song reminded me of My Love from six years prior. I'm surprised the label didn't push this as a single since Drake just released an album and the promotion could have worked for both artists. One of my favorites on the album.<br /><br />4. TKO - The second single and another catchy tune for the radio. Not a bad song just not one of my favorites on the album.<br /><br />5. Take Back The Night - The first single and  despite the stolen Michael Jackson esque riffs, it's a winner. Listening to this song reminded me of Jackson's Don't Stop Till You Get Enough.<br /><br />6. Murder feat. Jay-Z - The third collabo from JT & Jigga and just as a good as the first two. This is another song that could have been the first single instead of Take Back The Night since Jigga and Jay were on tour this summer.<br /><br />7. Drink You Away - One of my favorites on the album and I can easily see this song beingplayed on country stations. On the live tour, I really hope Justin does this one live and shows off those rumored guitar skills.<br /><br />8. You Got It On - Now this is what I'm talking about ! Some bloggers have proclaimed that Justin is the current king of R&B, which he isn't since singers like Charlie Wilson, JOE, Jahiem, Eric Roberson and Tyrese will out sing Justin when it comes to straight singing. However with You Got It On, Justin gives us  not only his best vocal on the album but the most straight forward R&B song on the album and my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />9. Amnesia- After the excellent You Got It On, Justin keep the vibe going with this song. Timberland's production works well with Justin's vocals once again.<br /><br />10. Only When I Walk Away - The second song  I don't really care for on the album and maybe it's the sequencing of where it is, since the seven songs that proceed it are so strong.<br /><br />11. Not A Bad Thing- Another ballad from Justin, and a throwback to his N 'Sync days with  its pop feel.<br /><br />12. Pair Of Wings - After Not A Bad thing, there's a hidden track. Pair Of Wings is a beautifully written song where Justin shows off his falsetto.<br /><br />13. Blindness  (Bonus Track Available At Target) -  One of the few songs that Timberland had no part in and it's a smooth ballad. I would have preferred he put this song on the album instead of True Blood or Only When I Walk Away. If you can't find at Target, I'm sure you can find it on P2P.<br /><br />14. Electric Lady (Bonus Track Available At Target) -  Of the bonuses tracks, this is the weaker one, the production was a bit too fast for my tastes.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks<br />You Got It One<br />Cabaret feat. Drake<br />Take Back The Night<br />Murder feat. Jay-Z<br />Not A Bad Thing<br />Pair Of Wings<br /><br />Missteps<br />True Blood<br /><br />All in all this is a great album and unlike Drake's totally misguided  Nothing Was The Same, Justin has blended various musical styles on this album and a created an almost perfect musical smoothie. I still don't see Justin as a straight forward R&B artist, but he is the current Prince Of Pop and the most worthy successor to the King Of Pop's throne with his ability to crossover to audiences of all races.
B00D48BSBA|2.0|For a Frederick Forsyth novel, this has been a disappointing read...<br />What started out to be a very promising premise, ended on a 'clean' damp squib, with no major revelations, turning points, empathy, memorable quotes, points of reflection or hair-raising, edge-of-seat action.<br /><br />When you consider master works like Icon, The Fourth Protocol and Fist of God, this book is almost forgettable.  Who can forget the spymaster Nigel Irvine, the maverick Jason Monk of Icon, the tenacious John Preston of Fourth Protocol, the wily Sam McCready of the Deceiver?  In comparison to those, as well as the well-developed characters and antagonists in the 4 earlier works mentioned in this para, the characters in this novel are one dimensional and under-developed.<br />Hence, the book as a whole is underwhelming...<br /><br />I so much wish to read the hard-hitting, memorable dialogues and writing such as the final conversation between John Preston and Andries DeVries in Fourth Protocol, the quirky understatement of Sir Nigel Irvine, the description of SAS's memorial to its fallen heroes at the end of Fist of God...

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I knew about Neil Gaiman but had never read one of his books.  I normally do not read science fiction or fantasy.  However, this title intrigued me as did listening to the praises of my science loving friends.  I could not put down the book and cannot believe how reading it conjured up all these creepy memories of childhood.  It made me remember bad dreams, rituals to ward off scary things happening to me and my family, monsters in the basement, etc.  And I had a &#34;normal&#34; family.  Read this book, but be prepared to lose some sleep.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Not a great movie. Glad I didn't see it in the theater, but it's worth a watch on Amazon or maybe wait for Redbox.
B00CKBCRO4|3.0|The topic that this book addresses could hardly be more important, and the author is Professor of Government at Harvard. There is every reason to have high expectations of the book, and indeed it is excellent in some ways, but it ought to have been a great deal better than it is.<br /><br />I should also say that Professor Sandel is on my own side of the dialectical fence when it comes to taking a view on the legitimate role of markets, so when I criticise his handling of the question I do so not as an ideological opponent but as an ally and sympathiser. In particular one remark (p179) that deserves the status of poker-work motto is `making markets more efficient is no virtue in itself'. At various points Professor Sandel contrasts `purely economic' arguments, allegedly value-free and concerned only with economic self-interest, with what he calls `moral' objections to them. Broadly, I go along with his general outlook and many of the instances that he uses are fine by me, but he weakens our argument in two ways - first, I don't know what ivory tower we would have to visit to find value-free economic beliefs. The proponents of laissez-faire markets these days are nothing if not strident and hectoring. Secondly, Sandel's use of the term `moral' seems to me slack and hit-or-miss. There are two ways of applying the term. One categorises specific areas of human conduct, and the other is just a device for excluding alternatives, and it may have nothing to do with morality in the first sense. We could talk of a moral certainty, for example, by way of opposing it to a mathematical or actuarial certainty, and morality is not involved in this perfectly legitimate usage. Between the two there is a grey borderland, and I think Sandel should have been more careful of the instances he uses. He himself recognises the issue on p139 when talking about viaticals, i.e. forms of insurance that are tantamount to bets on when someone will die. `Maybe', he says rightly, `it's merely creepy, not morally objectionable.' However he lapses again on p145 when discussing some ghastly betting on the survival prospects of certain refugees, although I admit that he ducks out from under by attributing the view that this was `morally appalling' to `most people', as if forsooth he knew most people. Then on p153 he calls the objection `moral' as if there were no two ways about that.<br /><br />What I regret particularly is that Sandel misses the really obvious case of morality-vs-economics, namely some socialist legislation. As I type this we have a live argument in Britain regarding a proposal by the opposition in parliament to freeze domestic energy prices to prevent more of our low-income citizenry freezing to death. The economic objections are perfectly intelligible - that holding down prices when costs are volatile could frighten off investment. True enough, but what that says to me is that a solution has to be found that will tackle the dilemma and not just assume that to avoid the one problem we have to put up with the other. Saving lives is a moral matter, and here we have genuine morality confronted with rational economics. What is also particularly unsatisfactory to me is the Professor's frequent tendency to assume that his standards of acceptability, whether we call them standards of morality or just of taste or something in between, are universally shared, or more or less. Even worse is the plonking pronunciamento at the end of chapter 3 that communitarian impulses are `more like muscles that develop and grow stronger with exercise.' So there. Repeat that after me. I happen to share Sandel's view here, but he and I are not everyone nor even most people, and the `moral' case can't just get a pass like this.<br /><br />What I would have liked from the author is a view, preferably argued so far as that is possible but at minimum clearly stated, on how standards of behaviour - under whatever banner whether as moral or not - relate to rationality. My ownview is that they are not matters of the intellect at all. I simply do not believe that they can be explained in terms of some calculus of advantage generally, least of all financial advantage. Tell that to the suicide bombers or to religious enthusiasts generally. It is always available to us, of course, to rationalise our impulses as some kind of profit-and-loss account (whether financial or in terms of some other benefit) but all that seems a contrived and ludicrous oversimplification to me, invoked to buttress what is not, at bottom, a rational case.<br /><br />If hypothetically `pure' economics and `moral' considerations don't belong on the same page, it would have been better not to put them on the same page. Sandel does not seem very impressed with this abstract view of economics, but I would have liked him to be clearer. Does he agree with Paul Mason, for instance, that there is no such thing as this? However suppose for the moment that there is such an animal as purely rational economics, Sandel could have pointed out the intellect's basic limitations that David Hume saw in the 18th century, and he could have attacked the silly little simplifications so beloved of the marketeers. For one thing, `maximised' good/happiness/utility are meaningless abstractions impossible to define or even identify in practice.<br /><br />If Sandel really wants to influence the debate he should have tried harder to control its vocabulary. Alas, professors are professors, and sadly one of his Harvard colleagues is quoted (out of context so perhaps giving an unjust impression) on p130 as asking whether the desperately needy should be denied the take-it-or-leave-it `choice' of starvation earnings or nothing. An economic reply could be that quality matters more than choice. A `moral' response might be that this is odious smugness from someone comfortably off.<br /><br />The long catalogue of examples suggests a student dissertation, with too much about baseball. All a pity.view is that they are not matters of the intellect at all.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very enjoyable game, highly addictive. I would give it five stars, but often the game ends right after you have a bingo and doesn't give you enough time to mark it so you don't get credit.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is one of those logic games also known as &#34;nannograms&#34; where you use logic to fill in squares on a grid to form a picture.  It's got a good tutorial and help info.  A little twist is that the items you uncover are added to a photo.  You can play grids of 5x5, 10x10 and 15x15.<br /><br />Default is to have errors marked permanently with big red x's.  Yikes!  But you can also select &#34;Ignore Errors&#34; under Options.  You can adust the sound in the Options, too.  You can set it up for multiple players.  Playable in airplane mode.  Plays in landscape mode and will flip when turned 180 degrees.  Untimed, but it will track how many hints and mistakes you have made..<br /><br />I like it, it's attractive on my Fire HD8.9 and I like the fact that you can mark squares that are definitely empty by  breaking them with a hammer.  It's also playable on my Samsung Galaxy S2, though you have to scroll the 15x15 grid, and technically you have to scroll the 10x10 grid, though it's neglible and you can see the whole grid, you just can't see both the top numbers and the bottom numbers at the same time.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|You should know if you need this and I don't think there are really any other options. Cable could be a bit more flexible and price could be lower.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Was working ok.  Now I can't even open it.  I wish they would leave it alone when ot works fine and everyone is happy with it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandsons really like playing this game on my Kindle Fire HD.  They downloaded it themselves and play it first ahead of all other games we have.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|This IS the fitting next xmen movie. It should have been the third, instead of whatever the name of the third one was (Brett Ratner should never make movies). This is a fine package of the Blu Ray: great picture/ sound, and a nice helping of special features. The only real down side is that there is not enough special features (even though I just said there's enough...there's sometimes never enough. Unless we're talking about a Lord of the Rings boxset).<br /><br />Get this for a great director's collaboration with really fine actors. Watch it because its fun!

0385743564|4.0|If you had superpowers, would you use them for good, or for evil?<br /><br />In the first of a new series of books by Brandon Sanderson, he explores that idea, as a small minority of ordinary people one day inexplicably gain super powers.  Epics, as they become known, possess any one of a variety of these powers, but without exception, they all use them for their own selfish interests. The rest of humanity is left to live in a constant state of fear, trying to live their lives without become the next victim of an Epic's destruction.<br /><br />Ten years ago David witnessed his father's death, as a particularly ruthless and seemingly invincible Epic known as Steelheart killed him along with almost everyone else who was there. David was the only survivor, and he escaped with not just his life, but with a secret as well, one that only he knows and which may change everything one day--Steelheart isn't invincible, he saw saw him bleed.<br /><br />David dedicates the next ten years of his life to studying everything he can about Steelheart and every other Epic he can. He believes that the more he knows about the Epics, the better chance he has of discovering their weaknesses and maybe one day being able to avenge his father's death.<br /><br />Normally I'm a very selfish reader, and when an author is writing a series that I really like, and then releases a book that's not part of that series, I tend to get irritated and question why they're not spending all their time writing the book I want them to write. But I think Sanderson is curing me of that attitude. While I'm anxiously awaiting the next in his Stormlight series, he's begun two additional series that quite honestly I'm almost as excited about reading.<br /><br />Steelheart is a great book. It's written for a slightly younger audience, but that in no way detracts from how good a book it is. From what I can tell, the only significant difference between Sanderson's books for adults and young adults is the length of the book. The characters, action, and world building that Sanderson creates so well is there no matter who his intended readers are. Buy the book for your teenager, but then borrow it afterwords.
1932907009|5.0|This book is about how to write a screenplay for popular movies.<br /><br />As a newbie writer, I give this book a high rating for being short, concise and very readable.<br /><br />The author is apparently a successful screenwriter, but not a top screenwriter. (I assume most top writers prefer to just write another screen play rather than a how-to book.)<br /><br />I thought the author made a good case for his theories, including using numerous examples from successful movies.<br /><br />There is a place for this kind of book. It seems to me that many elements for a story are universal. So you can't just say this author is telling you to use a cookie cutter. Most stories do use a three act structure, for example. You do need to care about the hero and what happens to him/her. Certain elements must be present in order to engage the reader or viewer, for it to be a story.<br /><br />I am somewhat appalled at some things the author says, at his sometimes crass attitude toward movies. But assuming he is correct, then the real fault lies with Hollywood and the movie-going public. If your only goal is to actually sell your script and make good money, it makes sense to think of your script as a product and look at what your market wants. Surely it's not art-lovers who are producing most scripts, it's corporations backed by greedy share-holders. I wish Hollywood was making more artful, cerebral movies but it isn't. That's reality.<br /><br />At the very least, this book appears to be a good place to begin, to learn the basics. Even if you hate this book at least you'll know what to avoid in your own writing.<br /><br />I don't know anything about script writing or the movie business, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm a wanna-be novelist. But I have watched thousands of movies so I'm not completely ignorant on this subject.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was reluctant to download this app... It seems as though many apps like this (i.e. to Facebook) just seemed to send you to the internet page, and I thought in the past, this one did too.  However, I was having issues viewing the Pinterest page on the internet browser on my Kindle Fire (it kept not wanting to let me see in mobile-mode, and if I DID get to try to re-pin something, I was getting error messages).  I figured as a last-ditch effort, I would download this...<br /><br />I've had it for about a week and I love it!  It's easy to use and DEFINITELY not just a link to the page!!  Just know that to get between pages (i.e. search vs. viewing your search vs viewing your pin), it is a finger swipe side-to-side (took me a bit to catch that one! LOL)...<br /><br />Very user-friendly and makes viewing Pinterest on my Kindle Fire, FUN again!!  :-)
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|As a history/english teacher I went into this movie with tempered expectations, the kind you typically enter a movie recreation of a book with.<br /><br />Setting the films issues aside (there are some that, I'm sure, have been discussed by other reviewers), the movie caught the feeling of many writers from the 1920's. This is something I was very impressed with and something I strive to have my students catch on with as they read. The feeling that there was so much excess and wealth in the time period, and yet all was not perfect came through very well, which, to be honest, surprised me. I was surprised that the film was able to convey the &#34;mood&#34; of the book and writer so well.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game no bugs so far that I see I love upgrade games. So much fun I'm officially addicted playing for hours straight.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was skeptical when I started reading this book.  I was only available as an eBook, and I figured if it was any good it would have been published in print.  But it drew me in pretty quickly and I greatly enjoyed it.<br /><br />A couple of the immediate sequels seemed to drag a little, but this one swept me right along.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I have loved all of the individual hero's movies, Iron Man, Thor, etc., but this one is the ultimate...so many heroes rolled into one, and they did deliver!  Great CGI, great humor...loved it!  I can't wait for a sequel!
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|This is hardly classy literature, but it was a good read.  Be warned that the Dexter in the book is a little more sadistic than on TV, where he quickly dispatched his victims.  But the book doesn't dwell on those scenes and is mostly a fun read.<br /><br />There are many other differences from the TV show regarding other characters and their fates, but I won't tell any spoilers here.  Go in with an open mind and enjoy the surprises.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I had two big problems with this book.<br /><br />1) I didn't like the premise. The premise is that two people are playing a game against each other. But this game is \\"practice magic until one you dies.\\" That is not a game. A game has guidelines and rules. Moreover, it doesn't make for interesting reading. Most storylines that involve asserting a winner involves training for some kind of epic battle or fight or challenge at the climax. But this follows the plot line of \\"Play for a while, then practice magic for a while. After about twenty years of going about your life practicing magic, get sick of the game and try to figure out a way to stop it.\\" It's just such an ambiguous, nonsensical idea around which to create an entire story.<br /><br />2)I don't feel for the characters. First of all, the two opponents are about 6-8 when they begin training for this competition, and it is not until they are about 36-38 that they grow sick of spending their lives competing but having no idea what this game is about or how to win it. Seriously, they go thirty years without any sort of teenage rebellion, or desire to branch out and do their own thing in their twenties. They go thirty years without getting real upset at the fact that someone else has planned out their life for them but won't tell them anything that's in store.<br /><br />Second of all, the way Marco and Celia fall in love is straight out of a storybook. They see each other and sparks fly. There are no convincible scenes or dialogue where they create a rapport believable enough to be perceived as love. Now this would work just fine if you were writing a thirty-page picture book. But when you have 400 pages of text, you really need to put a little more effort into convincing the readers that this is a genuine love story.<br /><br />And finally ... a good book is one where you want good things to happen the protagonist. If the protagonist suffers a loss, you feel sad too; if the protagonist is in danger, you're desperately hoping that they pull through unscathed. And in this book, I just didn't care who lived, who died, who was hurt, who won or lost the game.<br /><br />To the author's credit, it was fun to read about the different tents in the circus. Towards the end of the book, when people started recognizing that something sinister was going on, and lives started being threatened, the book did get more interesting. Even though I didn't have sympathy for the characters, it was nice to have a bit more action and advancing of the plot line.<br /><br />It wasn't a horrible book, but for all the literary awards it received, I was expecting to enjoy it more than I did.rately hoping that they pull through unscathed.

All human with wonderful gifts and imperfections.

B00C7JG0KG|5.0|OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL 3D [2013] [3D Blu-ray + Digital Copy] A Dazzling Brand-New Classic! From The Producers of ALICE IN WONDERLAND!<br /><br />Feel the magic of ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ surround you as it soars off the screen and lands in your living room in this spectacular and stunning awesome 3D Blu-ray – the absolute best you can get to view in your home.<br /><br />Disney’s fantastical adventure, from the director of the ‘Spider-Man’ trilogy, follows Oscar Diggs [James Franco], a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics. When Oscar Diggs is hurled away to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he’s hit the jackpot – until he meets three witches [Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams], who aren’t convinced he’s the great wizard everyone’s expecting. Reluctantly drawn into epic problems facing Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar Diggs must find out who is good and who is evil before it’s too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity – and even some wizardry – Oscar Diggs transforms himself into the great wizard and a better man as well.<br /><br />Cast: James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams, Zach Braff, Bill Cobbs, Joey King, Tony Cox, Stephen R. Hart, Abigail Spencer, Bruce Campbell, Ted Raimi, Tim Holmes, Toni Wynne, Rob Crites, William Dick, Gene Jones, John Lord Booth III, Suzanne Keilly, Shannon Murray, Ralph Lister, John Manfredi, Robert Stromberg, Channing Pierce, Brian Searle, Russell Bobbitt, Brandon Hamilton, Stevie Lee, Mike Estes, Phillip Huber, Chidi Ajufo, Talia Akiva, Blake Arnold, Cameron Barnett, Wayne Brinston, Colin Bryant, Ron Causey, Justin Chrzanowski, Michael Clossin, Zachary Robert Craft, Omar Diop, Neil Ellice, John C.

Baum (original story)<br /><br />Composer: Danny Elfman<br /><br />Cinematography: Peter Deming<br /><br />Video Resolution: 1080p<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1 [Black-and-White] and 2.40:1 [Colour]<br /><br />Audio: English: 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French: 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish: 5.1 Dolby Digital, English: 5.1 Dolby Digital and English: 2.0 Dolby Digital<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish<br /><br />Running Time: 130 minutes<br /><br />Region: All Regions<br /><br />Number of discs: 1<br /><br />Studio: Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment<br /><br />Andrew’s Blu-ray Review: Sam Raimi's epic fantasy prequel conjures up a new benchmark for 3D Blu-ray. Given the reverence so many fans have for the legendary 1939 M-G-M musical, it's no surprise that some consider any plans to do a prequel to ‘The Wizard of Oz’ to be completely sacrilegious.<br /><br />But somehow writer David Lindsay-Abaire and Michael Kapner and director Sam Raimi have managed to magic up a dizzying and manically inventive fantasy film that feels like a natural part of the universe Frank L. Baum created. By exploring the origin of the Wizard, this blockbuster prequel feels fresh and unpredictable, whilst also delivering plenty of nods and winks for fans of the original film, especially the Frank L. Baum's books.<br /><br />More delightful is the film's 3D presentation, which actually makes for a very entertaining experience. Though built on the backs of endless 3D gimmicks, there's a delirious energy to all the carnivorous plants, dive-bombing monkeys, surging rapids, toothy river fairies, jutting emerald crystals, and billowing fireballs to thoroughly demonstrate Sam Raimi's penchant for 3D showmanship. The camera leaps and swoops, glides and falls; the creatures of Oz charge and lunge, pounce and attack; cities and towns loom and extend into the distance, while endless fields of flowers, dark forests and sprawling mountain ranges disappear into the horizon. What Oz the Great and Powerful lacks in cohesion and inspiration, it tacks on with feverish, sometimes dizzying 3D, and it's clear that Sam Raimi's Oz was built to take full advantage of the format, from the ground up. The added assault on the senses even distracts from some of the film's bigger problems, making its 2D counterpart feel even flatter and less whimsical. Is the 3D version of the film the wonderful wizard Disney and the filmmakers hoped it would be? Perhaps in part, but it still falls short. It may take a sequel to prove Sam Raimi and company truly have something up their sleeves.<br /><br />Buoyed by game performances from all the principals and Sam Raimi's energetic direction, ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ is a fun slice of fantastical whimsy wrapped up in dazzling layers of 3D eye-candy. So, even if it doesn't really measure up to the original, it's still a whole lot of magical and exciting fun.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – Step aside ‘AVATAR’ there is a new king of 3D Blu-ray. Disney's stunning awesome encoded stereoscopic presentation of ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ 3D not only sets a new technical benchmark for the format – the native 3D photography is so involving that it easily makes the film more enjoyable that the 'flat' version. The sheer depth of the image and the volume dimensions of everything is frankly totally awe-inspiring. Nothing about it feels forced, it just feels perfectly natural. Colour presentation is probably the most vibrant I have seen in a 3D presentation and fills the widescreen 2.40:1 at all times, at least it does from Chapter 8 when the action moves to Oz, prior to that it's 1.33:1 black-and-white. ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ 3D 1080p imagery is truly magical.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The 3D presentations of the film are accompanied by what Disney is openly touting as a 'near-field' 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. This indicates that the mix has been optimised for 'smaller' environments – but don't worry, this is something that Disney has apparently done with a lot of its mixes in the past, albeit without the labelling and, as it happens, ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ 7.1 channel soundtrack is a match for the reference-quality visuals. Admittedly, things start in a rather subdued mode, with the audio accompanying the monochrome opening being deliberately wedded to the front stereo spread. However, once our hero is sucked up by the tornado in Chapter 7 the full 7.1 mix explodes into life. Front and rear speakers are employed aggressively and consistently from that point onwards, building layer upon layer of audio in the sound field to dynamic effect.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The 3D version contains no supplements whatsoever on the Blu-ray disc itself. Supplements can only can be accessed through the Digital Copy Plus version of the film.<br /><br />Special Feature: Walt Disney and the Road to Oz [Digital Copy Plus] [10:00] The studio and Uncle Walt's history with Oz, which traces back to the 1930s (when Snow White hinted at the success of feature fantasy), Disney's acquisition of the rights to fourteen Oz books, an abandoned 1950s musical adaptation (The Rainbow Road to Oz), and other milestones on the long and winding road to ‘Oz the Great and Powerful.’<br /><br />Special Feature: My Journey in Oz, by James Franco [Digital Copy Plus] [22:00] This sort of a-day-in-the-life video journal is more of a James Franco-hosted production documentary than anything else, and that's perfectly fine. James Franco does everything from discussing the film to interviewing Sam Raimi to going behind-the-scenes to reveal how practical and visual effects were used to realise Oz.<br /><br />Special Feature: China Girl and the Suspension of Disbelief [Digital Copy Plus] [5:00] Oz's porcelain doll springs to life by way of on-set marionettes, computer wizardry and the voice performance of young actress Joey King.<br /><br />Special Feature: Before Your Very Eyes: From Kansas to Oz [Digital Copy Plus] [11:00] The design, development and creation of the lands of Oz the Great and Powerful, from the film's visual aesthetic to its costumes, sets, environments, locations and grand vistas.<br /><br />Special Feature: Metamorphosis [Digital Copy Plus] [8:00] Sam Raimi and company bring the Wicked Witch to sinister, cackling life with prosthetics that simultaneously accentuate, sharpen and mask the actress's facial features.<br /><br />Special Feature: Mr. Elfman's Musical Concoctions [Digital Copy Plus] [7:00] Composer Danny Elfman and the film's score.<br /><br />Special Feature: Bloopers [Digital Copy Plus] [5:00] Franco, Braff, Kunis and the rest of the cast ham it up.<br /><br />Finally, ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ 3D never ascends to the heights of the original ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ and unfortunately a lot of critics of this 3D Blu-ray say that is certainly won't ever be hailed as a timeless classic, but to me it is a beautiful modern day classic of the original masterpiece in cinema history. So it will be totally wrong to give this 2013 film comparison, is almost totally unfair, but sadly a lot of critics are all unfairly in precisely doing that comparison, which is totally out of order and makes me very angry and totally incensed, as it is a totally beautiful well-crafted film and especially in 3D, whereas the 2D looks totally flat, that is a must to view in 3D. Another thing that is making me so angry is the comments of critics of this marvellous film, saying that nothing quite clicks into place [rubbish] especially the script, the cast, the visual effects, which to my mind is a very harsh comment and have obviously been watching a different film to me. On top of all that I feel Sam Raimi eventually finds his footing with ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ 3D and hits a decent stride and finishes poised hopefully, for a sequel. The 3D version is even better and is a honestly a very exciting experience. Walt Disney's Blu-ray release is more consistent and satisfying experience of this film, and with an excellent video transfer, especially the terrific sumptuous 3D experience, and a very exciting strong 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track. The 3D edition's extras are only available by way of Disney's new Digital Copy Plus online service, so that's a rather irritating hassle, but at least the content is still available in one way or another. All told, ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’ 3D is a great and powerful prequel it could be, but it’s the Blu-ray debut and 3D AV awesome presentation, unite to become a formidable powerhouse.

B00ECLU346|2.0|By \\"meh\\" I mean it is \\"okay.\\" Not good. Not great. Just \\"okay.\\" It was rushed it seems. Kinda felt robbed at the end. It is a funny movie but a lot of parts only felt funny because I was expected to laugh. Some parts are only giggle moments then after watching again you are like, \\"wtf.\\" I love the cast. These guys go great together, but I was just not feeling the third. Honestly? If I were you I would just torrent or rent at red box. Even then, I am still not sure it is worth that. Maybe I am just picky. What is really sad, the only parts of the movie I remember is the giraffe and when Chow was gliding in the air.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Action packed flick with all the &#34;running man&#34; style thought process interweaved throughout it. Definitely a recommended view for anyone!
6305428042|5.0|This is our Halloween Tradition Movie,to be watched on October 1st every year!  Just like National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, it sets the mood for the coming holiday. Bette, Kathy and even Jessica are hysterical and its a great movie to just enjoy with your family.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Funny, loved the movie. The characters resembled the real actors.  &#34;Release the Baby&#34; that was just too funny. I watched four times!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This is a must have app as it works so well. I just love how easy it is to work with.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|i got a kindle fire and the shooting stage is impossible after the first level since the kindle fire doesnt recognize more than two fingers, so prepare yourselves. Other than that just disable the plane level because the kindle doesnt have microphone so it doesn't recognize when you start to blow at it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I have read this twice and glean something new each time.  I am sure to read it again.  There is a reason it remains at the top of the best seller list after all this time!  Even my husband enjoyed reading this!!!
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This item cam very quick! And the bottom does expand to make it taller i love that. Although it is hard because its hard to adjust and when i slide my phone into the slot it scratches my phone. But I reccommend this more for an Iphone 4/4s
B00000FC5H|5.0|All the music that you loved from the elements.  This CD will make you move and bring back many memories. A must have for every collector of dance music.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|worth a watch....one of those shows that keeps you watching episode after episode. Overall great show that keeps you guessing.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I loved this game. I sometimes have cloudy thinking due to chronic illness. This game was great for mental acuity exercise. And the pictures were even fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It is like having a real horse. There are many  thing to do like cleaning the stall and pasture and grooming. I have one complaint through, it needs to be easier to get gems. All in all it is a great game.
0739341340|5.0|What a great book to learn something new. I have it in the car and listen to it every chance I get.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Alien franchise and as this is billed as a &#34;prequel&#34; I figured I'd give it a chance.  It didn't disappoint.  Anyone that asks about it, I always rave over it.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|Don't get me wrong this is a good album. I'm so glad that some rock and metal are still popular. M shadows and co. Always bring their talent and skills to a album. That being said I wasn't wow like I was with the self titled and city of evil! Some of the songs sound the same or to much like Metallica and megadeth which in some ways is pretty cool because their playing tribute to their heroes . But the album is still new and growing on me. Still a good metal, hard rock album by a really talented band. Can't wait to hear what comes next!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|...really, how can you not give this five stars?  It's Angry Birds.  It has consumed many hours of my life I can never get back.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|I got in to dream theater about two years ago right before mike portnoy left. Love all their albums expect for the last two that came out, a dramatic turn of events and the self tilted one that I'm doing a review on right now. I do like dramatic turn of a events better than the new one but still not crazy about both. While there is always cool stuff, amazing guitar riffs, singing, all around amazing musician ship. There just seems like there's something missing on this release. It sounds like the album was rushed a little bit, seems like some songs are half finished ideas or something. There's two instrumentals which are pretty cool. Some songs have a real moving pictures and hemispheres rush kinda vibe going on which is really cool. But all and all I hope this album grows on me a little bit and I'm going to give it a couple more spins but probably a must have for any die hard dream theater fan!
159562015X|2.0|I am taking a class that required us to use the code to find our strengths, and now I have a book that isn't very useful after the code has been used. In fact, when I had purchased this book, the code (which had not been opened yet) was unable to be activated because the website claimed that it was already in use. The company was able to give me a proper code, but I wish they would have a place where we could just buy a code for 2-3 dollars instead of leaving me with a book that isn't worth anything since the code has been used.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My two boys are so in live with this movie. They can watch it every day if it was up to them. We can't wait for part two to come out!

B00EP22QKG|5.0|I've been waiting for new material from Joan for a long time and totally worth the wait. The album is awesome; better than \\"Sinner\\". Love the tracks: TMI,Soulmates to Strangers, Make it back and Fragile. And the four live tracks is a plus.But what was that \\"life and dead stuff\\" after the live version of I Hate myself for loving you? hehehe kind of creepy!Love Joan Jett!!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I got this mic for a native American flute and it is ok I thought the mic would preform much better, my wireless mics sounds better than this mic. would not recommend this mic
0132350882|5.0|I bought this book for my CS222 class because it was required but I actually enjoy reading it. I feel like I'm learning a lot more than I normally would from a college textbook because the author's way of wording things makes it easy to follow. There are also small jokes and pictures that make reading from this book feel less like an assignment and more like listening to a mentor give you helpful advice. Overall, I feel like I'll actually be keeping this book when I'm done with the class because I know that it will help me later in life. Oh, and the quality of the book was wonderful as well, just like brand-new.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a game i've played for a long time or at least a version of it. Love it. Keeps kids busy too when we are in public.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Hideously violent. Degraded every actors' career involved. I wish somebody had warned me. Some beautiful scenes, some amazing make-up/costuming transformations. And a lot of brutal depictions of murders and suicides that crossed lines I was not prepared for. From my wife: \\"That could have been a great movie, except that it was ruined by strangely graphic violence.\\" Yep.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app because it gives you what you want really fast. I like it way better than weather bug because weather bug is slow and this is up to speed. I would recommend this to any one.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Hopefully everyone is prepared for the Zombie Apocalypse.  This movie starts off in Philly/NJ (Newark) and hopefully sheds some light on what it is we need to be prepared for when the un-dead try to feast on us!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was a little slow moving, I thought it was going to be better and did not like the ending.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|This Movie is ILL.  Tony proves that he's Iron Man both IN and OUT of the suit.  Can't Wait For Avengers 2!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|The &quot;most helpful reviews&quot; for this game are not helpful at all. If you read only that, you will never give a chance to the this little lovely game. It is a very good game , similar to the famous game named &quot;Helium&quot;, which I uninstalled after a very few days.<br />Controls for the moving a little fish are very simple, music and graphic nice, and I am really enjoying in this excellent game. Helium was too slow, and controls weren't effective. Just try it and you will have a good fun.
B00F5F0208|5.0|Very good album. I think its a classic. Definitely a must have album for your collection. Go get it trust me.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I never could to write a novel about something that is so good, as this beautiful game is. It is really good, the must have one. Install it and enjoy. Simple as that. I recommend it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The puzzles are really great! I play this app for hours. It is really fun. It is great. I would definitely get it.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is the best game of temple run their is and I love it because it has the elements of levels and places to go to .
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very good self help guide.Should become a routine practice in daily life for self empowerment and well being. Recommended for all ages
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does the job as described. Nice little app. Apparently I need 9 more words but it is good enough for me so haven't got more to say. Good value for money.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and addicting. Between the kids &amp; myself great Playing game to pass time. The building of families is soothing. My daughter loves to hatch the eggs. My son loves to collect &amp; feed the animals.
0307271080|5.0|Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's latest novel Americanah is the incendiary star crossed story of a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, who grows up in Nigeria, emigrates to the States where she becomes a renowned race blogger, and then returns to Nigeria.<br /><br />As with her earlier brilliant Biafran novel, Half of a Yellow Sun, I think Americanah awes me most with Ms. Adichie's tremendous skills in characterization. It doesn't seem to matter what class, race, nationality, age, occupation, or gender - every single character in Americanah is fully realised, a living breathing person with nuance and depth and resonance. From African emigres in America, both uneducated and highly educated, to white working class labourers and African illegals in England, to black, white, and mixed race professors, entrepreneurs, activists, domestic help, politicians, socialites, military officials, students, and teenagers in Nigeria and the States - it's all there in technicolour.<br /><br />\\"The question came out before she could restrain herself, so used was she to sharpening her words, to watching for terror in the eyes of boys.\\"<br /><br />This alone is reason enough to read this book, but you must read it too for its treatises on race in America. I think the way Ifemelu's blog entries were interspersed with the story felt jarring and awkward, but the entries themselves were so sharp and dead on that I want everyone in America to read them (and elsewhere too, but especially America).<br /><br />\\"Race is not biology; race is sociology. Race is not genotype; race is phenotype. Race matters because of racism. And racism is absurd because it's about how you look. Not about the blood you have. It's about the shade of your skin and the shape of your nose and the kink of your hair.\\"<br /><br />The differences between non-American Blacks (as Ifemelu identifies herself) and American Blacks is precisely described, a divide so deep and yet so often overlooked. It's one I noticed myself when I first moved to America from Nigeria, unable to relate on any level to African Americans despite a childhood spent with Africans.<br /><br />And I laughed in recognition at this line outlining the difference between many white Americans and immigrants: \\"This, the absence of a sponge [in the shower], made them seem unreachably alien to her.\\"<br /><br />I loved this take down: \\"...novels written by young and youngish men and packed with *things*, a fascinating confounding accumulation of brands and music and comic books and icons, with emotions skimmed over, and each sentence aware of its own stylishness.\\" (And there was another rant I won't quote but was right on about V.S. Naipaul.)<br /><br />Even the generalizations about Nigeria and America rang true:<br />\\"It's the key to America's greatness, the hubris.\\"<br />\\"...that Nigerian ability to laugh, to so easily reach for amusement.\\"<br /><br />Americanah is also a gorgeous deep love story, and each of our firecracker heroine's relationships are compellingly and beautifully laid out.<br /><br />\\"She rested her head against his and felt, for the first time, what she would often feel with him: a self-affection. He made her like herself. With him, she was at ease; her skin felt as though it was her right size.\\"<br /><br />\\"He paused. He often paused before he spoke. She thought this exquisite.\\"<br /><br />Even more so as these relationships fall apart:<br /><br />\\"For months, the air in their flat was like cracked glass.\\"<br /><br />\\"Love was a kind of grief.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, Obama is a character in Americanah, and his 2008 presidential race is curiously and inextricably linked to one of the love stories in the book, as when he won that fateful November, echoing my own roller coaster experience of that night: \\"The living room became an altar of disbelieving joy.\\"<br /><br />I had only two complaints - the lambasting of the liberal white American, which is only once countered with a blog post on the one white friend who gets it. I know that this pseudo liberality exists in preponderance, and perhaps even more burdensomely when said white pseudo liberal is with blacks (of any kind). Ifemelu is faced time and again with these hypocritical characters who claim racism is no longer an issue, or that they understand racism because their great grandparent was Native American, and other absurdities. I suppose too many people claim themselves liberal when they're actually not, and that's the point Ms. Adichie is trying to make. Anecdotally, I'd like to think I have more than one white friend who (really) gets it, but in the macro world, there's work to be done.<br /><br />My second complaint was plot related. One of the major turning points in Americanah occurs because Ifemelu can't find a job while at university (and several major plot points emanate from this). The prospect of work study jobs is denounced soundly once (as minimal and useless) and never heard about again. As a scholarship student who (partially) fed and clothed myself on work study earnings, I'm baffled as to why this angle was so flawed. Surely a close to minimum wage job (as work study jobs are) would have been better than some of the options Ifemelu is faced with.<br /><br />Lastly, because Nsukka is my home town and heart city (I am ever bound to the \\"mythologies of home\\"), I have to include this passage, about the dry dusty season of harmattan:<br /><br />\\"In Lagos, the harmattan was a mere veil of haze, but in Nsukka, it was a raging mercurial presence; the mornings were crisp, the afternoons ashen with heat, and the nights unknown.\\"<br /><br />Go read this book. It's funny and wise and sharp and it might very well change the way you think about race in America.
B00CEZJT2E|3.0|I like the product.  I like that it's small enough that I may continue to use my device while it's charging.  It won't give any of my devices a full charge, but it's great when I'm out and about and my phone is dying or having to unexpectedly stay the night at work.  It will give my Galaxy S2 an 80% charge and my tablet a 50% charge.  Overall I would recommend this product.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I liked this book.  It's interesting blah blah blah.  I guess I can't just star rate it without being required to ramble on about it.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Watched the first season of this when it was on television but somehow missed that there were subsequent years.<br />The writing is great and it's entertaining still reads fresh over half a decade later. This is a fun guilty pleasure if you are looking for a series to watch on a night you've got insomnia or even if you don't have a case of insomnia.<br />Also there will be a movie coming out next year!
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|This was a very good and interesting book to read it was recommended to me and I can recommend it, I was disappointed when it finished
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Entire series is well written & keeps your interest.  Everyone I've recommended it to has thanked me for suggesting it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is so amazing!!!!!! I have been playing it for like 2 weeks and I sill love it!! I really think that you should get this!!!!
B002N7RAH4|5.0|I remember the feeling of satisfaction I had when viewing Shawn Of The Dead, and thinking to myself, &#34; why hasn't anyone else done such a great job of mashing up the Zombie cliche and the buddy schtick?&#34;  Here, Pegg does it again with the super cop reluctantly takes on sidekick schtick...  Just fun. That is all.
B007FU1OH6|3.0|Still well written and entertaining, however lacks the complexity  and richness of the story and characters of the previous two books.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just finished reading this book, couldn't put it down. It leaves you thoughtful and amazed that children can overcome such terrible hardships. I didn't want the book to end.
B0053O89WY|5.0|In a day where reality TV shows rule, it is refreshing to watch a real show with excellent writers and incredible actors!
B001J1K5IG|4.0|I love the idea of instant viewing..however, Amazon needs to get the 'glitches out' which stall the film sevral times during viewing. This is not the first time this has happend.  Thanks.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Pretty credible overall. OK, maybe the ending was a little weak, but it had us guessing up until the end.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It is a good way to spend time playing puzzles in the waiting room in your doctor office or riding in the bus.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love the graphics of this game! Fun and great for all ages.<br />I can't wait until I can buy another horse.
B00BRPDO14|5.0|Yes, this album is similar to Fields, but it has a good vibe and I love Junip anyway. So who cares? It's a great album.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Nice simple physics based puzzle game. Good fun, would recommend.<br />Easy to get started and fun to solve. four more words required
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I never watched this series when it first aired but started watching it on Amazon Prime from the first episode and got hooked.  When I finished the last episode of season 5, I was sad because I knew that there would be no more.  Don't understand exactly why this show didn't go on for a few more seasons.  It was great - the stories, the characters, the actors - it was one of my favorite series of all time.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kate Morton is a master of character development and can move from generation to generation with ease and not getting lost in either the past or the present. Masterfully written.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Pretty good entertainment ....The characters really grown on you...<br />Highly recommended ...real life situations as far as the politics of doing any business...
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I really liked this book. I often have the problem of  knowing what's going to happen in a story long before it is actually revealed. This book kept me guessing,  and although I was a little bit ahead of the story, it was not as much as I am with most. I also enjoyed the settings and time frame - a vast mansion, a dilapidated strange house, and the cozy bookstore.
B00CRW2066|5.0|I don't know why I never bought an album from The National before, but I am hooked! It is great.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|i love this game so much and its super funny looking at all the dumb ways they die!!! i would recomand this game to everyone....its so fun and i love it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an extremely amazing book. Charlie was an emotional and believable character. Going through the reviews, I noticed some of the lower ratings talked about how innocent Charlie is. Contrary to popular belief, not all teenagers are pornhub.com addicts and read smut. So there you go. If you choose to read this book (which I hope you do), enjoy.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Instead of rows, columns, and squares with the same number pattern, this game provides colored squares and differing patterns. It tells you how many of a color are in a row and how many are in a column, in the order they appear. The first level is really easy but great practice if you are a first-time player like me. The second level is much more interesting, especially when I don't recognize the pattern right away. I am having fun with it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Wow great game lots of options with out having to spend lot s of cash. Build a base and war all over world at the same time pretty cool
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I think the problem here is the fact that people are posting opinions about the series, not the product itself.  That aside, AMC makes a great product, therefore with the vision, creative freedom and risk they take when producing an original series you cannot deny the fact that the people, AMC, deserve the money they make.  The point the responder made to the negative review was simply the fact that if you can't afford it, why are you bashing it!  If the price comes down I will probably buy it as a Christmas gift for my son, if it remains at this point I will not, it's too expensive for me, but I certainly would not give negative feedback because someone is making money.  Are  books too expensive because the author wants paid? was Brian's pay rate too high for the last series?  Is it greed?  Who cares, I won't pay $800 for my family to go to a hockey game, but people do, I don't begrudge them the money and the players make their money, it's a fast-paced dangerous sport.  Bottom line, the stuff looks great, it's the best TV show every made and if people will pay it, then God bless them, the market will determine if the price point is too high, that's the beauty of a free market.
1847879071|5.0|I used this book while writing my dissertation, and it was extremely helpful. It made the statistics, using SPSS, and analyzing the results approachable and understandable. It is a great supplement when using the classic works, which are often quite dry to read. Having this book really supported my understanding of the material. Highly Recommended!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This g5 game is pretty good. The game definitely seems to pass time an d draws you in. Good to play
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Great movie with awesome action.  Ending was not disappointing and i feel that i got my money for this movie.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I had  not tried this kind of puzzle before so I thought I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. This app is fun. There is a short learning curve but I<br />figured it out in about 5 minutes. The puzzles do take some logic at times but they are not difficult. Give it a try.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love it because I can see what my friends are up to and I also play facebook games a lot on it
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I don't know why I found this so hard to get into. I had to force myself to get into it and finally half-way through I became more interested in finding how who the main character would grow up to marry.  I could see the book being made into a TV movie. It was ok, but not a page turner.
1935597760|5.0|The Misremembered Man is a powerful, entertaining, and engaging story.<br /><br />Jamie is a lost soul, a survivor of a merciless childhood in one of Ireland's 'industrial school' orphanages. Left alone after the death of his Uncle Mick, his friends Paddy and Rose, encourage him to seek out female companionship. Lydia is a schoolteacher and her mother's carer. She is a woman hungry to live life and it is her lonely-hearts advertisement that Jamie answers. These two live in different worlds and it is hard to imagine how they could ever come together. This book will not end as you expect. These characters will draw you in. They deserve more than they have and I wanted it for them.<br /><br />The chapters dealing with Jamie's time in the orphanage are brutal. The author does not subject her readers to a gruesome blow by blow account but paints this horrid picture no less effectively. It invoked not only sorrow for Jamie but also a raw and savage anger on his behalf. It is historical fact that such places existed and humanity should hang its head in shame for allowing them.<br /><br />The conclusion is surprising and the author unwinds in a rush of urgent suspense. It is more than a page turner as I found myself wanting to jump ahead. I cannot remember any other book that engaged me so completely. As I read I could not help but beseech Paddy to hurry - you will understand when you read it; there will be no spoilers here.<br /><br />I am glad I bought a paperback copy rather than the e-book. This is a keeper, a book for the top shelf, to be read again, to be held in hand ad savoured.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The writing is superb and the characters beautifully drawn--I discovered Liane Moriarty when I purchased this book andhave since read everthing she has written!!!  Highly recommend
B007Z58RLC|4.0|Interesting story for seekers that brings Eastern religion into focus with Western religion. Good read! Respected point of view and approach!
B00ALK826S|1.0|the biggest stupidity i have ever seen. has nothing to do with franz liszt the composer. complete waste of money
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I never used it. I need to get aquainted better with what I'm doing before I try it.But thanks for asking.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book did not disappoint. Again, you felt like you were getting a glimpse of another culture. I enjoyed it very much. The characters were rich and the descriptions of the various locales and homes were good.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|\\"We're the Millers\\" is that rarest of cinematic creatures - a high-concept Hollywood comedy that actually works.<br /><br />Jason Sudeikis from \\"Saturday Night Live\\" plays a small-time drug dealer who's sent by his skeevy drug lord (Ed Helms) to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana. In order to avoid arousing any unwanted suspicion at the border, David rents an oversized RV and hires a motley crew of acquaintances to pose as his all-American family. These include a down-on-her-heels stripper posing as his wife (Jennifer Aniston); a hard-edged, homeless girl standing in as his daughter (Emma Roberts); and a big-hearted dork from the neighborhood assuming the role of his son (Will Poulter).<br /><br />The story is fraught with any number of comical misadventures as David and his unlikely troupe encounter armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and another family (led by Kathryn Hahn and \\"Parks and Recreation's\\" Nick Offerman) in an equally ostentatious RV along the way.<br /><br />What separates \\"We're the Millers\\" from so many other recent studio-manufactured comedies is the sharpness of the writing and the appealing nature of the characters. The script maintains a deft balance between subtle wit and blatant slapstick, modern-day crudity and old-fashioned sweetness. And even in those rare moments when the movie jumps the track, it's quick to climb right back on and head on to its destination.<br /><br />Much of the credit for the movie's success goes to the actors who create tremendously likable characters, all with their own comic quirks and eccentricities, but all rooted, at least to some extent, in real life. The real scene-stealer is Poulter whose spot-on portrayal of a lovable nerd serves as the beating heart of the movie.<br /><br />So effective in fact are the actors in getting us to root for the characters that the movie can play up the whole corny and sentimental notion of what it means to be a family and get away with it. Thus, it manages to keep its subversive cred while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it.ed while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Good movie and you can lounge around for 2+ hours....the acting was good, the action and cg are good!! The story is ok
B00EIL7E9C|3.0|I honestly LOVE True Blood, but the last two seasons (5 and 6) have aggravated even me.<br />I started watching the show because it was about the mystery of other beings, about finding love despite differences, about finding a place in a world that just got so much bigger. But these last two seasons have been about bashing the government, both vampire and human. There's no real supernatural base to them, which defeats the whole point to the show.<br />If you are looking for praises so you know the show is good, seasons 1-4 are AMAZING, 5-6 not so much.<br />Hopefully, season 7 fixes all my doubts, and Sookie (bring back innocent Sookie!), then maybe I will actually watch the season without wanting to turn it off.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A great game. The graphics are clean and sharp, the gameplay is smooth, controls are easy to pick up and the customization is nice.  Only thing I would like to see at somepoint is options during the game to replenish your health without spending gems.  Some obsticils are simply unavoidable
0756404746|5.0|This is a fantasy in the world of magic; unlike most fantasy it is logical and ordered. The hero starts as a young boy who aspires to go to the university.  He starts as part of a family of traveling entertainers, after which he discovers the poor section of a large city.  The world is not unlike medieval earth but the book is not centered on the great and mighty lords of castles, but the daily and precarious life of the poor.  The hero is not a mythical one but an all too human boy in trouble (generally).
B006PIXKVW|5.0|my 6 y.o. daughter was mesmerized by this story packed full of lessons for life. as a mom who rarely can sit still for a whole movie (fellow moms out there, you get that) I couldn't pull myself away
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so well done. It is frustrating when horrible things happen to the people you've come to care about so much, but it is impossible not to want to know what happens next.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really like the character and I will be buying the next books in the series. Quite a violent book.
B00DZP3KJ0|3.0|This, guy obviously loves himself....But, he knows a lot about photographical techniques and the book is well worth if you want to expand your creative horizon as a photographer.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This is quite a suspenseful movie; it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not a typical Brad Pitt role, but he does well.
0756407915|5.0|This is a fantasy in the world of magic; unlike most fantasy it is logical and ordered. The hero starts as a young boy who aspires to go to the university.  The university is controlled by the masters, each master represents a school of magic with its own dangers. The Healers, the Metal Workers (often scarred by explosions) and the Namers (a high percentage of which go mad, or even when not mad are quite odd). It is a book which vacuum's you in and draws you on.  My only complaint is that the final volume won't be published until early next year.

B00E0SX118|4.0|The movie quality is great, very vibrant colors. It was nice not having to run around a store looking for a movie, just a couple of clicks and you're all set. The kids liked the movie, well at least I think they did. I was able to clean the house and they didn't get up once, I call that a win win!! ;)
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Not sure what all the fuss is about. This book was as predictable as it gets. The only positive is: it's a quick read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game. Not super challenging but somewhat difficult. I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them Sam I am...
B001XUH69Y|4.0|I have seen this movie before but I watched it again with my 15-yr old daughter.  It is always fun to watch but it is a long movie and my daughter lost interest toward the middle of it. May be you should consider splitting it into 2 parts.  I recommend it to all people who like classic movies.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would consider myself to be an avid reader. Post apocolyptic fiction is one of my favorite genres.  I happened upon this book and read the synopsis and bought the first of the first of the series.  I was blown away by the stroyline.  I have already purchased and started the second of the series Shift, and it promises to be just as much of a good read. My legs grew weak as I read about trudging up and down the steps of the cylinder, and it is almost claustrophobic to think of spending hundreds of years underground with no idea that people just like you are undergoing a simalr hardship just a few hundred feet away.  I look forward to hearing about how the clamity came to be, and how we did this to ourselves.  I am sure there are many more surprises that Mr. Lowery has for Juliette and the peoples of silos 17 and 18. Consider me a fan!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had no interest in this series until Charlie Hunnam was cast as Christian Grey. Picturing that beautiful man saying and doing those things are beyond erotic....wow. I am \\"biting my lip\\" waiting for the movie, hahaha.

B004JK61K0|2.0|I’m seeking an alternative app because my device doesn't have Google services so Gmail app won’t work, and the stock Email app creates labels like &#34;[Imap]/Sent&#34; on Gmail which is annoying.<br />K-9 can be configured to work well with Gmail, but its UI is primarily designed for a phone. There is no split view, and message list has very small font size. Kaiten from same vendor is a better choice.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I almost stopped reading this novel a couple of times because I didn't like the lead character much. My recommendation for anybody picking up Gone Girl is read right on through your resistance! This is a true roller coaster of a read that is worth your time. Get over needing to like anybody here. Just read it. Nothing is as it seems -- except for the fact that Gillian Flynn can WRITE!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so addicting it should come with a warning label. I keep picturing the beautiful Charlie Hunnam saying those three little words \\"I Want You\\" and my pulse races. This book turned this tame housewife into an animal...grrrrr.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Maybe this is a hiking book for non-hikers. I have to say, she causes herself a completely undue amount of stress by hiking with a way too big pack and too small shoes and subsequently the trail is really nothing but pain to her and the best parts are the off trail stuff and people. I just really don't understand that as an avid hiker myself. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's book about the Appalachian trail much more. Sorry, but Cheryl comes off as whiny. Shit happens to everyone and while it's good that she broke away from heroin by hiking the trail, it's still really frustrating to read this when she doesn't appreciate that not everyone has the luxury to go hike for weeks on end to find themselves.
0316044695|5.0|This was a great read, I have been reading several military novels recently, fiction and non-fiction and this one REALLY has been one of the best!I wish I could give more stars. I encourage you to reade it before the movie comes out. These were good guys who tried to do the right thing, and it const them their lives. This is a brilliant, fast paced novel of over the top action that will without a doubt grip your heart and make you shed a tear.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|However, only works with YouTube and Netflix.<br /><br />HD streaming works perfectly.<br /><br />Without an Netflix account, you only left with youtube.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Seiko makes a great watch. It's just that the time slips with these movement based watches. It looks and feels great on my wrist, which is very important. I wish the crown screwed down as well. It's a solid watch for what I paid for it.
B000BZISTE|5.0|A brilliantly acted, funny and moving treatise on the experience of American medicos and army types stuck in the middle of combat in the Korean War. Robert Altman had a hit with this. His style of direction allegedly prompted relatively experienced lead actors Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland to seek Altman's sacking before they realized that unorthodox though his approach was, the rushes produced some great moments. Like all intelligent and wonderfully made films, M*A*S*H stands the test of time and remains absolutely worth watching. Sally Kellerman as Hot Lips Houlihan is a delight (and we find out where the nick-name comes from). Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall, Rene Aubenjenois, Bud Cort and others provide excellent support. Altman's son discovered the title track (repeated on the highly successful TV series). This is a scathing, bitter-sweet black comedy which moves the viewer.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|Somehow made me become pro-wall street. Greed is good. lol. It had very good characters and an awesome dark animalistic nature.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series so far - just starting the last book of the trilogy, hope it's as good as the first 2! Have read other trilogies, but usually the 2nd and 3rd books aren't as good as the first - this is not the case here, can't put them down!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|really explains where it all began. I missed the original characters from the first three books but this one was a good way to end a great series.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|What I liked;<br /><br />1.  Cool effects not seen in other movies (i.e. the slow motion, blood splattering, etc.).<br />2.  Shallow character development (it worked in this movie with Dredd...he is what he is).<br />You don't need to care much about these characters.  Again, it works for this kind of movie.<br />3.  Some good action and cool concepts around shooting and blowing things up.<br />4.  Some light comedy that gets lost in the misery.  Really, this is just a blood bath movie<br />based on a miserable human existence in the future.<br />5.  Predictability is good in some movies.  It worked here.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1.  The acting by the female judge lead.  It isn't very good or convincing.  If you are<br />going to be boring at least be really good looking and sexy in the process. (Although the<br />intra-mind action was intriguing).<br />2.  The plot could have been developed better even in a shallow movie.<br />3.  It actually lacked some action that could have made Dredd a better character to watch<br />(i.e. get him some more big guns or toys to blow stuff up).<br /><br />Overall, it wasn't what I expected yet I was pleasantly surprised.  Of course, I watched it<br />without my fiancee.  This is a guys movie all the way (although some ladies will like it).<br /><br />Go for it.  Just don't say I didn't warn you if you don't like it.
B00DAKW7Q2|5.0|Still awesome,  still know way more of the lyrics than I should after umpteen years. Still can't see some supposedly hidden spooky stuff in the album photo, dang it!

B00BEIYP8A|4.0|If you're familiar with the 70's era Formula One rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt then \\"Rush\\" may not hold too many surprises for you. My guess is, if you are familiar with the story, you are in the minority. So, Ron Howard's biographical film may have been a really great choice for a story to tell. Those in Europe may be acutely familiar with it but even they may not have heard the intricate details behind the scenes that made up one of the most bitter racing rivalries in history.<br /><br />The casting of the title characters was spot on and I only know this based on the real footage of the two personalities at the end of the film and the story that was told. James Hunt was a blonde-haired playboy with a lust for testing life, partying and women. So, \\"Thor\\"'s Chris Hemsworth was a perfect fit for the part. Niki Lauda was a small perfectionist with an overbite and was played by German actor Daniel Bruhl. Combine two well cast actors with a juicy story, rivalry, fast moving cars and one of the best storytelling directors in Hollywood and \\"Rush\\" has all the right ingredients.<br /><br />First and foremost, \\"Rush\\" is not \\"Days of Thunder\\" or \\"Fast and Furious\\". I was more taken by the storyline and acting than I was the racing sequences. I found the racing sequences to be a little disappointing for the most part. They were few and far between and much of what made Niki Lauda and James Hunt despise each other so much was because of what happened between them on the race track. This was all portrayed, but much of what made \\"Rush\\" a good movie was as I stated before; Ron Howard, being a great storyteller.<br /><br />Not having the slightest idea of what happened between Hunt and Lauda, I found myself completely involved in their conflicted and conflicting personalities. The 1976 Formula One season was a life changer for both men and that is what the movie focuses on; one year, one season of their lives. I would only recommend that you go to see \\"Rush\\" for the story and the drama because if you're going to be dazzled by dynamic racing sequences, you'll be disappointed. To me, this was the weakest part of the film, but fortunately there was an amazing story to tell about the human spirit, the value of life and the risks that race car drivers take when they get behind the wheel for the sake of sport and fame.ory and the drama because if you're going to be dazzled by dynamic racing sequences, you'll be disappointed.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait until Room 2 is out.  I love this kind of puzzle games. The 3D graphic is excellent... you can view the object top &amp; bottom; rotate it 360 degrees. I didn't have any problem playing it in my Kfire HD.  The puzzles are just right a far as difficulty is concern. I love the puzzle within the puzzle.  I don't want to say too much. Just play it and you'll find out. The music is pleasant enough.<br /><br />My minor whineys:  The clue and pause buttons are annoying. I wish they are somewhere else, like drop down menu perhaps?  I accidentally keep on clicking on them. Another annoying thing for me is the zoom in &amp; zoom out because I used a stylus, I would rather double tap again to zoom out.<br /><br />Thank you for this amazing game. I am hooked. It does like playing Myst.
B00622BF40|5.0|From our friends down under comes this most memorable and entertaining film.  It may be a bit exaggerated,  campy, and/or dated for some, but the dancing, characters, and costumes are fantastic.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|I liked the preview of the movie and finally had a chance to see it!  I love all the cast members and they were funny.  It was nice to spend a couple of hours watching it, but somehow, I didn't fee like watching it again.
1551525143|5.0|\\"Blue is the Warmest Color\\" by Julie Maroh is the first, and only, graphic novel I've read.<br />As a lover of some cartoon strips--Doonesbury, Calvin and Hobbes, For Better and For Worse, and Stone Soup--I was not averse to reading my first graphic novel.<br />I just hadn't found one with a story that attracted me.<br />\\"Blue\\" has that, and it did.<br />It relates the poignant story of a 15 year old girl who, upon dying--We learn this in the first pages, so I'm not really spoiling anything!--leaves her diary for her life's love, a girl named Emma, to read after her death.<br />This book is the tale Clementine's diary tells over the years of their relationship.<br />Oh my God, how beautiful and poetic and REAL are the thoughts and words written by \\"Clem\\" about her deep love for Emma, her lover who had blue hair when they first met.  (Thus the title!)<br />The artwork is beautiful and adorable, the words those of a teenager in angst and in pure joy, as she traverses the ups and downs of a lesbian relationship.<br />I can't recommend this wonderful little novel (156 pages) too much!!<br />It is simply one of the best romance or relationship novels I've ever read, whether graphic or plain prose!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was great to read something that I can actually relate to and makes you think that life is a journey.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a very adorable my lil pony game. I agree some parts of game is slow and choppy but fun for kids. It's a free game so I believe it is worth it for the cost plus for lil kids. The sky mini game and the catching Apple needs work on but for the most part it's not too bad.
B004YXE438|5.0|If you're a traditional puzzle fan, Spectrum Puzzles is the ideal app. Not only does it present a number of puzzles, it gives you multiple ways to work them; 12-48 pcs. Sometimes pieces may be difficult to recognize, but the game lets you know when you have placed them correctly which is a big help. The pieces are also easy to move unlike some other apps tried. Fun way to pass the time. -T.J

B008Y212PI|4.0|If you like crosswords or sudoku, you'll definitely like this app. First, 5x5 level, seems easy after a game or two, but there's much more fun to have when changed to 10x10 level. Easy to play, not so easy to be solved - you'll have good time playing this puzzle.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Fun and entertaining app, can not wait for another update. A littlr suggestion for the next update, add a Sniper Rifle and some Asian weapons, thanks
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|One day I downloaded about 4 different escape games because I love these kinds of games. This was the 3rd one I got to after completing two others that I really enjoyed. I immediately lost interest after the first few seconds because there was this entire intro screen and I'm used to just starting the game. I didn't care for that and turned it off.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Its sad that Mr Flynn has left us.  He has been a source of reading pleasure for years.  He was in his prime!<br /><br />This book, The Last Man, is pretty typical of the Mitch Rapp series.  I found it good.  Not his best, but worthwhile and up to par with his other novels.  If you like his novels, you will not be disappointed.  If your looking for a first try, tasting of his writing, i would steer you towards one of his earlier Rapp novels, such as Memorial Day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome and fun and challenging so little grandson extra ordinaire nick aged three loves this fun game. it is a little difficult and doesnt seem to save.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is a fun challenging game. There is just one problem, the moose game you cannot put more than two fingers on the screen at the same time. As for the airplane, if you don't have a mic, go to settings and switch off plane game. This game is really fun if they just fix the moose game.

B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I absolutely love this cd so much I played it twice when it arrived & I have played it over & over again. All the tracks are brilliant, but while I enjoy the song it's a woman's world, I also enjoy my love, dresses to kill & I don't have to sleep to dream. It may have taken 12 years, but it's been worth the wait.

B0063M22QO|5.0|Th is a delightful Mah-Jongg game... it can be as easy or as complicated as you like. Great fun in waiting rooms! My only suggestion might be more tile sets to play with. I love it...that's all I can say... if you like Mah-Jongg, you will love it too.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I wasn't too sure when i seen this game, but it was free so I got it and know I love it. Its very easy and relaxing game also a great game to pass the time.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Great album the sound is amazing. I really really love the live bonus tracks. You also get free Joan Jett stickers which is pretty cool. I can't stop listening to it!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|It had a good premise and had a few interesting twists. But what I had a hard time with were the really long internal dialogues and long reminescences that sometimes went on for pages in the middle of important conversations. I would get lost and have to go back and see again what the conversation was about. The characters were troubled and reflective all the time and yet had no depth. I was also bothered by the book basically condoning lies, as everyone was lying to everyone all the time and getting away with it. This could have been a powerful book about the power of forgiveness and honesty but was more about the power of spite and lies. It wasnt good...but wasnt terrible. But not sure I would read another by this author.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Interesting concept for a different kind of logic puzzle. Similar to &quot;cross me&quot; game  (including the controls), but simplier. Different difficulty levels are good.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a good game. However I wish it had a guide because it is difficult trying to find the right portal to go through to get to the next level.

The author's candid telling of the evolution of the world his characters live in  gives a novice writer a solid indication of how a successful compilation occurs. Gate  on Mr. Card.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good book very good and entertaining read. Enjoyed the monologue with katniss's mind. Also liked how the captiol was. Ok
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|We loved this third Iron Man movie! It was intense at parts but thoughtful and interesting! Sorry we missed it in the theatres!
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|There are no characters to root for in this depressing remake of a mediocre Stallone film. I almost quit viewing ten minutes into the film but curiosity got the best of me. I kept thinking it had to improve. I was wrong. I did notice that Karl Urban kept his helmet on for the entire movie and I don't blame him. I would hide my face too.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is a good sequel to The Shining.  I still like The Shining the best. You will like the book .
B003G4W49C|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Despite his 'issues', the author makes Ender a believable character. You really care about what happens to him and believe in him. Only criticism is that the end seemed a bit rushed.
B00CWIMVDW|4.0|Fascinating characters in an intelligent psychotic world beautifully developed by the creators of this show. Complicated and complex. It doesn't hurt when you cast Caroline Dhavernas who was in Wonderfalls or have Ellen Muth from Dead Like Me do a guest turn. The only drawback is with the \\"displays\\" by the murderers. You have to dispel from reality to accept that some were physically possible to achieve. Visually stunning to look at anyway.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. It's always cooler when you can play with real people. machines can never replace the people. That's why the Park is a healthy place. Thanks Gameloft! Well done!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy install and ready to use right out of the box.  I can't wait for additional apps to start showing up.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I liked the interface so you can change media, erase and do other fun things with it.  So it's good for young children or amateur artists with a need for  an instant effect, but it doesn't emulate the real medium because you can't blend colours, get transparency or draw with any real degree of accuracy. But then again it is free software and therefore good value for free.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Enjoy the show. Should be required viewing. for  everyone. Great fit fiction an examples of highly functioning adults.  How to behave like an officer.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comic book based movie. I liked many of the plot elements. But I think they tried to incorporate a little too much. There was the story with the father and his past, the story of the two brothers, then the story with Thor and his girlfriend, then the story with shield, and then there was the actual truth about the brother revealed. It would have been better if they had cut some of the other story elements out and saved it for another time. It was a little much to take it in all at once.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|haven't played enough to know how this game is gonna go yet. When I have more time in playing, I will try to write a better review.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a nice refreshing game. So good too that I got if free. Thanks Duck Games LLC! Love love it!
B00D5CENXA|4.0|The reading goes fast and easy in this tale of hillbilly justice. Annie's ex-husband is out of prison with a chip on his shoulder. Rob has always loved and protected her. The ex-husband comes back home to get revenge. Will Rob be able to protect his love this time?<br /><br />The story sets up a classic conflict between justice and mercy. When Rob is forced to choose between the two, he has to rely on his instincts for guidance.<br /><br />This is the beginning of what I hope the author will turn into a beautiful love story of devotion and redemption.
0385344228|1.0|This book is clever and engaging, but it has nothing to do with love - just the opposite. This book is about psychopaths (or \\"sociopaths\\" or people with \\"reactive attachment disorder\\" or \\"narcissists,\\" or whatever you want to call people who have no conscience or remorse) and it was probably written for psychopaths. Everything presented has a double meaning. If you're naïve, you might think the book is about love; if you're not naïve, you'll see that this is really a story about the psychopath experience.<br /><br />It's clear that Andy, the father, is a psychopath long before the family history is revealed. His strategy of lure, trap, f&@#, is probably the mantra of every psychopath who ever existed. Like all psychopaths, he lies convincingly. For example, he expresses a \\"soft spot\\" for \\"La-Judas\\" (traitor to \\"god\\"?), but he ridicules Loguidice and tries to destroy his career. Andy tells everyone his son is innocent, but his actions don't match his words (so psychopathic!). He expresses \\"love\\" for his wife, but his expressions of \\"love\\" have to do with Laurie's physical appearance, so it's not surprising that he wants to cry when stress takes a toll on her looks. Andy's emotions are shallow, his descriptions of people are without depth, as if people were objects, he talks about putting on \\"masks,\\" he reverently discusses his ancestor's \\"genius for violence,\\" and, just so we know how diabolical and clever he is, he talks about all the innocent people whose lives were destroyed when they were unfairly found guilty of crimes they didn't commit (mistakes, which of course the prosecuting attorney would have manipulated the jury into making). Andy and his son are, quite literally, charming devils. If you consider that what psychopaths most want is to hurt empathetic people, then the ending shouldn't be much of a surprise.<br /><br />This book isn't about defending a son; it's about defending psychopaths. It has some merit, in that it's educational, but books like \\"TheSociopath Next Door\\" or \\"Snakes in Suits\\" are much more informative. Mostly, this book is disgustingly evil. Don't waste your time.
B0040I09RM|4.0|This is a very well written series.  It's up there with some of the best.  Not quite to the level of Breaking Bad or Sopranos, or Walking Dead, but well worth the time investment.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|I would recommend this movie to any of my friends. It is a feel good movie. You can laugh along with the characters and get completely involved in their social circle. Its a movie that can be watched again and again.
B000063DFS|5.0|NO MORE TEARS is one of the best moments from OZZY and his legendary legacy....Ozzy simply created the HEAVY METAL singer style, and his first 2 solo albums are masterpieces.....NO MORE TEARS is on the same high level with gens like the title track, MAMA I´M COMING HOME, DESIRE and HELLRAISER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BRAVO!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It's an okay game. It's more programed to bore you fast in free mode so you make purchases of coins and nuts. It's not a bad game but doesn't really do much to stimulate the brain. I'm surprised that getting even 3 combo's in the Kunfu Scrat does not improve your reward.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|The stories were a little bit of everything. Sad, happy, funny. I could relate the best to Jo the most. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks their childhood was tough or anyone who enjoys a little forgiven adventure without leaving the comfort of home.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is good for staying in touch with relatives that live far away. But all in all just Facebook. Always good for a laugh.
B000H4TX9I|3.0|It is a great plot with lots of potential, but the writers played it too safe. It started with an epic theme (the war), then slid into a comfortable petty-thief theme. They never took on the larger social and political issues that were presented at the beginning, and mentioned in every opening introductory narrative. They finally cut loose in the sequel \\"Serenity\\" movie. I wish the series would come back with that movie as the starting point. Had the network allowed the season to continue, then I would change my review to say that this first season had great character and plot development, leading to the beginning of the real story as presented in the sequel \\"Serenity\\". The series shows the day-to-day life of a rebel gang trying to survive in a totalitarian empire. They never engaged the \\"empire\\" until the movie. Then it got interesting! Too bad the network heads didn't see its potential.
B0039HV3P2|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a calm paced movie. The scenery and the dresses in this movie are beautiful!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|man, the VAN HALEN debut is one of the best HEAVY ROCK albums ever!!!!! While i like all the stuff from VAN HALEN, both with David Roth and Sammy Hagar, this is my favourite one(FAIR WARNING is great too...)All the songs are great and amazing like the classics AIN´T TALKING BOUT LOVE, RUNNIN WITH THE DEVIL, ON FIRE, FEEL YOUR LOVE TONIGHT and ATOMIC PUNK!!!!!!AMAZING ALBUM!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like HEAVY ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ET47USI|5.0|Love the animation! Keeps you entertained for hours.  Enough of a challenge to keep it interesting and fun. One of the best Spider games out!!
B007REW8DO|5.0|Great singer, and Ms. Perri has given the listener an album in which every song is wonderful. Worth the money!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Super fun to play and interesting article. Highly recommended. Good to play with kids. Yep. So So So fun. Bam.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is everything a minion game should be! Once I start playing it, I can`t put it down! It`s great for kids of all ages!
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|Renee Zellweger plays Beatrix Potter so well, she is simply adorable in it! It is an inspiring movie. The cute little drawings and stories that Beatrix writes and draws play a significant role in the movie as well as Beatrix's own life story. It is a little sad. While your watching though you feel really close to the characters.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I have been searching for a console cable that just works. When my purchased arrived I went to the website, ran the application to install the drivers for Windows 8, and everything is now working! This is an essential tool if you are studying for your CCNA or other networking exams.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was a helpful book for publishing my book on Kindle, which was a complicated process for me, as I am NOT technologically gifted, believe me. I needed someone to help me do this, and I am glad I had this book for guidance. Thank you to the author for sharing his expertise.<br /><br />Barbara Buxton (author of [[ASIN:1482344777 A Season of Innocence]])
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game in the world you get to fight mobs and build plus crafting and you get to mine
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was not as shocking as people made it seem when I heard others discussing it, but it certainly was a well written novel that made me want to just keep on reading...and reading...and reading.  Cool twists...
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very Enjoyable.  I recommend it.  I finished it in about three days.  Well written with a good flow.  We'll done Christina!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was pulled in quick and couldn't stop reading! I was cheering for Gale but the ending proved to satisfy me :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast will eventually be awesome, assuming the right developers sign up and Google allows open development. I am really waiting for the Plex support- if this little thing can utilize my plex server, it will be a 35 dollar media center solution for all of my TVs.<br /><br />As of now, however, the only thing it does is play youtube and netflix videos- which is pretty lame considering the plethera of ways to watch youtube and netflix. Most TVs and BluRay players do this already. yes, you can stream a tab directly from chrome onto your TV but what does that do? Not much. it doesn't work well to stream non youtube video. The best use so far seems to stream pandora on my TV so that I can hear it thorugh the house and can control it with my portable device.<br /><br />All in all, Google has shot themselves in the foot... again. They released this thing before it had any real functionality and unfortunately, the hype about it will probably die before it gets off the ground- unless they work very quickly.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/10/2013<br /><br />Chromecast just added a whole slew of apps, including Plex! Yeah, it is official. If you have a plex server set up on your desktop PC, and you have a smart phone... this is a 35 dollar HTPC solution. FANTASTIC! A must-own! Chromecast just knocked Apple TV out of business!
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|Such a triumphant plea of victory in pursuing your passion. Some of her vocal movements almost sounds childish in their whimsical positivity and excitement, but it comes across as playful and innocent.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book. Intertwined lives and circumstances but not in a contrived way. Coming of age story for people long past their teens.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I read this because it was the summer reading assignment for my seniors this year.  It started off really strong with some amazing information, but somewhere toward the middle it started getting a little dull.  Upon our classroom discussion, most of the kids agreed with me on this point.  However, I still would say it is worth reading because it raises some curious issues.
B0026P3G12|3.0|She is having a hard time in places and isn't always exactly in tune - but I am glad to have found a way to thank her for her &#34;Got Talent&#34; performance.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I am not as into this one as the first album, Sigh No More.  But it is a good addition to anyone's LOUD BANJO collection.
B008J34466|5.0|This CD is great.  I am 72 yrs old and LOVE this womans sound, looks and energy.  I only hope I can see her in concert.<br />It's on my Bucket List&#34;
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie, very interesting  plot, fast paced. surprise ending, great characters. loved the actors and magic tricks. a must see.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved it. I thought it was great. I could not put it down. Super fast paced. Completely enthralled and thoroughly entertained. Would recommend this book to everyone.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|If you think you might want this game it is so worth it. This game might take a while to load but is so worth it!
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it.  The book made me feel as if I were floating on the raft with Pi.  Highly recommend it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|However, I was expecting some more intriguing reading. I just can not get into this book. I've tried starting it a few times and always end up bored.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|This was a little slow to get into, but it grabbed me up and I loved the twists!!!!!!!!  Good one!
B002YK8OKC|5.0|The perfect christmas 80's movie. Great for anytime that you want to just sit and relax anywhere. I love this movie!
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I bought this watch at Costco about 3 years ago. I have to say that I am very pleased with it. Not too big or too small and it is medium heavy. It is far from perfect, but it does a good job for the money I paid ($69). Originally I bought it to use it while riding my jetski. I wanted something that could take on salty water, abuse and possibly get scratched. It does not show any rusty spots or scratches on the glass or the body even after three years of salty water and abuse. Not that important to me, but it is also very readable in total darkness.<br /><br />About the imperfections:<br />1. The middle bracelet links(the shiny ones) scratch with normal desk work as I tend to rest my arm and wrist in a certain way on my desk while at work.<br />2. It falls behind about 5 minutes per year, and like other posters have mentioned, do no expect swiss movement. This innacuracy is acceptable to me as I reset the time once a year. Also you will ocasionally find yourself resetting the day counter at the end of the month - I do not care about the calendar since I get this information from my cellphone.<br />3. The bracelet is pretty hard to unbuckle, even after three years of use, so strong nails are a must.<br />4. You'll need to unscrew the buttons before making any adjustments. I always have to remove my watch before I can adjust any settings.<br /><br />Other than the imperfections listed above, I enjoy wearing this watch, and I am considering buying another one in a different color (mine is white).
B00004CX86|3.0|(based upon theatre viewing)<br /><br />Clint plays the photographer and this movie has wonderful cinematography - it's a visual paradise.<br /><br />Beyond the visuals, and the nice lighting on the actors, we have a very decadent story - decadent because it is nothing more than another errant \\"go, girl\\" deal...who cares if someone cheats as long as she/he realizes her/his potential...to experience eros at its' ultimate?<br /><br />Okay...if we buy the storyline in a kind of pulp fiction way, at least make it sexy. Have Clint chase her into the surf (ok, no beaches around but they got lakes, no?) and her top flies off...whatever. But that would mean, Clint wears a speedo. Oh no, not that............
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Seen this type of zombi movie maybe 10 times prior, nothing new or original here. Not worth your precious time. Kinda fell flat on its face, no pun intended.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I love movies and watch about 3-4 each week.  This movie is one of the very best that I've ever seen.  It is a Christian movie that would appeal to almost anyone.  The acting  and story line was just great.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|beginning to end the movies is very entertaining.<br /><br />like every iron man movie is funny and very well  directed.<br />awesome acting.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Wonderful stories and wonderful performed. Cannot stop watching it. Don't know what will happen in session 3, just hope it can go on for ever.
B004XISI4A|3.0|Book 5 had moments of story continuium but drifts too far into fairy tales and leaves the characters of the preceeding 4 novels less significant.  A good read, not a great read.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like it because its free and convenient. I am a college student who is always on the go and having 1 to my books anytime makes it easier to complete my reading assignments on time. However, it would be nice if there were opportunity for text-to-speech and whispersync.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|Here's what the producers/directors did.  They figured they would hire half a dozen big names and throw them in a movie with a poor script and the movie would be a big hit.  It isn't.  There are too many story lines in this thing that they just don't have time to develop.<br /><br />Here's the basic idea that we've all seen before:<br /><br />Virus outbreak that begins to kill off a large percentage of the population.  Researchers find cure after many deaths.<br /><br />That's about it.<br /><br />My wife thought it was bad too.  Find something else to rent.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I was intrigued by the book and the ease of downloading it to my phone so I could read it anytime/anywhere. I love that it explains what science is known and how much we really don't know yet but may be discovering as technology allows us to understand things we had no way of measuring before. The subject/chapters are broken down in a way that allows me to absorb a chapter in a small amount of time and really get a grasp on the subject matter. I haven't finished the book yet because of my horrific schedule, but I've enjoyed what I've read through so far (I'm about halfway). Highly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Character development was good, although hard to believe a girl in her early twenties was so in experienced .  I will probably read the two other books just to see the outcome.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very good storyline and challenging enough to keep my interest I cannot wait for the second one to come out so I can enjoy it also
B000VSYDRM|1.0|What a ridiculously stupid movie. No, it's not profound or great art or whatever. It's gratuitous pornography. Yeah, apparently perfume made from dead women will make anyone who smells it immediately see a killer as an angel and engage in a giant orgy. Like I said, stupid.
B0085W09ME|5.0|This is so easy to use and quick to find out any info on flights.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.

B001BANK32|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to read this book! It is extremely suspenseful and overall a timeless read. I am very eager to get started on the sequel.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|This was one of the best documentary I have ever seen the only thing I find wrong with it is they focus too much on The Beatles which The Beatles is my favorite band but they already had a documentary they should have completely focused on George Harrison

B003TVMIDO|5.0|This Is an Amazing set for any John Lennon fan that wants to re buy or buy the collection and it sound great as well I think they put as much time in to this set as they did on The Beatles
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a small person in a large world, writing a review that not a single person will likely read. If you are reading this however, take heart because while you are a small person as well, this is a giant novel that will make you believe in things much bigger than you and that makes it successful. And you? That makes you privileged.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have read a few of Liane Moriarty's books and have enjoyed them all. I thought &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; was hysterical. The husband's secret blew me away; totally wasn't expecting that...got you thinking about the &#34;right&#34; thing to do. Good book...

0143124544|5.0|This book has an awesome read. It was funny and it was sad. It pulled at my heart strings and made me weep. It was a beautiful story with a beautiful ending. A must read
0385528787|5.0|\\"MaddAddam\\" is the conclusion of a trilogy, which began with \\"Oryx and Crake\\" and continued with \\"The Year of the Flood.\\" While I strongly recommend that you read both books before you attempt \\"MaddAddam\\" because they are worth the effort and reading them will help you fully comprehend the conclusion. You do not have to do so, though, because Atwood has very thoughtfully included a summary of the two prequels upfront called, \\"The Story So Far.\\"<br /><br />I once said \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" was the most terrifying books I have ever read. That includes King, Poe, and Lovecraft, by the way. Well, Atwood stepped up her game with this trilogy. The best horror (and dystopic sci-fi) takes current headlines and permutes them to your worst nightmares. \\"MaddAddam\\" is the culmination of corporate greed, abuse of humanity and genetic manipulation.<br /><br />\\"MaddAddam\\" is not a book that I would take lightly. It's a responsibility to read works like these because once Ms. Atwood opens your eyes to the possibilities of what could happen, you need to consider what kind of world you want to leave to the next generations, then step up and get informed about what is going on and do something to effect the kind of change you want to see in the world.<br /><br />I would include Margaret Atwood in a list of the finest authors I have ever read. Her work is moving and evocative and will leave you changed. Leave time to read this book in a place where you can think and react.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]]<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2013

Next time you do a marathon of the movies with your family, expect your knowledgeable fan to state interesting facts about the vehicles and spacecraft seen in the movies.
B00498YZH8|3.0|I suppose it is a great story, but disappointing compared to the book. Poorly depicts the setting, in my opinion.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a great film and musical.  Acting was great and the vocal talents displayed by all the actors was incredible.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was the best investment you can make if you love to stream and be able to view easily on your tv. We love to stream movies and this product made it painless and fast to do.
0345529057|5.0|I lived and loved every one of these books and cant wait for the next instalment. Would recommend this author and now would like to read some of his other books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not normally one to get into a TV series in such an addictive way, but this is an exceptional show!  My wife and I found ourselves stealing moments to catch up on the action at Downton, often staying up well past our bed times to do so.  Highly recomend.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is captivating and fun to play. I would highly recommend to anyone. I can see how someone could loose track of time while plying this game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is one of the best games out there!  The game itself is very fun and you don't have to spend any money for the full game experience! Works perfectly on my kindle fire!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so cool and it makes all the other games sucks<br />Next the graphics are so nice and neat
0060833459|2.0|I'm sure this is a great book, but I couldn't get past the first five chapters due to the outdated gender bias in the language used throughout.  I saw red every time a sentence included phrases such as \\"to be effective HE must\\", \\"the MEN in top management\\" and so on.<br /><br />Sure, the book was first written in 1966 when gender equality in business was an even more remote reality than it is today. From what I read, the ideas and techniques within are as relevant today as they were in 1966.<br /><br />However, given the iconic nature of this book, maybe it's time to update it and stop sending the unsubtle message that executives are all men to new readers!
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Not just another pretty face... There is real talent here.  I was not a believer until I listened to both CDs.  Now my X@#& tastes like Pepsi-Cola.<br /><br />Not For Everyone...
0805086846|5.0|No one can truly understand the scope of the genocide of American Indians-- but this account taken from the Indian perspective (not a white person's perspective) gives readers a pretty good idea. I was horrified each time I sat down to read a chunk of this book, and I realized how little I understood about history as it relates to the Indians. I don't know about present day schooling, but my schooling glossed over the 1860's - 1890's as history relates to the Indians. Other than the Trail of Tears and blaming the Indians for the near extinction of buffalo, my school didn't cover much else. It would be great if after a white perspective on US history if students were then required to read this Indian perspective. There is so much unspoken racism (even today) against Native Americans because people don't understand the true history of broken treaties, genocide, the mass slaughtering of bison (by white people, not Indians) starving Indians to death, and uncivilized actions towards the Indians. Lincoln is a celebrated hero for civil rights- but did you know that he also considered Indians \\"inferior?\\"  There will be some who contest the accuracy of this book, but regardless this is an important read to gain a new perspective on a subject people THINK they understand.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This game is not worth the free download. To many errors. Constantly freezes up and doesn't give back tokens. Constantly says problem with internet and there isn't. Just sucks.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would give this book 5 stars it is like,the best book I've read so far Its a great read for just about every one
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|One of the best shows on television today with a a great script and you dont u own it cause you need to watch it
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Would watch the movie. Looking forward to seeing the next movie. I would recommend this series of movies.  I don't have any more comments.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|The new &#34;birds&#34; are too much fun AND you can also play as evil piggies. The whole family has had lots of fun with the Star Wars characters and their various &#34;powers.&#34;
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've always liked kik but I logged out and am trying to log back in and it won't let me
0345803485|3.0|This is probably the first erotic novel I've read.<br /><br />I probably skimmed most of the book, so I give it 3 stars because the content was about 70% worth reading.  It's quite horribly written and there's not really a plot.  It's mostly about erotic acts.. and perhaps it just seemed like teenage sex to me?
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|It is still going strong and has a great scrpit along with a wonderful case that makes the show good
B009LDD22U|5.0|I love this show and this was a good season. It had a lot of laughs and a lot of serious emotional moments.
B00F91H666|5.0|I'm not a zombie fan, but this movie (uncut version) was more about a virus outbreak and finding a cure.  Yes, there was violence and gore, but the zombies did not take there sweet time on anything. I think this movie was very well written, the acting was superb, and it was all around exciting. I watched it twice during the 48 hour rental and will probably purchase the movie.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is good but it needs a little work. There are a few glitches but it is a good app
0345803493|4.0|It's better written than 50 Shades of Grey.<br />The sex acts are about the same rating for me as the first book, but<br />this second book delves more into the non sexual thoughts and feelings and interactions of the characters.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague In. is a most addictive game. If you are looking for a challenging game with deep strategy and varied interesting scenarios, then this is it. The games background music and tension makes it one of the best on android.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The first 30 minutes are pointless as it makes no sense at all. The core plot is about a star fleet officer who wants to militarize the crap out of star fleet and is willing to kill people to make it happen. Gene Roddenberry would have never approved of this character. One of the key characters is recycled from another star trek movie, which was a horrible idea. The entire ending was completely a ripoff even to the point of quoting lines from another star trek movie. I can't believe we've been waiting since 2009 (which was a mostly good movie) for this. I'm so glad that Jar Jar Abrams is not involved with Star Trek anymore and I hope he takes those 2 writers with him.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the fun game I like. It has so many diffeven levels. Even you think you are doing the some run' they change a few things to get you miss. It is not too much for the older person, but very active for kids and teens.
B00F91H666|4.0|The movie does not rely on blood and gore to carry the plot.  It has good plot twists. The acting is very good as well carried out with notable actors and actresses.
0385349947|5.0|Lots of good points.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll forget them all, but the advice is great.<br /><br />ps - not the best written book, but it's good and coherent
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So it's a really intense book as far as sexual content goes but the story line is a really good one and only gets better as the trilogy continues.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|The story line was bad.  THere was really no action until the last 30 minutes of the movie.  I was VERY disappointed in this movie.  I think this is the last one they are making and I think that is a good idea based on the quality of this one.  I do not recommend it at all.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love that I was able to get this game for free. It has a lot of puzzles that challenging but still fun. The only downside I've seen so far is the graphics are a little pixelly, but you can still see the pictures.
B00EABEHF4|2.0|Free, but not much substance.  No maps or details, just blurbs.  I guess you get what you paid for.  After all  it was free.
1846573343|2.0|I was not aware that it was the UK release.  The abridgement was so sever that you could barely get interested in the book and certainly did not get attached to the characters - not even Reacher!
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I checked this one out at the library. I tend to be a fan of YA paranormal/romance and this seemed to be up my alley. I'm giving this 4 stars, but I had my ups and downs with it. I enjoyed the storyline, the flow of the story, and the writing style. It never felt like it was dragging either. The thing that was hardest for me to read through (have to admit I almost put the book down a couple times) was the hatred displayed through Zoey for people with differing opinions from her. Now granted, I could completely understand her feelings towards her step-father and in turn, her mother, who quit acting like a mother. But, Zoey tended to stereotype , and spew such hatred towards certain groups of people that it was just hard for me to read sometimes. I did totally sympathize with her character and the things she was going through, though. The author did a good job of making me feel what Zoey was feeling. I have to say that without the hatred she displayed, I would have LOVED this story. As it is, I had a love/hate relationship with the book. So, I'm continuing to read the series for now. I'll just have to see if that aspect gets any better.
B009NH6JRE|4.0|The Walking Dead really hits it's stride in the third season.  Just as much zombie action as before but this season also demonstrates much more focus on an over all arc than the second season.  Looking forward to watching it again and can't wait for the next season to start.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I enjoyed the book. It has some interesting twists and turns.  I recommend for light reading at the beach or a lazy weekend.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game to play, i have much fun. I have such great fun playing this game on my way to work, at home, anytime.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I got addicted after playing this game on a whim. it is an easy way to relax for 20 minutes before bed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We watched all three seasons and enjoyed the experience of being in another time and place with interesting (and complex) characters and intrigue.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Django is a bloody and violent good times for fans of the director's previous works this should be a hit.  It's funny, well plotted and masterfully paced.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone though, expect over the top gore and strong language.
0062255657|1.0|My friend selected this book based on all the great reviews it was getting at its release.  I don't think the people who gave it 5 stars could have read it.  They must have just been fans of the author.  The book was so incredibly depressing in the first couple chapters.  Then it just got plain weird.  And it never got any better.  It just stayed plain weird.  NOTHING made any sense -- just pure crazy fantasy.  I would not recommend this book to anybody I know.  I enjoyed the animated movie Coraline so I thought I might like this book.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a good app for anyone it has the stuff that looks exactly how it was in the movie. It even has it when he is in the hot air balloon. I recommend it big time
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Best iron Man movie ever! It's an instant classic! Would have given 5 stars if they hadn't ruined Ben Kingsley's character by making him an actor!
B00DU74U74|5.0|All I can say is that I loved it! The ending made me cry and I loved how everything pulled together. It was so good!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This only disappoints you when you run out of pages to read.  And plus all of the haters of Eva. But I love this as much if not a tab bit more than 50 shades
B006WQLH7G|5.0|What a gem. This software updates automatically (unlike some freeware) and catches lots of bad things. What I like best is that they have desktop, laptop, and smartphone apps that you can run on one account. The smartphone app has a SMS call filter that you can just add unwanted (sales) calls to from the recent call log. That takes care of those callers who think &#34;DO NOT CALL&#34; doesn't apply to them. Gotcha - I'm busy eating dinner.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I have loved Neil Gaiman for many, many years and he was spot on in this story. The Hempstock's were such a memorable family and I truly enjoyed each of them. I liked how the story began with the main character as a middle aged man and worked back. His ability to tell stories is simply amazing.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is an addictive game that will challenge your logic skills. I feel like I'm getting smarter just playing this.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|The game is a lot of fun the play is really like. I wish you had more of them thank you very much
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Everyone should read this book at least once. Preferably, once every year. A beautiful reminder of what is truly important in Life.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really great app, especially if your smartphone eats batteries like candy. It shows you how much time you have left, depending on what you are doing.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love the CBS version and was really curious to see how the British version compared.<br />I watched on my Kindle Fire HD and was really impressed with the picture quality. The only thing I found watching<br />was a slight difficulty understanding voices at times.  The music seemed to slightly overpower the voice but only in spots.<br />Can't wait to find time to watch season 2.
B003CH7790|3.0|Quite honestly, this is not what I expected.  I suppose the book would have passed as a reference manual for the tapes that he advertised at the end.  I, truly expected more than this writer delivered
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Now you see me, was one of the best movies I've seen. I absolutely love it.  Definitely a must see movie.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|decent .... has some bugs that NEED TO BE WORKED OUT THO.. BUT IT IS A GREAT CONCEPT..... it's seemed the kindle platform is behind in this app tho

B0035JNTA6|4.0|ben is so funny in this film that i always love his movie from the beginning of his first movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you start this fantastic puzzle you will be hooked.Absolutely brilliant.<br />A very addictive and absorbing game,I can hardly put it down.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|One of the best games ever. It is awesome. I would totally get it again the only thing is you don't get anything when you.finish the game thingy.
B005HED08I|5.0|Love the old Star Trek shows, i can watch these over and over. trying to get my son to watch them now
B0084AYLK8|1.0|It was ok. But it was very hard to read this book. I think it would have been better if I wasn't forced to read it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Read Doctor Sleep in a could not put it down frenzy! Re-read it just to savor the &#34;steam&#34;.  If you can only read 1 frightener this year, download immediately! Mr. King draws from his deep well of scary and drowns us.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and amazing. I actually think I am addicted. I visit my horse all the time or when ever I get the chance.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Do u have the ability to separate the snooze and stop button. So close together....deep sleep reach for kindle hit stop..No alarm. Crap ...if u could put one on top one on bottom no chance of being late to work. Thanks either way.
1416594795|5.0|This book delivers exactly what the title says it will. Fun read. Learned a lot about up to date evidence on the case for the theory of evolution. I recommend the audiobook as well, gotta love his british accent. Like a sir.
1250029465|5.0|Entertaining, fun, easy read. Im a dog lover so got this as a gift for a friend. She liked it so much, she gave it back and I read it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We love trying to move up our friends list, and the fact that all you friends are listed not just the top players the younger family members have just as much fun and don't get as frustrated compared to the games with the limited number leader board
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wasn't too sure about this game  but with so many good reviews I thought it was worth a try.  Some levels are easy and then some are very challenging so it keeps it fun and interesting.  I thought the reviews about the music were lame but I tried playing with the music on and it is kinda Zen-like.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is fun. It will keep you playing so if you have work to do then do it first if not your work may not get done. Truth has come to you ~
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|They really enjoy the new graphics..and liked all of the new levels and characters...very nice upgrade for them. Would recommend.
1594489505|4.0|Found this book informative and inspirational.  Used as a book club book with lots of conversation and discussion and opinions.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Does everything: timer, alarm, stop watch, and desk top. The alarm is not real loud but maybe that is in my settings skill. Try it!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Great visual effects, good plot, great actors  Love Morgan Freeman. Mark Ruffio great also, did not see end coming, super
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It has jewels, logs, fish, leaves, and all kinds of things.  Each level gets more challenging, and you even have goals to complete.  Truely interesting, relaxing, fun but not overtaking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids really enjoy this...and if i remember when i set it up...it allowed me to choose levels by their age...
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Hilarious! So funny. Someone showed me the video awhile ago. I didn't know there was a game. Love it! Definitely recommend for a good laugh.
B00B1OWEVC|3.0|This record suffers from a real shortage -of ideas, of listenable lyrics and of interesting singing. I don't mind the break from Mr. Reznor's singing (never his strong point) but the female singer brings very little to the experience. In the 1970's Paul McCartney's fans loudly complained about his wife's presence in his band and on his records. But Linda's contributions were a lot less distracting than Mrs. Reznor's who doesn't seem particularly comfortable. Overall the song structures are uniformly linear with precious little dynamics. I greatly enjoy Mr. Reznor's sdtk. work and an instrumental version of this album would be much better.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Although similar to the fifty shades trilogy it's a great book can't wait till the 4th in series comes out

B008EEZ64Y|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but did not love it. It had a good message about the colors of difference, choices, fresh experiences and emotions--whether they be good or ill. But I felt it was missing depth. It resembles more the simpleness of an Aesop fairy tale.
006621131X|2.0|Consider how engaging and how influential  the 1960's/early 70's in NYC were.  A significant portion of today's popular culture got started at this time, in this place.  This should an amazing story. And Ms. Smith's failure to address much of anything outside of her tiny world is one of the bigger disappointments of this book. We get a lot of  reminiscing (Ms. Smith was poor-we get it) and lots of name-dropping.<br /><br />No one is more enthralled by Patti Smith than Patti Smith. The book is not particularly well written. It's very very slow. It must have been very tough to be a female in that environment. After reading this book I still have no idea.  A  real missed opportunity.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|this is a good book it is really good and is one of my favorite dan brown books. if you liked this book you will like all of dan brown's books
B001PP9ALY|4.0|2008R: Ok, Angelina Jolie with a gun, curving bullets, fast cars, and Charles Xavier (the younger X-Men). Need I say more? Enjoy MFJLabs 4x
B0031R5K72|4.0|An amazing story of a young girl during WWII. A novel way of describing the war from a young girl's perspective. Somethimes it gets a bit slow though.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This movie is beautifully written and filmed. I will watch it again and again. I will go and watch other movies by this writer/director.
B00EQUP3Q6|3.0|I love TR's sdtk. work. HTDA was serviceable at best. Copy Of A and Find My Way are ok here. An instrumental version of the album would be better.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Has some glitches that can be annoying but by far one of the most addictive mobile games ever! I like the power ups and the obstacles, and of course the funny death sequence drawings and dialogue...and the demon monkey!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|excellent  book.  I had read the book and of course seen the movies but it was still wonderful to read the book  again.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.<br />So I purchased it for myself, wrapped it and snuck it under the tree.<br />I think I might need to buy another one so I can leave a copy of it at the cabin.
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|It's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.  If you have not bought it, wait till it's $10 or less.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really fun the only prob is it glitches and has alot of loads  but it is one of my faves
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|The album finally arrived on time. It's better than I expected her songs are incredible I love (Team, still sane, tennis court, etc..) I couldn't be happier.
B00594XOZU|3.0|This app on the kindle fire wont let me login so i think its messed up crap. If u get it BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Set in a small town in Australia, this novel unfolds bit-by-bit , letting the reader peel up a piece of the puzzle here, gather an inference there and steadily try to work out what went wrong and where.  Seemingly innocuous interchanges and discoveries lead to a discovery that will numb you.  Amazing book.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|This app helps me put some things in perspective, while causing me to contemplate issues that I avoid. I read it daily, take what I need, and leave the rest behind.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Slow at times with little depth but still a good story about a way of life that is rare in these modern times: kids allowed to have adventures with little supervision.<br /><br />Kind of a more grown up / modern Stand By Me with a shootout at the end.
1451675046|4.0|a real contribution for public understanding of science,in spite of keeping the image of a radical antireligious atheist of the author.his attractive ideas(memes according to his terminology)spread smoothly,whether deep(extended phenotype) or not(selfish gene),rogue(god delusion)or not very much(present book).this ability  is of utmost importance for works promoting science literacy.critical reading will be enjoyable for all ,even religious ppl.no fear of \\"memastasis\\"(instead of metastasis)of his ideas,just enjoy interesting stories and know solid facts.let us ask him to write more of this genre,and-if possible-to be more modest towards ppl with other attitudes.no one has the absolute truth,or he has?
B008KE3960|5.0|Awesome game. Perfect time killer.<br /><br />I can sit and play this game for an hour.... until my eyes start to hurt and I have to get up. Lol
B0036S4B6M|4.0|If you are doing both , there are major changes between the original novel and Netflix series.  Of course, this is an ages-old issue.  Once TV (in any form) gets a hold of a book, it is going to evolve its characters the way the writers are feeling it and structuring the story lines.  The basic premise remains the same, and it is fascinating: in a true situation, the lead character, Piper, is incarcerated.  Her crime, her adjustment, her day to day life is all documented in a compelling way by upsetting the narrative timeframe .  This book is a puzzle you gradually work out ... (SPOILER ALERT). What happened after she got out is happening in real time, as the success of Piper Kerman's book and series (which has taken on a life of its own now) continues to unfold before those who are now caught up in the tale .
B00CWIMY3O|1.0|I almost hate to give this show only one star because Mads Mikkelson is a perfect Hannibal Lector but that sadly, is where it ends. All of the other characters are obnoxious, horribly written and poorly executed. The strife between Will and the Chief is so forced and annoying and Will's \\"special gift\\" is one of the most unnecessary additions to any story ever. Why can't this just be a show about what it was supposed to be about? The concept stands well on its own and there is no need for all of the artificial relations and interactions. I started to watch this show because the idea of watching Hannibal Lector before he was captured sounded great to me. I watched the whole season in order to give it a fair chance and it just got worse and worse. There are way too many stupid little side stories and unrealistic events. Do we really need a new serial killer in this small Minnesota town every week? I don't even need one besides Hannibal. This stupid TV culture of overindulgence and crowd pleasing continues to destroy good ideas. I'd give it less than a star but I can't.
0316113514|5.0|I am writing this review in order to provide an in-depth criticism on the book's content as well as structure for people who are deciding whether or not to purchase this book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read. As an avid marathoner, I am constantly looking for literature that tells me that all the torture I put my body through is worth it. Being a medical doctor, John Ratey has hands-on experience and knowledge with diagnosis and prescription of treatments. He has seen how exercise can solve health issues in lieu of medications. His perspective on the topic allows him to write effectively. He has obviously researched the effects of exercise on the brain to a great extent - and he does a great job of introducing the reader to the science and explaining why it matters. He covers the effects of exercise on the following: learning, stress, anxiety, depression, attention deficit, addiction, hormonal changes, and aging. Each of these topics are very relevant to the modern human. Personally, I enjoyed reading the learning and stress chapters the most. Ratey wrote the book to promote exercise, and he constantly reminds the reader of it. He eloquently ties all the information of a chapter together to support his message: exercise is good for you.<br /><br />The first chapter, \\"Welcome to the Revolution\\", describes recent innovation in Physical Education classes in grade schools in America. Ratey tells an interesting story about the schools of Naperville, Illinois and the instigator of the PE rebellion, Phil Lawler. Mr. Lawler's story is fascinating. His desire to rework the PE curriculum and his success in doing so is admirable, but even more exciting are the results from that passion. Naperville's District 203 had some of the highest average test scores in the world, including 6th in the world for math and 1st in the world for science. Ratey uses this chapter to show how this isn't a simple correlation between increased fitness and higher test scores. He provides many examplesas well as statistics to show that physical education has a very important place in the lives of Americans.<br />The second chapter, \\"Learning\\", sets out to demonstrate to the readers how exercise affects the way we learn. In this chapter, Ratey introduces neuroplasticity, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophic factors. He describes the terms without using confusing medical jargon. Notably, he teaches the reader about Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and how it influences learning.  Exercise stimulates the production of BDNF. Ratey mixes the science with real-life examples so it is easy to understand.<br /><br />The third chapter, \\"Stress\\", goes over the mechanisms of stress within the body and how exercise acts as a counter to excess stress. He uses a patient of his, Susan, as a point of reference throughout the chapter, applying new topics to Susan's situation and the outcome of those changes. I found it very useful to be able to come back to Susan and see how she changed as Dr. Ratey \\"prescribed\\" exercise to deal with stress. Ratey goes over what stress is and how it affects the body. This is very useful because not many people understand how debilitating stress can be and how important it is to have an outlet for reducing it. As Ratey explains, stress equals higher levels of cortisol in the body. Cortisol in high levels will damage the body, including the brain, but it is absolutely essential in controlled doses. Ratey does a fantastic job of explaining the complex interaction between the brain, the body, and stress.<br /><br />The fourth chapter, \\"Anxiety\\", describes how exercise affects anxiety. Ratey provides the reader with a simple and in-depth explanation of how anxiety is produced within the body. Shortly after, the reader finds out how exercise affects that state of anxiety and reduces it.  It is very easy to throw out physiological terms and leave the readers with abstract ideas of what is happening in the body, but Ratey explains it well enough so the reader is not lost.<br /><br />In order to maintain some degree of mystery in the book, I will briefly skim over the remaining chapters. Chapter 5 \\"Depression\\" is an extremely useful chapter, as many people in the United States suffer from depression. Exercise has many benefits - and helping cope with depression is one of them. Ratey describes why and how exercise helps with depression.  Chapter 6 \\"Attention Deficit\\" goes over the current epidemic of ADHD within the U.S. Ratey explains that it isn't a simple motivation issue, but a serious physiological one.  Ratey explains what is deficient in the brains of people with ADHD. He describes how brain function is affected and how neurotransmitters are as well. Of course, he ties it back to exercise. Through case studies and reports, he explains effectively how the effects produced through exercise aid those with ADHD. Chapter 7 \\"Addiction\\" covers how addiction works in our brains and how exercise works in helping overcome addictions. There are many accounts of people getting through smoking or other addictions. I found this chapter to be inspiring and educational. Chapter 8 \\"Hormonal Changes\\" is specifically written for women. It goes through how hormones affect women throughout their lives and how exercise helps balance their system. Ratey covers PMS and menopause, giving thorough descriptions of what is happening physiologically. He then describes the counteracting effects of exercise. In Chapter 9 \\"Aging\\", Ratey explains what happens physiologically through the aging process. Again, he shows how consistent exercise can restrict the effects of aging and how it can improve brain function even in old age. He also advocates mental exercise as well as physical to restrain the effects of aging. Finally, the last chapter \\"The Regimen\\" offers advice for starting an exercise habit. It's a useful chapter, as Ratey offers basic tips, such as finding a group to exercise with.<br /><br />Ratey does a fantastic job keepingthe reader interested. The content is divided into ten chapters, as previously stated, and follows a predictable pattern. His writing style is simple and easy to understand. It's not eloquent prose, but it is clear and concise and allows Ratey to deliver his message.  Through his experience as a doctor, Ratey has plenty of stories for every situation. I loved reading how people's lives changed as they simply became more active. The people in the stories were, for the most part, entirely relatable to the average person. The information about case studies and research was explained clearly and simply, so a lay person could easily grasp the meaning and importance of complex interactions and systems. I enjoyed reading this book.
B0015MPIAO|2.0|This highly acclaimed yet sometimes reviled film boasts several impressive assets. Edward Woodward, a highly respected stage actor and alumnus of RADA, lends this work a much needed authenticity with his convincing portrayal of a police inspector in search of a crime. In the course of the movie, the viewer learns about two of his significant character traits: his religious zealotry and his determination to remain a virgin until marriage. These two traits are prominently reflected and contrasted in the depiction of the social milieu of his new environment - one as a counterpart of the devout paganism of the community and the other as an oppositional trait of the island's denizens.<br /><br />Another asset is the breathtaking Scottish scenery which greatly bestows this movie a verisimilitude which can induce the viewer to believe that similar covert societies exist in inaccessible, isolated venues.<br /><br />And finally, the theme of paganism is enriched by explorations of provocative tropes: conformity among all of the island's inhabitants to ensure their continued existence; exclusion of those of divergent beliefs and attitudes; and the megalomania of the island's charismatic autocrat reminiscent of those demagogic leaders of Jonestown and Nazi Germany.<br /><br />But in spite of the aforementioned, this film is vastly disappointing. The direction lacks a tautness necessary to build anticipation and suspense, and certain pagan rituals are choreographed and staged far too tidily without a spontaneity to allow one to suspend disbelief. And it is unfortunate that few other actors rival Woodward's portrayal in complexity and subtlety.<br /><br />It is, however, not regretted that this film was seen - as the persecution of the other to ensure the cohesiveness and longevity of a particular culture is all too prevalent today.
B00B4804KS|2.0|This is about the 3D edition of the movie only, not about the movie itself or previous editions. I have mixed feelings about this particular 3D edition. In geneal, the 3D feeling is not spectacular, yet nice, with rounded edges and lots of volume; but there are flaws. First of all, there's far too much ghosting. Second, and most importantly, Universal has done it again (yes, yet again!!) and has gone too far with the DNR reduction. There is an unfortunate loss of detail (the previous 2D blu-ray edition is much more detailed), all clothes look like they are made of plastic, faces are waxy (especially middle shots, where they look plain ridiculous) and the background vegetation often looks like green jelly. This was in a 55' Sony TV with active glasses; maybe smaller screens or passive glasses with diminish these defects. But most of all, this movie was never intended for 3D, so there are no \\"on-your-face shocking effects\\" or intended use of the environmental 3D either. What was the need of this? Oh, yes, extra cash on a film already sold in many other different formats, of course. Recommended only for hardcore fans of either Jurassic Park or 3D movies...and even so, think about it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This was a very well done series. I literally cannot stop thinking about it, which is why I am giving it five stars. The story, acting, script and directing was very well done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't say enough wonderful things about this series. I have loved every moment. It has brought me to tears several times. Love all the actors and actresses. Their performance is perfect. Can't wait for season 4.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I really enjoyed this single CD.  I loved the song when it came out and loved the music in the movie.  The second song on the CD which is an instrumental version of the song was great to.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The seasons just keep getting better in my eye and are good investments<br /> as well as keeping you laughing along the way
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very much one of my favorite stories.I love every word of it. Wonderful story from EL James. A must read
B001EBWING|5.0|A real 5* movie that will always be a classic!  Two great stars:  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.  I have seen Casablanca numerous times and still watch it every time as though it were the first time. Bogart played many good roles as a villain and both shine in this movie as lovers.  A great story!

B004R2DS9C|4.0|This storage box also opens up into a play mat.  So if you are looking for strictly a storage container this would not be what you are looking for.  However, it is a nice playmat when opened up and sure does expand the young StarWars enthusiasts imagination.  So all in all it was a good purchase as a gift for the intended person.

Frankly, no.<br /><br />The problem of middle class atheists is that for them its about proving how smart they are, and how stupid religious believers are. Some go beyond that, and try to make atheism into a belief system. Or a business. (In the US, many pretend that almost everyone is middle class; I use the term in the sense of the petty bourgeoisie).<br /><br />Dawkins claims that religion is the source of all the problems of the world. He may be a scientific materialist, but he certainly isn't a historical materialist. Religion isn't something eternal written in a book. It's a form that politics and culture take, which is why in different times and different places, these books keep getting reinterpreted. Religion does not exist outside of time and place. It doesn't exist outside of the class struggle. And in that struggle, many with religious beliefs will be on the side of the working class. And those who think they're smarter than everyone else will be on the other side for certain.<br /><br />The Marxist point of view is, as expressed by Marx \\"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\\"<br /><br />A Bolshevik resolution of 1918, said the party must \\"really liberate the working people from religious prejudices. For this purpose it must organize the most widespread scientific education and anti-religious propaganda. It is necessary, however, to take care to avoid hurting the religious sentiments of believers, for this only serves to increase religious fanaticism.\\"<br /><br />Some useful books on religion from a Marxist perspective are: [[ASIN:0486454509 On Religion]]; [[ASIN:1408633205 Religion]]; [[ASIN:0902869930 Foundations of Christianity: A study in Christian origins]]; [[ASIN:0873481348 The Jewish Question: A Marxist Interpretation]]; [[ASIN:0394738225 Muhammad]].<br /><br />I also recommend several books by George Novack: [[ASIN:0873480228 The Origins of Materialism: The Evolution of a Scientific View of the World]]; [[ASIN:087348309X Humanism and Socialism]]; and [[ASIN:0873486056 Understanding History: Marxist Essays]].Muhammad]].<br /><br />I also recommend several books by George Novack: [[ASIN:0873480228 The Origins of Materialism: The Evolution of a Scientific View of the World]]; [[ASIN:087348309X Humanism and Socialism]]; and [[ASIN:0873486056 Understanding History: Marxist Essays]].
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Haven't watched it yet because I just received it.  The stars of the original cast are back and they seem to gell and I look forward to watching it a little later.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|This book has everything you could want to know about homebrewing in it. Gives great in depth details, presented in a way that everyone can understand. Great example walk throughs of different brewing days/recipes. This book is up to date. Originally I was using what he has posted online, but that was written in '96 and the technology and understanding of homebrewing has changed, and with it alot of the details within. BUY IT! Your beer will thank you.
B00ATX7FLA|5.0|Got all twelve for my grandson so he could hang the planets in his bedroom. He enjoyed putting the sets together and then stored them in ziploc containers so we could hang the planets from his bedroom ceiling. You are getting the planet, plus the Lego set.  Great for Star Wars collectors
B002N5N4M6|5.0|For those that have seen this show you know what its about so if i describe this wrong dont flog me.<br /><br />If you havent seen it, why have you not watched this, the casts and story will entertain you for hours and brings<br />out your inner nerd.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series. It has a great script, sets, actors, and photography. It's a great period piece that's fun to watch. I can't wait for the next season!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album is 5 stars great! It's like as if someone has created a great work of fine art and then sprinkle a bunch of crap on it to add attitude. This is not a mainstream catchy/aggressive easy to get rap album, if you want that stop reading right now and don't waste time on this album. If you listen to hip hop just to fit a scene and be cool, stop reading. If you want traditional gangsta rap stop reading. If you want something to bump in your car that sounds catchy and cool stop reading. If you want the old kanye stop reading. If you can't think, stop reading. If you hate modern art museums stop reading. If you want good production with catchy/smart lyrics stop reading.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the most ambitious albums ever produced, perhaps even the greatest. The juxtaposition of intelligent beats, thoughts, samples, lyrics on this album is amazing like a modern work of art in a contemporary art museum. If you are looking for lyrics in a traditional sense: beauty, idealism, deep philosophy, you won't find them here. The lyrics are crude, nasty, immature, angry, \\"seemingly meaningless\\", unideal,manic,crazy, funny, cliche,laughable, silly, witty, aggressive,violent,structureless, arrogant, wild, free, offensive, modern like splashing a bunch of abstract paint onto a canvas. But the lyrics all actually mean something if you dig for it and think about it. They are overlayed on top of a very well thought out production beats made by a team of people. The beats are very experimental, smart and groundbreaking. Its refreshing to see someone say anything they want and get away with it. not alot of people get away with that. The crazy lyrics and intelligent beats push and challenge the listener to new heights, it makes them think and see things in a new height. There are elements of hip hop, industrial techno, dance music, punk rock, soul, jazz,nine inch nails, bjork, daft punk, Rick Rubin and more to this sophisticated album. Yeezus was made no differently thana work of art made in a college art class sitting and critiquing one another until something revolutionary and magical Happens. He's constantly pushing to invent something new. This album must be read as a whole to be understood. As a whole, this album is like an emblem of our society and culture today...it symbolizes the the hearts and souls of the time we live in. There is no other album today that comes remotely close to accomplishing this. Kanye may be a mainstream name, but this is not a mainstream album.<br /><br />Compared to other hip hop albums, this album is innovative, almost revolutionary. There isn't another hip hop album that sounds or feels like it. Not everyone will agree but this album is a metaphor for the young generation now. It captures: the madness of overcrowding, the intelligence of this generation, justified arrogance, the insanity of materialism, the destruction of love, the injustice people face, unfairness in society, the want for truth, the need for justice, the demand for art to move forward, freedom of speech, the fact everything has to be taken with force to truely be owned. The youth is a lot smarter than what they were 10 years ago, a lot angrier and a lot more open and smart about understanding things and art. our generation as a whole has gotten smarter.Old people can't say anything new, this new album speaks in volumes to the new generation of college and fine art minded individuals. This cd will speak to many people who will try to understand it: black people, minorities, the rich, the poor, educated people, college kids, materialistic people, hip hop fans, indie music fans, techno/industrial fans, punk rockers, art snobs, graphic designers, angry kids, music critics, book snobs, hippies, rock kids, jazz and soul fans, fans of innovation, risk takers, famous people, politicians, divorced people,everyday people and more. This album is huge, its like the voice of this generation! It pushes the limits and opens something new to everyone. Years from now music critics will still go back to this album and dissect it, analyze it, teach about it and appreciate it. Critics are already scrambling over it and going crazy over it right now for a good reason! Yeezus must be read and understood on a very metaphorical level and not a literal one. I agree with Kanye on the lyrics \\"I am a God\\". He is a god (of hip hop), an innovator, a fine artist in the hip hop game and is successful at it. He is an artist that forces his viewers to think and demand more. He is the zeitgeist and the voice of this generation even if he is arrogant.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is the missing link of my media viewing experience. I can kick off movies from my Nexus 7, laptop or phone, it was super easy to setup and looks amazing. I fully plan to get another for my bedroom!
B008Y212PI|1.0|I don't know why this app won't function without a connection, but that always makes me wonder if it is spyware.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Im glad the next season is available because im on edge<br />wondering whats going to happen the fruit loops.<br />Woohoo!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I fully enjoy listening to this album. It may not be like his last but it's showing how much he's grown and it shows in his music. This album is just another chapter in his life and I have to say i'm enjoying the ride. I just finished watching his performance on the itunes festival and from what I heard, i'm ready to listen to part 2 of the 20/20 Experience!
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|Great show, sound, image and case, great article for collectors, i really love it, thank you so much for send this to Colombia
B0063GORYU|5.0|I got this app because I love spider solitaire in every shape, way and form.  This is a good relaxing game that I thought my dad how to play.  Now he is totally addicted to the game.
0345803450|4.0|At times I found the book slow to keep my attention  but the end was worth it all.<br />I still think about the fantastic ending which made me love the book.
B0065UF2ZM|5.0|Harry Bosch loves listening to jazz, loves to do his own thing and is selfish but very caring.<br /><br />Harry doesn't sleep but does find the time to eat and to think as he has a murder to solve.<br /><br />This book is about Harry Bosch and it is so very exciting as Harry Bosch needs to solve a number of things which include: Murder, Stolen Radioactive Cesium and Coverups.<br />It is also about the FBI, National Security, Homeland Security, Conflict and Romance.<br /><br />I suggest you start reading this book  early on a Saturday morning as you will not be able to put it down, hopefully you will be able to finish reading it before it is time for you to leave for work on Monday morning.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This gave proves to be both challenging and exciting.  The different levels are enjoyable for myself and my kids. Great addition to my kindle fire apps!
B00006G8G1|5.0|Great show, sound, image and case, great article for collectors, i really love it, thank you so much for send this to Colombia
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a well-made show.  The characters are great and the stories are very unique.  I love to watch and guess what will happen in the end, but it's always a twist.  Very interesting!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I've played other games/puzzles like this, and this one definitely isn't the most difficult or complex, but it is still SUPER fun. Although, the rebels look NOTHING like the puzzles you work out.
B003U51D58|4.0|The last season of lost was all over the place, with time travel and flashbacks and flash forwards and alternate realities... in short, the writers lost their minds. LOL - even with that being the case the episodes were entertaining and everyone was sad see it end.
B006Z21ZEM|5.0|Great show, sound, image and case, great article for collectors, i really love it, thank you so much for send this to Colombia
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 6 yr old and I both have this and enjoy it. It is fast paced yet still easy. You don't need to be spending real money just to get basic quests done.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|.Its fun to play and fairly simple my whole family enjoys. Have played numerous. Angry birds liked this one most
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show! Can't wait for season 3.<br /><br />My only complaint is there were some consistent streaming issues, where the show would pause for several seconds to buffer and would either eventually resume play or I'd have to refresh the browser. This happened across multiple episodes on multiple days, but I never have this problem on hulu or netflix so I know it's not my internet connection speed. It may be an issue with amazon's server?
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|If you can take the gritty in your face drama dealing with guns, drugs, gangs, their dealing with law enforcement.  This show has everything, mc chases/action for the guys, drama for the women.  Character depth and depiction in this show are spot on amazing for law enforcement and the the mc clubs/criminal elements of show.  The actors really pull in the muscle and deliver their characters authentically.  The way the mc club deals with other gangs, similar to politics.  Setting is also realistic depicting the urban decay of our Nor-Cal roadways, and urban buildings.  I just wanna know where all the award nominations are for this show.  Motorcycle Clubs are about the men, but the women in this show really pull their weight, especially Katey Sagal.  I am not into bikes other than the creativity that goes into the custom bikes,  and never thought I would be interested in this show, but it is truly awesome for a TV show.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Hey it's Sunnydale Girl! For a lot of vampire flicks; it's the beginning of the movie and I'm switching the channel saying \\"keep going, not any of Corey's though...even Bordello of Blood...he's my favorite besides Roland and Lily the Mother of all Vampires! And this one has always been not only my favorite movie...but my favorite vampire movie and why I like vampires in the 1st place. So here's my latest review; 1st off; Santa Carla an awesome Vampire town; where I would not only l live on The Boardwalk...but in that cave. Now who would I have as friend? Well 1st Faith from Buffy would be my older sister (I usually get to be Star in the flick, and she would date Kiefer leading to the end of the movie...now I'm sure if you've read my reviews you'd think I would just be on Edgars side; but that's not entirely true. I'd also wanna be on the vampires side like in Twilight; not only do I have all those I'd be Bella and Vampires on the good and Evil side I really like Bad ass villains.) So I'd go to the comic book store and Faith would be like you're chasing that guy aint us..admit it you're chasing him.....and later we'd help take some of the vampires down...but I could be some 2.....I just like both sides...and my husband is even writing some vampires everywhere and death to all vampires comics...this movie is in fact one of the reasons we met....it's pretty cool when you can fall in love over your favorite movies about vampires, try it people it rocks! And we love the fight scenes in the end...Death by stereo....Try holy water death breath....Awesome Monster Bashers, and the attack of Eddie monster...and one more thing (but I changed this line a while back) one thing about living in Santa Carla I always did like...all the damn vampires.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|good game, nice game play options and more characters to selections then the first angry birds star wars, keeps getting better.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Who wouldn't love Nemo?  It's great to have kids or grandkids and have excuses to see movies like this one.

Your gonna feel it, and won't be disappointed.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a great app.  It's drills are fun and help build language skills in a natural way. It doesn't seem like work, but reinforces the skills regularly so they stick with you better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series. I really enjoyed watching it. Now I have to wait for the next one to come out next season.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|The movie had a strong first half, with the story but did not go far enough in depth of the reason or culture behind magicians.  All in all worth a watch
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great premise:  what if super powered folks really exist, but they are ALL evil?  That's where the story opens up at - what follows is a crazy ride, with many twists.  Reminiscent of Matrix in many ways, I felt.
B00FB6FOEU|5.0|What's great about the internet is that I was able to listen to all of these songs well before the record store opens this morning. What sucks about the webs is that I have already heard the whole album. Thank you, Joan, for allowing us to record tons of material at live shows. The album versions are a little tame now that I've listened to the live versions for months.<br /><br />Haven't listened to the vinyl yet, so I can't comment on the alternate versions of \\"Any Weather\\" or \\"Different\\". Here's my break down.<br /><br />1. Any Weather (606 version)<br />This was written by Dave Grohl. The vocals are nice. Fans won't be disappointed.<br />2. TMI<br />On each of the Black Hearts' records, there are a few throwback tracks that seem like they would have fit better on an older album (like \\"Insecure\\" on Pure & Simple). The music on this track has an old-school vibe.<br />3. Soulmates to Strangers<br />This was written by Laura Jane Grace. This is the second most Joan Jett song on the album. You'll see.<br />4. Make it Back<br />Definitely the most Joanest Jettest track on the album. Listen to the guitar, no one else could have written this song. I love it.<br />5. Hard to Grow Up<br />One of her less bubble-gum, more emo songs. The guitar is nice.<br />6. Fragile<br />Flows well after the previous track. It seems like Joan really likes this one, so I'm trying to like the keyboards.<br />7. Reality Mentality<br />This and TMI are the throw backs. If you close your eyes, you can imagine that this is Patti Rasnick singing for The Hunnz.<br />8. Bad as We Can Be<br />Haven't decided on this one yet. It's the filler.<br />9. Different<br />Can't believe she didn't put this on Glorious Results... Just saying.<br />10. Everybody Needs a Hero<br />No spoilers. You have decide for yourself on this one. It is unexpected.<br /><br />The whole album flows pretty well. A little something for everyone. It is clear that Joan really likes a lot of these tracks and that makes the albumfn great. If you're a fan, you will love it. If you're not a fan, well it's just silly that you read my whole review, and I hope you like the record anyway.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by a very good friend (also a nerd).  His words were, &#34;Get ready for crack in book form.&#34;  I'm not kidding, and he was right.  I couldn't put my Kindle down until I'd finished it.<br /><br />You can get a plot synopsis elsewhere.  As a nerd, what I loved about this book was how lovingly Cline has woven together innumerable references to the geek subculture.  This includes classic video games, '80s film, anime, music, and a host of other things.  If you are a geek and a child of the '80s, you will fall in love with this book.<br /><br />I only have two complaints about the book, and both of them stem from Cline's writing needing a bit of tightening up.  For one thing, I thought that one of the big reveals of the book, the identity of one of the protagonist's close online friends, was a bit predictable.  I can't say more than that without spoilers.<br /><br />My other complaint is in Cline's inability to properly build suspense.  Some good editing would have worked wonders here, but as it is, there are several times in the book where the plot is very clearly leading to a huge climax fraught with danger and peril only for the protagonist to relatively easily navigate through the dangers with little to no harm and his plan having worked out perfectly.  As outstanding as the book is otherwise, these few instances make for a bit of some mini anti-climaxes throughout.<br /><br />However, those are honestly minor complaints.  This was one of those rare books where I was genuinely sad when it was over.  You know how sometimes you read something so good that you kind of mope around for a few days after you've finished it because you know you can never read it for the first time again?  This is one of those books.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this app nearly every night while falling asleep. It is a great sleep aid. A great sleep aid.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At first it was difficult to keep up with all the characters, but after a little while couldn't put it down.
B0000AM6IY|2.0|Movie is one of my favorites. For this reason, i did not rate it lower - Quality of the film is not the best. For the price, it was o.k.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This film is quite an achievement, mixing elements of Craig's previous two Bond films and making, finally, a perfect entry into the franchise. The movie is full of homages to previous Bond films, but Skyfall's story is exciting and original enough that these references do not overshadow the film as a whole.6/5 stars-truly excellent.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I want my money back because it takes too much room that I can't install it.And I &quot;want my money back right now!&quot;
B002KGEORM|5.0|This show has got me caught up. I watched the entire season 2 in a weekend. Now on to season 3!
B004EPYZUS|3.0|Good story but same as the other &#34; Mission Impossible's &#34;If you have nothing else to do, perhaps like a rainy day type of movie ...
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Overall, an excellent soundtrack. Some pieces are forgettable, but the overall tone reminds me of the soundtracks to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy (same composer, after all).And the final track? Flat-out awesome.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Forget g g g f2f trust that the Bible says that the population of you are not polish and newspapers in the Bible says that the population of you are not polish and newspapers in the Bible says that the population top.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|LOVE this show it is so addicting. I am not one that usually goes for this kind of show... brutality and motorcycles, but this is so well written and the characters just &#34;drag you in&#34;. On season 4 now, can not wait to see what changes in characters 5 and 6 bring.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I have always been and always will be a favorite fan of Grey's Anatomy.. Just the story lines keeps you wanting more...
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A very exiting book that is hard to put down. Not hard to follow along what is going on, so I would recommend this book to anyone if you like this genre or not. Read this book all the way to the end! Some of my friends who have a short attention spans, didn't like this book, then LOVED it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good read!  One of the best Mitch Rapp escapades. I will miss Vince Fynn stories in the future. Thank you!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Its interactive nature is someing really different and unique. The author is also hilarious!<br />Great read!
B004LWZW8I|3.0|same sort of story like the Titans, Rainy day type of movie or if you have not anything better to do ..
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I did not get to see Fringe when it originally aired because I did not get this channel.  A friend told me about it and I started watching it on Amazon Prime.  This is an awesome series and it definitely reminds me of X-Files.  Love the insider references too.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Both the human and feline aspects of the book are heartwarming. I also have a more sympathetic view of the homeless now.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Very funny and family friendly movie. It tells the age old struggle between parent and child of trying to be your own person while still maintaining a relationship with each other. It reminded me of my own daughter.
B00005JM20|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Rowan Atkinson in his role as the famous mime: Mr. Bean. But on a recent trip to a local thrift store, I found a VHS version of the movie: Johnny English and I am so glad I decided to buy it!<br /><br />What a treat this movie was, from start to finish.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson is soooo funny. I can't remember laughing that much, in a long, long time. I felt great afterwards. A stress-buster of the very best kind.<br /><br />This is family entertainment at it's best.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />Read my full review at: myreallifereviews dot com
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Multiple plots seem to go everywhere and every which way without any end.  I kept reading books hoping on some kind of ending on one or more plots.  Seems to be never ending stories.
0761169253|4.0|Two thumbs up for this author depositing long overdue insights and a paradigm shift into this readers psyche.  Thank you Mr. Kleon!
B008M87GJK|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire and it works GREAT. Pictures representing stories come up in categories you request.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|its easy to do and challenging..it's a great quick game and I would recommend it to my friends..keep up the good work
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|Installed as directed! Did not work - I still cannot use Flash!! I Would not recommend this application to anyone!
B00821OX98|4.0|Some of  the early episodes are a little cheesy,  but it picks up after like the 4th episode.  pretty good consider the limited violence and somewhat pg13  feel.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Breaking bad still beats it hands down but now I'm hooked on this show. Great acting and plot. I would recommend it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great plot and character development. One of the beat shows of the past couple years. A must see tv show.
1401216676|5.0|Amazing simply Amazing love the killer joke that was said. Couldn't be better. I absolutely admired the beautiful art work of the story
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|This is actually a pretty good scifi movie. The main problem is the script places too much on the kid,played by Will Smith's son and he's just not upto such a heavy burden. This would have worked much better if they switched roles. The kid should have been injured in the ship with Will Smith out there searching. It's a little like Oblivion with humans trying to survive on a hostile earth.
B007EDYN36|3.0|If you are a Kiss fan, this book by Peter Criss provides some insights of his years and struggles with the band.
0765348276|5.0|I read this book when it was first published, and I must say that I highly recommend it to all us sci-fi fans. Even if you aren't a fan, give it a try. It's well written with characters that are both fun and interesting. There is plenty of action and twists, but all that is easy to follow. This is actually the first of a trilogy, so you must read this before the others. Mr. Scalzi leads us through a book worthy of praise.
1451675046|3.0|This book reads like it was written for 12 year olds, very simplistic and basic. Not at all what I expected.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game. only drawback you have to post constantly to score the game tickets. I really like that I can play offline though. it keeps me entertained.thank you for the free game. I don't have Internet in my home so this is one of the few games that I can play dailey
B001EBV0OY|5.0|the story line, the acting, its just beautiful, I seen it 5 times already, every time I watch it, I can always find something new
B000Q79HS8|4.0|Matt Damon, once again, puts in a solid performance in this exciting spy espionage plot<br />movie. His performance makes you feel what the character is going through, as he<br />desperately weaves his way through a maze of exciting plot points.<br /><br />The movie, really makes you want to see the last film in the series, Bourne Ultimatum.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A great  mix of hidden object, adventure, and puzzle solving.  I really enjoy Big Fish games. Three dollars is a good price for the quality of these games.
1476733953|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's a gripping read and a wonderful first book for a new author who, I think, is well worth following.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is the only thing keeping me going, keeping me truly alive. That should be enough of a review.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Lots of fun and adventures. Really really good. Of you have not read it, you should read it. I would definitely recommend it.:)
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|My hubby and I watch a lot of movies and were running out of good action-packed family movies to watch. The trailer looked so good, but we have found that sometimes the trailer has all of the good parts and the rest of the movie is quite boring. This movie actually lived up to the excitement of the trailer. If you are into this genre of movie, then I think you will not be disappointed. So I definitely would recommend it.
B0061QD88S|5.0|DVD was brand new as was the cover. It plays perfectly. And I am so glad to have it. One of , if not THE Best Heartfelt Warm Movie in the Disney collection.  The colors , the characters and the animation brilliant.  A FEEL GOOD MOVIE!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It's the best game because i love this kind of games and i can play it everywhere it s just awesome
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love to occupy myself while I am watching TV and this game is so much fun and allows you to play, pause to watch, and then play again.  While the concept is simple, it continues to be challenging with each time you play.  I happen to be retired, but I would recommend to anyone.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Of course I give it 5 stars.  I love this album for what it represents to the band and the fans.  The remix is so great even though I never had an issue with the original mix.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|IT'S THE FIRST TIME I GOT  THIS TO WORK ON MY DEVICE.  I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER. I HAD TO PASS ON SOME THINGS BEFORE BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE IT.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun game. Each level gets more challenging which keeps my interest. Great for whole family, all ages are able to enjoy this game. Highly recommended.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|This game is awesome! Don't listen to the second review, cause he just hates sonic. This game is finally on kindle! I've been waiting so long for it to come out  so I can race my friends. Get this app now! Rated Everyone, that's what it's rated on xbox. SOOOOOOOOOOOO EPIC!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes the sex was out of this world, but the emotions are more what this book was for me. It w written wonderfully!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|When I bought the album I had already been hooked on &#34;My Songs Know What You Did In the Dark (Light Em Up)&#34; its a catchy tune with an interesting music video. From track one (The Phoenix) the strong hook of the instrumental element of this song is amazing especially when you're playing it in the car with all windows down. Track six (The Mighty Fall, feat. Big Sean) is in my top three favorite from this album. The lyrics and the added versus from Big Sean makes this song great. Track 11 (Save Rock and Roll, feat Elton John) is my top favorite. Come on!! An awesome band like Fall Out Boy with the added greatness that is Sir Elton is just mind blowing.<br /><br />Save Rock N Roll in its entirety is a new revamped sound for Fall Out Boy. They've evolved as have their fans but with tracks like &#34;Where did the Party Go&#34; reminding me of the early days of the band. This isn't a departure from who they are, just evolving into greatness. I'm just glad Fall Out Boy is back again with an awesome album. This album is meant to be listening in a large open space or as previously stated in your car with the windows down.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a very challenging, addictive and fun game! If you like challenges than this is a game for you.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I like everything  about it . If u Don't have  it  your missing out on a really fun game
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love this. So many fun and interesting things to watch.  Never a dull moment.  Every day I love this Kindle more and more.
B008Y6SLL2|5.0|This is a good depiction of what brought down the financial market a few years ago. It is still happening!
B000001FKY|5.0|This album is both very well produced and contains some of the best music composition of the group. However, it's almost as if the band purposely combined both efforts to satisfy/ensure more radio play across the FM radio station formats. The song &#34;Hysteria&#34; clearly found popularity with AOR and trendy pop/dance stations. Overall, I like this CD because the songs bring back many good memories from an adventurous period of my life.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is so much fun .love it and fun for all ages .love the fact not bombarded with ads. This is definitely a five star game.
B006QV30JU|5.0|What can I say about this movie that can do it justice? Nothing actually, it's just a wonderful warm hug. Is it the best musical ever? No. Is it Mr. Kelly's best? No. It's just beautiful, romantic, whimsical, fun. Enjoy it with your family.
B0084670FU|5.0|Fear of terrorism and ordinary life mistakes collide in a very interesting way. I liked how the different settings were set up separately and then come together at the end.
B0006GANN2|5.0|Gene Hackman gives a great performance without overdoing it. In other words, he plays the character of Popeye Doyle with great zeal without smothering the contributions of fellow cast members (Tom Cruise, you REALLY need to watch this movie and  take a lesson from Mr. Hackman).  Gene plays the part so well, you can sense his determination; you can feel his shivering as he is tailing the elusive suspect; and you can feel his frustration and fatigue with the loses he suffers as he pursues his antagonist. A great film from the 70's!!!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game is addicting it is so fun it can repeat a little but it is still extremely fun so get it
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game. You can't actually go wrong with solitaire. It follows all the rules, allows you to pick your type of deals, whether you want to undo a card and keeps track to your points.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was the best book ever<br />I loved it it just catches your attention<br />It is a great book you'll love it
