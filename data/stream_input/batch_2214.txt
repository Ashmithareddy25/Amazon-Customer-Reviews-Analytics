B0085KGHI6|4.0|Recorded live at the Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago in 1981, this is a lot of fun even though there are far too many musos on the stage at any given time.  Cameramen had a nightmare trying to capture it but they did pretty well.  Some great guitar work from Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods but also from John Primer.  Muddy Waters was only on stage for about 50% of the performance, but it was enhanced by some input from Buddy Guy, Junior Wells and Lefty Dizz.  It has taken a lot of years for it to be released and I can understand why. Interesting performance but lacking formality.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Heard people talk about this game. Have enjoyed playing it.  Has helped passed to some of these cold Wesstern NY winter days and evenings!
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Every single movie I see of MR. Scott Adkins is an exciting martial arts entertainment. I can positively say that he always puts on a good fight in almost all of his action movies like NINJA, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER DAY OF RECKONING, THE EXPENDABLES 2, and my all time favorites UNDISPUTED 3 REDEMPTION and UNDISPUTED 2 LAST MAN STANDING opposite his opponent Michael Jai White. Scott is one of the TOP best martial arts kickboxers that I have seen yet and I'm sure he has to do a lot of intense training everyday to strive to be ONE of the best. KEEP ON FIGHTING ADKINS, YOU DO IT WITH STYLE!!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Fits into and matches my Vera Bradly cover perfectly.  I would reccomend this item to others that have a Kindle Fire HD.
0345803493|5.0|Read all 3 books.... couldn't put the book down!  I hope E. L. James writes a 4th book!  Great read!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have the weather channel on my computer, but love having it on my Kindle Fire. Can check in on the weather where ever I have WIFI.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|A great app but needs a different looking and moving controls and you need to be able to play longer
0452295548|5.0|This is a phenomenal book. My wife experienced a stroke 6 months ago. She seems to share many similarities with the author, and of course there are several differences.<br /><br />From this book I have learned GREATLY how to be with my beloved wife, how to respect her when she is sleeping and healing, and how to be continually encouraging and hopeful both within myself and with her. This book will open doors for you, and I pray for the medical community to continue delve into the deep Mystery that is a Stroke and the human brain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS AWESOME!!!!! My Horse is fun to play! Please play this awesome game. You will enjoy it.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Though the story doesn't move you along like some of De Mille's others this is definitely a well crafted and interesting story taking place in the Middle East. De Mille has done his homework concerning the customs and culture of the area and wove this background seamlessly into his story. I would strongly recommend that De Mille's two &#34;Lion&#34; books be read before tackling &#34;The Panther&#34; as they are all connected.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This series has to be one of the best done on cable. It has action, fast moving and changes direction quickly. It keeps one's interest.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|they came in on time, brand new in box. GREAT value and would definatly purchase from this source again in the future
B00181JGI2|5.0|This is a true classic and goto movie like Top Gun, Monty Python's Search For The Holy Grail, Conan, Flash Gordon, Ace Ventura, Star Wars, and any other movie you never get tired of watching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down. I really recommend it to everyone. Can't wait to start reading book three. Awesome
B00B2064IY|5.0|This is a great glimpse into what could/would have been.  He is playing in genres different from the normal radio play tunes.<br /><br />This is a great rockin album.  Good buy.  I got it for less than $7usd.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love Love Love the book series.  Like lots of ladies, this has certainly peaked my interest in things I hadnt thought of before. It is worth the read for sure.
034580404X|5.0|The best set of books I think I've ever read so far!  If u like kinky, romance, love stories I would definitely recommend that u read these books, u will not be disappointed!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book I loved it every bit of the way from the first word to the last it was great
0062238868|4.0|Informative read. Purchased this book for teenage grandsons to read.  Appreciate a man of such dedication and skill who chooses to stand for the values of this country.  Chris Kyle chose to protect the ideals of the USA  through the cost of war.  His own death happened as he was reaching out to help a fellow soldier.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three books. Wonderful read, I have not read thru these many books in such a short time as I did with these. A great romantic, sexy story. Thank you E L James.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I was able to get this game as a &quot;So called FAOTD&quot; as such I was expecting as well as tnhinking by downloading such a large file that I was getting the full game. However it seems EVERYTIME G5 entertainment put one of there games up as the FAOTD they mislead us by making it seem as if we are getting a full game. However it seems time and again after downloading a large file from G5 that when its booted up and you play it and it starts getting fun they inform you after your IN TO the game it stops dead and like so many other so called &quot;FAOTD&quot; offers all your really getting is the FREE demo you can get anytime. Its at about 13-23 minutes into the game your joy with the game comes to a screeching halt, at which time it not only asks for a &quot;GOOD REVIEW&quot; it also asks/expects you to buy the &quot;Full Game&quot; with real world money. Which seems to me to be total B.S. to me, being it was offered as a full game for free through the FAOTD offer. This is a VERY common practice of G5 Entertainment when one of there games is the free app of the day. So if you want this title just buy it. Because the FAOTD is just a scam to get yup into the game just enough to hope you buy it. Pass on G5 games offered as a free app of the day.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers was one of the movies where I immediately thought &#34;I should get that!&#34; during the movie. Well thought out, filled with amazing fighting sequences and definitely shows the time and effort they took just to make this. There's some good humor as well, most coming from Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.).<br /><br />The 4 disc combo ain't half bad either. 3D was very immersive and the normal Blu-ray/DVD were great too! This also came with the iTunes version of the movie, which should have been very impressive to the rest of the Amazon shoppers out there (I'm fond with UltraViolet/Flixster, but others not so much).<br /><br />If you're a fan of superhero movies, this is a must buy!
B000001A3H|4.0|I got into Kyuss sort of late in my life and I regret it. But I am so glad I bought this album. It was priced well and still playing hard.
1602839158|5.0|If you like books on CD, then this is a good book to get. Very interesting stories that all connect with one another.
B0009FTXGI|4.0|The lens hood works great for what I use it for. The only downfall I have noticed about this product is that it can sometimes be a little tricky too screw on and can come off fairly easy. Also if you try to put it on in reverse to store it with the lens, it will not attach.
0307970299|5.0|If you like books on CD this is a great one to listen too. Cheryl Strayed writes her story to make the listener feel as if they are there on the trail.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really like this series, I wish it was on all the time and I wish they would show it it America the same time as in Britain.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this app. I saw the movie and loved it, so when I saw the add for this app, I was just like, WOW! I just had to get it! this app is entertaining and really fun. its also just like the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|funa fun game that makes the thime go by.i just started but im sure i i will be playing for a while i dont like all the facebook links and likes I just want to play the game not share it all the rimmed.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I was looking for a different style mahjong. this was deleted after my first game. the tiles were small and difficult to differentiate.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|But I love running in this game! Oh,and the jumping, and the sliding, and the mine carts... I also like getting to earn extra characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should get subway suffers its better than temple run its also a fast pace game when it gets fast you have to be quick to jump and slide
B007REV4T8|5.0|The reason I liked it BEST of ALL the Daniel Craig Bond films is they put the &#34;Dry&#34; British wit back into the Bond Films!  That is why I really enjoyes this film!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|It's a rolling good time. It will keep you playing all night long. It's a great time waster. Good fun.
B003V9OCIS|4.0|The acting was done with typical German workmanship precision.<br />The movie was about a fascinating subject. One very familiar to me.<br />The realism afor subtitles.nd photography conveyed the fearsome nature of the cimb and the Eiger.<br />The lack of a 5 star rating from me was due only because of the need
B004LWZWGA|5.0|... and I like batman. So I write positive review!<br /><br />Though, please, someone get Christian Bale a cough drop... or Chloraseptic... or a priest. That voice has got to hurt after this film.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game will keep you entertained for those short bursts of time when you need something to keep you busy, yet it is enjoyable enough to play in long stretches. GLU hit again with this one. I admit that I played this game enough to warrant paying for some upgrades. I don't mind though, as GLU games don't feel like mobile games, they have high quality, good production values, and I know there's some depth to the experience. If you're on the border about this game, why not download it? You can do so for free! Just be careful, Samurai Zombie battles can be addicting!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Amazing ending to a gripping trilogy! Couldn't put my kindle down until I knew the ending. It was definitely not the ending I expected either. These books were fantastic. Now I can't wait to see the rest played out on the big screen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is afn game. can't put it down.<br />l like it a lot. it seams I can't get enough of it.<br />need to play some more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for horse lovers wished it had more competition options and a faster sever Love this game keeps me entertained
B0090O07RS|4.0|I would have given this a rating of 5 stars, but we have an audio issue.  I haven't seen anyone else mention it, so I thought I would.  When I play the disc in my Sony blu ray, which is connected to an LG TV that is connected to an LG sound bar, it starts out fine.  I have music on the menu screen, audio with the extras, but when I play the concert, there is no audio.  If I turn off the sound bar and turn on the TV speakers, we then have sound.  I called LG, who told me to call Sony, who tried to help me, but to no avail.  I've updated the blu ray firmware, but still no audio.  I gave the disc to my brother to try it on his set up.  Worked fine.  We have played many movies, and we've played other concert discs, and had no problems.  It's just a problem with this disc, and only a problem with the concert footage.  Very strange, but I thought it might be worth mentioning.
B0091THRCU|1.0|I bought this and soon it started to wear and show the cheap quality. I don't recommend to anyone! Don't buy!
B00AHXDECG|4.0|My favorite for the whole album is \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" for that pop catchy tune! It gets you dancing!!! My second favorite for the sweet bleeding ballad is \\"When I Was Your Man.\\" You can feel his pain and regret. In an interview, he describes himself as bleeding and he does!!! It cuts to the core of your soul and makes you feel as though you are living his pain. The lyrics are awesome. Finally, a nice sweet melody that is smoothe like honey is \\"Moonshine.\\" The chorus is very similar to Heartbeat by Don Johnson except that Heartbeat has a more rock feel. \\"Moonshine\\" combines the two together for a more smoothe feel. He takes you away with the lyrics, very smart!!! I would also say that \\"Young Girls\\" is an honorable mention but didn't make my personal collection cut. The rest of the album is ok.

B00280LYHS|5.0|It was an entertaining thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. I have read it multiple times. It is one of my favorite books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app crashes every now and then, but I'm just happy to have a Pinterst app. Using an original Kindle Fire.<br /><br />UPDATE: The recent versions of this app have worked very well for me. No more crashing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is an amazing game and really fun! I recommend it! I'm on it almost twenty-four seven. Get this app I mean come on it's free and it's fun.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I have been looking for a good calculator app for a while now but they generally had extensive permissions, app size or ads. This has none of those things. I am thrilled that I won't need to get a different calculator even if I decided to take Math classes or tutor a High Schooler. But for myself I generally need a calculator for budgeting and price comparisons. Being able to see my previous answers is a luxury I haven't enjoyed before. The calculator is intuitive and easy to use. I can't wait to use it more!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE BUT THIS IS FAR BETTER THAN A . M OVIE WILL EVER BE I JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!
B008LFY6NI|5.0|It keeps both the little ones and big ones occupied for a few minutes at least. The game offers different shapes, and you can share your artwork, although, I don't think there is an option to save it (not that you need it!).  It really is a cool little game, you pick a shape (circle, flower, etc) and spin it with your finger, then select colors to 'paint' on there.  It gives you the option to buy more shapes, animals and other options, but you don't really need them. It would have been nice if they were already included, but it's still good as it is. Its worth the $2, but I don't think it will keep anyone occupied for over 15 or 20 minutes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I wish it stays a game for ever. If u guys delete it ill die that's how awesome it is.
B003TTZT5A|5.0|THE PRODUCTION ON THIS RECORDING IS PURE,CLEAN,AND VERY WELL RECORDED. NICE VINYL PACKAGE AND IF YOUR A METALLICA FAN OR NOT ITS WORTH ADDING TO YOUR COLLECTION.SOUND IS SO CLEAR NO NOISE BETWEEN TRACKS AND WHEN MUSIC GOES DOWN AND SINGING COMES UP SOUND LIKE THEY R RIGHT IN ROOM A+
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I've never been huge into classics. And often I don't finish them. But this book is easy to understand, and I cried tears of joy! It teaches the importance of family. Never have I read a book so chock full of Good advice! Everyone must read and read to your children!
B009NYF2ES|4.0|This is my second copy I'm purchasing since the first one was washed out and almost blurred for HD, but it was an earlier edition.<br />This one on Blue -ray is much better, almost as good as my old VHS, this one is from 2013.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you are or have read a number of John Grisham books you will enjoy the intrigue and twist and turns of The Rackteer. A fast read as his style dictates and his character descriptions allow the reader to be fully engaged. My favorite Grisham book is still The Broker, a wonderful story set in his new location in northern Italy.
0345803485|1.0|I ordered it just to see what all the hype was about.  I am surprised it is so widely available as I consider it practically porn!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Exciting, emotional, suspenseful, and romantic. I loved it, especially the little twist at the end. Very well written. Looking forward to watching the movie now.
B00BHU2A7I|2.0|The scriptwriters must be running out of ideas and subjects in Hollywood. I wonder how many of today's audience members have even heard of Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma.<br /><br />The story is all really conjecture with no one to support or deny it. This is basically a the story of a man and a woman for whom the passion has gone out of their marriage. Well, nothing lasts forever. He thinks she's cheating on him and he is jealous. She dislikes the fact that he is sexually attracted to his leading ladies. Well, the women tend to be young, glamourous actresses. This is an elderly couple. Wouldn't it be natural?<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins, complete with rubber nose and padding, neither looks nor sounds anything like Alfred Hitchcock. Helen Mirren looks nothing like Alma. Imelda Staunton in THE GIRL is a much closer match and Imelda's restrained performance strikes me as much closer to the real woman than Mirren's histrionics.<br /><br />The Movie if full of innacuracies and spends very little time discussing the making of the movie. Most of the movie is speculation about the Hitchcock's marriage.<br /><br />Here's an example: When they are photographing Marion's flight in the car, the vehicle shown is a light blue 1955 Ford Tudor (2 doors) sedan. Did anybody bother to screen PSYCHO before they set up this shot? Marion left town in a 1955 Ford, but it was a FORDOR (4 doors) sedan in BLACK.<br /><br />The famous \\"gray\\" dress in the original B&W movie was really light blue, according to Rita Riggs who was the wardrobe director. In this recreation, the dress has gone back to dark grey.<br /><br />I didn't get all the references to Ed Gein. I don't believe Hitch was obsessed with Gein. He knew he was \\"only making a movie\\".<br /><br />I liked Scarlett Johanson as Janet Leigh. Scarlett doesn't have Janet's classical beauty, but she has a earthy sexiness, and Janet is shown as a sweet girl, which she was in real life. Jessica Biel, who plays the elegant Vera Miles is strikingly gorgeous and a good choice for the part, but has little to do. The actor who plays Anthony Perkins will make you do a double take, but he only has about two lines of dialogue.<br /><br />I find it telling that the credits name all the people standing around the set as to who plays what participant in PSYCHO, even when they have no dialogue, yet never once do you hear or see the name PATRICIA HITCHCOCK! Ms. Hitchcock, if you will remember, had the supporting part of Caroline, Marion's co-worker at the real estate office. I'd love to know what Pat thinks of this movie. It can't be anything good.<br /><br />Meanwhile, read the book: ALFRED HITCHCOCK AND THE MAKING OF PSYCHO.<br /><br />If you purchase PSYCHO, THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION, you will find an excellent documentary about the making of PSYCHO containing interviews with Janet Leigh, Assistant Director Hilton Greene and Screenwriter Joseph Stefano, among others. This documentary contains all you need to know about the making of PSYCHO from inception to completion.<br /><br />It's much better than this silly self-indulgent picture.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, Toby Jones and Imelda Staunton are head and shoulders better than Hopkins and Mirren as the Hitchcocks in THE GIRL, even if the story is not.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was amazed by this book. It made me cry and laugh so many times. Such a wonderful story. I was left wanting more.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I really wanted to play this game but it has too many invasive permissions. I don't think the game needs to look at my phone calls or contacts. Oh well...
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The game is fun but the time is terrible. Give us more time! Give us more time! Give us more TIME!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing series, amazing acting, amazing plot, amazing graphics. I NEED 12 more words to complete this review O M F G
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This is a somewhat predictable guy friends tale with a twist, one of the friends is a teddy bear to has been wished to life.
B004V45YBG|5.0|Wonderful to read such an easy and complex (yes, at the same time!) style -- lots of smiles are promised here!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game. i love the graphics i love the sounds its just amazing. i love all thethings you can do on it also
B008645YEE|3.0|I finally bought this after months of negative reviews about the quality, thinking that it couldn't be that bad.<br />It is.<br />The sound made me change the Equalizer to a less dynamic setting due to the sudden volume changes within the recording. That being said, it turns out the the 2 pieces of music I wanted were included..but those are the only tracks I play. Fortunately, the Selina Kyle/Catwoman piece is quiet across the bass/mid range/treble so it (at least)sounds ok. Buyer beware.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this one. I just can't seem to find a good horse game in here. This was just the thing that I was looking for.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I really enjoyed Eleanor Porter's &#34;Pollyanna Grows Up&#34;.  I loved the Disney &#34;Pollyanna&#34; movie when I was younger and did not realize that Ms. Porter had written a different and wonderful sequel to the story.  I also discovered that the Disney version changed some things from Ms. Porter's original story (not very shocking, I know).  I really enjoyed reading this story and the ease with which I could take my Kindle with me anywhere.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Much better than the first book :) although the last paragraph was a bit weird don't u think? I can't wait to read the third book
B008NMT684|3.0|My 2 year old played with it a bunch and enjoyed it very much. Thanks guys for a great product.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Based on other reviews on this game, I was skeptical. But, after trying multiple times to download, with each attempt kicking me back to the app list, I have to say it JUST DOESN'T WORK on the Kindle Fire. Fix it for Fire compatibility and I may change my opinion.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My 2 year old played with it a bunch and enjoyed it very much. Thanks guys for a great product.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|I loved this album. I had respect for Jack White's talent, but had never purchased an album, or paid much attention to him... UNTIL I watched &#34;It Might Get Loud&#34;. This brilliant film opens with Jack &#34;building&#34; an electric guitar. I was immediately intrigued.<br /><br />I purchased this album after hearing 'I'm Shakin'' and watching the video. Still one of the best songs on the album, but I love 'Love Interruption' and 'Freedom at 21'. They showcase Jack's amazing talent, and I was thrilled that these are the 2 songs he chose to perform during the Grammys. I admire a musician who continually challenges himself and refuses to conform to the demands of mainstream pop music.<br /><br />If you loved The White Stripes, Jack will not disappoint you with Blunderbuss.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My 2 year old played with it a bunch and enjoyed it very much. Thanks guys for a great product.
B00284BMBM|4.0|Bought this for my Son , & then wished that I had kept it for myself !  Buy it you'll like it !
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun! Great graphics, fun games and many interaction opportunities make this an app I would definitely recommend for others! It's one of the few games of its kind that doesn't require you to spend money to enjoy it nor does it harass you for money every 5 minutes. It could use more competition options though.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|My Friend & Neighbor loves David Cook.  I thought it would make a great Birthday gift .  I was right !  She was very Happy ~~~~
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Loved the story between two sides that had different missions.  Love the part years later where they get to meet each other.
0316228532|3.0|Another Harry Potter fan who hoped this new novel would be a step up or at least sideways in terms of storytelling.<br /><br />I find it hard to characterize my feelings about this book because the story was gripping (more than I expected, given other reviews and the subject matter) but so many of the characters were just awful people...and there was almost no hope or light of any kind in this tale; the Dementors had already visited this sorry little village. In the end, you could definitely sense that JK Rowling was settling some old scores.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read.  Puts a whole new spin on the war other then what the new media showed. God bless Chris and his family.
0060853972|5.0|This book was marvelous from start to finish, and marked the beginning of my journey - which took several years - into other Terry Pratchett (Discworld) and Neil Gaiman books. I need to read it again, more slowly, and look up some of the references which were a little vague to me (I got a lot of them, but not all). As the other reviewers have said: this book is a poke in the eye (and thus those who cannot allow some humor into their religious outlook will probably find it offensive), but I found it one delivered with a grin and some of the sharpest satire in the book world.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|More than 20 years but still sounds so fresh. Use your Illusion 1 and 2 both created magic. Their best work
0385341008|5.0|I am so sick of &#34;popular&#34; books where the main characters are incredibly unlikable, and the story leaves you drained and hopeless. This book is the opposite - read it when you want to reside in a less complicated and more beautiful place, but with plenty of heart, humor, difficulty and humanity in all its splendor (the good, the bad and the ugly). Be prepared to put it down and hug yourself and recommend it to all your friends and neighbors.
B00B5LJ5NG|5.0|What makes this book special is, for one thing, her terrific writing. But also her perspective. This is not Mighty Woman, Watch Her Hike. And it's not in the comic vein of Bill Bryson's &#34;Walk in the Woods,&#34; though there's plenty comic in it. She was not even a serious hiker, and set out only because a guidebook on the trail caught her fancy at a time when her life was falling apart on various fronts. She was woefully unprepared, pack too big, boots too small, and planning wildly unrealistic. But she stuck with it, through a series of bizarre adventures and setbacks. But again, it's a unique mix of determination and randomness, all told brilliantly. By the end it's a truly powerful hymn to the value of her adventure.
B0082POM2W|5.0|Interesting story, it kept me entertained throughout the novel. I cared for the main characters and enjoyed the historical detail. Not your usual Stephen King story, which is probably why I liked it. I'm not much of a horror fan.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I'm a big fan of Boogie Nights and Magnolia so I was hopeful I would enjoy The Master.  However, it was really disappointing.  I saw the big problem as being Joaquin Phoenix's character.  I don't know whether it was his performance or the way his character was written, but Freddie seemed such a zero that it was impossible to construct a story around him.  There are some imaginative scenes in the film but that doesn't make for an overall narrative which can carry a film.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my three year old son loves this game but too many pop ups. he loves to feed an give his horse treats just like he does here on are farm. this is a lovely game for almost any age.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is my Angry Birds...  It is addicting to me, as it plays like an Angry Brids type of game since there are numerous, fairly quick levels with similar problems to solve.  It appeals to me because you are not only attacking and destroying, but you need to apply some physics and engineering to get the job done as effectively as possible.  I do not play obsessively, but even after several months of having this App I am nowhere close to playing all the levels or bonus stages.  Good fun!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game<br /><br /> Khrushchev ssh Judi and day out of the first time in my opinion is that you can transform your own project is the devil and shout out for the devil went into effect in the first time since I was a good game m e and shout out for the devil went to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to Jamaica to the bills are in a few weeks of a new one that is a few days after a new study shows the first place for a new one of a few weeks ago I will keep the first
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I really like the variety and the option to replay the games I  have already played in order to get a better score. I like playing against myself and I think I could play a long time without having to replay any of the games.
0345531930|5.0|This book kept me up reading way too late on several work nights- couldn't put it down. Great read- a good suspense novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down from start to finish. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. Spectacular!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It's about innocence, growing up, the good, bad and evil that can overtake anybody at any time in their lives,young or old.

B008220BP2|4.0|First of all, I love me my Zombie films.  And lately there have been a lot of them.  We're sort of in a zombie renaissance.  I feel we've reached a point now too where there are so many that the only real point of producing new ones is to mess with the formula.  Perhaps that's why Romero's last two films were not really all that well received...  where he was once experimenting with the formula he himself developed, his last two were really more of the same.  Maybe I'm being a little harsh, I haven't actually seen Survival of the Dead (so I am only going by heresay, but the heresay on it is pretty one note) but I can't imagine anyone really standing up for Diary of the Dead.  It can't stand up to any of his earlier efforts, even Land of the Dead (Romero's only full on mainstream film I can think of).    In any case, I'm getting a little side tracked.  Continuing the trend of monkeying with the formula, Warm Zombies...  I mean Bodies was just released.  It's not particularly heavy or deep, but it is a lot of fun, very sweet, and more then a little heart warming.  It may be the first Zombie movie I can think of with told from the Zombie's perspective, with a zombie protagonist.  On that note it does cheat a little.  I don't mind the inner dialogue of \\"R\\" (he can't remember his name, only that it starts with R) but they do have trouble straddling the line of mindless automaton, and thinking and feeling zombie.  It's a difficult juggling act, which they don't completely succeed in, making the zombies a little inconsistent from one scene to the next, but given what they are trying to do with the story, it's hard to imagine how it could have been handled differently.  Zombie movies tend to be very much about setting up a system of rules, and then showcasing what those rules mean for the universe, and here they aren't able to follow there own rules 100 percent, so you end up with a few leaps of logic that don't make a lot of sense.  It's a minor nitpick though, and remember we're talking about a movie involving walking corpses who not only eat human brains, but literally eat their memories.  That leads me to an interesting point in this film, they introduce a new rule to the mix where zombies experience the memories of their victims by eating their brains.  This to my knowledge has never been suggested before, but makes a good explanation for why zombies specifically eat brains, but still leaving the more general carnivorous proclivities intact.    One thing I find interesting about the whole genre, is by and large there has been a shift in tone from one of general hopelessness to one that actually feels rather uplifting.  This is strange because right now it seems to me that most movies and genres are actually trending the exact opposite.  Everyone seems to have a very poor outlook on the future right now, but looking at the modern state of Zombie films, you have a feeling of \\"We're gonna make it after all\\".  Maybe the makers of Zombie films just feel that hopelessness has been played out.  In any case, this movie has as hopeful a message as you could possibly want.  Not only would we survive the zombie apocalypse, but one day will learn to be best friends with the zombies!  (it doesn't come across QUITE as cheesy in the movie)  This I think is very nice message for our times.  I think the hopeful outlook is something people need right now.    The actors mostly acquit themselves nicely, though the heroine is really kindof a bit bland.  John Malcovich is always a nice addition to any movie, and though he is a bit underused as the heroines obsessed militaristic father, his few scenes really shine.  \\"M\\" is also a very nice character played in an unusually strait manner by the usually comic Rob Corddry.  He is R's best friend whom R often ALMOST has conversations with!  And of course we come to the protagonist, R, who really steals the whole show.  His \\"inner monologue\\" if it can be called that, really holds the whole thing together, and makes you feel for this mindless automaton.  He also handles his gradual transition from traditional moaning and groaning zombie to thinking feeling and speaking \\"almost\\" human quite well.  He is played by Nicholas Holt who seems to be a bit of an up and comer right now, and I wouldn't be surprised to see his career take off in the next few years.    See the rest of my reviews at[...]

B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so happy when Pinterest finally released an app that was compatible with my Kindle Fire.  The app works great and I haven't experienced any problems while using.  Would definitely recommend!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I liked this case for my new kindle fire.  It does the job for very little price.  Its sturdy and suits me just fine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun.It requires some agility and is a brain teaser. Really helps to pass the time and relax.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I enjoy playing this game while my son naps, It can get a little tricky sometimes but gets your mind stimulated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game, it is super fun. It is a great pass time and better than temple run. It is easy, but also challenging. Over all it is a great game especially for the kindle fire and other large devices or tablets.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Really loved the storyline and the characters were amazing in the movie.  Was excited to add this to my collection.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|I bought this right after we bought a 3D tv so we would have a 3D movie to watch. There were 6 of us watching the movie and we all laughed at how awful this is. I not only wasted money, but 2 hours of my life.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|This is really one of the best children's books, I absolutely love this story. I remember it from when I was a little girl and now I am reading it to my own little princess.
B005JABSB6|5.0|They seem to work well so far and hold a charge for several hours. I wish they gave a discount for ordering multiple pairs, it would have helped since I ordered 6 pair
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded this for my 3-year-old daughter because she loves horses. It's fairly limited what you an do for free but, but she seems to really like it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was bought as a gift.  He really likes this movie and was holding out on buying it until a 3D version was released. I was told it was worth the wait
B005D0RDKW|4.0|Older and not quite as crisp as they once were but this was expected and not nearly as bad as I thought it might be. Why did I buy this, because I have everything by them including some bootleg things. Their older, like me and they still sound pretty good ad their music not only lives on but will live on a long long time. Is this their best, not close but this may be the last one so if your a real fan you should have this.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Don't want to spoil. I just do not like at all the ending. It was unnecessary.<br />We were so much eager to watch season 3. But I doubt I ll watch season 4.
B002AS466O|4.0|This is not his (Willis) best nor it his worst. Down on his luck with family and job he overcomes the odds and with a little help and luck he's able to get things right. If you like Willis you'll likely enjoy and if not look elsewhere, he's done better!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|such a great app I am addicted to it and it is the best app ive ever played also I like valor so you should checks that out too
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is challenging and fun for all ages. Me and my small children can play this game for hours and compete against one another trying to complete the many different challenges.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|one word, HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A family must see, or just for the fans of this genre of movie, soon will buy the DVD copy to complete my set!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it was &copy;&copy;  cool.I liked it it was usefully and I use it<br />  o<br />  4school work and other stuff.it was really helpfull. to me.  ;)
089898890X|4.0|I had this book about 5 years ago and lent it out to someone and never saw it again, so I finally decided to buy it again. It's a great book with a lot of helpful exercises for anyone interested if jazz drumming or at least using jazz influences in other settings. Not a book for beginners of course :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|every one make a rate on this I love this game if u love or like put 5 stars please
B000IZAHB4|4.0|I do not get the chance to watch many movies on A. Prime. As I'm watching the movie it stops & reloads so many times that we finally get disinterested. And so it happened w/ this movie. My grandchildren luv this movie, but had to settle for one on Netflix. We couldn't watch it. If there is something I can do please let my know
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan goes to Vegas for a Wedding. Gets drunk and ends up in bed with a man. She is married! She doesn't remember it happening, But she wants a divorce. Turns out the groom doesn't.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I think having Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III) was the inspired choice here, as he captures the 1940s vibe so well. Evans is surprisingly good as Cap, while the supporting actors (Hayley Atwell, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Dominic Cooper, Stanley Tucci) are superb. Almost gave it 5-stars, but the finale feels a little too rushed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is great I like to play it when there is nothing to do... I think that the fact that you can actually interact and send gifts to your friends. It's really great. I rate it as a four because it is fun but can sometimes be tedious
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Consciously and sub-consciously I've wrestled with resistance all my life.  This book has made me profoundly aware of the beast's many guises and the heavy price I will pay if I don' go for his belly
B007REV4YI|5.0|If you like bond movies don't miss this one. If you hate bond movies but love action this is the movie for you.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|got the full version for this and it works just fine..my friends were asking me, so can you edit/type in some words now? the answer is YES, you can do those things. it goes with power point and excel too..
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Love their hip blend of music that is hard to define.  If you like Dave Matthews you will like Mumford & sons as well.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|nutty fluffies rollercoaster is the best game ever!!! I just down loaded it today and I already have like, 372 hearts!!! not joking one bit!!!this is the best f***  game ever!!!
B000000WG0|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and the music is a great remembrance of the wonderful mission work done by so many.
0757302661|5.0|I only semi-used this method during birth. But, I do believe it kept me calm and confident before and during birth. A great book for new moms nervous about the big day.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun game. but it takes too long to get more energy. it would be even more fun if it took less than 5 minutes to get more energy.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Intense entertaining and definitely an eye opener.<br /><br />Great Cast, Design, and up to speed with the times!<br /><br />It's a Date!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|As a long time persona fan and player of the original P4, I wasn't sure about buying a new system to play a game I had already played before. I don't regret my decision even a little, P4G has loads of new content and gameplay. As someone who failed to play through P4 even a second time, P4G has me hooked into the same game even stronger than when I played the original. It has tons of replay value and fun features. I highly recommend it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Been a while since I picked up a Clancy book and was glad I did. He didn't disappoint me at all. Moved in all the directions that Clancy writes . It knocked out of the park for me. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00000IREA|5.0|This is a movie that Jane Fonda would like to forget she was ever a part of. It is a true 60's classic! She has since managed to offend many former American prisioners of war and other patriots. I wish she had just stuck to movies like this and not become so political. Her talent has been wasted since she made this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Would love more levels,that's my only complaint. Colors are bright and vivid. Story kept me interested for the length of the game. Fun game to escape into.
B008VBYN80|4.0|this game is fun and requires very little help from neighbors to do things battles are very classic old school and the graphics aren't bad either
0517548232|5.0|Wow !! This is an eye-opener... Forget the bean-counting madness that all but a few of us Hate !! This is a classic that should be studied in class in Every High School in America ! (and the Book of Rules for the House and Senate)  Freedom, stolen in laws that pervert and eventually make slaves of us all, is shown to be taken an inch at a time. Ever wonder why ACTS coming out of DC have funny and/or misnomer names to them ???  Framing mischief with their laws is a Biblical term. Nothing new but a REAL great read. Our ignorance is deadly...
0307592731|4.0|This may be the first book I have read that is on the Oprah Book Club list. While that's not why I read it, it definitely deserves the attention. I've read other books by females who have hikes either the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) or the Appalachian Trail alone and there is just something fascinating about the journey to knowing yourself by hiking eleven-hundred plus miles. Competing with nature (including lack of water, animals, rain and snow), as well as your own thoughts and dealing with the people you meet along the trail, makes it impressive how people thrive on the trail.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed's story goes back to her youth, as well as her mother's death while in her early 20's, showing how these challenges brought her to hiking the trail. I enjoyed the stories of the fellow hikes she spends some of the time with, the beauty she experiences and funny (only after the fact) stories, such as losing a shoe down a mountain.<br /><br />I'm in awe of what she accomplished, and while probably not wanting to ever hike the whole trail, on my own, enjoy living vicariously through her. Maybe someday I'll get a chance to hike some of the trail, and feel a little of the \\"trail magic.\\"<br /><br />Good for people who like travel/hiking novels as well as those who like feel-good, female novels.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Continuum the adventures of Richard and Kahlan. Great book, great series. Terry Goodkind always keeping interesting and so detail about his characters.
1455160474|5.0|Imagine growing up in a prison camp; not knowing any other way of life. Having very little to eat, only one set of clothes which are replaced just once a year, and being forced to work 12 plus hours a day.<br /><br />Shin Dong-hyuk is the only person known to have been born in a North Korean prison camp and later escape from it. It's a fascinating look into a secretive world, and what life looks like when you have no knowledge of a loving family, God, civilization, comfort, or joy. Born the second son of parents who were only allowed to see each other a few times a year, he was in the prison camp to atone for the sins of his grandparents.<br /><br />The book covers his time in the camp, how he was able to escape, and then, once he made it to South Korea, how he worked on settling into his new way of life.<br /><br />In South Korea, he was placed in a program that would help assimilate him to culture outside of North Korea. Teaching him and others who had left North Korea the truth about the world and the truth about their country. Unlike other defector's from North Korea, he was in some ways starting with a clean slate. He had not been taught the propaganda that the others grew up learning, so for example, when he was told who really started the Korean war, he easily accepted it.<br /><br />With the help from people in the US who heard about his story he had the opportunity to travel and eventually moves to California, working as a human right activist. He struggled with guilt his discomfort in telling his story and being able to relate to the American's he would speak to. And since his escape was in 2005, this is still an ongoing story, so it sort of leaves us hanging at the end.<br /><br />Though I had read the original Washington Post article about him (also written by this author), I appreciated that the book also covers recent events, such as how he's adjusting to life in the US. Now free, he's racked with guilt, finds it challenging to stay at one job, is learning about social norms and how to love. He is still working as a human rights activist, living in Washington state and Seoul, South Korea.ning about social norms and how to love. He is still working as a human rights activist, living in Washington state and Seoul, South Korea.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Although the search screens were sometimes difficult, the true adventure never swayed. Especially for those who enjoy a challenge. There are so many search games that are repetitious and easy ,this is NOT one of them. A+++
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Even better than Season 1.  Can't wait to see what happens next!  I LOVE Bates.  He's so honorable, strong and quiet.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Even though K Loggins is in another band - love his songs and his voice.<br />Can't get enough of him
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well, well!  Who would've thought it possible!  No sex, no violence, no profanity.  Just great acting, marvelous plots, exquisite costumes in a beautiful setting.  And, it's a HIT!  Why can't our American film makers see this and stop producing the garbage that comes out of Hollywood.  I will pay no more money for American films, now that I can get real, quality movies from the Brits.
0446547646|5.0|This book is another great one from Nicholas Sparks.If you like his style, you will love this book! Great read!
B0032FPVKE|5.0|This case is perfect for my new Pentax K-01 with the 40mm f/2.8 limited lens. I looked at dozens and dozens of name brand camera cases until this one showed up with the exact dimensions I needed. The case takes the camera, strap and an extra battery. It also has exterior compartments on three sides where I can store memory cards, extra lens caps, note cards, and personal items. The case comes with a shoulder strap, handle, and belt loops. Its well padded, has an easy to open zipper, and is weather resistent. The price was great as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the series. I had resisted reading it because it sounded strange but my husband wanted to see the movie and I like to read the books first. I was pleasantly surprised!!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This game wouldstrangly for some reason not dowload for my kindle fire. I never had this problem so this seemed very strangge but looksfun.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I didn't even get past chapter two. I knew it would be a lighthearted read, but it was a total BORE!!!
1616550414|5.0|Well, considering that this is the first product that I ever bought in my life (from the internet, of course) It's amazing, so great that I can't handle myself!!!<br />I loved the fact that he is so big and complete, but I have to confess that he's a little late in the deliver, but this is not your fault. It's my country's fault, you did a great job!<br />I recommend that product to every single Zelda fan, because, trust me, it's amazing!!!<br />Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the series. I had resisted reading it because it sounded strange but my husband wanted to see the movie and I like to read the books first. I was pleasantly surprised!!
B001F8W400|4.0|movie was good but did not stream well enough to be an enjoyable experience, pixelated, sound dropped out at times
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the series. I had resisted reading it because it sounded strange but my husband wanted to see the movie and I like to read the books first. I was pleasantly surprised!!
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|It's funny and he describes this book really well.  And the pictures are hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will read this book again.
B00005LIN0|4.0|Interesting approach.  This version of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess makes the opera more accessible as a movie musical than pure operatic versions do.  For the P&B fan who needs to own all interpretations, or the novice who is more comfortable with a movie musical approach.  Opera lovers?  Houston Opera Company, to me is still the gold standard.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The most interesting psychological study of truly disfunctional people I have ever read!  I ran my battery down to zero on my iPad, couldn't put it down!
B0036SUQWA|5.0|This movie gets funnier every time I watch it.  How hunky George Clooney can survive, image in tact, after the goofy characters he plays so believably I can't imagine.  The cast is quirky and deliciously looney and oh, so believable.  For those irreverent or subversive souls who lived through the Viet Nam War period--and protests--the sight gags and insider jokes just keep coming.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|What this new release lacks in the way of outright revelation (that can occasionally be found on the Daggar Records releases), it more than makes up for in it's ambition to present the direction that Hendrix wished to take his music after Electric Ladyland, but was thwarted by circumstance.  (The ceaseless touring, that never amounted to financial independence was draining enough, but various incidents like the vial that turned up in the luggage at Canadian Customs, his bizarre kidnapping and rescue, and the dosing problem during the Band Of Gypsies New Year's concert contributed to his losing traction on any ambition in forging another alternative trail.)  Here, in a series of \\"live in studio\\" cuts that have not been picked apart and re-recorded, Hendrix's sister provides a vision as to the sound that Jimi was striving for.  It's decidedly rooted in his experience of the small black clubs he played in prior to leaving NCY for London.  In a way his back to basics inclination mirrors the advent of Delaney and Bonnie and even the Band that provided a turning point as popular music moved into the '70's.  What finally emerged as Cry of Love/First Rays was exceedingly distinguished with no need for caveat, but the sound of this new album displays extraordinary potential, and is more than satisfying.
B00BHU261S|5.0|i liked this move the only this is A.H did not really look or acted like him if you have seen any A.H tv form the 50's you can see why
B00A757EFW|2.0|this ame is just not the same as the original.  I find it difficult to navigate using a cell phone
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Fun game but I got tired of losing changes after playing for an hour and starting the game again later. Base changes, amount of coins, and other goods would be reset and id have to make changes again.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|much more fun without the adds driving you nuts. Same great fun game to play while waiting at the DMV
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is such a good game. I have a baby sister who is two and she love's it too. I love how well it is set up.  It has such great graphics.<br />Love it.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Fun game to kill time & graphics are decent. Not used to the V-stick but, I'm sure i just need too play more.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire<br />Suzanne Collins<br /><br />  If you like a book that is about surviving outside and every move you take you might be killed than Catching Fire is the book for you.Katniss Everdeen has won The Hunger Games in the first book The Hunger Games and is planning on doing it again in the Quarter Quell thats when the victors participate in the games.Will Katniss survive  the games?<br /><br />  Katniss,peeta,and prim are some of the characters in the book.Prim is Katniss's sister and very fragile. Peeta Mellark is nice and Katniss's future husband.He is in the games with Katniss. Katniss is fierce and has to protect Peeta from being killed by a tribute and she can't risk it because she loves him.<br /><br />  This book is great and not a waste of your money.It is suspensefull and it catches you. You won't want to stop reading until its over.This book is worth every penny you pay.I would recommend this book to middle schoolers and up. I rate it 5 out of 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.<br />If anybody doesn't read this book you are missing out on a really  good book
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|First of all I cant do anything because the app refuses to upload the notes and the permissions on it ate outrageous. Do not buy. Get a different note taking app.

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|It's a good science fiction action hero movie tied to a comic.<br />What's not to love?<br /><br />Four more words required??? WTF is that?<br />I said all I wanted to say.
B009LRE040|5.0|Christopher Nolan completely thrills and amazes with this the final entry to his Batman trilogy. Using the all-star cast, top in their field FX, and a this is how we're going to do it attitude Nolan creates the ultimate finish.  If you have not seen it, please do, I believe you will &#34;Love this movie&#34;
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is great its so much fun it's worth the money you need to get this game you won't regret it  =)
B00BHMF578|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie to my friends and family! Very entertaining and Ben Affleck gives one heck of a performance!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love that people can make new friends. I wish they could improve alittle on the games and maybe have some games to play with your horse.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This game is filled with a lot of really cool game references which is pretty cool for gamers. As a movie it is great for the whole family. My 11 year old daughter and 7 year old son watch it over and Over and OVER like when they were little. A great buy for the family.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|just play it and if you dont like it unantalled it . all and all i would say its a very enjoyable game ... though they sometime ask for
B005J9ZFQG|3.0|The story of it almost seems low budget how it is filmed but with the new film coming to theaters its worth seeing
B00005R24K|3.0|It is a very different story line and you hvae to be prepared for the low budget filming due to when it was filmed
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|This follows the orginal perfectly. Some people may not be a huge fan of this movie if you do not understand the video game. This is a movie perfect for horror fanatics!
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|This movie was great! I felt that it was filmed with great perfection and that any horror fanatic like myself will enjoy it!
B009AMALLM|5.0|It does have some very good jumpy parts and good use of technology and it does follow the other Paranormal Activities. I do feel that they did not build on it enough however to give you enough new information. In the last 20 to 30 min is when it becomes the most intense. Only true PA fans and horror fanatics may like this rent it before you buy it.
0446585041|2.0|I like Ellen Degeneres. I think she is funny without being dirty and I admire her for coming out about her personal life. But Seriously...I',m Kidding is just not worth reading unless you just want some mindless drivel. There is no plot, no point to the book. Some of what she says is funny and some is just silly.  Only die hard Ellen fans will enjoy it. There are a lot of humor books (Dave Barry for example) that are better and the Stephanie Plum books can be funny and interesting. I give it two stars not because it is bad, but because it just is not worth spending a number of hours on unless you really like her.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I thought it was OK but not an Oscar winner. I've seen hostage rescue movies before & this had nothing new. It's a forgettable movie. Throughout the whole movie Ben Affleck scowls which is irritating & unrealistic
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It looked at first like all the season 2 episodes would be free on Prime, but the offer applied only to the first episode.  I felt this was misleading advertising, as there was not a notice that there was a charge for watching the next episode.  I love the series, but Amazon should be clearer about their pricing policy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice and very easy to use calculator. I use it often. it is simple and show the last thing I added

0375714839|5.0|Recommend to all ! I love this book it is the best! You can easily get sucked into the comic and it is very enjoyable to read when you are on the go or have nothing else to do.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones it just an excellent series.  It has humor, compassion, thriller, very educational just love the caracters not only bones and Booth but all of them are so important.  Amazon love your service
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Tina Fey writes as though you are in the room talking to her. It is a great autobiography.  Great insight  into how  people start off their careers as comedians. Tina is a very talented woman, and truly paid her dues!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book that u can't put down..... I have read it over and over but every time it gets better!!! I love all the surprise in this book and that it keeps u on the edge of your chair!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun app very realistic and lots of fun mini games :) even my 5year old daughter keeps interested in it
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is a really good app. It is precise and it lets you save locations besides your own location. Its free which is a plus why not get it.
B00ANVX6DY|1.0|Received this in the mail yesterday and today went to open it and watch with our daughter there is no princess activity set. As part of the pre-order it was supposed to be in the shipment.<br /><br />The movie is great and our daughter loves Sophia. This rating is purely based on the lack of the princess activity set that was supposed to be in the order.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Learned of Downton Abbey well into 3rd season.  I loved it so much that I've started over with Season/Series 1 and just finished Season 2.  I used the Amazon instant video through my Wii with wifi and had great quality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My granddaughter loves horses so this game keeps her happy. The &quot;Paddock Clean-up&quot; is great for a preschoolers hand-eye coordination.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Great controller that only took a couple minutes to get running for Guild Wars 2. Ergonomics suck though and took me a while to find a comfortable place to set it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|As usual the graphics are beautiful. The storyline is not cheesy. For me this is the perfect mix of HO and mini puzzles. Absolutely no issues downloading or playing on my kindle fire.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|No more to say... These books are like heroin.  So addictive, and can't get enough. Wish there were many more!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply amazing. You won't ever look at things the same way after reading this. It's deep, but refreshing. A must read.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Great story lines with great dialogue. The show will keep you guessing. The writers have done an excellent job developing the character of Sherlock Holmes.
B00701897I|5.0|3D version of this great story.  The direction and casting seem ideal for the story.  The plot moves along well and keeps your attention.  The 3D adds more to what would be a gripping yarn in any format.  Well worth the reasonable price it can be found at.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Had no preceonceptions about this movie when purchased.  Had a new 3D TV and was seeking films to justify its purchase.  This one seemed reasonably priced and well received by those who had seen it before me.  It was a delightful movie, well directed and scripted, with great voice talent.  The 3D was good and the whole thing so enjoyable I wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner and in the theater.
B008YUHQ3M|5.0|While everyone wondered at the decision to break up this particular book into two parts (possibly the book in the series with the most potential for judicious editing), it is great to finally see the &#34;wizardry&#34; in three dimensions.  The movie is very enjoyable and brings the series to a satisfactory close - even the forgettable (and oft wished forgotten) epilogue.  The cast is superb and the &#34;kids&#34; show that they have developed some acting chops since the first chapter.  Shame to have lost Albus, but his brother's presence is incorporated well into the plot.  Shame the author waited until the final volume to provide so much of the Dunbledore (and other) backstory.  Holds together well.  The 3D imagery is beautiful.
B0082GQ5HG|5.0|We missed this at the theaters, and wanted to watch it as soon as it was released to DVD.  Since we have a 3D player and TV, the choice was obvious to go with the 3D blu-ray version.  It is very British in humor and style, so if you are an Anglophile or just love Ardmann/Wallace and Gromitt/Chicken Run you will adore this.  If claymation is not your thing, then don't bother.  Some people (in my experience) jus don't like claymation and cannot enjoy a movie's content due to that.  But even beyond that, this seem very British in style and dialogue to the pont of being almost a BBC comedy.<br /><br />If you find yourself watching lots of British humor and don't dislike claymation, then this is definitely for you!
B00005JL96|5.0|I would recommend this to all Disney fans, Stitch fans, animation fans, and kids of all ages.  Stich keeps you in stitches quite literally and the surrounding chaos he creates by merely existing is hilarious.<br /><br />Not quite undiscovered/unplumbed territory as far as the &#34;hiding away someone/something&#34; experience goes.  All been done a zillion times before, yet this time the fun seems amplified by the great characterizations and voice talents brought to bear.  Lots of new ideas or plot twists, no.  great handling of them all, yes.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|Great movie continuing the trend for Dr Seuss films (with the sad exclusion of the live action Cat In The Hat).  This film departs from the recent trend to bring young children's books to the screen with live action (Grinch, Cat In The Hat, Where The Wild Things Are) and for good reason.  With the sole exception of the Grinch (possibly due to the incredible casting of that film), these books don't translate all that well into live action and leave the viewer wondering who they were made for.<br /><br />This doesn't do that.  It is lots of fun and while the territory has been plumbed by many others, this version of the envronmental/ecology story stands up very well.  Only Wall-E did it better.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Already had the earlier films in 2D, but this allowed me to upgrade those to 3D while adding the latest and greatest installment to the collection at a very reasonable price.  Toy Story 3 is a tears of joy producing humerous story continuing the saga of Woody and pals.  The underlying human story is full of pathos and some wistfulness, while the story of the toys is full of adventure and some pretty inventive fun and laughs!  TS3 is a must see and you might as well see it in 3D and get the first two installments in 3D at the same time.<br /><br />One caveat: this version contains ONLY the 3D versions, so if yu have non-3D screens you wish to watch it on, it will not satisfy your needs. As a supplement to the 2D versions, however, it sparkles!
B005LAII08|5.0|Disney (Pixar division) has done it again!  On the heels of Tangled, Disney had released yet another princess to the cheers of all.  Disney has played with the princess myth/story in many ways over the years.  In Brave the princesses get their payback.  Brave is nothing like Snow White and she doesn't intend to be, despite her mother's wishes elsewise.  So many great themes are explored and woven into the main story.  3D adds to the fun, but in this case it truly is icing as Brave delights in any version.  Still, the 3D is well done!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|While Thor is possibly the hardest of the Avengers to make seem even remotely possible in real life and incorporate into the pantheology of the full group, this film does the imossibe well.  Thor is brought to life in a way that seemed to be undoable prior to its completeion.  The Thor we meet and travel with seems very believable probably because of the writing and direction that makes Thor's actions very believable from a human perspective.<br /><br />By the time the movie ends, Thor seems much less implausible and the viewer is practically drooling to see the Avengers.  The first glimpse of another Avenger in this movie also makes it a must see for the Avengers fan.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This film, while controversy surrounds the originality of its plot, was and remains amazing.  One of Disney's best that stands up against everything the company has released in animation.  While some critics thought it stole too much from a poorly executed animated feature of similar name and somewhat similar story, the truth is that both films steal a lot more from Bambi (another Disney great) than either does from the other.  The names of the characters (always a favorite for those who claim theft) are basically Swahili words for the animals depicted.<br /><br />But enough on the critics.  This film is one of the best of the best Disney has produced in decades.  In 3D it becomes all that more powerful and ready for a 21st century audience.  And it comes with all of the trimmings including a 2D DVD copy for your grandma and an electronic copy for your teenager's laptop.  Does it get better?  Not as a rule.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|These drawings are wonderful.  The filiming of them in 3D was genious.  It is almost like being there and is in fact the only way you'll get to see them at all, let a lone in such great detail.<br /><br />Much has been said about the 3D, such as the outside the cave portions being not particularly 3D worthy.  I agree.  But then why do I care?  The big attraction here is to see the unseeable and in 3D so you get the feel for the way it is in the cave, as opposed to 2D phiotographs.  The only negative is perhaps that it could, possibly should have been shorter.  But it seems they wanted to give enough content (as measured in minutes) for the money invested.  But the repetition of the shots of the cave interior and the sometimes curiously unneeded side conversations make it not great cinema.<br /><br />But all that said, for the price, being able to see these drawings almost in a way that makes them seem touchable is a joy.  Would I second guess the director and producer? Yes I would.  I would have included more interior cave shots at different angles and magnification, and dumped the repetitive shots and unnecessary commentary.  But would I want my money back - NEVER!
B005BCE7II|5.0|This movie is fun.  Period.  The voice characterizations remain as before and the movie ventures into 3D as an extra plus.  The whole franchise seems ideal for 3D treatment and don't be surprised if the rest of the series eventually makes it into that format.<br /><br />Our intrepid band of misfits continue their bizarre and outrageously funny journey across an imagined ice age terrain while handling the sorts of human foibles we all face.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|So many bad reviews of this film exist and for so many wrong reasons.  Some claim it rips off a bunch of other films (eg Start Wars), a lot of which actually ripped off the John Carter series.  This is the original and Disney did it very, very well.  Sadly it's lack of box office punch cost several great people the jobs they deserved to keep.  That is shameful.  This film is fantastic and really gives some 21st Century kick to a story that predates all other fantasy-scifi.<br /><br />Watch it without prejudice and you will love it.  Watch it in 3D and you will love it even more.  A great treatment of the book series that sadly will not likely see a sequel do to the poor reviews and box office.  A shame.
B008UZ7MUI|5.0|While it is questionable whether out of all the HP novels this one deserves two films, the final product is eye candy and the action very fun, especially in 3D.  The characters you've all come to love and cherish are back.  Even Dumbledore, sort of.  Being twice as much film for about the same amount of content, this film and its counterpart Part 2 are closer to the book than their predecessors.  The addition of 3D is another plus for a series so dominated by special effects.<br /><br />I wouldn't start my HP movie watching with this one, for obvious reasons, but it does satisfy and provide lots for the HP fan.  If you've never seen any of the previous movies or read the books, this is not for you.  There is just too much missing to make it stand alone.
B003XWFLTM|5.0|Excellent example of his work & a great symphony playing it as well!  A super addition to anyone's music library.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He does it again!  Sparks sucks you in to his world and these characters come to life on the pages.  You will root for this couple! And it is more than just a romance novel.  There is a thriller aspect that will leave you not wanting to put it down until you are finished it. Dont miss out on this one!
B004EBZX6W|2.0|didnt really like it kept crashing on my tablet. could use some improvement on crashing... I didnt really like it
B00881VLCE|1.0|Shuts itself down before I can even play.<br />Tried several times and even restarted, maybe its just<br />my tablet but doesn't work.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A truly unique and inspiring story of courage sacrifice and the love we have for family and friends. If you don't love these books you have no taste in books.
B0086700CM|5.0|Grandchildren love this game! keeps them thinking and interested.  Better for the 12 year old than the 8 year old, but still a good game,
B00B7ERH04|5.0|It's seem awesome and cool that and I wanna to learn about camera and video because  so I haven't one for video in my kindle tablet HD
B004YM6JLO|5.0|The series is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone who liked the Twilight movies.  It can be a little violent, but the storyline is great and you'll get hooked on the Salvatore brothers. They are too cute.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Like being entwined in a wonderful dream, that feels just that slightly real and endlessly beautiful.  A book not to be forgotten.
0143119680|5.0|I listened to this on audio on a 20+ hour road trip, it made the trip fly by.  Interesting characters and great descriptions of places and things.  Well worth a read.  I a good series, I've heard the 2nd of the series too.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS.  The acting is well done and the scenery is breathtaking.  The clothes leave me wishing I was back in that time period.  I am anxiously waiting for Season4 after the cliff hanger from Season 3.
B008I34YYY|1.0|I saw teaser trailers for this movie a while ago and salivated for it's release. Unfortunately, the brilliant teaser trailers are far more entertaining than the movie itself. This is such a GREAT concept that was so HORRIBLY executed. Basic Idea: Nazi's escape Earth in 1945 and make a secret colony on the far side of the moon. There they multiply, become completely militarized, and have built a superweapon they plan to use to conquer the Earth. Seems like a great idea, right? What could go wrong with this plot? Oh, EVERYTHING!<br /><br />Some call this a comedy. It would be nice if there was something funny in it. There are several attempts, but no actual humor. I'd like to say there is a stand out performance, but the  script is so bad, no one can act their way out of it's incompetence. All are dragged into it's mire. I do think there is some imagery that is cool, but seriously most of the really good stuff is seen in the teaser trailers available on the web. The original Moon Fuhrer looks really good on screen. You really think 'Nazi' when you see him, but it's not worth buying the movie for. Although Julia Dietze makes an adorable little Nazi frau, every action her character takes makes no sense. She was wasted in this movie (even though it appears she cannot act; Is it the script or her?). I could dissect this film and point out bad decision after bad decision that went into it's making, but there is no point. It's just bad.<br /><br />Extras: You get the teaser trailers plus theatrical trailers and a behind the scenes short. The Blu-Ray doesn't even have a subtitle option, which would have been nice, because a lot of the dialogue is mumbled out and diffused by other scenic noise. There are subtitles when the characters speak German, though some of it flies by pretty quickly.<br /><br />I ENJOY A LOT OF WHAT OTHERS CALL \\"BAD FILMS\\", BUT THERE IS REALLY NOTHING TO ENJOY HERE!<br />SO DISAPPOINTED! Go buy Robo-Geisha instead! It's bad, but highly entertaining!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I liked that it was a little darker than the typical Nicholas sparks books, but it was a little slow in the beginning. I liked the twist at the end.
B002O2THRO|3.0|The movie was wonderful, as was to be expected.  Unfortunately, the quality that showed up on my TV was fuzzy and hard to hear.  That may have been due to the wireless connection on my end.<br /><br />It was worth it anyhow.  Loved the movie.  Can't wait to see what they will do with it when the new version comes out soon.  Rich
B004RJMUJO|2.0|When I purchase an app, I don't expect it will start serving me ads between games. But that's what FN suddenly began doing. Free apps? Sure, pitch away. But ads in a game I PAID for? Boo. Boooooooooo.
B00BHU261S|4.0|The cast brought a well written script to life in a well written story that captivates. I was immersed in the world of Hitchcock.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! I have it on VHS but would like to have it on DVD. I hope Amazon will offer it on DVD, other than the Japanese version
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|one of the best movies that no one knows about. I consider myself a film buff, and on the cinematographic level, this movie is only rivaled by 8 1/2.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|It's classic, i love this book. Must read for all who love English novels and the way they did everything, especially the courting and the lifestyles :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app Helps pass time while waiting for doctor. or any thing else you are waiting to do.
0553579908|5.0|I bought just by impulse the first 4 books, and now I realize my mistake: I'm an addict now, and the rate George R. R. Michael writes is too slow to satisfy my greedy reading needs.<br /><br />The stories, characters, action, romance, violence, fantasy, are all fascinating! If you are about to start these books, try to read them slowly, so you always have a book ready when you finish your current one. Don't devour them like I did.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|This movie rocks. Good action scenes, decent dialogue, and a smoking hot prostitute... How can you not want to own this?! Buy this movie now!
1616550414|5.0|The quality, the content, the stories... everything is awesome!<br /><br />...there is something troublesome about this book, though: I think I might be unavailable for a few weeks, while I devour its contents, enjoy smelling the pages and play again all my games.<br /><br />Yup.
B001E75QH0|5.0|This is a classic series. Well, except the fourth one. Seriously, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was kind of a stinker. But the first three are incredible. Buy them now!

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I didn't jump on the HP bandwagon until after Deathly Hallows 1 came out. Then my friend let me borrow all of his HP movies. So I only had to wait a week or two between movies instead of several years. After I saw them all I treated myself to the box set for my birthday. Awesome series!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|But that's what I need from George R .R. Michael's books! I feel like there are some things not yet explained, some things still left in the open.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I owned this movie once, but lost it in a divorce several years ago. Was reminded of it awhile back and had to buy it. Understated comedy and cool f/x.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is probably the worst book I have ever read.The style is puerile and the content repetitive. Only people with a minimal education or a very low IQ could possibly appreciate it. Truly dreadful!

B004GUSG4M|5.0|Excellent book. One of the best I've read in a long time. I would highly suggest it.I was engaged from the first page. It's got a great twist. Really good thriller.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love this movie!  I saw it on ABC Family and ordered the DVD before it was over!  Christina is amazing!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|This is a great app to showcase my pics on my kindle. It was very easy to use and the pics look great. I recomend this highly.
1594744475|5.0|I absolutely love this book the ideas it has which are adorable. Some reviews say that the recipes are unhealthy like fried vegetables which I agree with. But I personally just substitute the unhealthy for a healthier version. With this book it is great for people who are beginners at the making of bentos. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for cute ideas for a child's or your own lunch. But of coarse everyone will have a different opinion;) I love how it gives you a sense of what you might need to make the lunches what they are. Such as Nori cut outs and egg molds. Things that can be expensive /fun to have but not needed. This book also gave me a insite to Japanese side dishes in the bento which I loved. This book has like 50 recipies in it that I was not expecting and extra ones in the back for some things that are not listed but showed in the bento picture. Overall I wasnt expecting the number of recipies which was a pleasant surprise. LOVE THIS BOOK! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is the most intense show I have ever seen! I am on the edge of my seat for entire episodes and I love the characters!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark did a great job of prpeparing the reader for what it takes to be a member of Seal Team 6.  The account of the mission was detailed and kept you flipping the pages.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|once i got this i couldnt put it down for my own sake!!!! i get on it everyday to check up on my dragons i just cant put it down!!! i also like how you dont have to pay money for gems! trust me you will love it!!!!!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|I love this show. I was sort of skeptical at first and hoped that drugs weren't glorified.  Not at all. The grit and ugliness of the drug world is shown. I love the characters, the writers and the story line.  I think the show is perfectly casted and I have been a fan of Bryan Cranston since he was Tim Watley on Seinfeld. If you haven't tried the show yet, don't waste more time, just order the series and let the fun begin!!
0345803485|4.0|It's a book... It came in on time my girlfriend bought it. Idk what it's about some weird sex book but if your into that go ahead and get it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Watch the first show and you will be addicted. Great storyline and acting is fantastic.  Be prepared to watch them all.  This is by far the best SciFi series that was ever on TV.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I wish it was on everyday like a soap opera!!! And the way multiple story lines are being shown, is great!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I am merely finishing the series I started now. I've gotten to the point where I skim through the sex scenes to actually read the storyline.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I love the Downton Abbey series... But I really can't believe that they've done away with Matthew, he was one of the best characters!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series. The scenery is beautiful. The characters are a great fit for this show, and do a great job.
B001HN6922|3.0|I only bought this cause it was like 5.00 and to add to my Pixar Collection - lost alot of the goodness that made the !st one so awesome!  Not a terrible movie but not a great one by ay means either
B00271HAK8|5.0|I remember watching this back in the day when it was released and I thought it was funny. Even now it's still a great movie that my husband & I both enjoyed watching. The streaming quality was excellent with our Xbox 360 and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00A8KJN14|4.0|This Movie is pretty cool even though i think it is entirely in black and white (as was Coroline i believe?) I'm gonna give it 4 stars cause it's no Pixar film, but they set the bar pretty high.  Kids will like it cause its about a dog and adults might like it if they're into this kind of stuff  Threre really aren't too many animated movies i don't like so this might be a somewhat skewed review. Overall the movie was good, not great, not bad, just good - you really can't miss with this one, especially if you liked 9.
B00846F1YW|4.0|good game to pass the time. like the multiple levels.  wish some items didn't get hidden because of screen sis.
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|Not into writing large reviews, so this is straight to the point. Soilwork is one of my most listened to bands of the last 2 years, after having only really discovered their existence late. This album has very little filler, and is a decent mix of &#34;A Predators Portrait&#34; &#34;Natural Born Chaos&#34; as well as their later stuff. Speed's vocals are pretty excellent here, running the gamut from clean during some of the hookier chorus passages to screams and growls through most of the songs. I have always like that even when he is in screamo mode, I can actually understand what he is saying, and this goes all the way back to the really early stuff. This album is fantastic, great at top volume in the car, and I have to say ranks with the first two albums I mentioned above as one of my favorite efforts from these Swedes. If you like the whole range of their work, you will like this one. If you only like their first two albums, you should still like this. Give it a go - you wont be sorry.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I never thought a series about zombies could be good but The Walking Dead proved me wrong.  The central theme is interpersonal drama and the series is rather well written.  So far, the second season is the best but the third season is pretty good, better than the first.  The zombies are just a side note falling into the background.  The third season is hallmarked by the struggles of surviving a zombie apocalypse and the friction within the group of protagonists mixed with conflict with an antagonistic group.  Then, there are the struggles with morality and the loss of humanity.  However, some of the writing is a little soap opera cheesy, but forgivable.  Overall, the third season is entertaining and action packed, better than most of the shows on the major networks.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I really had a hard time putting it down. Good surprising twists kept me reading page after page!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Like the title of my review, the eighth season is not as good as the previous ones.  This season seems to be sleepy and lying down.  The absence of the character Bobby and the cameos of Castiel without the introduction of new endearing characters seem to create a void.  So far, this season is all about Sam and Dean and lacks the chemistry of the previous seasons, along with not being quite as funny, ironic, and irreverent, breaking the rules of screen writing and poking fun at themselves and clichés.  I keep on hoping this is the proverbial calm before the storm.  Perhaps they need to bring me in as a writer?<br /><br />Still, the eighth season is better than much of what is on TV, but not as good as previous seasons.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't have cable, so I love that I can watch my favorite show on amazon. Season 3 is the best yet!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so awesome. You can have your own dragons and care for them. Sometimes me and my friends<br />have a little competion to see who can get on the highest level. Totally buy this App!!
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Good book. The author's style is effortless and keeps you reading chapter after chapter. Unexpected ending! Excited to read the next one.
0307276902|4.0|Graphic, refreshing are a few words that come to mind. Enjoyed the book throughout. Would recommend. Oprah can't be wrong.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Is it the best Bond Ever? I'm not sure. But is it the best Bond for the 21st century. Absolutely. Daniel Craig has made the character his own. The genesis of what was familiar and is again came about organically and the exotic location and action packed sequence live up to the standards set. Recommended highly.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked it well enough mainly because it was different from most books out there . At times I was annoyed because Katniss wad being so weak when she started out in the beginning of the books as so strong and independent.  I also thought the love hate triangle was on the ridiculous side.  She's very judgemental when it suits her.  I was amused by the fact that she bonds with the cat.
B009MB682W|5.0|It's Bond! All original no substitutes. Too soon for Sky fall but all themes are there. Well worth the $10.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best app! Lots of cool ideas, diy, recipies, crafts, clothes, quotes and anything else you might be looking for!
0553382179|5.0|This book is better than all the organizational / self help books you'll ever find!  Should be a mainstay for every woman starting out in her own home!
0517548232|5.0|This book is a classic. In accessible language with great examples, Henry Hazlitt manages to pack dozens of complex lessons about economics into a short work. He explains the theoretical foundations of good economic policy and refutes common economic misconceptions. A wonderful, short read. A true classic.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|Loved this book......can't reommend it high enough......tense to the end . Can't wiat for this authors next book....5 stars, no doubt
B0054SMID0|4.0|somewhat predictable but entertaining nonetheless.  i got it for free on prime, but i would say it's also worth renting.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good story if a little rah-rah-America/CIA. Completely avoids the politics that lead to the crisis except for a short intro, but I know that wasn't the main purpose of the film. Enjoyable to watch even when the suspense is stretched to the point of the absurd once or twice. Great acting all around.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but really loved the book. It does a god job<br />of capturing how nostalgic we all feel as teens.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This movie is hilarious, no matter the age group. You can watch it with your lady friend (or man friend, depending on preference) or your baby sister (or brother, depending on availability)
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I loved this book and cant wait to read the rest of this trilogy.  Unique look at a mid 20th century Russian serial killer. Dark gritty and raw.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Sadly I had seen the show twice here n Australia, the great Australian tenors, Anthony Warlowe and Rob Guest, did the honours and to my mind, and ears, Warlowe was the best. Better than Michael Crawford who never seemed to be comfortable at the higher range.<br />I say 'sadly' 'cos this may have been more enjoyable for me if I had  seen the movie first. It was enjoyable, to a point. I note they added extra bits, like the sword fight in the cemetery. I guess if you have the freedom of a movie why not use it?<br />As an aside, my wife has seen the stage show here in Melbourne about a dozen times and agreed that Warlowe is the best.We also saw the sequel in London, 'Love never Dies'. At the time we thought maybe it should have. When it came to Melbourne with a new cast and Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the production they had put on here he evidently decided to take this version to Broadway. We saw it here in Melbourne. We agreed it was better that the London version, but still felt that Love Should have Died.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Final book to a series that was overall satisfying even if one had to suspend belief in parts. Fine Ya
0790729628|5.0|I have seen every version of this movie to date. There were some modifications to the original because trhe audiences on test screenings 'didn't quite get it'. In one version Ford has a voice over commentary and there were also some alterations to the ending.<br />I prefer it without the commentary from Ford, ditto the original ending. I like being made to think by some movies. Tinker Tailor evidently didn't get the kudos it deserved for the same reason, imagine having to think about the story and plot. Poor things.<br />The noir settings are great, the acting is first rate, I highly recommend it. Get all the versions and make up your own mind.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I really enjoy this series and the authors writing style, his writing style, world, and characters are intelligent and engaging.
6305388458|5.0|Probably one of the Python teams more comprehensible movie presentations, even with the Star Wars section. Everyone took it to be a send up of Christianity, it wasn't. A mickey take on the Gospels, it wasn't. It was a great send up and ridiculing of sectarianism. &#34;Follow the shoe&#34; , &#34;No, follow the gourd&#34;. &#34;We should all hop on one foot&#34;.<br />The various religious leaders attacked it and gave it the best pre opening promotions, ever. Imagine people telling you not to watch something! It didn't matter that most finally admitted they hadn't even seen the movie before their attack.<br />Go on, watch it. You can still go to heaven.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great series that is a must read for any fantasy or science fiction fan. Guaranteed to draw you in and not let go.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The dvd was the same quality as the one I had purchased in a store. The picture and sound quality were excellent. I would recommend this dvd to others.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A.wonderful series that immerses you in a dark and gritty world in strife and many vying for power. Must read series.
B007R0WHMK|1.0|This movie was a real waste of time and band-width. ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I think this is a great series,  I love his writing style and the dark gritty scenes. He is a master at his craft. Series may have slowed some but after reading Robert Jordan's Dragon Reborn series I am used to a lull in some books and think the overall piece speaks for itself.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. My fianc&eacute; and I read it together at night. it was a relaxing experience for the both of us.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Lack of a story and characters to draw you in and feel their emotions. I love apocalyptic novels and unfortunately this one falls short for me.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|One of those mindless puzzle games. Some are challenging, some levels are easy. Will be happy when a new world comes out
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Absolute crap. I have no idea how this drivel ended up on the bestseller list. That's my opinion. Badly written.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Love the game But for the third time I have opened it ti find it has reset to the beginning!  I was almost to great white. I am ready to just give it up now!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is so much fun and cool. you can feed wash clean the paddock and muck out the stalls. You can even by other horses and you can buy clothing for you and your horses! This game is awesome you should get it.
0920236162|3.0|I got this for my daughter. While I really was enthused about the writer's attempt at empowering girls and teaching them that they don't need to have a man to be happy and successful, the story wasn't all the engaging. We read it once and it has been sitting on the shelf and I doubt it will ever come off the shelf again.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This was a favorite book of my three boys when they were small. Now I've bought it for my first grandchild, and I KNOW it will be a favorite of hers too!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app to find and access files on my kindle.  Its easy to install and easy to use.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I love Muse and this CD is great!  It is very instrumental and interesting to listen to.  If you like &#34;Madness&#34; you'll definitely love this CD!
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|This is a great reworking of former releases. Thanks for a DVD this time that makes this release very special.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I loved &#34;Closer&#34; so I decided to buy the whole CD and I love it!  Great for workouts or passing the time.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Based on the trailer, I was expecting a &#34;Speed&#34; like adrenalin rush movie so I was surprised that this was a story about alcoholism and kind of a downer story all the way through. From a dramatic standpoint it was well done, Denzel Washington and Kelly Reilly did a good job. The movie held my attention all the way through and the ending was exactly right.
B001YXS7JI|5.0|One of my top 10 albums???? of all time. What a smooth sounding band.  Amazon down loads are great, you truly own the music unlike some of the other services
B005IQZB14|5.0|A woman an extreme adventure trying to workout her problems on the Pacific Coast Trail might not sound like a great book, but you would be very wrong to pass on this book based on that overview. This is a biography that reads as fiction so it is very pleasant reading all the way through. Ms. Strayed is does an incredible job of describing the trail, her journey, her agony (both on trail and off) and amusingly her absolute lust for Snapple lemonade.<br /><br />I had read about this book in a book review that peaked my interest and while this is not typically a book I would have grabbed, I am so glad I did. Definitely worth the read.<br /><br />Cheryl - thank you for telling us about your amazing adventure.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|great book  a bit different from the movie but the content is about the same.  great reading.  I would recommend the book greatly for a thrilling ride
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follet is among my favorite authors. mMy rating is reflective of how I would rate this book against his other books. This book is very well done. This historical fiction takes the reader from the events that lead up to WWII, right through the war. It gives your perspectives from Characters from America, England, Russia and Germany so you get a view from all sides. You'll learn things you did not know and the tale keeps you intrigued from beginning to end.<br /><br />Ken Follett in my opinion is one of the best authors of our time and his books stand the test of time. Read them all.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's generally a good game good gameplay,great graphics but the audio could be so much better it totally ruins the game.I'm a fan of the first but if you like a good game get it but if your picky I recommend the first.:(
B00BESM14U|5.0|Kind of an unexpected and a little dark - but has all the appealing elements of a good teenage coming of age / love story. The actors do a really nice job of being both believable and endearing. Their is also some really good song choices. Definitely worth watching.
0312983867|5.0|I love the Stephanie Plum series.<br />I listen to the audio books but I get these for my step daughter who loves the books in print.
B009K0P10K|4.0|This season differs from season 1 in that in incorporates a lot more action. Great story line though and Madelline Stowe is wonderful!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It can be tough to play and fills up a lot of time that would be boring. Just want to win
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Most of the games are fairly easy and you will be surprised at how much time you will spend in it. A great way to kill the time at appointments without having to reach for a magazine.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Whenever enough independent people have had the same type of experience, there seems to be something to it. (zombies etc) What the  truth is we will all find out won't we?
B009ETZNIC|5.0|A really good Mel Gibson romp! We'd seen this movie through Netflix but wanted a copy for our collection. We'll watch it once a year as we do all our favorites.
B009POCG2C|5.0|We felt this was a great movie.  Love the dry sense of humor that Clint Eastwood adds.  It can also be a tear jerker.
1451695195|5.0|A most extraordinary book! A book not to be kept gathering dust on the bookshelf, but to passed along to everyone who can appreciate this man's incredible journey. It is hopeful and uplifting. For anyone who even questions the hereafter I suggest you read this book. It's the real thing.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|Love Denzel Washington but really disliked this movie.  He is so much more than he portrays in this movie.  Makes you not want to fly.  Real disappointing.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Ryan is very enjoyable in this one.  Sandra does a good job.  I am a fan of both of these actors so I knew what to expect and what would be difficult for them.  Sandra struggles way more than Ryan.<br />I like the premise.  The script is good.  The scenes are funny.<br />The nude scene on my DVD is more nude than the trailer would suggest, but no privates are shown.  Ryan is a stud muffin to say the least and Sandra is more curvacious than I thought.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|It is a 3D cover on the front, Kind of cool, The only thing extra here is the Blu-ray 3D disk (which i really don't have a use for, but its nice i suppose). The only thing I found disappointing was the shipping, took longer than the estimated time, which amazon is usually very good about. Was referred to the Amazon prime from a friend, and I might end the trial now..<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed the film in theaters and My family and I are excited to FINALLY watch this movie at home.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was excited to come across a book that has over 4000 reviews, and still have 4.5 stars at that, so I knew it would be good...I didn't know it would be INCREDIBLE!  This book was NOT written hastily, it is apparent how well thought out and planned, and ultimately executed with every turn of the page.  The banter between the characters is also hilarious, especially at the beginning, I found myself laughing out loud so often I was happy I was just sitting on my couch reading it!  It is also a complete book from beginning to end (that can't be said for a lot of releases with similar young couples in the romance novel category around the same time frame) so that's worth a bonus star at this point too!  This was just a really good read, and would also be a really good movie too!
0783225733|1.0|And no such code/instructions are in the package, just lots of text promising \\"digital download included\\". I ordered it as a gift. There were several descriptions for this movie on Amazon, and I carefully selected the one I wanted, but in the cart and since my first clicks on the item, it seems they all resolved to this one description, now, which isn't mentioning the digital copy. Bogus.<br /><br />Update: okay, everyone has made a big effort to fix this problem, a refund, a download code, lots of groveling. Gee, I didn't really expect that. Thanks! The description I used to make the order is gone now and what remains is more clear that some of these DVDs do not have a download code with them.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good true story about Chris Kyle. Gives you a real feel for what the training and fighting was like. Kyle comes across as a real person-a regular guy. The fact that he died trying to help a fellow veteran gives the story a sad conclusion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game in the world it is a five star for me best characters in the world buy it it is totally worth it!!!!!!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|WOW awsome great story graphic novel made for you to watch i have the book so this was very good to watch glad that i got it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire but when I tried to run it all I got were solicitations to purchase other apps.  So I deleted it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I do wish that the Amazon app for iPad allowed Air Play.  Watching on my big screen would have been better than watching my iPad
B007REV4T8|4.0|The James Bond series finally gets an Oscar-winning filmmaker who imparts tremendous flair to the franchise. In fact, Sam Mendes gives \\"Skyfall\\" a directorial style not seen since Peter Hunt's \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\\" The result is a smashing (if slightly overlong) entertainment. Daniel Craig adds some much-needed humor to a no-nonsense 007 while Javier Bardem's stylish villainy transcends his underwritten role. \\"Skyfall\\" also provides a grand farewell for Judi Dench's M, who has considerably more screen time than previous installments. A notch below \\"Casino Royale\\" (2006), but still damn good Bond.
B00015N56U|2.0|I wanted to use this in the classroom. Totally inappropriate for classroom use since the female character runs around in full frontal &#34;seventies style&#34; nude! Even I was shocked, and I don't shock easily.
B0052OSTOS|3.0|I tired this and her voice doesn't make me relax much, but it was worth a shot. Now for extra words to make Amazon happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's like the best game I ever played. In my opinion I think it's way better then temple run. Because in temple run all your doing is jumping and sliding over and under things and in this game you can jump on trains collect cool things that can make you fly and jump higher and stuff like that. I think this the best game I ever played on the kindle fire...
B008742O32|5.0|I love this app, allows me to transfer files to my tablet and phone without cables or removing memory cards.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Jason and Percy are Both missing then greeks and some other group combine and might be a civil war or a Giant V.S. Greek and another group if  you don't know the other group its the Romans
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have fallen in love with these characters...need to know how this story ends...I have laughed and cried...magic mystery and love all you need in a good book
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game except for the fact that you can only go so far on entering new competitions then there is no more training and new competitions to enter.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Makes it easy to check the battery life. I highly recommend this app for the kindle fire hd. It's pretty accurate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The online setting is awesome. I can't stop playing. It's the best game ever. I would recommend this game for everyone. Unless you don't like games.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For a small, lightweight sharpener, this will fit the bill for a BOB, GHB or just for keeping handy in your tackle box for a &#34;gee, I need to sharpen this knife&#34; moment.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|This book was really o interesting. I read it for an English class, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to become familiar with Billy Pilgrim and his adventures.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Not particularly well-written.  The symbolism lacked subtlety.  The characters weren't really<br />fleshed out so I couldn't really empathize with any of them.  Regardless of how the book may<br />have brought attention to some problems with our foster care system,  the main character<br />just wasn't believable to me.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|This movie is magnificent. Three decades of aging, and Criterion delivers it to us after a thorough restoration, which the director happens to love. I will be talking it up for the rest of my life. I will buy it as a gift for people I love. Everyone who respects my opinion will hear about it. I can't begin to talk about the specifics of content. I don't want to name the great movies that this one exceeds. I only want to say that you have not seen anything if you have not experienced this. Right, it requires a commitment of attention. We of this decade are not accustomed to this kind of serious art... made available to the masses. I don't even want to say too much about the core theme. But, I will: it is about money versus human beings. Where have I heard about that? The movie holds the truth of the ages. How does that sound? Too much? Wrong. ...The truth of the ages. There is much reason to weep, to laugh, and most of all to learn. I had to pause... for a few minutes now and then to recover my calm viewing mode. What an amazing thing it is. Blu-ray is the only way to go. The sound is unbelievable. Music in itself is an unforgettable experience.The commentary disc is excellent. There it is... push a button and it will come to your mailbox. What a world. Thank you Criterion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Type in for the seed normal . It is a diamond seed! So much more seeds like everything. The word everything is a seed.
B0019NB9A2|4.0|A friend of mine once opined that the worst thing to happen to the porno video business was High Definition discs. &#34;Who wants to see every little pore and flaw on somebody's skin?&#34; While I can't comment on THAT particular use of Hi-Def, I CAN say that watching Forbidden Planet on Blu-ray for the first time made for some slightly disillusioning moments, among many more of delight. Given the films age I'm willing to cut it some slack. Even with the obvious nature of most of the movie's special effects (which, at the time, were groundbreaking), great storytelling still shines through so, regardless of the sketchy animation or occasional cheesy miniatures, I can still enjoy the film for what it is - an intelligent, well-written, and totally entertaining Sci-Fi movie. (I disagree with whoever it was who called it the FIRST great Sci-Fi movie. That list of possibilities is long. Think &#34;Things to Come&#34;, &#34;The Day the Eart Stood Still&#34;, etc.) Other folks have described its Shakespearean origins and bemoaned Walter Pidgeon's scenery chewing, but Forbidden Planet still stands the test of time. Would I have appreciated more extras on the disc? Sure, but I'll give this one a hearty recommendation nevertheless.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead is a fantastic show that follows a group of people and show what they have to deal with during a zombie plague. It does a great job of balancing the action scenes with the drama of how this catastrophe affects the characters' hearts and minds. The action scenes and times when the group come upon remains can be very graphic, so prepare for that if you have small children or a weak stomach.
1400052181|5.0|I like this book very much, just from the first page I read, I became fascinated by this book and could not helping reading it.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I was really enjoying the game until I hit a spot I just cannot get past. with no skip feature I will have to stop before I get to the finish. disappointing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Intense book , well done , very informative . You see first hand what our troops are going through in those two horrible wars .<br /><br />It is sad that the young man after going through so much had to be killed by an American  lunatic . Chris was a true American hero .
B00062PN6I|4.0|These headphones sounds great.  Got bass if you want it and are crystal clear.  I would def. recommend these.  Great Buy!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I almost didn't finish this book. The first 150 pages were and boring, but I am not one to not finish a book. After the first 150 or so pages the book came alive even my 13 year old daughter sat and listened to it with me. This was our first audio book we both love reading, we have decided we like audio books and this one was wonderful to sit read and imagine. The story of PI is heart breaking, courageous, and inspiring. We really liked this book. It got 4 stars because of how it started .
1402270275|4.0|Since the death of her father Honoria has had to work hard to provide for her siblings and keep her family together. Desperation has brought them to the seedy Whitechapel district where she hopes they can remain hidden from the prying eyes of the Echelon but instead they catch the attention of Blade, the undisputed master of the rookeries. Blade knows everything that happens in Whitechapel and he knows exactly who Honoria is and why she is hiding. He offers her his protection but it could come at a price she isn't willing to pay. How much is Honoria really prepared to sacrifice for her freedom and the safety of her siblings?<br /><br />Kiss of Steel is a fabulous historical paranormal romance with a side order of steampunk and it makes for a great start to the London Steampunk series. It has a dark and gritty feel to it that reminded me of Kristen Callihan's Darkest London series (another series I'd highly recommend although that one doesn't include the steampunk elements). The story is heavily focused on the romance which meant the world building wasn't quite as strong as it could have been but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. There were times when I found myself a little confused about the difference between blue bloods, the Echelon and actual vampires but I think I got it all straight in my head by the end of the book. I've come to expect a little confusion at the start of a new series when I'm getting to grips with a new world so that didn't bother me too much and now that the rules have been established I think the series will just continue to get stronger with each instalment. Even though the romance plays a heavy role in the story there were still plenty of other things going on and I found it very difficult to put the book down because I just had to know how everything was going to play out.<br /><br />One of the main strengths of this book was the characters, I was able to respect Honoria for the way she is so fiercely protective of Lena and Charlie (her sister & brother). She will do whatever it takes to make sure they are safe from the reaches of the Echelon who would just take them as blood slaves. Honoria is smart, strong and unwilling to back down without a fight. She may be down on her luck but she isn't broken and she has too much pride to go begging. Blade is the kind of alpha we've come across many times before in paranormal romance but that didn't stop me falling for his charms. He has a bad reputation but underneath it he is a decent guy who just wants to be left alone to live his life as he sees fit. He has a small group of friends who are incredibly loyal but he has earned their trust and he would give his life to keep them safe. I enjoyed the flirty banter between Blade and Honoria and loved the way their relationship develops throughout the story as she slowly learns that she can trust Blade to help her and her siblings.<br /><br />Alongside the main characters we have been introduced to an interesting group who will each get to take their turn centre stage in future stories and I'm looking forward to getting to know them all better in as the series continues. If you enjoyed Kiss of Steel then make sure you read the follow up novella Tarnished Knight which is currently available to read for free on Bec McMaster's website and fits into the time line between this book and Heart of Iron (due to be published in May). I'd recommend Kiss of Steel to fans of historical and / or paranormal romance, you don't have to be familiar with steampunk to enjoy the story and this could be a good gateway book for people who enjoy PNR and have yet to test the steampunk waters. This is a series I definitely plan to continue reading and I can't wait to see where the journey takes us next.er & brother).

015601386X|5.0|I've been trying to find some classic, wonderful German texts and this is at the top of my list. This German edition is simply wonderful!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I found this book to be a real page turner.Author really captured how hostile the enviroment is on Mars and how any little mistake could spell the end for the main character.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This was one of the best stories I have read in a long time.  I consider myself quite astute at guessing endings - I would never have guessed this.  A very good read - right until the last word.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I must say that reading this book is something that I had to do in my life, like putting a check mark. Although I didn't know that before reading it, of course. I just finished the whole book and couldn't take anything else to read today because I feel that I need time to process everything that I have read.<br /><br />I liked the narration of the book. The author most of the time disappears and uses a simple historical narrative to give the first place to the subject itself, that is, the things that happened to Jobs and his relatives, friends, coworkers, and his projects and companies. But there are some few but awesome moments when the author suddenly elaborates conclusions or compares the things that happened in the beginnings with the final outcome of Jobs or his projects, giving valuable insight about how things happen sometimes in life. He has his art, although he is very measured about not overusing it. The result: I enjoyed a book that is historically detailed and true but also well written as a beautiful novel. I truly recommend it to anyone.
B009CVAUIU|5.0|I read the ebook version. . .<br /><br />It is a novel of unbelievable systemic cruelty and hope.  I have no idea if this book comes even close to the truth, but I do know it is incredibly moving.<br /><br />The ending is obvious once you start to read the book, and really, the only ending possible.  As a result, I found myself disengaging and slowing down my reading, trying to avoid the end of the book.  But I was unable to stop reading completely, it was just too engrossing.<br /><br />It's hard to write about without leaving spoilers all over this review.  But read it, especially if you are feeling a bit sorry for yourself for whatever reason. I don't care what your situation is, you  do not live in North Korea, and that makes you a winner by any standard.
B001LF347E|5.0|This has become one of my favorite TV shows. If you love fantasy or the Merlin mythology, it is definitely worth getting. The commentary from the actors is entertaining and the bonus features are great.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I've heard great things about this game from friends, but for whatever reason, it won't download on my kindle!  This must be fixed, I desperately want to play this.
B007V65R54|4.0|The first section of the book, which covers real-life examples, provides much to consider, learn, and think over. One cannot help but be impressed not only by Silver's insights and analytic capabilities, but also his intellectual breadth and engaging writing style. The latter part of the book, however, attempts to present action items but lacked the energy and power of the initial chapters; i found this part of the book to be less than compelling and started to lose interest.  Still very much worth reading, not only for its science and math but moreover for its analysis of important current global topics.
0767020308|4.0|We have 3 different movie versions of this story. I like this one best. It has additional scenes compared to the others. Mr. Knightly is played very well.
B0063M22QO|5.0|great game can't get enough<br />Enjoy all the different layouts really challenging<br />if you add a tournament I go for it<br />having fun playing
B004G600A4|5.0|We purchased this movie after seeing it at the theater. It is a good one to watch with our grand-kids.
B00APUTEBG|4.0|This movie had movement of it's own in action presentation. I couldn't predict the next scene. I couldn't anticipate the end. Still, it was a smooth ride taking me everwhere a movie, of this calibre, should go. Check it out and thank me later.....MLJ
B008X9Z37A|5.0|The leather protector looks great and indeed makes the Kindle Fire easier to handle while protecting it.  I chose the red one.

B006OOHYIC|4.0|Very good, however if you need a hint, , they keep raising the limit, as you progress.  It gets very difficult, but you can find the solutions on facebook, you just have to remember them. Very good logic game, since I am a senior I need these kind of games.

B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Cute show. Fun to watch. Likely not an Oscar contender.<br /><br />I would recommend this for any viewer. Humor, action, good range of emotions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So good. Very addictive, always trying for the daily challenge or the next line of coins.in my opinion it is miles better than temple run.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to continue the series after Bared To You. I got a little tired of Eva's childish inner dialog. But then my curiosity got the better of me. I HAD to find out what happened to Gideon as a child. Wow. What a ride.<br /><br />When I finished this book, (2 minutes ago) I screamed &#34;Nooooooooo&#34;  when I went to buy the next book and saw that it doesn't come out until June.  I will be counting the days.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|The series normalizes phenomenon and replicates a deductive process that pulls from several hard science and soft science disciplines. The personality profiles are realistic and the relationships each character develop are consistent with each character's psyche.

B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Photoshop touch is awesome... as long as you are familiar with Photoshop. I had a little difficulty at first with figuring out the UI, but after about a half hour I was as comfortable with it as I've ever been on a PC. I didn't need the tutorials, but I can certainly see how some folks might; this is definitely not some cheep-o $0.99 app made for casual users or children. Definitely recommend using a stylus for this app, as it is difficult to select pixels with any accuracy using your fingers. All of the essentials are there, including the coveted magic wand select tool! I love this program, and would say that this is the best $10 you could dump into your kindle.

1609613937|3.0|I saw this book in the library and thought Wow, good reading. After I got into the book and read it, I found much that I disagreed with. He seems to be going against all mainstream, current nutrition rules and I found some of his ideas startling.<br /><br />Like his suggestion on Page 173-174 that there be no limitation of salt added to foods at the table.I know one man who adds as much as 1 tsp. of salt to his food just from the salt shaker. The author must not have seen the study from Finland where the government restricted regular salt and had the people use a salt substitute and the rate of heart disease dropped 60%. I believe in America we use too much salt. He is against supplements except for B12. Well, he is right here, a complete vegan diet does not have B12 in it. However, I believe the use of herb and herbal formulas is ok.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed with what I read. At first I thought Wow, I can have potatoes again. (I'm diabetic and was told to stay away from starchy foods as they raise the blood sugar.) If I ate the way he advocates, my sugars would to  too high, I know I've tried it. Actually I found this book a real disappointment. It makes interesting reading, but I don't agree with him. -- Author, Valerie Lull, Ten Healthy Teas

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this production of Jane Eyre.  I was a bit curious about viewing it as a Masterpiece Theatre presentation rather than a movie. I must say I was so very surprised!  The actors portrayed their characters perfectly.  The settings, musical score and costumes were great.<br />I will be, actually I have already started my own library of Masterpiece Theatre productions and also of British movies.<br />I am hooked on period drama stories and classics.  I would certainly recommend this version.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Oh my goodness!!!! I was absolutely bowled over by this movie!  I loved it, loved it, loved it.....<br />Everything about this presentation was done beatifully.  Matthew MacFadyen is absolutely perfect as the aristocratic Mr. Darcy.<br />His acting, to me, did not present a haughty, unfriendly man, but rather a shy, lonely soul who hides behind his class expectations and mannerism.  By watching his reactions, with those very melancholy eyes, (believe me I have watched those eyes a number of times!) you get to truly know him.  He does not need to speak.....his expressions say it all.  Of course, his voice is one of the most beautiful masculine voice I have ever heard!  Bravo Matthew!  Keira is spot on!  She too can convey her feelings with her expressions and mannerism.  I have watched this movie at least 3 times, and will certainly watch it again and again.  Every time I watch it I pick up some more nuances I had missed before.  The rest of the ensemble was just as excellent portraing their characters.  Buying this movie, was certainly money well spent.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun and relaxing game ^_^ very enjoyable and interactive. It's also a fun learning experience.<br />I really enjoy it
B008VVT51U|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable and enchanting movie, the trailers didn't do this movie justice portraying it as a flighty comedy.  Sure, it had its comedic moments, most delivered by the brilliant Bill Nighy's self effacing words and gestures, as well as Maggie Smith's crotchety, cringe inducing racial slurs.  At its heart, however, it is poignant and utterly charming.
B005HEDIHG|3.0|We enjoy watching Star Trek very much.  Unfortunately we keep having playback issues.  We cannot watch more than 5-10 seconds of an episode before the screen freezes and a message tells us we are having playback issues.  We've followed the instructions to update our player but still have the problem.  Repeated calls to Amazon have also failed to alleviate this problem.  We've been told that technicians are working on it.<br /><br />Plan B, we downloaded the Amazon App to our iPad.  We found out that this app does not support playback using hdmi, meaning we have to watch it on the small screen while our tv screen is blank.<br /><br />Like I said, we enjoy watching Star Trek...if we can actually watch an episode.

B004XVMCMQ|5.0|If you like movies from this time period you will love this movie. I hope to fine more movies like this one.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|step back and get to know one of country music's finest in this film. I recommend this movie to people of all ages who enjoy biographical films, country music - or Jaoquin and Reese. They both did a fantastic job portraying Johnny and June (they each respectively learned and performed the songs as well). not a perfect love story but an honest and faithful one.

B004ZGI2KK|4.0|see the darker side of the classic fairytale... perhaps one more honest to the original telling. there is a dangerous secret that no one wants to talk about but everyone fears. everyone wants to be brave and fight it....but what is &#34;it&#34;? or who is &#34;it&#34;? when a priest comes and gets the small village to look and consider each other as the feared werewolf, who do you trust? what is &#34;it&#34; really after?<br /><br />this film keeps you guessing along with Amanda Seyfried's character - it was suspenseful and entertaining.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Great fun.  We don't have &#34;tv&#34; anymore.  We just get the shows we like to watch...no commercials and we can watch them when we want.  We missed lots of these when they were on.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is truly action packed and right from the beginning it pulls you in dares to look away.  Fantastic cast of actors and actresses make for great drama as well.  Stephen Amell pours his heart and soul into portraying Oliver Queen and it truly shows how much he enjoys playing this character!  I cannot say enough good about this show!  Long may it stay on the air!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fast read. Kept my attention with its many twists and turns! The characters were likeable. I've enjoyed all of the authors books.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is perhaps the best and worst experience of my life. While reading this book I found myself asking questions and reflecting on my own life. As Ana grew and evolved I felt as though I grew with her. I have found this is more than just a book, but a lesson to us all to look deeper than the surface. I would recommend this book to anyone capable of reading. Men and woman alike have a lot to learn from this masterpiece.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Glad to see that the James Bond frachise got back to the old school Bond.  Q makes a return as does Moneypenny.  Lots of surprises.  I have seen all the Bond films and find this one to be the best.  I still love Connery as Bond best, but this was the best movie.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is another great book for all of the kids who love the diary of a wimpy kid series. The 6th book of the series is a very funny book. If you've read the other books of the series this will be a good book to do a book report with. It has an easy concept.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I can see where someone who attended the concert would be disappointed that not all songs performed are included on this DVD.  Considering The Beach Boys did not make it to my city, I loved this DVD.  It was great to see David Marks playing guitar solos and to hear the harmonies of them all together.  While I wish it was a full concert, I do not regret buying this DVD.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This is one  of the better young adult books that I enjoyed.  The characters are very believe able and like able too.
B006YC74E8|4.0|Its not a perfect piece of software, bu tit does let you do basic editing and you can actually take a picture with the kindle.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|This book is full of humour with lots of action from people who just happen to run to each other through interesting circumstances.
0811876373|5.0|This was a great vendor and a quick response to my order. I appreciated the care of the packaging and loved the product.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|We've just watched the first two episodes but found it an enjoyable, sweet, well-cast, well-acted program.  Excited to watch the rest of the series.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Thought  this was very readable.  It seemed like a very believable story except for the part about Jo.  Didn't quite fit in.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Really enjoyable read, you can associate with a plethora of 80's music, movies and computer technology during the era throughout the book. A fantastic possible future where we are all hooked on a virtual Oasis, maybe version one of the Matrix? It's an enthralling read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was a wonderful addition. This DvD helped me to catch up to the third season that's currently being shown.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I've seen this guy in concert and read all the whacky magazine articles, and did not expect such a good biography from a supposed monster. You get to understand that Marilyn Manson and the band are more about artist shock tactics, than endorsing real harm.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just what I expected.  The classic game works great. Not much else to say it works. Thanks for this guys
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I found this biography and story compelling, you just can't believe that somewhere else in this world people are born into a prison and taught to hate their own family. Shocking, eye opening, and you just want to read on to see where it all leads to. Amazing story, read it and try to compare on the bad things that might have happened in your life - it won't compare!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a pick for my book club and we all loved it.  What a great story of relationships and how some crazy folk gravitate toward someone they envision as the leader of a cause.  The cause becomes the cause but Harold held his own in the end.  A delightful story in every way.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Doctor Who, Season 4, is fantastic. The civilized Universe is continually beset by rampant idiocy and the Doctor is there to save it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I enjoy this app on my kindle fire because there is no fluff. Easy to navigate and simple interface. Would recommend to any ebayer. I also enjoy the updates provided even while I'm not on ebay.

B00846REIS|5.0|I liked it more than 50 Shades!!  Its a great book to take your mind off of everyday happenings in life.
B008JFUTT0|4.0|Just watch it and get ready for an emotional journey of a humble artist who's message and music survives another time and place beyond America that encourages a movement to lead a country to rejoin humanity. Beautiful and Poetic.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|I could listen to this album over and over, I loved them since I was 11 and still love them at 28.
B001YV502C|5.0|I love this movie! So prophetic and detailed. Also waaaaaay better than the book by PD James but still worth the read.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|A great look at the better side of humanity.  An amazing story about faith, our culture and love.  Worth the watch.
B000PNAHQY|5.0|This is a great series for introducing the classics to new readers.  The text is larger and every other page is a black and white illustration that helps explain the text.  The reading level is 4-5th grade which is not only easy for  a young reader but is also very good for English-as-a Second -Language readers.
0767812166|5.0|Again my whole family enjoyed this movie.  I have loaned this movie out to other family members and now they would like to order it.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Two words...for Chris Kyle...posthumously...Thank You...<br />I wouldn't say more, but there is a word minimum. I will add however that I enjoyed hearing about his life from his wife's POV. She contributed nicely to the book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app helps me keep track of all my sales and buys its awesome. It alerted me and gives me fast reaction with this app then goijgvto my computer waiting for it to load and yhisxjudt makes it so much easy.
0547848412|4.0|My wife and I recently read “Life of Pi” together.  It was enjoyable and entertaining but a bit too long and got repetitive toward the end.  The story is incredible and hard to believe, but it is written so convincingly and in such detail that we had to verify it was indeed fiction.
B0000CFW87|5.0|My CD got destroyed, I loved this CD and could only find it here.  So I had to replace my damaged one.
B008JFUTT0|4.0|We had never heard of Rodriguez until we saw his story on &#34;60 Minutes&#34; which whetted our appetite to know more about him.  So, we ordered the movie from Amazon.com.  We enjoyed it, too, but not quite as much as the short &#34;60 Minutes&#34; segment.  Nevertheless, we’ve subsequently downloaded all of Rodriguez’s music from Amazon into our iPod and are enjoying it very much.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|A simply beautiful production, excellent acting. Must see.  I love that it is longer and has more details from the book than other versions I have seen.
1400160332|5.0|My wife got me the audiobook version of this for Valentine's Day, and I love it. Dr. Ferguson examines money as a social tool, or more accurately, how the very concept of money and related items (credit, bankruptcy, loansharking, etc, etc...) have evolved over time and led to changes in society. This is not a &#34;get rich&#34; book. It is not an investment book. It is a historical look at the dynamics which driven the evolution of money, as well as how the evolution of money has permitted our society to advance and grow.<br /><br />While the subject is, indeed, complex, Ferguson writes it with such plain and straightforward language that even a high school drop-out would understand fully what is being discussed. However, that is not to say this is a simple book. The subject is deep, but the author uses humor and language that is real-world for the average American.<br /><br />And, the historical overview and background of the subjects is, in my opinion, fascinating.<br /><br />If you like History, or the subject of money, or to simply learn something new, this book would be a good choice.
B004TB6GUY|3.0|Listen when you want a fireside sip with soothing bls.  Cool guitar play as usual.  Showcases zakk's versatility which you'd never know if just listening to blessed hell ride or the like.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A very good follow up to the first book!!! Very well written by Larson and I can't wait to read book 3.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love series and the picture on the HD Fire is fantastic!!!!  I can't wait for the series to start again.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a very fun game! Most of these reviews are sort of hating on the game. Personally it is Fun and I also recommand Bakery Story.
1608955702|5.0|Just finished this book - one of the most helpful I've read in a while. I am relatively new to using flash and have been reading a number of books on the subject as well as browsing through sites on the web. The explanations and examples in this book finally presented things in such a way that I feel as though I had a light bulb moment - actually more than one. The book is more about technique than equipment but that is just the type of information I need at this point. Yes, some of the photos and information have been presented on Neil's website but what I found particularly helpful was having them laid out in book form, in logical progression. I really enjoy the website but I've often felt that I needed the information as I found it in this book. What may wind up being the most important thing, thanks to Neil, is that I find myself looking at and studying the effect and quality of light with nearly rapt attention as I go through my day.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a gripping murder mystery that kept me wanting to know who did it. The ending was not expected.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love it but I hate that it freezes so often... I have to keep reinstalling it. I've started just downloading two to three puzzle packs at a time. But I must say I'm addicted. And my students love playing also!
B00AN93Q0O|4.0|This album is my first introduction to 21 pilots, and as a whole, it's pretty good. My standout tracks are Holding On To You, Car Radio, and Fake You Out.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first season to this series was great.! Shows you why the 2 brothers became hunters and it had very good storytelling and action. The bond between the brothers is very well done. Series is very dark but entertaining. A very good series to addt o your collection.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a really good book. I really liked it. I`'ll recommend it to any one who likes diary of a wimpy kid.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|A good follow up to the first season. The cliffhanger from season one is answered. You meet a lot of interesting players in this season and the main vilian is no joke. A must buy series if you are into good action and a well told story.
B0063TX06I|5.0|Sound and quality are great! Love all the songs on this CD. The bee Gees are so entertaining. Their song writing, singing, smiles and energy are what makes them so special.
B00B2064IY|4.0|right off the bat, the very first cut had me hooked and interested in listening to the rest of the offering.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very unusual book by Nicholas Sparks. Not at all his typical book.  But ······Awesome and very worth reading. Suspenseful, romantic, and thrilling.

B00AEFYCL4|1.0|Watched this movie about 3/4 of the way and got bored.Must add that there are some beautiful scenery to be appreciated.But agree with the one review that happiness is here , within.It is very commendable that a person went to live a life that they belief.Sadly can't watch a movie that you just watch for the sake of it , not because you want to

B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I'm pushing 50... and a fan of Lizard-era Crimson, Fragile-era Yes, Trick of the Tail-era Genesis, etc.  I picked up on Steve's work about 5 years ago with Porcupine Tree and was blown away with what he was doing... I can't believe I had never heard of what he was doing over in the UK across the ocean.  It was like finding my musical savior.<br /><br />Since then I have followed Steve's every move, and have rarely been disappointed.  When I heard that this album had Alan Parsons as the engineer my mind was blown (go listen to \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\") and I could not wait to hear it... well, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me was the sound... its so clear and crisp its unbelievable.  I haven't heard that since I sold my realistic record player about 20 years ago.  Then there are the tasty jams this group plays... sooo many of them all over the place.  The talent here is amazing and I have to credit Steve with pulling them all together under one roof to produce something so beautiful and organic sounding.<br /><br />I am so thankful that there is someone championing the kind of listening experience that was once commonplace among audiophiles.  If you have any appreciation for serious music you should give this record a spin.

B007REV4T8|5.0|I have seen every, and I mean every Bond film (including the American tv version of Casino Royal) as well as the David Niven version from the 60s.<br /><br />Goldfinger was the, dare I say, gold standard of Bond films.  Sean Connery WAS James Bond for many of us.  I thought Daniel Craig did an outstanding job in Casino Royal.<br /><br />Here, he surpasses that movie.  I do believe that Goldfinger and Sean Connery have been replaced as the gold standard.  Javier Bardem is a totally creepy villain - maybe not as creepy as in No Country for old Men, but darn close.  Has he found a new calling for playing bad guys?<br /><br />I really like that they cut down on the gimmicks and actually had a good story.<br /><br />This is a super movie.  The question for the future is who will they get to replace Daniel Craig when he decides to step down?

B008K7WCJM|5.0|The fact that this album is two hours long and that I wasn't ready for it to be over should tell you everything you need to know.<br /><br />Just by chance, the morning after I bought this album I found myself working alone in a windswept, snow covered field.  I popped in my head phones and let the Seer wash over me.  My mind is officially blown. The perfect album in a perfect setting to hear it for the first time.<br /><br />Next time I experience it, I plan on doing so in a darkened room with a candle or two, a pair of large speakers, and a few pints of high gravity India Pale Ale. I can't wait.<br /><br />PS. I'd never even heard of Swans until I caught a portion of the song &#34;Mother of the World&#34; on NPR a couple days ago. Now I'm a fan.
B00354Y9ZU|2.0|Not a bad little pep talk, but for a 200 page book I was disappointed by how much his enthusiasm outweighed any actual insight he had to lend. I've enjoyed some of his talks and interviews, but this is basically a loose, long-form rant that an editor could have tightened up into a compelling ten minutes.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I went with how many reviews this book had and I bought it. Wasn,t disappointed to much. Good story I thought it got a little boring at times. I will probably will read another one some time in the future. If you like mystery you will probably enjoy it. Good reading

B000JQUHLM|5.0|Awesome book perfectly fits the the first book funny and romantic in A way. Right from the beginning l kind of got that feeling that Jimmy was the lost Jamie . Almost wish the book could go on forever.<br /><br />Even though I'm not that old I've read more books then most people twice my age, and l still find great beauty and character in old English and Greek, although I do admit it could have done with a few tweaks here and there and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make the love connections the basic fundamentals was still pretty good and if it was the sequel to anything but Pollyanna it probably wouldn't have cut it for me but it was Pollyanna and therefore I give it five stars.

0307341577|3.0|**This review contains spoilers**<br /><br />While I enjoyed this book, I think it fell just a wee bit short in a few areas. It is defintely a complex book, and it took me a while to compose my thoughts about what I felt \\"went wrong\\".<br /><br />For me, the strength of the two main characters comes into question several times during the book. Libby's character starts out strong. She is dark, unmotivated, reserved, a shell living with no purpose what so ever. Through the course of the book, she finds motivation in the most unexpected of places - solving the mystery of who murdered her family. While her initial approach to this mystery is money oriented, she rather quickly becomes engrossed in finding the answer. An answer to a mystery 20 years old, that her entire life she has refused to think about. Obviously the money is her motivation, but I find it difficult to believe that this tiny woman, who is afraid of everything, removed from society, unwilling to help herself, let alone another human being is coaxed into the fervor she finds herself in looking for the answer. I just don't feel the metamorphosis she experiences is detailed in the book.<br /><br />I also find Ben difficult to grasp. In one flashback we are led to feel sorry for Ben as the misguided son with no father figure living in severe poverty and mocked by his peers. He expresses disdain for those who mock him and avoids putting himself into positions where it may be possible. Only to learn in the next flashback that his girlfriend and newly found friends also treat him with the same disdain he refuses to accept from others. At one point we see the ginger hearted adolescent willing to help then contrasted by an erratic and uncommunicative son. We learn he has dark thoughts through drawings found (that are never explained in the book leading us to believe he may have in fact been capable of the darkness that surrounds the murders), but also that he has aspirations of fatherhood and the future. Then we see the potential he has for violence and his own realization and fear of that beast within him, but mere hours later witness him cower in fear during the murders.<br /><br />Finally, I found the ultimate reasoning for the murders to be so off the beaten path of where the book began. These horrific murders that altered so many lives happened because two women wanted to protect their families, not some sinister Satanic cult, or a drunken ex-husband or traumatized adolescent. The author taunts us through the novel with perspective murderers (I think a couple times too many) only to explain them by a case of \\"wrong place wrong time\\".
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these a few weeks ago because no earbud has ever stayed in my ears. I had also started going to the gym and really needed some headphones that would stay secure. These are perfect. They fit in my ears very well and are small enough that the headband part isn't super noticeable. I don't know much about sound quality but I certainly don't have anything bad to say about it. They are very comfortable and easy to forget I'm wearing and they don't pinch my head or anything, which is nice when I'm studying. I would definitely recommend, especially for such a cheap price.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  Surprised at how funny it was. Alan Arkin should have win best supporting actor for his film.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I know I am late to the &#34;Sherlock&#34; party, but now that I am here, I love it!  The acting is absolutely amazing.  Every word, movement, eye twitch, and tick just adds to the richness and complexity of the characters.

0345495004|5.0|Frank Lloyd Wright is a towering figure of 20th Century architecture and his influence is still strongly felt well into the 21st Century. His persona includes such descriptives as genius, arrogant, crank, stubborn, eccentric, and ambitious to a fault. But, \\"romantic\\" or, even \\"lover\\" is a not a characteristic one would ever think of when describing Frank Lloyd Wright. Yet, thanks to this beautifully rendered novel by Nancy Horan, clearly Wright was a man . . . who in spite of being devoted to his large family, he was also susceptible to the unpredictable attraction to another woman. In my own opinion, very few details of this book should be revealed in a review. This is a beautiful love story, about a very remarkable woman, and true to his reputation . . . a remarkable man too. This is a book that must be discovered page by page, without anticipation of where you are going, or what happens next. When two married people, with children and loving spouses--find themselves irresistibly attracted to each other, then one must expect turmoil, heartache, and yet enduring passion and devotion may also emerge. Wright and his lover were complex people, with complicated lives, yet to share their story is a journey of the heart. One that will resonate and haunt a reader long after you have read LOVING FRANK.

0062238868|5.0|Good Read.  Perhaps cold hearted to most normal non military people.  But this hero did take out more than 160 enemies. It is a tragedy that he in turn was murdered by a soldier he was trying to help with PTSS
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I loved every minute of it!!!  Very good portrayal of Vikings.  Very entertaining and I can't wait for next weeks episode!!!
B00B2064IY|5.0|Everyone should own this ! I listened to the disc in its entirety one time last evening...and another this am with breakfast....it certainly is infectious.<br />Being a 30+ year electric guitar player, and huge fan of all guitar oriented music, I have to say that this new release is spectacular. There are classic Jimi vibes everywhere here, some unexplored tones from his Marshall amps, and some rarely heard background singing. This is a must have for all Hendrix fans, guitar players, and anyone who wants to break out of the normalcy of their current crop of ear candy.  The quality of the recording is very nicely mixed and with a good set of headphones or speakers, you will think you were sitting on the couch in the studio.  His signature, cutting edge guitar techniques are everywhere here, sweet chord progressions, trills, fills and bends galore. A pioneers pioneer, if you will ! I will not go over track by track as it is not my thing, rather than cover the overall &#34;feel&#34; and &#34;tone&#34; that came from this release. So with that, Thank you Mr. James Marshall Hendrix for what you did and what you continue to do....inspire and amaze us ! This was released on my departed Fathers birthday, so it meant that much more to me.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I watch this again and again and it still cracks me up. Blu-ray was cheaper on amazon than anywhere else. The scene where they're tripping out is one of the funniest ever.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Better than the movie...by a long shot!  I couldn't put this book down, from start to finish.  Only took me a day and a half to finish.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was really critical of my initial viewing of Skyfall. Every Bond movie falls into a pattern, each scene an ingredient polarizing into a fast, fun film. We always have huge charismatic villains, beautiful femme fatales, wonderful toys, and exotic locations.<br /><br />And the cars.<br /><br />But Skyfall didn't fit most of the pattern. Sure, they bring back the original Bond Car. But there was no femme fatal. We didn't even get any gadgets. But we got a really creepy and powerful villain. So, I stepped back and watched it for a second time. And that's when it hit me. Skyfall is meant to be a look inside who Craig's Bond really was. And that difference between other Bond movies thrusts Skyfall into one of the best Bond stories, if not the best Bond film. No spoilers -  just give it a go. I can compare Skyfall to Jim Butcher's novel Changes - everything is shaken to the core to get a peek at real motivations and the human fighting spirit conquering all.<br /><br />Special Features are some of the best I've seen on a BD release since 2011. Tons of behind the scenes, comparisons to previous Bond films, as well as very enjoyable commentary tracks.<br /><br />Of course, Bond will return. I just hope he can match this new benchmark of the series.

B007C3TVNA|2.0|There's no question that this movie is brilliantly made: great to look at and superbly acted, qualities which made it the 15th most mentioned movie in 2011 critics' Top 10 lists. But does it make an ounce of sense in terms of actual human psychology? Fact: there are no children like Kevin, who as an infant behaves like a psychopath when he's with his mother but normally with everyone else, especially his father (which prevents anyone from believing that he's a monster). Fact: the film emphasizes that Eva had severe trouble bonding with Kevin before his psychopathy emerged, strongly suggesting a causal relationship, but that's complete nonsense. Psychopathy is a neurological defect that has nothing to do with the quality of parenting, and to even suggest that it does is a reversion to the days when autism and schizophrenia were blamed on bad mothering. Fact: while there's reason to believe that Eric Harris of Columbine and Andrew Golden (Jonesboro, 1998) were psychopaths, they represent a distinct minority of school shooters, and both recruited accomplices; so the notion of a psychopathic lone school shooter is at best a stretch. Fact: the parents of school shooters have never been ostracized or persecuted by their community (as happens here, and it's a major plot point).<br /><br />So what we have here is a film that *given a sufficient knowledge of psychology* (which clearly is not the case for many critics and fans of critically acclaimed movies) is no more realistic or credible than The Omen. And yet it purports to cast an insightful light on the troubling phenomenon of school shootings. What it's actually doing is exploiting school shootings while portraying them in a thoroughly misleading light. In terms of story, it's cheap horror posing as art.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an incredible story about a true American hero and patriot.  His loss is truly a loss the the entire country.  I didn't know what to expect from the book when I started it but by the end I have nothing but respect, admiration and thanks. RIP and thank you
B0095P29EG|4.0|This review is about the version I watched via Amazon instant video and not the movie it self. I watched it on my iPhone 4 with the Amazon app. The picture and sound on the phone were good with just a little evidence of the compression used to stream the video. I've also watched Hugo on my 40' Insignia LED TV and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the video and audio: not Blu Ray, but better than SD DVD. If I didn't want to watch my favorite pro-football team, I would get rid of satellite and just order shows to watch.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|What a concept.  It is the diet that has made the most sense to me.  Still working on it.<br />The concept of challenging the body to break fats down by confusing it makes a lot of sense.  It takes some getting used to insofar as one day your eating normal and another day maybe your limiting your intake.  Sure forces you to eat a lot of greens, though!<br />Great book, easy reading, great concept.
0756404738|5.0|In this book things get slower and more detailed than in the previous one.<br />If you liked &#34;The name of the wind&#34; you should buy it.<br /><br />For Brazilians: It's not easy to read. If you are not confident buy the Portuguese version.
B009VMN3RA|1.0|The only reason I read this book is because I paid $12.99 for it. I don't know what happened in this woman's life that she would like to think that anyone would  believe that the story was anything but boring. I had to force myself to read just one more page at a time. It was like a 12 step program. Do not waste your time or your money.
B00000DOYU|5.0|Go for this version and toss the 1997, 2001 and 2005 Remasters by Polydor, Polar and Universal. They are not good.

Either the original Polydor Germany Release or the Atlantic US Release are the versions to go with.
B00AFEY7QO|4.0|Studio CD / Concert DVD combo:<br /><br />  The smoothness of the performances is stunning.  Even without a &#34;real&#34; drummer (there is only a percussionist who is otherwise fantastic), these arrangements of the classic SOS songs provide deep bass, tight harmonies, and the groove expected from SOS.  The one drawback is that the songs are interspersed with the ethereal instrumental &#34;stylings&#34; that one might find on a SOS CD.  In that setting, one can skip a track, but here they break into the flow of the concert to give us a glipse of behind the scenes goings on and other peripheral fare that would be better as extras.<br />  I don't want to scare anyone away from this set.  The music on the CD is fabulous, using the same band as on the concert DVD.  A star is taken away because a few of the later tracks on the CD are overmodulated and begin to distort just a little in the louder passages.  And a star is taken away on the DVD because of a couple of things.  Again, the songs are cut up by the peripheral stuff, but also, there are extended intros that do nothing to enhance the songs they precede (Let's just get going already :-D  ) and why, oh, why did you cut out the faster version of Breakout even though the slower version is transcendental?  Why is there no Filth and Dreams?  Why is there no What King of Fool Are You??  These are lesser &#34;hits,&#34; but I thought their inclusion would have, could have, been better than seeing the band mulling around behind the scenes or Corinne buying a kimono for her performance where we hear snippets of the faster Breakout.<br />  Oh well.  Just get this already.  It's worth four out of five, without a doubt.  Enjoy!
B00123MBQA|5.0|Though somewhat controversial because of the misinterpretation of &#34;Rednecks&#34;, this album is really great.  Highlights include: &#34;Kingfish&#34;, &#34;Guilty&#34;, &#34;Mr. President, Have Pity on the Working Man&#34;, and &#34;Rollin'.&#34;  So few albums have songs that fit together cohesively, and while not a complete concept album, the songs work together well.  I'm a fan.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|I've had the same TI84 since high school; and I thought I would never relinquish it... until NOW. While this calc doesn't do graphing, it seems to do almost everything else. It's also more convenient and less heavy on my phone than in my backpack. FAOTD? Nice!
0679735909|1.0|In full disclosure, I was assigned this novel for an English class.  I would have never bothered with a second chapter if not for being forced.  Byatt's use of poetry, diary, and letters is clever, but most of this book is about academics doing research.  As a student, reading a fairly realistic account of someone doing research is like working at a Taco Bell and reading a book about the all night shift at Taco John's – it's too close to normal to be interesting.  I know critics have enjoyed it and Neil LeButte made a film version, but this book isn't for me.
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|This is a great CD of Eric Burdon, like every cut on it and listen to it often. Guess what; it arrived in a small, well padded hard box container so the Jewel box for the CD was not broken or cracked.

B004UFEJXK|5.0|This movie is cleverly put together blending comedy with romance. I never thought my favorite movie would be from Disney, but after watching this movie I was proved wrong. Not to mention, I'm a male adult. I was drawn in from start to finish. Their were no boring scenes. The things Wall-E would do for Eve. I could learn a thing or two from him. Maybe everyone could.
1454701250|5.0|This is a really nicely made book with some great stamping ideas for the artist/crafter that likes whimsy/nature inspired art. Very clear instructions too on how to create stamps.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|however it could be a little bigger to allow for reaching in around the filter edges. Its good for a circular  polarizer, ND3 and a UV, however if you have more filters, then it is a bit limited.

B0089LOKHG|4.0|I loved the entire book and series including the short stories..but my problem was the ending. It left me wanting more and didn't really provide a conclusion to the story..I feel like there should be a short book following this or something. The ending was disappointing.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Let Me Move You, Hear My Train, Crash and Easy Blues alone are worth the price of the cd.  I'm giving this 5 stars and still have three tracks to go on my first listen.  These are some great songs with some great Jimi solos.  The cd has a clean, bright sound - good job on the production!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed the suspense of this book. It was hard to put it down, and the ending<br />was a surprise to me!

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|This album is truly terrific.  I find I can relate aspects of my own life to every one of the songs in some way.  The music, the lyrics, the message:  each song conveys some not-to-be-forgotten piece of life's puzzle expressed in a most unique style that is pleasing to the ear.  The more I listen, the more I find to like.

B005LAIGPU|5.0|A sci-fi treat completely out of left field.  It doesn't take a 9 figure budget to come up with an entertaining, &#34;realistic&#34; treatment of a group of teens who mysteriously develop superpowers.  The powers may not be 'realistic', but what they do with them is more-true-to-life than you'll find in Spiderman or most other Hollywood blockbusters.  The film loses its way a bit in the big blowout conclusion, but more than makes up for it in the parts leading up to it.
B0054SMID0|4.0|As always Matthew is just beautiful. But that aside, great storyline with some unexpected surprises. This is one you'll want to see.
B00932A66Y|4.0|Starts and finishes as an excellent crime thriller, but with a middle part that is a completely unrealistic action film.  Smart - then stupid - then smart again.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Outstanding. As thing unfold I found the furious pace of the entries had made me read just as furiously. The journal fore mat drew me in. The characters are believable. Twists and turns kept me reading until the very end. A must read but be prepared to stay up until you finish it. This was a book club choice and a great one!
B005LAII62|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch---fun for the ghoulish enthusiasts!! The boy was very endearing. this one has my daughter's total approval.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Not really thrilled with the plot. Nolan made Bane kind of cheesy and is no where near classic Bane from comics.  Was a bit of a let down because I personally had such high expectations because of the previous two movies in the saga.  Fight scenes were pretty good.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|never thought of Dark Shadows as comedic...Mr Depp brings the original feeling to Barnabas Collins Family loyalty and caring.<br />and dignity.i did take several viewings to fully appreciate this movie I'm old enough to remember the series; and I still love it as i always did
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Not enough action for a Stone movie.  Not what was expected.  Don't really recommend.  The polyamourous love triangle was just plain sutpid.  Hayek and Benicio was good.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We have many series we watch/like and this is now on top. Story is great and acting is spot on. Can't wait until Series 3!

B009CPJHY4|4.0|This movie is a charmer!  I didn't know much about the movie before I saw it, and it was like unwrapping a present.  I could easily see it again.  It's that good.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|If you got into the twighlight saga then you will enjoy this book. i loved all of them, something different, i recommend them

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Sometimes it gets boing.  But it is fun to play with friends and connect with others and test your brain.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|Am almost sad I'm done reading it. Got completely drawn into the story and would wish it did not end yet. Absolutely brilliant!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I like happy shows with a beginning, middle and end that all occurs within one hour.  So imagine my surprise when my friends finally talked me into watching &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.  I adore this show.  It's realism and cutting edge effects makes me forget that in reality it's very much a fantasy soap opera.  There are pieces of action here or there and though short, they have a major effect on the viewer.  The acting is impeccable and the characters are deep and you'll fall in love with them regardless of whether they are good or evil or somewhere in-between.  If you love stuff like &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; then you will like &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; although &#34;Thrones&#34; is much more political.  Order a few episodes and see if you don't agree.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was looking for something new to read, and I came across this book on the kindle store. Now, I am a huge fan of \\"heaven is for real\\". So I thought I would enjoy this book as well, and it was interesting... to an extent.<br /><br />I am a Christian, and I believe that the only way for anyone to get into heaven is through the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and savior. I believe that Eben did have a NDE, but I feel that what he saw was more of a dream than an actual heaven. I trust in the bible whole heartedly, and eben doesn't mention much at all about our need to except Jesus as our Lord and savior to get into heaven. We must love God, put him first over everything else!<br /><br />Eben gives an honest account of what he saw, I believe he is an honest person. But if he doesn't have Jesus, he doesn't have anything. I wouldn't really recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful book, it draws you in and make you want more and more! I can't wait to read the next book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story! Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite writers, he really makes the characters come to life and you can get lost in their stories.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wonderful book, I felt as if I was on the PCT myself. I am not a camper but thought about a week on the trail might be good.

141659521X|5.0|I've read 6 of Vince Flynn's series with Mitch Rapp.  I can't put them down and hurry to the next book in the series.  This book completes that series and cost me less than 1/2 of local shelf price.
B000NTPGBG|5.0|I'm big fan of Spider-Man series!  This movie is funny, but sadly they cut some scenes off from regular DVD movie.  How disappoint!
B00B2064IY|5.0|...example of Hendix' evolution into the post Experience period.  Most of the tracks have Billy Cox and Buddy Miles, a few the Woodstock band.  Some tracks are reminiscent of both Ladyland (jazzy) and Axis.  While it doesn't exhibit the full studio depth of Ladyland Eddie Kramer's post engineering is flawless.  Track 5 is a throwaway, should of been omitted.
1616550414|5.0|I'm huge fan of &#34;the Legend of Zelda&#34; franchises.  Some artworks inside this book that you never seen before.  I love it!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game is very colorful with great graphics. It also has an interesting storyline. It definitely leaves you wanting more !!! A great combination of hidden object and mystery.
B004784ZKM|5.0|Like Phil Collins or can't stand him, you have to respect this album. He took the vocal helm after Gabriel left the band and then put out this live album, singing all the songs that were trademarked by Gabriel. To record Supper's Ready live was a nerve-y move no matter what, but to do so without Gabriel was doubly so. The result is obviously quite different from Gabriel-esque Genesis. While both Collins and Gabriel could do &#34;theatrical&#34; Collins version is more Broadway-Disney-fied, while Gabriel is more dark and pretentious. Or not - check it out for yourself. You might not want to listen to a 24 minute song very often but I promise you will be impressed even if you don't love it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was such a sweet read. Had me laughing and crying all at the same time.<br />Love this book and love this dog. Enzo put a great spin on what it is like to be a dog.
B00122TDAS|5.0|There was a window in the genesis discography in between Peter Gabriel and Abacab where the band really blossomed as a progressive rock powerhouse. As such the arrangements and lyrics are overblown and pretentious but in a totally delightful way. Dated, but perfect for what it was. Totally satisfying if a deep rich serving of progressive rock is what you're after.
B00136NUG6|5.0|If you want to take a walk down memory lane, this is the way to do it. Great songs from back in the day will delight and entertain you. This is truly an album from when music was music!
B00005JPS8|5.0|I had always seen bits and pieces of this movie, never all the way through. Since I love Iron Man anyway I thought I might as well buy it and watch the entire movie. I know I won't be disappointed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|its a very good game to play. You need to play. It's really fun to play. It has very good graphic.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I love the X-Men series as well as this movie.  I tells the background on Wolverine that is left out of the other movies. This explores who he is and how he came to be what he is now. Anybody who is into Marvel Comics or characters in general, should see this movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been watching Walking Dead since it started two years ago. Excellent zombie apocalypse series, if you're unsure just buy one electronic episode and see what you think. RDE
B000HT386M|5.0|A dynamic role that shows what acting skills Adam Sandler is capable of!! A true love story of family forgotten!-Or put on the back burner to further his career & doesn't realize his family will slip away from him with just a &#34;CLICK&#34; of a special remote control he bought to pause his life to make life easier but doesn't know that at the same time is changing his whole world! When he sees what he has lost & desparately wants back, is it too late?! Buy it! You'll love It!  Comedy Drama
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the book. Can't wait to see the movie as the movies from his books are usually very good.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie was entertaining. A little depressing but at least thought provoking and not just a mindless drama with a happy ending.
B004P2HMNM|5.0|My son picked this out for his 8th birthday, he is a lego fanatic and was able to put it together all by himself even though it says 16+.  It did take him several days to complete but that was even better because he got to enjoy the building process for longer.  The details are really great and it was well worth the money.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|I have never written a review before but this book was so bad I had to! I have read the two previous books so naturally I was excited for the release and to finish the series. Lena turns from a strong female character to a silly girl who cries about EVERYTHING! Half of the story is just Lauren Oliver overly describing the landscape and the other Lena thinking about tough memories. The ending was the biggest disappointment in any series I have ever read. I do not recommend buying and if you really need to read it wait until your local library has it.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|It's good to  play when you have spare time and it is the best game I played and it is a very good app you should get it
B000ID37KO|5.0|This classic is an all-time favorite.  My favorite scene is in the schoolyard when the birds beginning to gather on the monkey bars.  I could, and have, watch it over and over and over.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A book that completely captures your thoughts, exercises your fantasies and builds your expectations. LOVED it! On to book 2
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive.I like that it doesn't try to con you into spending money. The only downfall is that the more updates that are done, the slower it runs. But it still doesn't stop me enjoying it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm sure there are some factual and scientific errors in the book that are above my pay grade, but the first person singular narrative makes this a very gripping story. I'm definitely going to read more from this author.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This is truly an addictive game!  The only thing I would change is the time allotted for game play.  The object is to destroy matches within 60 seconds!  I want more time!!  Overall excellent kindle GAME
B00BHMF578|5.0|We are old enough to remember the actual incident.  We thought the acting and screenplay were superb.  We agreed with the Academy's choice of the movie as the Best.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It was a good book. It was partially predictable and not at the same time. I would recommend it to someone.
B004G8Y0D0|5.0|Need a respite from documentaries or &#34;serious&#34; movie content?  Go for this one.  Loved the performances and the movie was light in all the right places regardless of bang bang shoot'em up scenes.
B000SEI230|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It's become of of my favorites that I can read more than once and never get tired in doing so. It made me cry and sometimes laugh but in the end it was a wonderful love story that is so unique it some way or another. I would recommend it to anyone who loves these kind of stories as much as I do
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I found Kyle's detail of the different fields of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, his view of the insurgents, his views of why he was fighting (somewhat troubling), the weapon descriptions, the SEAL training all captivating. It's not all knights and chivalry on our soldiers part and there is some unsettling commentary on our government policies on engagement.  The toll on military families is front and center  in the book too.<br /><br />Ironically the end of the book ties into his last efforts.
B008AS5UAO|5.0|In many ways, this new recording of Don Giovanni is spot on, and I rather doubt that any record company could assemble a better cast these days.  Furthermore, if this recording is indicative of the quality to been seen in DG's new Mozart cycle, I am excited to hear Mozart's other mature works performed like this one.  With just a few minor flaws that throw off my full enjoyment of this work, I remain very excited by the final result.<br /><br />The Mahler Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin plays beautifully (with special mention going to the wonderful strings!).  The players respond wonderfully to the conductor's ideas about the work, and their nuance is very much appreciated when considering the loveliness of Mozart's score.  Mr. N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin himself does lead a lovely rendition of the score, but there are moments when it becomes clear that this \\"Don\\" is a singers' opera, and it feels like the soloists are leading the conductor around by his baton.  This recording is, as we know, the result of several taped concert performances, and I think the benefit of live recordings is the play-by-play of the singers (who, incidentally, work very well as a team in the ensembles), but, in this case, there are moments when N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin seems to lose the profile of the work while the singers do their own thing.  Happily, these incidents are few, and N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin does bring out moments of great beauty and clarity, and the music is frequently alive with heated emotion.<br /><br />As for the singers, I am bowled over with excitement for the most part.  The common consensus appears to be that Mojca Erdman and Vitalij Kowaljow are the weakest links in the cast, and I would agree for the most part that this is the case.  Kowaljow's Commendatore is not poorly sung, per se, but rather his voice just sounds a bit young, and therefore it lacks the gravitas of a truly successful portrayal.  In the graveyard scene, one wants to feel the chill of death in a truly rumbling basso-profundo, but such is life.  Erdman interacts nicely with the Konstantin Wolff's Masetto, but her Zerlina is small-potatoes when one considers that the role has been recorded by Kathleen Battle, Graziella Scuitti, Mirella Freni and many other eminent sopranos.  Her voice is smallish and quite bright, which is not bad in and of itself, but the portrayal is monotone and a tad screechy.  I suspect I'd probably appreciate her voice more if I was seeing her live, but the recording brings out the fault-lines.  However, I am nit-picking, and taken in the context of a group effort, Kowaljow and Erdman aren't so terrible.<br /><br />Coming into the experience, I had the most trepidation about Rolando Villazon's Don Ottavio.  Even if the character is a bit of a wet blanket, he does have some of the most beautiful tenor arias in the standard repertoire, and I didn't think Villazon's Latin sound would fit the cool beauty of Mozart's vocal line.  I, and many others, I suspect, are spoiled by Luigi Alva's portrayal under Giulini (and plenty of others), but Villazon did surprise me.  I'm not sure I really love him as a Mozart singer, but his treatment of Ottavio's music, the long breaths, and his unique sound make him a surprisingly good choice in this recording of stand-out voices.<br /><br />The ravishing Diana Damrau and Joyce DiDonato sing the main ladies, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira, and I'm not sure there have been better women in the roles.  Hands down, the most beautifully sung performance of the roles still remains in the hands of Joan Sutherland and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf on the classic 1959 recording with Giulini, but Damrau and DiDonato are stage-animals in ways that the late Dames never were.  Damrau's lighter voice is as flexible as Dame Joan's, but certainly is smaller in size, and I think it provides her an advantage in negotiating the mad flights of coloratura in Donna Anna's music.  \\"Or sai chi l'onore,\\" is spine-tingling, and the decorations near the end of the aria are astounding.  I was especially touched by the vividness of Damrau's approach to Donna Anna's recits.<br /><br />For DiDonato's Elvira, I have no words to really describe the magic with any adequacy.  Donna Elvira, to me, seems like a hard role to cast: she is sad, and mad, and little crazy.  Her vocal writing hovers lower on the staff, and a case can be made for casting either a mezzo or a soprano.  Schwarkopf under Giulini and Te Kanawa under Sir Colin Davis fall into the soprano category, and their portrayals effectively highlight Elvira's personal tragedy, but they don't quite catch the anger and slightly unhinged feeling about her.  Agnes Baltsa, under von Karajan, is better suited to the angrier aspects of Elvira, but she sometimes sounded like Princess Eboli wandered in from the wrong opera, and Elvira came off as more harridan than wronged woman.  DiDonato's comfort in the higher passages and easy dips into the mezzo range give us a very happy compromise.  DiDonato is a consummate musician, and her attention to text, line, breath, and dramatic truth is staggering.  I challenge you to find a better \\"Mi tradi.\\"<br /><br />And to the men!  Luca Pisaroni's Leporello is handsomely sung, and he is likely a splendid Don himself, but I find he brings something quite wonderful to Giovanni's second-in-command.  There is a degree of smarmy sympathy in the Catalogue Aria when most renditions just come off blunt and sarcastic, and I find this a refreshing change of pace.  Some find Ildebrando d'Archangelo's sound inappropriate for the suavity of the Don, but I am in love!  I like the smooth sensuality Eberhard Wachter, a lighter, brighter sound, but d'Archangelo's portrayal is downright sexy.  He is no coolly detached noble womanizer, but rather a sex-crazed libertine!  The Champagne Aria is a frenzy of boozy ecstasy, and the booming \\"Viva la liberta\\" in the act 1 finale oozes unbridled sex.  Do I think it's a conventionally noble portrayal?  No.  But, it is one of the most vivid Dons in a field of many competitors.  I doubt this is to everyone's taste, but it definitely gets me to sit up and listen.<br /><br />On the whole, I believe the positive aspects of this recording far out-weigh the minor negative ones.  It can sit comfortably next to the revered sets of the past and hold its own next to them.re,\\" is spine-tingling, and the decorations near the end of the aria are astounding.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is much more fun than it looks to be. Typical Mario clone type game but works very well on Nexus 4 phone.
0345803493|3.0|The first book disturbed me and brought up issues from my dating past that I didn't care to deal with right now. I told myself if this book was anything like that, I wouldn't be reading it, but I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, Ana has left Christian, but is miserable. They spend the next two weeks trying to figure out if his self-loathing and her feelings that he will never be happy unless every sex act involves him spanking her or worse will render their connection impossible. And of course, to spice things up, the author introduces us to Mrs. Robinson, once Christian's dominant, now his business partner, Leila, a crazy former sub, and Jack, Ana's boss/sexual harasser.<br /><br />The flaws are evident. James' writing is not the stuff of great literature, but it was fun, and there is a place for fun writing in the world literature scene. The story is improbable; at one point, Christian tells Ana he makes $100K an hour, and I just had to laugh at how unrealistic that is. And the characters, in typical hipster fashion, spend the entire book not listening to what the other person is saying, telling the other person they aren't good enough to be what the other person wants, and how could they love them, but then they go to bed and it's OK because the sex is great.<br /><br />The sex scenes in the book were good. I didn't like the sex in the first book because it brought up bad memories for me and I thought the scenes were unrealistic. This book, they felt a little more real, and they were more in my comfort zone, in a committed relationship, where they came to a mutual decision. I felt the love, not just the lust, and I appreciate that. Other reviewers may feel differently, but I liked that aspect.<br /><br />I may read the last book to see how it ends, but I'd recommend this book for someone who needs a fun escape.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I give the Martian 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, or whatever other top rating one could bestow. The premise sounded stultifying (sorry!) but the favorable reviews encouraged me to download and read, after all, we're talking .99 cents, for crying out loud! well I have paid 10x that for ebooks that I enjoyed 1/10 as much!<br /><br />The book was a delightful read, exciting, \\"page turning,\\" and the character of Watney from virtually page one was engagingly personal. You din't need to be a hardcore sci-fi lover to enjoy this. Yes, it is replete with technical details of what Watney does to survive on Mars, but it never gets weighed down by this and can be simply read as an adventure- you don't need to really understand all of the tech, though it is educational and to my layman's eye feels accurate. It's just a great story. BUY IT!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|Good movie, I did not think it deserved the Best Movie Oscar but who am I... I do not like the trick with the camera moving around and shaking too much to create intensity, it is actually annoying. Also I don't know why the stream had a constant circle in the middle on HD format, maybe the movie is too large for a regular cable internet connection. I guess this is an Amazon issue.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I must say i have spent hours upon hours with this game . the only really bad thing about it is when you get deep in the levels on the orginal kindle things start to lag pretty heavy. Mabey that more on the part of the kindle than the game though.
0345529057|5.0|Love this series & the HBO show; this was a good price for the 1st 4 books; Can't wait for future books
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I couldn't put it down, so real and painful, I now will see the movie, I can only hope it is as good!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is more than sex, it a story of unconditional love. The characters could be any couple with secrets and a passion for each other.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|everything was Status Quo except  the 5th disc has a glitch or sticking point in the episode with the minataur about 5-10 minutes<br />in
B00A81MV3U|1.0|This has to be the worst Mental Health film ever made. When you decide to go into the area of psyche you are going up against such heavyweights as \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\", \\"Awakenings\\" and even \\"Fight Club\\". The writer and director are simply in over their heads. The whole movie is poorly cast, poorly written and poorly acted. De Niro and Weaver have got chops galore but even they cannnot save it.<br /><br />It WAS great to see Chris Tucker back in form but Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have no business being in a movie like this. Mental Health has to be handled sensitively, tactfully and above all SLOWLY. They both lack the maturity and expertise to handle the task and the pacing on this is way off. If you want a modern Mental Health movie, check out \\"Robot and Frank\\". It is far superior to this drivel. The pacing is perfect and Langella is THE MAN. This movie is just an insult to the subject of Mental Health. It is all flash and cash with no artistic smash. Not recommended.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Every time my 7 year-old plays this game the screen shrinks in size and half of the screen goes white.  Please fix this it. She loves playing this game 2 min at a time.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|I look forward to another season. Was there only one season made? I would continue to watch it again ok
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Great movie!  One of the best non-action films I have seen.  From the first scene through the end the story line flowed very well.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|Purchased this CD for my husband whom loves Bob Seger.  He loves it and listens to it weekly when he has a day off.
0439023521|4.0|This book is a great read. It was much better than the movie. After reading this book I could not wait to buy and read the next two in the series.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a truly fantastic book and one of my favorite fantasy novels.  Patrick Rothfuss does a wonderful job creating a hero with true depth. I have read this book several times and it never gets boring. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.
159562015X|4.0|This is a great book to read if you are out on the job search.  It certainly shows where your stengths are and what type of job might best suit you.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Delightful, easy read. Don't expect Austen but how can you? A great interpretation of the characters and how they would have behaved.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Buy this book. I loved Harold and Maureen.<br />the story unfolds so cleverly, it is both heart warming and heart breaking. I almost would have preferred Harold to have continued his pilgrimage without the interference of the other so called 'pilgrims' as I enjoyed Harold so much, but it all works out in the end. Read this book. It's worth every page.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Then this is it!<br /><br />I agree that Van Morrison's music is so varied and colorful that it would be better to get each of his albums individually, if you can afford it and already know what you are getting.  However, if you are looking for a representative sample of his work, then you can't beat this one for the price.  I've had it on shuffle everyday since I got it.
B00006879E|5.0|SONGS ABOUT JANE, EXCELLENT!!!  HAVEN'T LIKED A GROUP THIS MUCH SINCE THE BEATLES. THIS ALBUM IS GOING TO BE A CLASSIC.

B000P2A256|3.0|GOOD ALBUM, BUT NOT AS MUCH GREAT TRACKS. IT STILL IS GOOD LISTENING. CAN'T REALLY GO BAD WITH MAROON 5.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|I thought the beginning was kind of slow and  uninteresting. I know it's a series of books, but it would be hard for someone to follow if they had not read the first book.

B0091REZMW|3.0|very addictive... I can play this game for hours. the only thing i dont like is that your energy gets depleted very quickly and that you need to buy and spend your diamonds for everything.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Just like many other people the Twilight series has drawn me in! I never thought I would have gotten as interested as I have in this series so when the movies started coming out on DVD I decided to give them a try and low and behold I like them - a lot!<br />I have the first part of this two part ending and really wanted this second and last half of this series so naturally I went to AMAZON to find the best price for the DVD and did. Thank you for alway having what I am looking for, always at a great price and always shipped and packaged perfectly. AMAZON is the place that I ALWAYS tell anyone I know to go to to find anything that they may be looking for and at great prices.<br />Thank you for keeping a great website!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|This is a top notch show, very well done. The cast is excellent as is the writing. As enjoyable as they come.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|first off, i hate sitcoms and the normal stupid shows on cable. i am more of a documentary and movie person. i watched season one on netflix and was hooked. my sister told me of season two and i purchased this and watched the entire season while home sick with a cold. this show and these actors are a pot of gold. i would actually buy every season jessica lange stars in. wow....finally something worth watching. Jessica, i see this turning into a movie that changes with every part. money money....
B004VMUS9G|5.0|My son wanted an alarm clock but he ignores all the traditional clocks with buzzers.  He sleeps with his Kindal (reads at night).  When we used this app he fianlly started to get up on time.  He likes the variety of alarm and snooze options.  Works well.

0525953728|5.0|Exactly what I oredered and met all expectations. Would not hesitate to purchase again.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|installs okay on the kindle fire hd, nice graphics. the mahjong deluxe hd free for kindle locked up the kindle, took several attempts to shutdown the kindle fire hd before it finally shutdown. would not recommend this app, it is broken, uninstalled this from my kindle
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was amazing. I started to read this book and just like everyone else couldn't put it down. The characters were all so unique and the book just never got boring. There was always something to look forward to, so I kept reading, reading, and reading.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|installs okay on a kindle fire hd, has many different levels of easy to extremely hard. keeps track of stats, can resume a game already started, can set various color options, pencils...landscape, portrait, suggest setting the options before starting the games.
B004IAFBAM|5.0|Exceptional! They just don't make cartoons like they used to. I wish more these days were up to this caliber.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It was a funny insightful book and there were times I laughed out loud.  I was not a Tina Fey fan but after her book I have a new respect for her gift for comedy and her intelligence.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun.  Your coins accumulate while you are not playing so you can go back and play later.  It's fun to get prizes.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Excellent children movie and good for all adults - will make all adults and children laugh which is needed more in the world today
B000YMM3CC|5.0|loved it.  it was interesting to see the pre-WWII dress styles, autos and architecture of the south.  also, the story line was great!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I am not into cartoon movies, but this caught my attention. Very well written and had good messages for children.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|great movie.  another wonderful performance by clint eastwood.  the story line was very interesting especially during this season of spring baseball.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|this was the worst Bourne ever and I am a serious Bourne fan.  If the subsequent series are anything like this Im done. Lacked suspense the action was poorly done bc/ lack of creativity and the out-of-time ending was completely disappointing  I want my $$$ back
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great show. we don't usually buy shows...but our dvr didn't get the last 15 minutes of the show because of the weather.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is one of the best games for kindle. I play it almost 24/7. creative is awesome because if you fly high enough and fall sometimes it will let you stand on a cloud.
B003U51EE8|5.0|Found the shows to be intriguing and spell binding. Very interesting twist and turns that keeps you coming back for more.
0978545095|2.0|First off I am a big fan of Vivian Maier's work.  I wish I was smart enough to buy some of the negatives on EBAY.  I collect photo books with over 1000 rare photo books from the 1930- 2013 in my Library. She had an amazing eye.<br />It seems the owner of the images went with a cheap publisher.  The book is poorly laid out, The Power House Street Photographer publication has better printing, better paper and better use of the images.<br />Petty as is sounds presentation of ones work is important.  The book is split in full bleed of the photos on some pages and white bordered images on the next page,This really robs the image of powerful content.  Captions on some and others nothing ( not that it matters where she took the image)  The printing is fair but the images do not pop out of the pages ( which they should they are powerful photos)  The paper is cheap that it is printed on , not nearly as good as thePower House Street Photographer published book.<br /><br />I was saddened when I looked at the book, content is strong but the presentation is awful. The text is okay I will keep the book to teach with.<br /><br />Sorry to be so negative, I just feel this book does not do her Justice!  I hope they return to Power House or Aperture for the next book.<br /><br />Regards All.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|This is a very good family movie.  Came earlier than promised.  Enjoyed watching it time and time again.  Would recommend it to everyone.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We rented this movie for the kids and they loved it so<br />much we rented it again for them.  They really enjoyed it!
B007REV4YI|1.0|I talk to my friends.  I talk to the people on the street.  Everyone loves this movie.  And so, if you consider yourself a typical movie-goer, you will apparently love this movie too, so go ahead and buy it!<br /><br />My review however is for more of the Bond aficionados, and those who look at movies as art, not just mass produced entertainment.<br /><br />First things first!  These big movies are made by huge publically traded corporations, whose motive is profit.  Period.  Therefore it is financially beneficial to appeal to the masses of humanity, instead of creating a high art value movie that may or may not sell well.<br /><br />In short..  It really felt like a Dark Knight knockoff in many ways.  And I heard the director admitted to being heavily influenced by Christopher Nolan's \\"Dark Knight\\".  I could actually feel the contrived plot.  I don't want to enter spoiler territory, but much of the villain plan/plot was ridiculous.<br /><br />The best part was the beautiful French actress.  She doesn't stay around for long unfortunately.<br /><br />And why do we need another \\"reboot\\", after the hugely successful Casino Royale which was only 2 movies ago?  I know \\"Quantum of Solace\\" was garbage.<br /><br />The final showdown was beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />It didn't feel like Bond, and unlike any other Bond movie.. I truly hated it.  Just a feeling.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Certainly the best thing I'm watching on tv right now. Can not wait for season 3 to start as it is really starting to get exciting.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|5 stars for an excellent story. But Beware - Shifting Fog and House at Rivington are the same story. Different titles.
B00062PN6I|3.0|The headphones were a great value and I will continue to use them.  The bass frequencies are lacking (I use them as monitors while I play bass at church) but as I mentioned in the title, they are still a great value.  I use them on a regular basis and I think they will hold up nicely.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|A great quality recording.  I liked the selection of songs on the album.  Good for any singers who want to expand their repertoire a bit.
B004G600A4|1.0|I love the movie, I own a copy myself which I purchased at a brick and mortar store.  But the copy my friend (I purchased this as a gift) received from the seller does not play.  Unfortunately the product cannot be returned.  So it was a waste of money and I feel bad that my friend who was excited to watch the movie must now just throw away her worthless gift.  I am not happy.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|This was my first real introduction to Andrea Bocelli's music.  His voice is very smooth and soothing, and the recording quality was excellent!  I do wish there would be a few more English language songs on the album.  It gets a little tiresome if you can't understand most of the lyrics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been playing the games for four days now and I'm cleverly7.<br />I like it's good for  people who like horses
B0074MZSPO|4.0|Other than the fact that Brittany has the voice of an angel, its awesome. truly. the vinyl came with a single that i do not have the center piece to play, and a code for the mp3 download.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the actual disk is cheaply made and thin, but it will never be as good as the old vintage LPs :/
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like to play subway sufers it keeps me interested and it also keeps me happy and focus on the kindle fire
B002N1AEMS|5.0|The xx is a great band with great music. its so chill and makes you want to get high and stare off into time and space. It came with a poster looking thing that has the lyrics on it, i know all LPs come with it, but im putting it on my wall! it also came with a totally rad code that gives you three downloads to the album!<br /><br />Unfortunatly the disk is cheaply made and is a bit thinner compared to older LPs, but im not complaining because it doesnt effect the quality of sound.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The coins are way to hard to get it should be 2 coins for every 1 you pick up. Because the prices are ridiculous. But overall it's a pretty cool game.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I love Sudoku. I think I've played most Sudoku apps out there. Usually, they are much too simple. This one has a nice variety of very challenging puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was an awesome book , exciting , and funny , and I recommend , read it for yourself , hope for the movie soon lol
B003EVWDR0|5.0|WOW, the special effects, graphics, casting, etc were off the chart awesome.  The natives were so life like that you couldn't tell them from the actors...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent. I couldn't stop reading!  You immediately fall in love with Katie and Alex, and you feel for all the things they have both been through.
B004SBQTHU|5.0|It's another awesome album by the Gorillaz, if you're a fan of their work, then you need to own this album, merely for the sake of the great songs.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I've been looking for a snap on case to replace my last case that made it difficult to touch the &#34;home&#34; button. What I like most about it is that it's so light and slim. I can't stand a big chunky case like the one I had before. The stand feature of the case seems to work okay but not as sturdy as the one I had before. My only worry with this case is that over time the elastic band that keeps it closed might become stretched out.
0142501123|5.0|I chose this rating because it's a nice childrens book where the witch doesnt eat kids or animals etc... I own it and this copy I sent to a friend who just had her first great grand child.<br />I cant wait to read this book...again...  :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9-year-old is obsessed with this game. I don't understand it, to be honest, but she LOVES it. She's always showing me the buildings she's made and I have to pretend I know what she's talking about. Quite frankly it just looks like a digital version of legos but it keeps her occupied and it works well as a reward for good behavior so it was worth the $6.99.
B00881VLCE|4.0|awesome game when  you have nothing to do.  all the free additional puzzles are great.  i recommend it for all adults and kids.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|Cute movie about an over protective father and a daughter who wants to explore the world.  The kids loved it and the grown ups don't mind watching it.  Some adult humor that goes over the kids head but plenty of laughs for the little ones too.  I was worried it might be too scary for my littlest but he was fine.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|After having seen the movie, I immediately order for this movie track. Great ones and loved ones from Morricone and from John Legend as well. If you liked the film, truly recommend to purchase this item.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love the storyline! definitely keeps me interested. love the zoom feature to. looks awesome on kindle fire hd. Well done app.
B0091TGWYE|1.0|Very cool idea, but card holder should be multiple slots instead of 1 pocket.  If you put more than 1 card in it, it stretches out and forms a big square on the side of your case. Material did not hold up very well.
1400069807|5.0|I can hardly read more than 2-3 pages of \\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" without having to put the book down and take a few deep breaths to soothe my anger. Michael Moss has written a meticulously researched, searing indictment of the food industry, from how Americans are being subliminally hooked on unhealthy foods to the extraordinary research and psychology-based marketing ploys (which to me should be illegal!)which get us quickly addicted - not only physically but emotionally - to more than 60,000 processed foods and sodas. After reading the chapters on Coke's strategies, I will never again lift one of those sleek red cans to my lips! What is being done to us by the food industry in the name of profit is about as immoral as it gets, and Moss's book is a must-read for anyone concerned about how giant food corporations are destroying our health as a nation and especially the health of our children.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|The progressions alone are worth the price. There are very minimal routines included, so don't buy it if that is what you are looking for. As long as you can think for yourself and apply the information in the book to create your own routines the book is excellent.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I played this game for a good 2 months until everything started to cost real money. and after installing the most recent update I lost over 4 million coins I spent on a a family of dinosaurs. I did not pay real money for them but it is frustrating when you spend so long tying to save up. And my daughter, 6, spent over 85$ accidentaly purchasing acorns. So unless you want to waste your time and money don't download this app.
B001A4LYN2|1.0|I was very excited to see this movie.  I work in the energy inudustry and had heard good things about it.  The movie, however, was weird and in many places flat out disturbing.  We turned it off before getting to the end - it was that bad.
B004GVUPFE|2.0|kills time, thats about it unless you like puzzle games. . . . .  . . . . . . .
B002BWP49M|1.0|these movies do not follow basic vampire protocal.  They should have called them something else.  Stick to blade if you want to be entertained.
B004GYY714|4.0|Not a bad app for free. The only problem I have is trying to turn it off without shutting down my kindle.
0316044695|5.0|Being an Infantry Marine this story really humbles me and makes me proud to serve along guys like this.  Makes you really respect not only what seals do but the journey to become one.  I personlly would never join the navy if I wasn't guaranteed to end up on the teams.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|MOST BOOKS ARE BETTER THEN THE MOVIE, IN THIS CASE THAT IS TRUE. I LOVED THE ORIGINAL MOVIE BUT THIS ADDS MUCH MORE DETAIL THEN THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO IN THE MOVIE. IT HELPED ME PUT A BUNCH OF MILES ON MY PEDOMETER LISTENING ON MY IPOD.
0670019933|3.0|I can honestly say this book wasn't for me.  I should preface by saying though, that I experienced this book as an audiobook.  And the only thing that I'll really say about that is that the reader spoke clearly and at a good pace.  Otherwise, this review is for the content of the book.<br /><br />Smith is a \\"Dharma Bum\\" roaming around (for most of the book anyway) the Western part of the USA with some buddies who also subscribe to his philosophy of life.  And that philosophy is a mix of their version of Buddhism, nature, parties, and general free-spiritedness.  I'm told this book has something to do with a \\"Beat\\" culture that I've never actually heard of before as well, so I can't comment if that's true or not. Smith, along with his buddy Japhy, do a lot of hiking, reflecting, writing haiku's and other poetry and have a few orgy's thrown in for good measure.  The overall theme is one of Smith finding himself, and understanding the world around him, and Kerouac uses the life of a backpacker/survivalist/bum to show how even someone with a meager existence can appreciate the beauty in all things.<br /><br />Smith and Japhy, despite being Zen self proclaimed Buddhists, are very much superficial people.  I can't decide if Kerouac really did believe they were spiritual and had the right idea, or he was making fun of them.  I'd like to believe the latter but I've read that the character of Smith is somewhat based on Kerouac himself.  That's not to say they were all that bad though.  They both had a genuine appreciation for nature and an easy personality that wasn't quick to anger.  Those are admirable traits in anyone, even if they are a \\"bum\\".  But they did seem to mooch a lot off of other people, and usually Buddhists don't seem to advertise what they are.  Smith truly is the main character of this book and he is very fair in describing his friend Japhy.  He mostly sings high praises for him, unless Japhy is questioning Smith's alcohol intake.  And we do see everything out of Smith's eyes so they follow his perspective and views on Buddhism, nature, the people they meet, and everything else.<br /><br />A lot of this book comes off as pretentious.  Like Kerouac was saying that if you weren't doing the things these people were or thinking the same things, then you probably weren't all that enlightened.  And I did bristle at that.  Especially considering that these people were mooching off of everybody and only occasionally working for their keep.  There are different roads to enlightenment.  But I will give him the pretty writing in this book.  There were some great descriptions of food and nature and I especially enjoyed the mountain climbing section near the beginning of the book.  I think that could have been a whole book in itself and there was no need for the rest of it, as I didn't find the rest particularly interesting. There was also a lot of mention of Buddhism, but it's not the type of Buddhism that I've heard a little about, but more an Americanized \\"fun\\" version that allowed excess.  Kerouac also threw in a lot of Buddhist terms that if you didn't know what they meant, well too bad, because he wasn't going to tell you.  It was another way of being pretentious almost, as Kerouac expected any reader to already know what he was talking about and be part of his social group.  Or at least that's how it seemed.<br /><br />Just not a book for me.  Maybe I'm the wrong generation or just think a lot differently than Kerouac.  I can appreciate the descriptive stream-of-consciousness writing, but I just didn't appreciate the message of this book.<br /><br />The Dharma Bums<br />Copyright 1958<br />AudioBook Experience<br /><br />Review by M.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|A very uplifting album with a sound that harks of the 80's into the 90's. Definitely does not sound very much like their previous releases and possibly that is why I like it so much more. I'd say you owe it to yourself to pick this up. It will make you smile. I love the track- I'm not your hero; very well said- &#34;I'm not their hero, but that doesn't mean I wasn't brave.&#34; Clapping to how good and uplifting this release is.

B0044XUZ9K|4.0|This classic is a wonderful edition to any library, what with the hero being but a young boy (and yet still rigidly devout in his beliefs of friendship and loyalty) and a treacherous villain that is about as infamous as the real life pirate Edward Teach, a.k.a Blackbeard. I recommend this book to any and all who love to read. Oh, and I also enjoyed all the illustrations in this edition =0)
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|I don't want to over analyze this so I'll keep it brief.  If you want to hear the albums that's one thing. I wouldn't compare this to the studio releases as that's not what it's meant to be,  That doesn't mean it is not comparable (at least in my mind) in one way or another.  Here are some great, stripped down performances (live in the studio you might say).  Steven Stills plays a tasty/mean bass!  The sax player and guest vocalist are tasty and bring some nice new elements to Jimi's wonderful guitar playing.  You can hear Jimi evolving and bringing into play a hybrid of styles, Motown, soul, jazz you name it.  I think this is an outstanding addition  to any Hendrix's fans collection.<br />I love it!  Great grooves etc.  I'm very happy with the release.  God what a SHAME he is no longer with us.  I can't even IMAGINE what he would be playing like now....
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I enjoyed the ride. Daniel Craig makes a great Bond.  Action packed, good story, great performances.  Wild and fun ride.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazingly awesome game. Better than the original. Although its a tad bit more difficult than the last one, its still cool and in my opinion, somewhat addictive! :)
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I had heard about it for years and it lived up to my expectations! Fun trip.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. I hope that the last book in this series is as good as the first two
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent writing, superb performances, wonderful twists and turns!  Upstairs or down, you end up loving them all through the laughter, heartbreak, and manipulations.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Had this not been a book club choice I would have quit reading after over 100 pages. I found this book very difficult to get in to but was encouraged by a fellow book clubber to keep going. I just finished the book and am glad I persevered. The ending has quite a twist. I am not sure I would recommend this book unless I included the caveat that I found it quite difficult to get into. There is so much to read and so little time, I would rather have read something else.
B00BAX538U|5.0|A FINE READ.Fun to have in a graphic format as this tale surely stands the test of time.Good job Mr Powell
B004S3MB2U|5.0|For me, in a word, yes.<br />Ihave been looking for a decent financial calculator for months. I think I have found it!<br />This does so more than what I was expecting! From financial calculations to conversions to time calculations.<br />An overall impressive application for a FAOTD!<br />Do NOT MISS THIS APPLICATION!! Get it while you can for free.<br />It is worth the $9.99, but for free? I have no complaints!<br /><br />Thankyou Amazon &amp; Hudren for a top quality FAOTD application!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Fantastic location, great script writing, beautiful women.....what more could a guy ask for? Check it out and you'll be hooked as well...Remember if you are a 1st timer, you have to start with Season 1....marathon thru the episodes and your curiosity will be aroused!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Pretty straight forward, I love the style of the book, told as short story anecdotes that progress chronologically through the fictional history of World War Z.  Creepy, funny, and entertaining as hell!  Accidentally left the book at work so I immediately bought it on my Kindle so I could read through the weekend.<br /><br />Too bad it seems the movie is mostly unrelated to the book, I expect a disappointment, but who knows.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|A GREAT MOVIIE THAT KEEPS YOU WONDERING IF THE HOSTAGES  WILL GET OUT OF IRAN! GREAT DIRECTING AND YOU FEEL THE FRIGHT AND DOUBT OF ALL INVOLVED!! THIS PICTURE IS MORE THAN DESERVING OF THE OSCAR FOR BEST PICTURE OF 2012!! NO OTHER PICTURE COMES CLOSE. SHAME, SHAME ON THE ACADEMEY FOR SNUBBING BEN AFFLECK FOR DIRECTOR!! HE WOULD HAVE WON HANDS-DOWN IN MY BOOK!! AND KATHERINE BIGELOW, TOO, WAS SNUBBED AND SHE AT LEAST DESERVED A NOMINATION FOR &#34;ZERO DARK THIRTY!!&#34; WHEN IS THE ACADEMEY GOING TO GIVE NOMINATIONS TO THOSE WHO REALLY DEDESERVE IT THAN JUST TRYING TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT!? TO ME THIS IS NO MORE THAN A COPE-OUT, AND WHOEVER DOES THE PICKING SHOULD BE FIRED!! I HAVE THIS DVD AND I'VE ALREADY WATCHED IT TWICE!! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE!!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The movie was terrible but the performance was great! The movie crashes and loses momentum as soon as the plane crashes...Would have been better if it was shorter or crisper...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so fun I have always wanted a horse and now I have one I am sick and it makes me feel better to play with my horse Shelby
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I saw enough negative reviews to make me a little hesitant about getting this, but I'm glad I did.  It's very simple to use and it took both my husband and me only a few seconds each to learn to get accurate yardages very quickly.  Ours works perfectly and has given us no problems.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|It was a well done reinterpretation of the original.  I thought the acting was good and the special effects good as well.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I use it for stories and a a &quot;weight loss diary&quot; and you cant add pics. plus the on screen key board is too much of a pain to use it often
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Did not have hight expectations for this movied but it surprised me.  I would see the second one if it comes about.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really cool app. I love it!!!!!! I'm so completely addicted. Plus if you get it for a kid it will help with responsibility. :)
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|I thought the movies was very well done.  However, it was a little too long.  The pre-cog involvement did not quite gel with me.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the math challenge questions are super helpful. I use it in conjunction with Other alarms on other devices. but this is the best if all of them
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|I did not like the format.  It was striving to be an arty film and did not work for me.  However, the acting was great.
B00BLGZUR0|2.0|Might have been better if they had an actual budget.  Special effects are just not up to par with today's movies.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This movie makes up for the lack-luster second movie, Quantum of Solace, in more ways than just it being a Bond movie. The characters were people you came to care about; the plot was fantastic and it held my attention from the first chase scene to M's death at the end.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Even though it was not as outstanding as the first Season, the story line got better, the characters more defined and I can't wait to watch Season 3.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a ton of fun in one movie. Every gamer is going to love it! There are so many references to so many games, new and old. The younger generation may learn of some games they may not recognize, but us parents will remember. Almost every game imaginable has been recreated and brought to life in this film.<br />How can you not love a movie where one of the characters uses this line:<br /> &#34;Milk my duds!&#34;<br />Too funny, I tell ya!<br />Ralph is not only the title, but truly the star of the show. You really have to love a good, bad guy. However, Glitch girl stole the show for me. She was hilarious and alone made it all worth watching.<br />Definitely fun for the whole family.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|I thought that the 1st episode of the season would be better and more exciting than it was.  Maybe the 2nd episode will be better.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|the talking didnt match the mouths and it got stuck a few times, but a great movie! peace on earth
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'd think temple run 2  is AWESOME every one should get it<br />zip lines are so coool<br />love when u get to the cave with the mine carts
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This was a good series to watch after Stargate SG-1 stopped. Rodney may get on your nerves, but other than that, if you enjoyed Stargate SG-1, you'll enjoy Stargate Atlantis.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoy this show.  I love being able to watch it at my own pace on Amazon Instant Video!
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I must first say that I am not a Scientist in any sense of the definition, but I do appreciate all of the amazing advances in our understanding of how everything works, and even more fascinating - how everything came to be where we are now.<br /><br />I love the exuberance infused in every paragraph, the humorous asides, and the infectious nature of Krauss' writing style, which is good, as I may need to read this through at least once more to absorb more of the details. This book isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy expanding your knowledge, learning more about our universe (and possibly multiverses) then, this is a great read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There Is a lot of hype that Has been made about the sexual content in this book. Book one was more racier than two and three. However, as their relationship Matured so did their Sexual relationship. It clearly was not as graphic as the media led on. I fell in love with the books because of the intense love story behind it. Truly a dream. It would be hard pressed to find a man who would love his counterpart as much as Christian loved Anastasia.<br />My only negative towards the story is that it is not true to fact to more than 80% of the women in the world To have enjoyed Orgasms in the many Ways, as many times and as quick Anastasia experienced them. For this I know these books are truly the ultimate fantasy for women.  For this I thank you😘
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As someone who has denied and repelled most young adult books in past 5 years (Twilight series included in this), I had a hard time reading these books. The first one bore me to death, the second was very confusing at times and the teenage rants were hard to stick with, and this book was another, where at times, I found it hard to read. However, Suzanne Collins is a very good writer and once I started the book, it was hard not to want to find out what happens. She is a very descriptive writer and it's easy to paint a picture of this war torn world in ones mind. This world of war, rebels and the Capitol are all so intense and easy to get trapped in.<br />What I did not like about this book was the ending. It's not at all what I thought it would have ended as. I'm also thoroughly disappointed with who she ended up with, because quite frankly, she didn't deserve him. Either way, this is a book intended for young adults, high school aged teenagers, young people who live on the highs and lows. As an adult, it was good, but I'll stick to the movies.
1439153663|5.0|Could not put The Kitchen House down.  It had such a Margaret Mitchell flare to it!  The weave of characters was so beautifully sewn together.  For your first book it truly is a winner.  Hungry for more!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it! the location is beautiful, the characters are well developed, interesting story lines....you'll miss it during off seasons!. Wonderful series
0446401307|3.0|If it's a Harry Bosch novel I want to read it. Actually, I've probably already read it.<br /><br />3.5 Stars?<br /><br />For a new writer I'd give this a 4-star, or if I really liked the new writer, maybe even a 5. The writing and plotting is very clean. But for Connelly? I'm sorry, IMHO he was slacking-off in this one. I only read OVERLOOK once, and I'm not going back for a re-read. [And I hate when FBI agents are the Bad Guys; killers breaking the LAW.]<br /><br />Plot-wise & Action-wise this puppy has everything going for it, but the only few gem-moments for me were when Harry was seeing more in crime scenes and the motivations of people than his superiors and the FBI.<br /><br />If I was stuck on an airplane flight and this was the only thing decent I could find in the airport bookstore, I'd re-read this. Only then. @hg47
B000FBGBPC|5.0|i loved this prodeuct clean disk and alot more im going to spam now g g g g g g
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great case for the money. Fits perfectly, looks nice and the price was right. Would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive case.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have wanted this CD for some time.  I play it constantly<br />in the car. It contains some great songs - love Adele!!
B003UYUP58|5.0|Excellent. I was a bit apprehensive about reading it, but it turned out to be a really great book. Cancer research certainly has come a long way, but still so much farther to go.
0880796863|5.0|The colors are more subdued and earthy than the &#34;regular&#34; RWS deck.  I prefer it as I hardly ever pick up the regular deck as I dislike the &#34;neon&#34; like colors within them.  It's probably just me.  Others dislike this deck very much.  In the end, it's all about personal taste and persprective.  Enjoy.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Brooks has nailed it in the sequel to &#34;Wizards First Rule&#34;.  This book is fantasy with a combination of romance.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Want to keep track of the moon phase from waxing to full to wanning? This is your go to app.  It's handy as I can keep an accurate watch over my religious/ritual use.  Perhaps you're a moon gazer, this app will help you with that as well. Enjoy. :-)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|So many twists and turns - so many questions. This show keeps you at the edge of your seat. I am glad I didn't see the show when it was aired on tv. I don't think I could have waited one week  for the next show - let alone several months for the next season! My wife and I devoured the episodes in packs of three or for. On weekends maybe even more. After we watched the final show guess what. We started to watch it again. We became true fans of that show! Great job writing and acting!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This one goes to the top of my list! I laughed out loud tons of times and also cried my eyes out. The info on this book gives it no justice, it's ssooo much better! This is a wonderful book that shows no matter what life throws at you as long as you believe in yourself you can overcome anything. It was my first book from this author but DEF won't be my last!! A must read!!!!!!
B00867GHS8|5.0|I had forgotten how good this was until we saw it again in 3 D.  Not overwhelming effects.  Just right.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is the best album i've heard in a very long time. So much creativity!! The music scene has been needing an artist like this for a VERY long time
0307949508|4.0|Synopsis/blurb........<br />Lisbeth Salander is a wanted woman. Two Millennium journalists about to expose the truth about sex trafficking in Sweden are murdered, and Salander's prints are on the weapon. Her history of unpredictable and vengeful behaviour makes her an official danger to society - but no-one can find her. Mikael Blomkvist, editor-in-chief of Millennium, does not believe the police. Using all his magazine staff and resources to prove Salander's innocence, Blomkvist also uncovers her terrible past, spent in criminally corrupt institutions. Yet Salander is more avenging angel than helpless victim. She may be an expert at staying out of sight - but she has ways of tracking down her most elusive enemies.<br />My son read this late last year and enjoyed it more than the first book in the trilogy. I would have to say his conclusions mirror my own.<br /><br />I usually have a reluctance to pick up books over a certain length, more from an aspect of time management reasoning that I could read 2 @ 250 pages long; in the same time it would take to read 1 @ 500 pages. This doesn't always ring true and a lot depends on the pace of the narrative as to how quickly I plough through something.<br /><br />At 569 pages long I was expecting to take just under a week or so to finish, but in reality it took a little under 3 days - probably because even though I felt not that much happened in the first 150-odd pages, I was still enjoying it.<br /><br />The action in the second half of the book more than made up for the plodding start.<br />Not the best book I have ever read, but far from the worst. Fairly predictable conclusion insofar as I was reading safe in the knowledge that there is a third book to follow, so unless Salander and Blomkvist needed to acquire Lazarus-like tendencies they were both sure to survive.<br /><br />That said, within the narrative there were decent periods of action and violence, likeable and unlikeable characters - mainly within the investigating officers in the police force, and a reasonable plot with only a slight stretch on the boundaries of credibility in my honest opinion.<br /><br />I'll be back for the 3rd instalment sometime whenever, depending on whatever turns my head in the meantime.<br /><br />4 from 5<br /><br />Acquired second hand sometime last year from one of Leighton Buzzard's charity shops.ng officers in the police force, and a reasonable plot with only a slight stretch on the boundaries of credibility in my honest opinion.<br /><br />I'll be back for the 3rd instalment sometime whenever, depending on whatever turns my head in the meantime.<br /><br />4 from 5<br /><br />Acquired second hand sometime last year from one of Leighton Buzzard's charity shops.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I'm so glad I finally bought this.  I bought it to use with my Android phone so I can play the radio and Pandora on external speakers.  I had to see if it worked as advertised as soon as it arrived today.  I popped it right onto my phone and voilà- our Bose docking station finally has a purpose again!
B004C0WVP6|1.0|Got this today installed fine, downhill from there. Within hours drive started throwing errors, unable to flush cache, file system corrupt etc.. Started the troubleshooting process and have 8 bad sectors in the 1st 10% the scan, bad sign, bad drive, back you go..
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It is weird because it is not like any other book I read I think there are a lot of other good books
B001HPP2XW|5.0|The quality was excellent of this classic film.  The story line is timeless, worth watching and a must have for movie collectors.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I loved this book. I've been waiting awhile to buy it and finally decided just to do it. I am glad that I did. This book was great. I had it all figured out in the middle of the book and was suprised when I was wrong! Great twist and turns. I recommend this book.
B00BCWOFIS|1.0|I found the second season interesting for the first 8 episodes, but then it lost appeal to me. Louis became a parody of himself. Jessica is just not believable any more. Mike Ross is turning into a boring whiny brat and the super efficient and wonderfully sexy Rachel has developed into a mouse. Even the usually razor sharp and super-cool Donna has lost her defining edge and her judgement. Harvey is simply aggressive now. He is no longer charming and his credibility is totally shot. The only character I like in the whole series now is Daniel Hardman who is witty and cutting and actually acts somewhat like a lawyer should. Then they really kill the whole series by introducing two abrasive \\"British\\" lawyers who act like total berks, something British lawyers decidedly are not. Note to producers, if you are looking to merge with someone you don't go out of your way to rub their noses in the dirt, and it is certainly not a very British way to behave. Believe it or not, most British people actually like Americans (in general). This \\"merger\\" is now developing into a hostile takeover. As for the accents of the British characters, really really really, we do not talk like that. Not even Prince Charles talks like that. So do try and get a British actor to play a British character and not a yank with a mouth full of marbles. This series, so promising in the beginning, is now a total waste of time and I will not be watching any more seasons. Poor show all round.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am fairly pleased with this calculator. I put it on my Droid and removed the built-in calculator. It takes a few seconds to load but works great.
1475972350|5.0|If you watch the show criminal minds at this book is for you. Can not wait to read the next case for det Larkin. Could not put it down. Great thrill book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it twice! Kept my attention and kept me coming back for more. Couldn't put it down :) would and have recommended it. My sister in law is on the 2nd book in the series!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Fabulous!  More Characters add!  More intense!  Highly recommend watching and hanging on your seats.  The zombies are not dead yet!
B009C7JS14|5.0|Was exactly what I was looking for, my phone has one simular to it and I love it. I love that when it's raining or snowing its showing rain or snow on the app.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Excellent show!  Fabulous cast of characters!  Highly recommend!  I cannot wait to see more!  LOOK FOR NEW SEASON THIS SUMMER!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Having always been an avid reader, I leapt on this option to purchase all 5 Wool books for such a low price (even though I already owned the Kindle version of the first book). What an amazing deal! This Omnibus Edition was a thoroughly enjoyable read and left me thirsting for more. I am already reading the Shift Omnibus to fill the void left by these first books, and looking into filling up my Kindle with all of Hugh Howey's books. He is my new favorite author!
B0095P33IW|4.0|The movie was very good and my son wanted to watch it over and over again.  He thought that it was a great superhero story.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|This is one of my treasured books in my library.  Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas map out easy and fun techniques for improving your memory.  They help you recall names, facts, where you left your keys and even numbers.  The simple number system is worth the price of the book.  It helps me remember my wife's social security number tying it to a simple phrase.<br /><br />There are so many other memory tools in this fantastic book.  Buy it!
B00942G4UA|5.0|This film opened my eyes to how much control CORPORATE AMERICA has over the working class person.  THE BOARD ROOM SUITS CONTROL WHAT WE EAT and it is processed garbage.  They kill animals inhumanely and put amonia in meat to kill e-coli and mash it up and fill it into fast food burgerS.  Companies squeeze the REAL farmers out and make them mass producers and black list the ones that don't conform - HOW DARE THEY!!!!!!!  You need to stop just buying things in the super market and really understand GOOD FOOD IS NOT CHEAP.  These companies are driving honest hard working people out of business and controlling everything.  AFTER seeing this movie and going on the PETA WEBSITE, I'm not supporting these companies WHO ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN A PROFIT REGARDLESS OF HEALTH RISKS TO US AND TREAT ANIMALS POORLY!  I'm going to try to support the right people.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|a very nice collection of songs, its a really long CD.  I love anything from Enya.  will order some more
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is amazing. Unlike some other free games of you get bored with playing one of these you can go to a different game
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I love this entire CD, great songs, music its my favorite, not just hard stuff, its a mix of good songs
B004RL9T50|5.0|This is funny and very well made.  It is clean and appropriate enough for kids to watch but also has the humor and actions to make mom's and dad's laugh too, so to me it makes a great movie for a family movie night.  My family and I have watched it a number of times on movie night and it is still funny after watching it all those times.  Also, good music in it too with Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC, and Guns 'n' Roses.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This is a great CD, I love all the songs and the music.  I was greatly surprised how much I liked it!
B009GED3HS|4.0|Without spoiler's, which I know a lot of people hate in these reviews, and I am one of them as well.  This season is funny, but I think season's 1-6 are much better.....just seems like the running joke of &#34;who is Ted's wife&#34; has gone on enough. But Neil Patrick Harris still in my opinion, saves this show and makes it entertaining and worth watching.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read many reviews about Ender's Game and I align myself with those that love the book.  I love the storytelling style of author Orson Scott Card.  In some of the sequels I think Card gets a little preachy at times but Ender's Game moves along quickly and builds a universe using a young boy's perspective that I related to when I first read it as a teenager.  I bought the Kindle edition so I could read it on my Kindle Fire without carrying a paperback around with me and I found myself enjoying it still, all these years later.
0062238868|5.0|Absolutely a must read for anyone that is interested in this type of book...<br /><br />Also, just not right that he was killed by an ex marine that he was trying to help.
067144901X|5.0|My 6 month old son absolutely loves this book. I can different sounds for the animals when reading it out, and he enjoys it. His face lights up when he realizes that I will be reading this book to him. The book is very easy to memorize and I sometimes just repeat the contents of the book to my son.. and he recognizes that and loves that too!
B00136JRZY|5.0|If you love Whitney Houston's music, you'll love this album. It has many of her popular songs such as: The Greatest Love of All; You Give Good Love; Saving All My Love For You; and Take Good Care of My Heart.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Helen Hunt was amazing in this movie.  Shows that no matter who you are or what you look like.  Love is what matters.  It's unconditional.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book really hit home for me because I lost a sister when I was younger to Leukemia. This book really helped explain the emotions everyone in the family was experiencing, along with the hardships. Jodi Picoult does an amazing job with the characters and plot. This is the second book Ive read by her and I liked this one more then the first! Although \\"The Pact\\" is also a very good book!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My son liked this movie.  Its a good family movie. Something you can all watch together.  No real scary parts.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This movie was extra long and filled with lots of action. Eventually I got annoyed of Shia LaBeouf running around screaming like a girl not an action hero at all.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I enjoyed reading this, at first I was sceptical, the more I read,  the more I excepted the ideas.  I will give this book a chance, and try my best, to give love to everyone, even myself.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This watch does the trick for me. Simple face so you can actually see what time it is (a handy feature for a watch)without a lot of other crap in the way.  Flat, lightweight, classy, comfortable, a metal band so you're not getting a new leather band every 3-6 months.  Mine doesn't say \\"Titanium\\" on the face which is fine with me.  Less is more.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|My 2 Krokus favorites are Headhunter and One Vice... and Dirty Dynamite plays just like One Vice..Headphones on and before you know it 40 minutes of rockin entertainment have passed and you are clicking repeat. Buy this album if you love One Vice...
B008B68IV8|3.0|This Ghoulia isn't my favorite. On one hand I love the dolls hair and make up. The blue eye shadow looks really nice. The outfit is where things go down hill for me. I love the ribcage on the front of the dress but thats where it ends. In my mind hoodie+dress=Ugly. I can understand why some may love this outfit though. I just made the outfit into a shirt instead of a dress. Still worth buying if your a Ghoulia fan.
0345472322|5.0|exactly as described and seller shipped it faster than expected. thanks a lot. also if you feel like a failure or just need some motivation this book has a few points here and there that i willl forever use
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very cool for horse lovers!!! i am hooked. absolutely love it. love the graphics. wish it was easier to get gems but still great.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great for making to do list or checklists of any kind.  It has really helped me keep track of my marathon training schedule.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the first.  The ending of the second book wasn't expected...too soon for me.  Meeting the next generation of characters was intriguing...I will read the final book in this triology.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I found the book much better than the movie, but the movie stands well on its own too. Just beware if you read the book because about the main thing the two have in common is Brits retiring to India.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong in any form.  Keeps my hand and eye co-ordination sharp and is a challenge to clear all the tiles.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great movie, that even with knowing how it would come out in the end, kept me at the edge of my seat. Whether it was due all the Academy Awards, not so sure. But I did enjoy this movie.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|As a trained historian, I found this book quite intriguing. It added new incites to my already extensive knowledge of the man and the times. In addition, it clarifies AND raises questions about Lincoln, his attitudes toward slavery, the importance he assigned cooperative relationships with friends and foes in being effective, as well as the value of a sense of humor in all things. I recommend the book. It both informs, raises questions, and whets the appetite for more.

0375869026|5.0|That pretty much sums it up. I bought Wonder for my daughter last Christmas. She just finished reading it today and came bounding into the room to tell me it is her favorite book ever and if she could, she would give it 6 stars. So there you go. Buy it. I plan on reading it myself.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I spent a weekend catching up on this series and saw the entire first season.  It was great for me and I can't wait to see the next season.  The plots and dialogue seemed well thought out and written.  Great show.

B0016BPWNM|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies in the Fantasy genre. Aimed at early teens, but stands up well for adults who like fairy-tale fantasies. Extras on how much work went into the puppetry and animatronics are good.

0062014536|3.0|I don't mind a cliffhanger but if you do then you will hate the ending of this book. Basically all plots and story lines are left completely open, there is no resolution to anything. The main reason for my rating is that I felt like the whole book was rushed. While I enjoyed many aspects of the book and LOVED Lena's evolution as a character, as many others have said some characters were completely disregarded (Julian being the worst). I wish there was some kind of closure somewhere in this book, with Hana, Lena's family, the revolution, the love tri-angle etc...but there just isn't. Like I said cliffhangers don't usually bother me, The Giver is has a great ending however this one was over kill.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|An English series of aristocracy and servants.  How could that be any good?? Well, that is what I thought, but kept hearing good things about it from people who's senses I trust, so I watched the first one.  Hmm, that was interesting, I wonder what will happen with that Bates character.  I'll watch the second one.  Oh my, what a scandal...and that is all it took.  Very good show, beautiful scenery and lots of grandeur to look at it, but now the war is here, oh dear.  Gotta go, still a few more episodes to catch up on.  You won't be disappointed.  Quality TV indeed.
B008X6JP3G|4.0|This is not bad for Kevin, shows power and control of cartels in Mexico. If you are of week stomach, don't watch movie.
B00130UFY2|4.0|I watch the Bourne series regularly.<br /><br />I love the lighting and angles of camera shots. The action isn't just random spraying of bullets everywhere (with the hero never being hit). The fighting techniques are realistic for close-in fighting.<br /><br />Overall, though, the Bourne character's mindset is intriguing. He is like a master chess player, setting steps to a goal with contingencies built in. Until the goal is met, he's relentless.<br /><br />The series doesn't over rely on futuristic technology, which is refreshing.<br /><br />I enjoy a car chase now and then. The one from the first movie was well done. I could probably have done without subsequent ones. That's about my only criticism.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A must see for everyone. Once you watch it you will understand why it is so popular and you cannot get enough of it. I can't wait for season 4

0446580848|1.0|I only got about 1/3 of the way through this junk. I was first exposed to John Corey in Plum Island where I found his wisecracking good nature to be an enjoyable part of this great novel. With each additional John Corey book the character has become more and more tiresome, the chapters longer, and the plots thinner. His sarcasm has become almost evil, he has gone deeper into the sexist and racist pit, and he no longer appears to have any redeeming qualities. The fact that he is still married is the biggest mystery in this plotless book. Why this woman would continue to find him in the least bit attractive is beyond me. And now, another sarcastic fool is added to the cast of characters, so he and Corey fight for who can be the least sensitive chauvinist pig. The Panther hits rock bottom. I only gave it one star because you can't write a review without at least one.

B00005OCEX|1.0|Yes, I was a metal head in the eighties. i will admit that but...this was the fluff that MTV tried to market as  metal in the place of \\"real\\" metal: Priest, Maiden, Crue, even 'glam era' Kiss was way, way better than this contrived MTV bull-crap that was played incessantly. If you want to hear sum true-ass metal from back in those days, Pick up the now-out-of-print compilation, Slave To The Metal or, just about anything but this turd!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great, easy and enjoyable read. I really enjoyed escaping at the end of busy days. A love story with twists!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I was not expecting great things from this film. From the trailer I gathered that it was going to be an attempt to put a new spin on the time travel theme. Usually, when a film has what I consider to be an overly \\"clever\\" premise (for lack of a better word) I wind up being disappointed. Movies with overly clever premises usually wind up being all about the premise, and they tend to leave out other things that I think are important: interesting characters, an interesting plot, and some thematic material with some substance. So that is what I was expecting with this film. I assumed I would be entertained, but I was not expecting much more than that. What I got was much more interesting, and much more satisfying, than what I was expecting.<br /><br />First of all, the makers of this movie were clearly aware that they were operating with a well worn premise. We have all seen so many time travel movies and shows that we have become jaded. The interesting paradoxes that arise when trying to think about time travel are no longer all that interesting. They no longer blow minds the way they used to. There is a scene in this movie where young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old Joe (Bruce Willis) are sitting at a diner and young Joe starts to ask the standard, mind-bending, time travel questions (\\"so when I do things does it change your memory?\\", etc.). Old Joe essentially brushes him off by saying \\"If we start talking about that we are going to be talking about it all day\\". I take this to be the filmmakers saying to the audience \\"We know you have heard all of this before so we are not going to repeat it.\\" I always appreciate it when filmmakers are self-conscious enough to know when they are bordering on cliche. Ultimately it is probably impossible to avoid cliche entirely in a time travel movie, but I appreciated the nod to the audience, and this movie actually does succeed in avoiding cliche. It is hard to imagine a time travel movie that has something new to say, but this one does (though, not necessarily about time travel, which is not really what this movie is about).<br /><br />The goal of the movie did not seem to me to be to \\"bend minds\\". In fact, while the premise is an interesting premise, I felt like the premise was really just a means to explore some more interesting themes. Themes about the cycle of violence, and how to break it, and about personal transformation. It also raises some interesting questions about how we look back on our old selves. Old Joe does not think very highly of young Joe. While very few of us have probably ever had the experience of traveling back in time and talking to our old selves in person (I have, but I am an exception) I think we can all relate to old Joe's attitude towards his younger self. With perspective, and hopefully a little personal growth, our past errors, and stupidity, often become glaring. This movie dramatizes that universal human experience by having Joe's young and old selves actually come face to face.<br /><br />The premise, in other words, is not just clever for the sake of being clever, it serves a purpose, and it allows the filmmakers to explore a number of interesting ideas and themes, which is what I think good movies, and good premises, are supposed to do. There is a real human story at the center of this film. It is certainly an exciting, and entertaining movie, but the center of the movie is a human story about original sin and redemption. When I say 'original sin', I do not mean 'original sin' in the theological sense. I just mean that the violence of the world existed before we were born and we were all, to some degree, victims of that violence before we were old enough to make conscious decisions, and we all tend to perpetuate that violence, to some degree, into the future by visiting it upon future generations, before they are old enough to make conscious decisions, and so on. That, to me, is really what this movie is about.<br /><br />There is one last thing that Ireally appreciated about this film: it trusted its audience. That is so rare. To explain what I mean I am going to have to give some things away about the plot, so this is my SPOILER ALERT. The \\"hero\\" of the film is really kind of an anti-hero. Joe is already an assassin when the movie begins. Now, it seems like most films would do everything they could to downplay that, and try to sell the audience on the \\"assassin with a heart of gold\\". This movie goes in exactly the opposite direction. Early in the movie Joe sells out his best friend for money, and even old Joe, who is supposed to be reformed, makes it his mission to kill \\"The Rainmaker\\". Old Joe knows \\"The Rainmaker\\" is one of three kids, but he does not know which, and so he starts killing them one at a time (two of them, remember, are innocent). Most movies would have found a way around all of that. There would have been some plot twist that would have revealed who \\"The Rainmaker\\" was before old Joe actually killed anyone, or young Joe would have knocked the gun out of old Joe's hands just in time. Most filmmakers would not have trusted their audience to stick with a main character with such a dark side.<br /><br />Filmmakers (or maybe it is the studios) seem to think that audiences want morally unambiguous characters, or, that audiences are unwilling to put up with any moral ambiguity, complexity, or subtlety. Movies have to go all one way or the other with characters. Either they are good, in which case they can never do anything morally reprehensible, or even morally ambiguous, or they are evil, in which case they are pure evil and have no conscience at all. Fimmakers (or studios) seem to think that audiences are incapable of understanding anything more subtle than that. I do not think that is true, and it frustrates me. The world is morally complex and ambiguous, and morally complex and ambiguous characters tend to make the most interesting characters, so I wish that more movies had the guts to do what this movie did: have a hero who was clearly very flawed and unlikable in many ways. The main character in this film does not fall into either extreme. He is certainly not \\"good\\". He does things that are genuinely morally reprehensible. But he has a conscience, at least at times. It is just that his own self-interest tends to outweigh his conscience most of the time (does that sound at all familiar?) So I just want to say how much I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers trusted their audience enough to make their main character so morally ambiguous.<br /><br />This genuinely was a very entertaining, and interesting, movie, and I highly recommend it.

0937381888|3.0|Twenty years ago I was a homebrewer, and in fact won a couple of ribbons.  I have recently decided to return to the hobby, so I bought this book to refresh my recollection, and to learn of the developments of the past twenty years.<br /><br />The author has many good tips, but far too frequently lapses into discussions of chemical reactions that I doubt many people would be interested in.  Perhaps the most advanced homebrewers would be interested in such discussions, but then the book should not be called How to Brew, and the chapters on getting started in the hobby should be eliminated.<br /><br />In my view, a book for beginning and novice homebrewers should primarily deal with the many types of malt extracts and hops, with many recipes discussing how small changes in the recipes will alter the flavor.  There is not much of that here.<br /><br />Back in the day, I used Charlie Papazian's Complete Joy of Homebrewing.  Today I received a copy of the third edition of that book.  I'll see if I like it better than the Palmer.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|This is a review of the first book of the trilogy.  I am glad I didn't buy this book.  I got it from the library.  Needless to say, I returned it the next day.  The writing is so poor that it is laughable.  I couldn't get past the first chapter.  After the she tripped and said \\"Oh crap,\\" I looked on the spine of the book and discovered that it is in the Romance novel category.  That explains so much.  It is not a novel, but a poor attempt to make money.  Don't waste your money or time on this one!!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought the book about 2 weeks ago and it was quickly delivered before scheduled.  I read it in under 2 days.  I am not a big reader but this book was written in a very easy to understand style.  It kept me interested and it put to rest many myths that I always thought were true.  I have only changed over to this program for 1 week now but I already feel better.  I am eating enough carbs to keep me satisfied but I am also losing the weight I want.  I spend less time in the gym now and I see all the guys grueling over doing 15 reps of light weights and spending 2 hours in the gym when I am in and out in around 45 minutes and a lot of that is the rest time between sets.<br /><br />Mike is really onto something with this book and I feel like he takes a personal interest in the people who purchase it.  He sent me an email the other day and asked how it was going and if I had any questions.  I replied with my diet, routine, cardio and a question or two and he replied back in under 24 hours with answers.  I was really surprised at the quick and personal response.<br /><br />Must read for anyone looking to get into shape and make some positive changes in their life.

B001PO53IO|5.0|awesome! i'm not big on the animation, but the script is incredible! the animation grew on me, so all i can say is... awesome!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|So far, this book has been a major letdown from the third book, but since the third book was the BEST one in the series thus far, I am hoping that this book and it's introduction of a ton of new characters and neglect of a lot of established characters, is somehow necessary and that the next books will be LOADS better.  Mind you, it's still well written and enjoyable, it's just not nearly as good as the first three books and so much worse than book 3.  I'm hanging in there though, because I have to know what happens to the characters I DO care about.  I'll update this once I'm finished.<br /><br />EDIT:  The end of book 4 was ALMOST worth enduring all the new characters.  Loved what happened at the end.  I am on to book five now and loving it a lot more!  I am addicted to this series and can't WAIT for the new season to start on Sunday on HBO!

1400069289|2.0|Similar to some others, I picked up this book expecting a palatable analysis of human behavior and habits. Instead, it was filled with off-topic, albeit interesting anecdotes about everything from addiction to organizational policies. The author is another journalist trying too hard to wax scientific about topics in which he is not well versed. So he plays fast and loose with term 'habit' in order to write a book about things he likes with a title interesting enough to get people to pick it up.<br /><br />I'm wholly disappointed.

The Hana story was especially poignant and really highlighted while there were \\"invalids\\" to begin with.  Lena definately grew alot over the course of the year, and I loved that randomly she would say \\"has it only been a year' - very true.<br /><br />The ending though.... too many loose ends......the the Lena/Alex/Julian story wasn't truly resolved.  I'm o.k. I guess with Hana's story ending - but I was hoping or something different.  I came to really like her in this book - in the first book I was indifferent.  I think a short epilouge would have been helpful.  It would have cleaned up some loose ends......<br /><br />The ending is something that is getting more common - OMG - fast action ending so they can make it into a movie and 2 paragraphs and we're out.

B0006HBZXS|5.0|Sir Anthony Hopkins always give an outstanding performance. A very good movie which moves fast and keeps your attention. Highly recommend the Seller who send so prompt and a quality product. This is a good movie to watch on a cold winter or rainy night.
B00364K6YW|3.0|I was not prepared for individual episodes with credits after every one. I had another copy that was credits free until the very end of disc 2. Still a wonderful movie. But unless you want to deal with credits, I would pass on this version. DVDs arrived in great time and condition.

There are like 10 players to buy and upgrades too. This is the best game I have on my kindle well except for minecraft pe
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I liked it. The ending was pretty slow. The new characters are awesome. Man, I wish I was a demigod.
0525953728|5.0|An interesting, succinct page-turner about the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden. It is a first hand account by one of the SEALs involved in the mission and includes a bit of an autobiography as well. It's good to know we have warriors like this on our side - I couldn't help but imagine, while I was reading this, what it would be like to have a couple helicopters full of these guys fast rope into our house - yikes!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|New demigods add to the rest of the Percy Jackson story with a new twist. The story reads well and is a good read for anyone who enjoyed the Percy Jackson books.
B00BC5FN2C|1.0|This is an abominably over-written, over-produced and under-acted atrocity from director David Fincher and executive producer/star Kevin Spacey, who take a swift and funny six hour long British miniseries and stretch it out to over twice that length, while leeching it of all warmth, life and humor.<br /><br />Ponderous, boring, grim and over-written.  Way too many references to knives and devouring and killing (Spacey actually says of his wife: \\"I love that woman more than a shark loves blood.\\") to ram home the point about how PREDATORY these characters are.  Spacey's patented monotone drone reaches bold new lows of sheer self-indulgence, like some barely articulate zombie trying to stay awake.<br /><br />Unwatchable.  Check out the original.  Faster, funnier, more ALIVE than this parade of corpses.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but this is one of the best books I've read in a while.  The sci-fi is almost inconsequential to the adventure.  I've recommended it to several people who are not sci-fi fans and they all loved it.  Awesome story and excellent writing.  I would love to see more from this author.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|This book has a good story line and keeps you guessing the entire time. Good characters and a real page turner.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book ended so suddenly without any indication of what is happening in the next book. The description of the characters was good. Usually I don't like futuristic stories.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked it, but if it came on again I probably would change the channel.  The story is incredible, but needs to be a mini-series so I could have some understanding of who the characters are.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was amazing!! The excellent sequel to Beautiful Creatures, had me wondering what was going to happen next! If you read the first book, you'll sure as hell love this book!!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I'm getting too jaded for these types of movies.  It's long an arms race for visual stunts and explosions.  Doesn't do much for me anymore.

B009E3EY4M|5.0|Having seen Plant, Page, Jones, and Bonham either by themselves or in some combination over the last 20 years I was expecting something less than what they brought-- the &#34;Long Tall Cool One&#34; and crew were raving!!!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I was a bit thrown off by the flow and feel of this book because it was not fast paced and action packed like Ender's Game, but luckily I expected this from some of the other reviews I read. I became accustomed to the different pace and story and finally settled in to read this beautiful story about Ender's adult life on Lusitania. I'm not sure young adults/teens  will be impressed by this sequel like they were in the first, but I definitely recommend it if you can have an open mind and realize it is a different read from EG.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Having followed Rush since &#34;A Farewell to Kings&#34;- this was something new-- a reinventing of themselves that stretches the mind!

030758836X|1.0|Cynical, all but one  periferal character (Boney) are unlikeable. The author takes the worst of human nature; sociopaths, misogynists, personality disorders of the worst kind, and writes from their perspectives. Disappointing that this is the writing to which so many people seem to be  drawn right now. We need uplifting, creative, good work. I read this because our book club selected it, and am so sorry I bought it and wasted my time, but because it's popular, I didn't have time to get it from the library. I'd  have stopped reading if I hadn't wanted to participate in the discussion for book club. I now feel that urge to read something well written, thought provoking, and positive immediately, to get the \\"bad taste\\" out of my brain. Better check and see if Lief Enger has a new book.
B00AF46Q5Y|2.0|The first one in this trilogy was excellent.  The second one had me skipping pages as it was very boring and ended on a strange note. Not sure I want to read the third one
0143119680|5.0|I love this, and book #2 as well, and can hardly wait for #3. It's a wonderful tale, so well researched and written.
B003Y059EK|5.0|So I had to buy it for my 11 yr old son & he LOVED it just like I always have. Might be too scary for littler ones, though...
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|That's what this is. A fresh look at a musical icon. Great \\"all around\\" performance, package, title ok, recording, etc... Worth the time to listen and enjoy. Down to earth. Whoever came up with this has done Jimi well. I am happy to have listened and enjoyed it....
B007REV4YI|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 50 years since James Bond first hit the big screen and yet this past year had celebrations galore about that fact. First was the release of the blu-ray box set containing all Bond films with extras excluding SKYFALL. Numerous shows were done about the fact. Finally a tribute was paid to Bond this past Oscar night. But the big news concerning Bond this year was a new film, SKYFALL that has just hit DVD shelves.<br /><br />After the first two outings with Daniel Craig as the titular character, Bond is back and in action like never before. The film opens with the usual chase sequence filled with more action than a half dozen films crammed into about 10 minutes. When it finishes Bond is shot by one of his own team on orders from M (Dame Judi Dench) and falls from a moving train over a high bridge into a roaring river. Cue music and opening credits.<br /><br />Of course Bond didn't die. If he did then this would have been the shortest Bond film ever made. When the credits finish we find M fighting for the continued role of MI-6 and the need for the spy network set up all these years. It turns out that what Bond was attempting to retrieve (and failed to do) was a hard drive that contained the location and names of all of the undercover spies around the globe. Not only does M suffer that indignation but someone explodes a bomb in her office as well.<br /><br />Recuperating on some desert island, Bond hears the news and returns to the fold, confronting M in her home. A few details filled in, a new weapon courtesy of a new Q and Bond is off and running. His first lead is the man he was battling on top of the train at the start of the film that results in an extremely well choreographed and filmed fight to the death. The clues lead Bond from Shanghai to Macau and eventually to a meeting with the man behind it all.<br /><br />Silva (Javier Bardem) has a past with M. He too was one of the high members of MI-6 and a favorite of M. But things went bad (the details of which we learn later) and it appears he has manipulated Bond to this meeting. Bond escapes and captures Silva, taking him back to England. While most of the film up to this point has been setting the stage from here on out it's non-stop action and double crosses resulting in one of the most explosive finales ever captured in a Bond film and one that is more touching than any other.<br /><br />Visually SKYFALL is an amazing film to watch. The colors of the neon in Shanghai pop off the screen and the action scenes feel as if you are there with Bond in each and every move. Director Sam Mendes isn't known as an action director but he brings a fresh look to the entire film as well as a depth of character to Bond that's rarely if ever been seen.<br /><br />I saw this film when it was first out and loved it. For Bond geeks there are all sorts of special surprises from locations to items to lines in the film that will make them giddy with glee. Honestly there was at least one moment when I nearly screamed out \\"YES!\\" that involves a car. 'Nuff said. For those more recently drafted into the Bond films you'll get all the action you need and a story line that has more depths than most.<br /><br />Of the three Craig Bond films I'm undecided which I like best but I know it's between this one and CASINO ROYALE. One thing is certain. All are movies that should not just be rented but added to your collection. Bond films are movies that can be enjoyed any time and will be for years to come.ad (the details of which we learn later) and it appears he has manipulated Bond to this meeting.

B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Anyone who reads this column regularly knows that I am a horror fan. Sometimes it's to the point that I attempt to not write about a new horror release for fear people will think that's all I watch. But on occasion a movie comes along that I feel compelled to write about because it is just that good. Such is the case with SINISTER, a movie I missed in theaters but one that will stick with me now that I've watched it.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke stars as Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author whose last two books didn't do so well after the roaring success of his first book. In search of a new story Ellison is moving his family, wife Tracy and children Trevor and Ashley, into a new home in a new town. What he doesn't tell them is that the house they are moving into was owned by the victims of a gruesome murder and possible abduction.<br /><br />It seems that the family living there previously was executed in their own backyard. Bound with their heads covered by bags, they were stood on a bench with nooses round their necks. The opposite ends of those nooses were tied to a branch that fell, lifting them and strangling them. All the family with the exception of their little girl.<br /><br />As they move in Ellison takes a box of loose items to store in the attic and finds a scorpion there. He drops the box on it to smash it which loosens a floorboard under which he discovers a box of super 8mm films. Taking these to his office where he's already hard at work on the story of the family, he watches the first movie which begins with clips of the family and then shows their execution. Rather than call the local police who are no big fans of his (with the exception of one deputy) due to his treatment of other officers in one of his books, he begins watching the other films.<br /><br />Each night as Ellison works on his book and watches another film, he learns more about the killer. At the same time strange things begin to happen in the house. Noises, walking about in the attic, all draw his attention away from the book to see what is happening. Several of these incidents end up being a child searching for the bathroom in a new house or his son having night terrors, something he has suffered from in the past. But other items happened for reasons best left unsaid.<br /><br />Each roll of film reveals another family that seems fine until their death throws are captured on film. While watching the second film, Ellison catches a glimpse of something in the waves reflected on the pool a family is being drowned in. The image is that of a face but distorted. Subsequent films offer more glimpses of the possible killer as well as symbols at each one.<br /><br />With the assistance of the deputy Ellison is put in touch with a university professor the police sometimes contact for dealings in the occult of cults. This professor provides Ellison with some of the clues he's been looking for as well as part of the connection between these families. But it isn't until the last moments of the movie when he gets the one item that ties it all together. Before he gets that information the question of Ellison's sanity is called into play and just whether or not he's dreaming things or they are actually happening is answered.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of horror films, so many that I couldn't tell you the last time one of them actually scared me. This film did just that. When it was finished I found myself thinking that perhaps sleeping with the lights on that night might be a good thing. Yes there are a few predictable jump moments but there are some even I wasn't prepared for. At one point I checked my pulse and found that it was indeed racing just a bit.<br /><br />Hawke has had good and bad movies both in his career. This time around he does it right offering just the tiniest hint of possible insanity but lots of proof that he is definitely frightened and a bit disgusted by what he sees on screen. His character is determined to have that success of a hit book one more time but begins to wonder if the cost of his family is worth it.<br /><br />The best way to truly experience this film is sitting in the dark, the phone unplugged and every other distraction taken away. But if you tend to jump at the smallest thing, if you have nightmares induced by these sort of films and if you just don't like feeling your skin crawl you might want to watch it with the lights on.

B00821OX98|5.0|I'm hooked on this tv show, I started watching the 1st season and now can't stop. Can't wait to get to season 2.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This book was really good up until the last chapter when it just ended.  I didn't feel like anything was resolved.  I kinda got the impression that she was in a hurry to finish and left out a good 2 chapters.  I really loved the series but I wish the book had more closure.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am loving this book - had never read it before, but the movie (which I loved) closely follows the story so far.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|AFTER UPDATE: A more full version was just released, and it certainly doesn't whet my appetite for PVZ 2. Now I find that I will be charged more money for the same old content, which of course is totally lame. If I want to play Vasebreakers Endless then I have to pay another $3.99? And I'm noticing that the price of the game has dropped to 99 cents, so I would have been better off waiting and then paying for the extras. You shouldn't charge extra for OLD UPDATES. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I remember back when I bought this: I was looking forward to playing the regular version of the game on my phone, like I already own on my PC. So I bought this game a little while back for $1.99 during a temporary price reduction period. I was really disappointed with the Android version because the extra puzzle game and Zen garden were NOT included. I thought about downloading for my wife, but the Android version is almost worthless. That totally sucks because these extras were the things that gave the game REPLAYABILITY value. My wife and I like playing Vasebreakers Endless and other endless levels which are simply weren't included in the Android version.

B007SGM084|5.0|These books were great. So glad I finally read them. I would totally recommend these books to everyone I know
B009AP2G26|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this - many of the best cast members having moved on and being shown in their new lives. But it's great. Adds more depth to the plot.

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|The CD is classic Jimi and the recordings are great - along with the production. We have to remember this is going back 45 years ago. The fact that these 12 songs where in the archives and recorded with this level of quality is a blessing. Don't finesse it... turn it up, sit back and just enjoy the music.

0316224588|4.0|Since discovering Ian Rankin's Rebus books several decades back, I've devoured each one as soon as I could put my hands on it. Rebus fulfills everyone's fantasy about the value of justice over procedure or following the rules. He bucks authority, drinks and smokes too much and revels in puncturing pomposity. He also has excellent taste in music.<br /><br />Rebus, now retired and working as a civilian on a cold case unit still epitomizes the \\"off-the-reservation\\" cop we love to see prevail, but in STANDING IN ANOTHER MAN'S GRAVE, he seems<br />more . . . I don't know what. Needy? Sad? Mean-spirited?<br /><br />I still enjoy his relationship with his former partner Siobhan Clarke and his tweaking of the politically correct powers-that-be and Internal affairs. (The Complaints). But I found the trap he sets for the killer at the end of the book ill-considered, illogical and potentially tragic for everyone concerned. Overall, I think Rankin has brought Rebus' self-destructive tendencies to the forefront, and not always with entertaining and satisfying results.<br /><br />For Rebus fans, this is still a pretty good read, but, for my money, not as satisfying as many of the earlier books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  Lots of turns in the story that were captivating.  What interesting characters!

1936891026|5.0|The message of this book hit me right between the eyes.  I too had been a victim of \\"Resistance\\".  But no more.  This is war.<br /><br />The book is written in Three parts.  Part One is challenging.  Pressfield exposes the enemy of all life enhancing creative endeavor: Resistance.  He clarifies and brings into clear focus something mysterious that seeks to remain hidden in the shadows of our soul.  I now see this enemy more clearly than ever.  I believe Pressfield is speaking of the same thing Julian Smith refers to as [[ASIN:B0062Q7S3S The Flinch]].<br /><br />Part Two is practical.  The author proceeds to lay out a clear strategy to vanquish Resistance.  He calls this strategy Turning Pro.  Simply put, to defeat Resistance in your creative endeavor you must behave with like a professional on the job:<br />Show up every day<br />Show up no matter what<br />Stay on the job all day<br />Be committed over the long haul<br />Know the stakes are high and real<br />Accept money for the job<br />Don't over identify with the job<br />Master the techniques of the job<br />Have a sense of humor regarding our job<br />Receive praise or blame in the real world<br /><br />Part Three is inspiring.  It is about the invisible psychic and spiritual forces that ally themselves with those who do creative work.  Pressfield humbly shares some of his own experiences as he learned to rely on these unseen allies to reorient himself and bring forth his best works.  Essentially, the artist, like a mother, is involved in the process of birthing that which originates in an unseen realm.<br /><br />Challenging, practical and inspirational, I would highly recommend this book to anyone aspiring to creative endeavor.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|the music is great, acting is great, really funny, its a movie that you want to own not just see.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|More pricey than the various 3rd party offerings that do essentially the very same thing, but this is well made, stays securely on the lens, and does not vignette.  Recommended.
B0098QWAFK|5.0|First I'd like to note it comes with 2 digital copies. One for Ultra-Violet and One for iTunes which is really nice. This SteelBook is impressive. I love the cover art, and the inside cover art is great too. Great design. Super Cool. Worth the $50.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King that should be enough. I watched this movie since i was a kid and i still watch it this day. In my own opinion, I will always hold a place in the record book for this movie no matter what else comes out by Stephen King.
B004ZQ74G8|4.0|This book is definitley different from any other I have read. It took a little bit of time for me to get used to the format but it was a great story and worth the read. I did find it a little slow at times but in the end I enjoyed it.

B004TTHLBE|5.0|American Gods kept me engrossed throughout the whole book, or very nearly. It has great detail, including real populations of cities and plenty of real places that Neil went to before writing about them. It gives a spin on religion in America that I think only a non-American could portray. I look forward to reading more in this series and highly recommend this particular edition; I read this book for my book club and many people went with the normal copy and had some dissatisfaction at the discussion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love God's Holy Word.  My eyes tear when I read long periods of time.  This Bible loaded on my kindle is perfect!  I take it to bed and listen until I fall asleep.  I have it reading to me everyday.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|This album is very good.  I can't believe I'm typing this, but I prefer Marco Minnemann over Gavin Harrison.  The band he uses on this album jives on so many levels.  Would not be surprised if this ends up being the prog rock album of the year.  I have too many good things to say about it.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Very engaging!  I couldn't stop watching and finished all 4 episodes in 1 sitting.  Tragic but moving at the same time.  I didn't want the story to end
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love Lady Gaga, and this album is great! I like that I can go back and listen to it whenever and I could download to my computer
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset is good overall. I have had it for only about a week now, so not sure on how it will do in the long run. From what i have seen, it performs well with music, and games. The build seems good as well. Not sure if it will break like the other reviewers say it will.<br />Pros.<br />Good speakers, with ok 7.1 virtual surround sound.<br />Nice features like the 3 Programmable G-Keys.<br />The charge base that comes with the headset looks cool, and it works as well. It's awesome that you can use the wireless feature, and charge the headset both at a time, while only using 1 USB port.<br />The cords that charges the headset, and connects to the computer are both pretty long, and that's a plus for sure.<br />I like that I can move the wireless dongle around, because it's connected to the charge base, instead of directly to the computer. I think, it gives you at least a few more feet to move around your place.<br />The earcups are also very nice, and I do not mind wearing the headset for long periods of time. My head is pretty big, wearing at least a 7&5/8 size hat.<br />Cons.<br />The bass in the speakers are good, but sometimes when you turn up music a bit loud, it distorts it a lot. Seems like the speakers wouldn't be able to handle heavy bass, and if I play to much of it, the speakers would blow or something.<br />Another thing that I don't really like about this headset is that it does cut out sometimes. The audio would go away, and the headset would seem to completely disconnect from the wireless dongle all together. It would take about 3 to 4 seconds for the headset to reconnect, but that's the biggest thing that I hate about this headset.<br /><br />The overall verdict?<br />The headset is good. I do not regret buying it at all, especially because I got it from here for such a low price. It was either these, or the SteelSeries V2s. And since these were cheeper than the SteelSeries on the day when I felt like buying a headset, I went with these instead.<br/><br />(Before this headset, I was using the Plantronics Audio 995 headset, and it wouldn't let me charge and use the headset at the same time. I hated this, and that's why I went with this headset instead. I mean, I still have the Plantronics, but i will probably not be using it as much anymore)<br />Hope this review helped some people choose what kind of headset they want.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great show. Some nice special features. I wish there were more episodes. I started watching season 3 on PBS and had to get season 1 & 2 to get ther full story. Get season 3 also.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|A totally different view of Nazi Germany. Was highly recommended so I was skeptical. Now I highly recommend. Anyone who enjoys new ideas and reads a lot will enjoy.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|A Perfect Getaway is a non stop thrill ride! There's a shocking twist towards the middle of the film that I didn't see coming, including black and white flashback scenes which will tie up all the loose ends. Steve Zahn and Timothy Olyphant are creepy and so hilarious in this film but the biggest surprise was Milla Jovovich's peformance. Jovovoich was one of the those pretty actress' that I didn't think had much range or power, she proves me wrong in this film and she has ever since including the indie film, &#34;Dirty Girl&#34;. She has so much emotion in her eyes, you will be taken by her in this film, trust me! A Perfect Getaway also has an unrated director's cut version, which adds greatly to the story and gives more background about all 4 characters. I highly recommend it, enjoy!
