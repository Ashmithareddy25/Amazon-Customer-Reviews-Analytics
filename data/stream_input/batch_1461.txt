B006MVJ2L4|5.0|There are very few albums I like at first listen. This one reeled me in from the start. Adam Lambert's vocals shine throughout the entire album showing a range and depth to his vocal prowness like no other male pop singer out there today. Underneath is a beautiful work of art that stands on its own. This is a must have for any collection.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|This is jack white at his best. You can hear several different influences in this record. There is the good stuff from the white stripes but there is also some new collaborations with different styles. If you have not heard it watch \\"Love Interruption\\" on YouTube you'll see  what I mean.
B000TEMRXA|4.0|This band is a staple for anyone who loves classic rock. So many great songs that will live on forever.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Assuming this isn't an adware copy of some sort, then it needs some serious fixing. After installing, logged via FB. Gives me an error about being logged out, circles back to loving. Everytime. Uninstalled, reinstalled, same thing. Even if its free, it should at least work. 5/15/2012
B00632HWOG|5.0|I would recommend to this everyone who is on the go ::))<br />its amazingly. great and could not be cooler and I like it alot
B006ZNRD06|5.0|The app works great on my fire and android and I haven't had a problem with the key that goes with app.<br />I love all of the formats it covers for audio and video.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I kept hearing about this book everywhere so I purchased it.  I was not impressed.  I cannot believe that these books are topping the best seller list.  I am not a person that normally reads erotica so maybe that was my mistake.  But I can understand why school libraries are banning this book.  I sure wouldn't want my innocent daughter reading this.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing 2 & 3.  Quite frankly, I wish I could get my $$$ back for the first.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Great movie, had to get the trilogy because I love it so much.  Bluray is where it's at because it is so clear on my projection screen.
B004SKIPXW|4.0|We recently purchased a 3D Television.  I was searching for 3D movies for my husband and came across this one that seemed action packed so I purchased it for him and he enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have heard lots of hype about this book, but I've never been one to read the \\"most popular\\" books out. I read the first two chapters and fell in love! The way the book is written it is like you are standing there along with the characters. Awesome book and can't wait to read the rest of the series!
0399230033|5.0|I usually buy board books on my interest in reading a book to my son and in the reviews. This book was highly reviewed, however I didn't take the time to actually read them enough. So when the package came and my son excitedly opened the box and found this book he jumped on my lap to be immediately read to. I settled in our glider chair and read aloud \\"Good Night, Gorilla\\" and did the \\"shhh!\\" sign with my finger on the lips as I turned the page. That is when I realized that there were no words besides \\"good night,____ (insert animal name).\\" I was slightly taken aback and realized I had to quickly make up the story as I went along because I had a very CAPTIVE audience. As we turned the pages, my storytelling got better, helped by sounds of quiet: \\"shhh\\", tiredness: a yawn, and surprise: \\"Uhhhhhhh!!\\" (loudly sucking in air for 2-3 seconds). Needless to say, my little guy \\"read\\" this book 3 times the first time and now loves it every night. It's to the point where he anticipates the part where the pages are black and all you see are two eyes. He always does the surprised sound which is the cutest and funniest sound coming from an 18 month old, especially because it's a high pitched, and greatly exaggerated sound. And of course he does it several times, and then I do it, and then he does it and the noise is repeated at least 2 more times after that. I am so glad we have this book because every time we read it, we focus on something different and the story is always just a little different to keep him entertained.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The whole series is incredible. I could not put it down! This one in particular was the best in my opinion.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I have read Angela's Ashes a long time go. I am glad I can read it again  on my Kindle fire.
098357670X|5.0|Not only is Tom a master caricature artist, he's also a master teacher! For anyone even remotely trying to increase their caricature skills, buy this book! You won't regret it.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its pretty addicting but sometimes it really makes me rage hard so over all its pretty good 4 out of 5 stars
B007KZY1YY|5.0|This second book in this series kept me engaged throughout, brilliant erotic read with a story line. I did not hesitate to buy the next in the series.
0345803485|5.0|Get your motor running girls.  This book is erotic, without being sleazy, witty, and a \\"just plain fun\\" read.  I have already purchased the 2nd and 3rd books.
B001DM3Q2S|4.0|I decided this one was worth a try; I'll admit I had not read any reviews and had only seen a brief synopsis of the story line. We watched it for the first time last night and we both found it entertaining overall. As with most movies one must be prepared to accept certain givens and if one is able to do that the movie may work for the viewer. If, on the other hand, one is not able to do that then the movie has little chance of success. Both my wife and I were able to accept the givens so we both enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />I mentioned certain qualifications in the title and must admit we did have some minor problems with certain parts of the script which seemed entirely too improbable to accept as we watched the story unfold. The story focuses on a man and his son who has decided a camping trip might be a way to re-establish a somewhat damaged relationship. When the totally unexpected happens and they are thrust into a life or death situation their priorities must turn from relationships to survival.<br /><br />The scenery is dramatic and lovely and the acting is top notch. Morgan Freeman and John Cusack turn in effective performances as does newcomer, Jamie Anderson as the son. All told the movie provides an interesting evening's entertainment. I recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love to read books with a lot more story and alot less romance (so to say).I didn't buy the other 2 books because I felt it would be the same, 90% intimate sex discribed and maybe 10% story or plot. I was very disappointed when I read the book because of all the amazing reviews I read before I purchased it. Oh, by the way , I am not a prude!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is an over all good app if you like playing chess from the Ai to the visual its all good
1594484805|5.0|My girlfriend got the audiobook for me, and after listening to it a few times, I have to say it one of the top ten most-interesting books I've ever read/listened to.<br />The top negative review makes a valid point, and that is that the author sometimes makes some pretty wide leaps in his theories, but the vast majority of the book makes valid arguments in a clear manner.<br />If you're on the fence about this book, I suggest watching this excerpt:<br />[...]<br />If you find the video interesting, then you'll like the book :)
B005723JSQ|4.0|I loved all of Sophia Kinsella books and this one did not disappoint me at all.  This was a fast read and you could not help but giggle at some of the situations Poppy gets into.  The only thing I did not like is the author putting the numbers all through the book and I had to go back through the chapter to remind me what they mean. I would recommend this book for fans who read the Shopoholic books or anybody that likes a good romance story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game literally puts the family back into the game! I love the graphics and the ease in which to play the game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really fun got it on my kindle fire probably best app. I have got on it I totally recommend. it
1580176941|5.0|I've read it from cover to cover in a day, and I love it! The cookie designs are not as intimidating for novice cookie decorators like me, you can really just play with the designs. I love that it's divided into different occasions and holidays, it just makes it easier to find inspiration when you need it.
B005HSL626|4.0|the ads. there are way too many. it would be fun otherwise. my grandma has it on her phone and its ad free! I don't buy a lot of paid apps. chopping fruit seems like a waste of money, though.
B007U3SZHK|3.0|How can Joe put out SOOOOOOOOO many live albums and yet ALWAYS have so many of the same songs on them? Right now I'm listening to the title track to Not of this Earth - a stunning song -- and one I will never hear played live -- why, I guess because we need to hear Summer Song and Ice 9 for the 100th time.. Always with you always with me, ..again??????<br /><br />Joe if you are going to release ANOTHER live album next year (which you will) please in addition to the new songs (which are great to hear live) include songs you've never played live or haven't played for 15 years for disc release purposes - relearn them if you must.<br /><br />Your to do list is here --<br /><br />the Phone Call, the Snake, Not of this Earth, Motorcycle Driver, Time Machine, and Thinking of You. We don't need the 10th live version of Flying in a Blue Dream as great as the song is. Just being real here.. can't believe none of the other reviews have a similar problem.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|Works great with Ipad or iphone and Otterbox case. No more removing case just to dock. Ihome device is useful agin.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|Maybe you need a lot of skill to even start playing but I couldn't get past the first part of the game.  Nice graphics and wll done but maybe you need some background in a lower level game?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game and very entertainment, everybody in our family enjoys it and have a great time playing it.
B008011XQQ|3.0|There is nothing here to suggest it isn't first rate. Just about every song feels at home, then again nothing here beyond the title track is particularly memorable.. Canela, Nomad, & Metatron would be great building blocks for a heavier album but I guess they'll have to linger here with this sleepy disc. Great artwork, production, and again competent playing but there's very little spark and almost no fire..still at least he ditched the random roundtable of guests, that's a step forward.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I felt like I had to finish the series after reading the first two books.  This third book was so tedious, it took me over a month to finally finish it.  I really felt that the author had to finish her commitment to have a trilogy and all the things I loved about Katniss in the first, and even second, book were gone. Our heroine turns from someone who makes things happen to someone who has things happen to her.  Disappointing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so amazing and fun to play every time you play you win some thing and if u have enough points to buy a game from playing Yahoo!!!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Bought to replace my old cheap wired headset. Overall quality seems fine. Size is kind of large but you have to expect that for an over-ear style. Sound for music is decent, not as good as my Sennheiser wireless set however. BUT, the problem is the mic. I used these for one Skype call and the person right away commented how odd I sounded. He said my voice would go loud and quiet, and sometimes garbled in a robotic way. After about 2 minutes he asked me to switch back to my old cheap wired set because he couldn't stand listening to me that way -- and ahhh, clear and accurate. I noticed he sounded better on the old ones too. I'm guessing the \\"noise canceling\\" feature leads to distortion. I'd rather have no noise canceling.<br /><br />So I'm not impressed with the voice quality for send or receive. Really they are barely functional for voice conversations.<br /><br />On the plus side, the range was very good and there was zero background noise even at distance.<br /><br />They don't work for Skype which is mostly what I wanted so back they go.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a pretty good game. Earn money and upgrade your character. Casual play. Addictive. It's a free game so definitely worth the download.
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|Like the album that preceded it, Bloom builds on Beach House's lyrical themes and musical style, evolving in a way that never compromises the band's sound.  New, lush atmospheres are introduced and the recording quality is getting better with every release, but you could easily throw any song from Bloom into the same mix as any song from Devotion and they would sound great in succession.  As in past reviews, I chose to review this album track-by-track.  Some people are annoyed by this style of review and I respect that, so if you choose to stop reading, just know that this is likely the best album you will hear in 2012.  Now, for those who are game to journey on...<br /><br />Myth - With its simple programmed brush-brush-brush-cowbell intro, the band begins the album with a somewhat minimalist approach.  From here, the instruments and vocals layer on and continue to build to an epic climax.  From the first song, it is well understood that Beach House is back, and in top form.  (10/10)<br /><br />Wild - Of all the songs on this album, this one is likely the most nostalgic.  The lyrics seem to tap into the same hazy territory that most of Teen Dream existed within.  This time, the focus seems to be a conflicted father and the mistakes he possibly made.  For this reason, Wild plays like a repressed memory.  (9/10)<br /><br />Lazuli - Released on Record Store Day on a limited 7\\" (which I missed by a long shot, thanks to my job), Lazuli is one of the singles.  An arpeggiating synthesizer part carries the rhythm throughout this track, and like in \\"Myth,\\" it lays the foundation.  Bloom does not have any skip tracks to speak of, but this song needs time to grow on me.  (6/10)<br /><br />Other People - With each listen, this song gets better.  The chorus might be the most infectious on the album.  \\"Other people want to keep in touch.\\"  I find this line floating through my head at the most random times.  (10/10)<br /><br />The Hours - This is my absolute favorite song on the album.  When Bloom leaked a few weeks ago, this was the only track that was an incomplete file, which only heightened my anticipation for the physical album release.  Words cannot do it justice.  (Also, if you downloaded the leak, make sure to support the band and buy the album!) (10/10)<br /><br />Troublemaker - A slow burner, \\"Troublemaker\\" is this album's \\"Norway.\\"  Like in many Beach House songs, the chorus is where the song explodes with a passionate, melancholic burst of dreamy Beach Boys style guitar work.  *For an interesting influence on this sound, check out \\"All I Wanna Do\\" by The Beach Boys on Youtube.  You will be floored. (8/10)<br /><br />New Year - Droning guitars are introduced along with a looping drum machine, which, when mixed together, lends itself to the sounds of My Bloody Valentine.  With a faintly oriental melody in the chorus, this song is one of the faster songs on a reletively slow album.  (6/10)<br /><br />Wishes - It's hard to say what I find more emotional about this wistful song, Legrand's airy vocals or Scally's extremely precise lead guitar.  Either way, it's straight out of a dream.  (10/10)<br /><br />On the Sea - Much like on Teen Dream's \\"Real Love,\\" this song is Bloom's piano ballad.  Like the title suggests, this song conjures up images of a taking to the sea, with its upbeat rollicking piano.  This might be the closest Beach House has ever come to stepping out of their signature cloud of dreamy haze.  (9/10)<br /><br />Irene - A perfect album closer for an album that should go on forever, \\"Irene\\" is the band at its dreamy best. (10/10)<br /><br />Like the strangely insular teenage landscape John Hughes created in his movies or the glowing nostalgic universe of The Wonder Years, Beach House has managed to imagine their own fragile world for all of us to get lost in.  It's a strange paradise.album.  When Bloom leaked a few weeks ago, this was the only track that was an incomplete file, which only heightened my anticipation for the physical album release.

B007WULJ5G|5.0|Finally a company brave enough to give us the uncut version. I'm tired of all the haters for this movie too. It's not like anybody got hurt for real, this is just a movie! We wanted to be shocked and it shocked us. Love it or loath it -there will never be anything again like this!
0470876417|3.0|As a startup founder, I enjoyed this book. The first half of this book is really cool. I'm a sponge at the moment so I'm constantly learning about the startup process and I'm hell-bent on everything business models.  However, the latter half of the book becomes a bit monotonous. I was sort of skimming through the final chapters of the book just to finish it and move on.  Some really good tips though.  I will probably use this book at some point in the future to create some brainstorming sessions with the team.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|it could be better but its not bad overall.  doesn't always respond when you touch certain items.  overall not bad at all.  it's a fun game.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Not much to say. I don't subscribe to feeds on celebrity gossip or sports updates but this app has made my life much easier to navigate. I use it for social event websites so I always know what is going on in the Windy City.<br /><br />I would buy the paid app to support the developers but seems a little pricey @ $5 so I will stick with the free version for now
B0059XTUVI|5.0|This was a great film-really enjoyed it-was easy for me to understand the lingo as I have been to England many many times-I have family there and I know the 'local' slang!!<br />Would recommend it !
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This is THE Album of the Year that will make you dance and cry!!!<br />If you love Pop music...this album is too good to be true. Even if you just simply love good music...then you will find yourself loving every track depending on the time of the day and the mood you're in. As good as it is....it is only getting better and better after each listen.<br /><br />Besides the good music...Adam's vocals DANG! Those layers of voices from the man himself....Surreal!
159562015X|1.0|If you haven't taken the test yet then I'll give you a description of how it's laid out; you can be the judge of whether it makes any logical sense. There are approx. 170 questions and each answer is NOT absolute. I've never taken a self assessment test like this one and after completing it I think I know why, it doesn't work! Each question has two questions within it asking you which one you \\"strongly agree\\" with more, or you can hit neutral for both. They don't give a \\"strongly disagree\\" choice, it's either you strongly agree with the left answer, strongly agree with the right answer or \\"Neutral.\\" See the problem? I strongly agreed equally to a number of questions so I hit neutral, then I strongly disagreed with both questions and hit neutral. It makes no sense, it's absolute crap and a waste of money. So, do you strongly agree, strongly agree or are you neutral? OH!! And I originally purchased the book used not knowing the access code for each book can only be used ONCE so I had to buy it new, A GENIUS MARKETING SCHEME that places greed above all it's customers...a disgrace to say the least.
0345803485|3.0|I'll summarize for you:<br /><br />Hi, I am Anastasia.  I am boring, unattractive, not especially smart, ignorant and inexperienced at life. I also have no personality.  Oh my gosh, this amazingly smart CEO worth gazillions of dollars is crazy about me, but I am not after his money.  He drives safe cars and he wants to take care of me.  Oh my, I made a stupid decision and he came in the middle of the night to save me.  Wow, his eyes are so grey.  I will wear the same purple dress several times.  I have no clothes of my own, I have to borrow my roommates.  My roommate is so attractive.  I am not attractive.  Oh my gosh, I am having sex multiple times a day and having multiple orgasms, even though I have no idea what I'm doing.  Mr. Grey is so sexy and his eyes are so grey.  So so grey.  Sex Sex Sex.<br /><br />That's pretty much it, no plot to speak of really.  Characters are hollow.  The whole book takes place over the course of a few days.  It truly is Twilight, minus vampires, plus sex.
1400082773|5.0|This book really tells us what was in store for the country under a liberal socialist form of government and I sure wish that I had read this book before voting for obama in 08 because I surely wouldn't have voted for him knowing his liberal socialist views.<br /><br />  This book should be required reading for anyone of voting age because I believe people should be informed before using our most sacred right to vote.<br /><br />  I give this book 5 stars because it tells us what is in store for us and I hadn't ever heard of black liberation theology but I know a lot about it now and it sheds light on a very racist view and I had hoped we moved past that type of thought.
B0045TQF88|5.0|DOWN TO EARTH finally sounds properly, actually pretty better than their vinyl releases (whose sound was quite bad) and re - edition on CD (that ended ruining the whole thing with their squeaky mix). Congratulations to Andy Pearce, head of re mastering. The bonus disc is nice, but does not bring any finished outtake, only rehearsals and instrumental tracks. It´s OK if you are a fan. Also the packaging is very good, reproducing inside the sleeve, the covers of the singles extracted from this disc and a booklet with lots of information and good photos. Musically, of course, it's a great record in a great moment of Rainbow,with a superb job of Graham Bonnet no doubt the more brilliant star of the album.<br />In summary, an issue more than recommended
1451673442|5.0|After watching the secret, reading the power and then seeing that their was a new addition to the \\"secret\\" family I purchased this book online via \\" The Secret\\" Website. Because I live in New Zealand, I had never used amazon before. But after hearing through a friend that it was safe I went ahead. I was happy to receive an update on my order being dispatched and the estimated time it was going to take for it to be here. What I loved about this was it said it would be here by \\"22 May\\" it actually came in 4 weeks earlier!! So thank you so much!! it was a nice surprise for me to see it turn up super early :D A++ Would definitely buy from here again and recommend to others.
0345803493|3.0|My summary:<br /><br />I am Anastasia, I can't stay away from the first boyfriend I've ever had.  Even though I dumped him for legitimate reasons, I need him and his grey eyes.  He is the only man for me.  We've known eachother for two whole weeks now, we should get married.  He is possessive and bossy with a lot of baggage, but that is ok because he is crazy about me.  Sex sex sex.  Grey eyes.<br /><br />A little more of a plot in this installment than the first one, although still kind of unbelievable.  Again, very \\"adult Twilight\\".  The writing is low level and the plot set-up is obvious.  Also, all the mind-blowing sex acts get old, these kids are having sex up to 10 times a day?  Really?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app. I use for my guitar tabs and lyrics. I'm learning songs even faster than before. It's a great app for anyone.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|George put into words and music some incredible stuff. I listen to it in the car  and it puts a huge smile on my face. Thanks to Olivia & Dhani for sharing these. I can't wait for Volume 2.
0439023491|5.0|Middle books can be tricky in trilogies, but Collins does a great job with Catching Fire. We get introduced in to this book to one of my all-time favorite characters: Finnick Odair and get to see more development of the relationships between Katniss, Gale, Peeta and Haymitch. If you like the movie, you'll love the series!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Good game but when the energy bar becomes more of a 'put me down and walk away' goal it ruins the idea of a game you cant put down. I am literally fighting the urge to play because I might as well play solitaire or draw something because the only thing keeping me from playing is people, not corporate winnings
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I loved this novel!  I laughed, I cried, I read it twice. Travis and Abby's love story was surprising, exciting, fun and stressful all at the same time.  I hear that Ms. McGuire is writing the story from Travis POV.  I can't wait to really get inside his head and understand his actions.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a, Love Story!
B007P3TMW2|1.0|Just as the title of my review states, this movie is very forgettable. The story did not do much for me personally. Personally, I wouldn't watch this movie again, nor do I recommend it.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I didn't intend for this to be so long, but I hope it is useful for non-fans and casual listeners. :-) And no, I don't work for Adam or RCA! LOL<br /><br />---------------------<br />Edited to add: I just noticed that the tiny handful of negative reviews mostly had to do with not liking the genre of the album. They liked Adam's voice but apparently they weren't expecting the first half of the album to be dance songs - but that's just a matter of musical taste. People who don't like pop often complain about 'over production'. Yes, it is true that heavy music production tends to be just a cookie-cutter attempt to compensate for mediocre (or non-existent) singing talent. But I contend that Adam's incredible voice completely obliterates this concept. He can do things with his voice that other pop singers could never hope to attempt. Adam's pop music blends the best of both worlds. The production compliments and supports his amazing talent; it doesn't cover it up. This album has a mix of dance pop, rock, electro-funk, mid-tempo pop/rock and slower, heartfelt ballads. Adam's vocal skill ties it all together and keeps it fresh. If you like those styles of music, I guarantee you will love this album. Read on for a detailed review!<br />----------------------<br /><br />Until now, I've never heard an album where EVERY single song is awesome. My reactions to each track range from \\"I love this song\\" to \\"OMG I'm gonna faint!\\" Enthusiastic track-by-track reviews from reputable publications/blogs are cropping up everywhere. I've not seen any reviews that weren't positive. (With the exception of one shockingly homophobic rant. I won't say which site because they don't deserve hits.)I've seen several reviews that actually had a disclaimer that the reviewer was a non-fan but was happily converted by this amazing album.<br /><br />The first 7 songs are exhilarating dance pop hits. \\"Trespassing\\" is all attitude and swagger; \\"Cuckoo\\" is a 'lets get crazy' dance party; \\"Shady\\" is naughty and absolutely funkaliscious; \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\" is a joyous celebration of life with soaring vocals; \\"Kickin' In\\" is an ode to the intoxication of the clubbing scene; \\"Naked Love\\" is an infectious, playful romp that's easy to sing along to; \\"Pop That Lock\\", about claiming your power, escalates to a bombastic blow-the-lid-off jam.<br /><br />The energy of the second half of the album shifts to mid-tempo songs and ballads that are soulful and personal. \\"Better Than I Know Myself\\", which is about seeking reconciliation between the light and dark sides of self, is a great transition piece with a balance between slower, emotional verses and a more energetic chorus; \\"Broken English\\", about the frustration of communication problems, is a powerful, slow burn and some parts remind me of George Michael's heavier ballads; \\"Underneath\\" will rip your guts out. Achingly beautiful and deeply personal, it ebbs and flows between quiet vulnerabilty and a powerful demanding cry. Only Adam has the skill and artistry to pull off a song so emotional and vocally demanding; \\"Chokehold\\", about the addictive nature of a toxic relationship, has a throbbing beat and is both dark and hauntingly sensual; The standard album closes with \\"Outlaws of Love\\", a stripped down heartbreaker that also highlights Adam's incredible voice. It is a soulful lament inspired by the struggle for GLBT acceptance, but it captures the pain of anyone in a relationship that is unfairly condemned.<br /><br />The deluxe album includes 3 bonus tracks, which have a much heavier rock influence. Trust me, these gems are well worth the extra $2. \\"Runnin'\\" is an intense, pounding plea for the strength to turn away from a life of dysfunction and self sabotage. This song is utterly spellbinding - Adam uses his rarely-heard low register and soars almost 3 breathtaking octaves. \\"Take Back\\", is filled with energetic frustration and the painful regret of a crumbling relationship. The rhythmic vocal embellishments are at times hypnotic, but in a very good way. \\"Nirvana\\", is an expression of the spiritual beauty of love. This ethereal rock lullaby is a perfect close to the emotional journey of the album. Adam's voice is both exhilarating and calming.<br /><br />Unlike most albums that are just a couple of singles with filler, Trespassing is an amazing, cohesive work of art. With the impressive soaring vocals and the maturity and depth of the song writing, one could call this pop music for grown-ups. There are many A-list colaborators, but Adam is the glue that binds it together - he was executive producer and co-wrote 12 of the 15 songs. I urge you to invest in the album, don't just cherry-pick and download individual tracks. I agree with many reviewers that if Trespassing can just get enough exposure, it could easily be Album of the year.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its really fun to play and good for all ages! Everyone will love it and it is alot like Mario, but I'm not going to complain. :)
B0080OJBQW|5.0|ADAM LAMBERT IS A FREAK OF NATURE HIS BRAIN IS WELL BEYOND THIS WORLD! TRESPASSING IS EPIC! I CANNOT BELIEVE ADAM'S VOICE IS REAL, IF I HADN'T SEEN HIM LIVE I WOULD WONDER :D BUT REALNESS IS ALL HIM AND THIS IS CLEARLY A LABOR OF LOVE DEEP FROM HIS HEART! AND I THANK HIM FOR IT! I LOVE HIM FOR IT! A MUST HAVE ! MAKES MY SOUL HAPPY, MY MIND THINK, AND NIRVANA IS REACHED <3 LOVE IT!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this Omnibus totally blind.  It was just an amazon recommendation.  But for 6 bucks, I'll take a shot.<br /><br />It was a pretty good shot, I discovered something that I hadn't even been aware of.  I have mainly spent my time wading through a long series of books.  Thousands and thousands of pages of pure joy.  I do love a good long series if it's written well.<br /><br />But now I've discovered something wonderful.  A well written and brilliantly built world...in just 32 pages (Wool 1).  So good in fact, that I instantly jumped into the next volume, then the next and finally saddened by the sudden end.  5 great stories, in about the size of a full sized book.  Although, when reading the Omnibus it feels more like one book broken up into five sections.<br /><br />I'm starting to ramble, let me just say this...BUY IT!  READ IT!  LOVE IT...or don't.  I'm just saying it's really really good, and for 6 bucks it's definitely worth a shot!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game gives me so many level of skills. I can use all of my bane skills a d I got all the games I love in just one game.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was the first book that I have read from this author. Finished reading the book & then about a month later went to see the movie. Movie was very good but in my opinion the book far exceeded the movie. Highly recommend both but definitely read the book first. Nicholas Sparks has a very good gift for writing this type of novel. I plan on reading more of his works.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Great mobile office application. Easy to use and cert efficient. The improvements made from Suite Pro 5 to Suite Pro 6 are worthy and not just cosmetic. I highly recommend this app.
B006ON41FC|4.0|ok this game is Adorkable. seriously I love it. I mean I could spend hours playing this. but I do wish that the people that made this could make it to the point where u have to move ur device for the squirrel to move. because sometimes with the arrows it doesn't go like where I want it. and also maybe their could be more than just nuts like u could get power ups and boost etc. I love this game though its worth it!
B007SGM084|1.0|This triligy is almost exactly the story line of the twilight series...  Instead of a vampire there's a dominatrix and instead of innocent flirting there's crazy sex, a lot of it. Even if the plot had been completely original the author is so repetitive!!! I wanted to scream every time she referred to her inner goddess or listened to her subconscious! Not to mention rolled eyed, pursed lips, cocked heads, & bitten lips!! Get a thesaurus! Totally not worth the hype or the $29.99!!!
B007BVOF8E|5.0|When I watch most suspense thriller type movies I usually am pretty bored, don't really care about what is going on and generally feel like I know what is going to happen. This movie forces you to pay attention the entire time by purposefully creating ambiguity, forcing you into the shoes of characters in the movie. If you are a person who needs action, however, then don't watch this...it is more for the people who love battles of wit.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Some parts spot on....others a little far fetched.  Maybe I should sit down and write my own erotica book. :-).
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|Just what I expected...sexy Mark Wahlberg fights like Rambo and gets out of incredibly dangerous situations with his super powers. The girl gets taken hostage...wearing her bra and no shirt....cool cameo with Levon Helm (yay!!)...BUT, Danny Glover and the SO irritating spit lisp? What the heck? I couldn't stand it, he was awful, just awful to listen to. All in all it was a typical plot...but great to watch even still :)I wouldn't eve mind watching \\"Shooter\\" again actually.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so far so good! at first for some reason i couldn't download it and now i can... i do like the game =)
B006TJXZ30|2.0|Everything is great, but it doesn't send back ANY data. If you do any of these it won't show up if you log in on a computer: Delete messages, Move mesages, Mark messages as read, or Mark messages as spam. Plus, if you send a message there is like a 1:3 chance it will mess up your e-mail.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Didn't know if I was going to like it, but it was an enjoyable movie. Wish Atom would have knocked off Zeus's head.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Having already bought an older Marware case for my Kindle Fire some months back (see my other reviews), I was familiar with and very happy with the brand. So when I purchased a Fire for my brother's birthday I went to Marware first to find him a case. The Vibe is yet another example of why this company is a leader in tablet outfitting. A very well made case; easy to install and with what is probably the best stand feature I've seen on a Kindle Fire case. The tabs that hold the Fire into it do partially cover the speakers (which is noted in Marware's install guide), but they have center cut-outs and don't seem to hinder the sound output at all. I would give this case 6 stars if I could.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun and full of challenges. Its not exactly like the old school Oregon trail, but its a nice updated version.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read the trilogy. Everyone's talking about it and there's a good reason why. I know that some of the reviews will make you a little skeptical, but you will want to read Fifty Shades more than once, if only to figure out some of these positions!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible is great I love it and everyone else should too its about God and what I beleive in
B005T87QCI|2.0|Ok game at first but sometimes buttons don't work... hopefully that will be fixed but what upsetts me is that there is no atom or Zeus. In this game... 2 main vhracters in the movie
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am laughing at some of these reviewers.  Those who spend just as much money at Starbucks or for a pack of cigarettes.  if you cant afford the books go to a library.  these books are relatively mild as compared to mot erotica out there.  Come on girls lighten up and enjoy the wonderful love story that it is.  Spice up your sex life and make your partner happy.  Close minded women who are afraid to experiment and make their men happy are selfish prigs.  dont base the decision of whether or not to read this series on the unhappy with their romantic sex life bad reviews.  have your own thoughts after taking the big girl step and expanding your mind.  If sex books will make you uncomfortable go buy a Harlequin.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Good graphics and action. Challenging,  good bonus games. Definitely recommended.  You'll waste too many hours playing this match+ app. Worth your time.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|We took our 3 yr old to go see this move the first day it came out and she had so much fun!!! Dancing and laughing out loud!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots of fun. kids enjoy it too. wish u could earn money faster. but still fun for all.<br />good way to past time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Oh my gosh!  My sister mentioned this book on FB so I went to amazon.com and bought it on my Kindle.  I could not put it down!  In fact, I read the entire book in one day.  It is very different from anything else I've ever read and it kept my attention and I hungered for every new page.  There is violence and a lot of it, but not the kind that makes you sick.  It's hard to explain to other people except to say \\"Read it\\"!!  You really do not know what is going to happen next, and many times, I went back and read an excerpt over again.  After enough time has passed, I may read it again.  I've also read the 2 books after this one.  They were good and the 3rd one very good, but neither captured my attention like this one.  I highly recommend The Hunger Games!!
0062082353|5.0|AMERICAN SNIPER begins with Kyle's first sniper kill and then follows his path from childhood all the way through his enlistment until he leaves the Navy in 2009. Reading about the way Kyle grew up and the life he led before becoming a SEAL really gives insight into what sort of person it takes to be a special forces operator. Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a \\"good ol' boy\\". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing. The autobiography is broken up into chapters with sub-chapters, making for quick easy reading and the tone of the narrative is so laid back that it's really more like having a conversation than reading.I love this book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I bought Catching Fire as soon as I got into the Hunger Games and  started it immediately upon completing Hunger Games - and it was too soon.  The first book is by far the best and I couldn't put it down.  However, Catching Fire got better and better and I enjoyed reading it.  It doesn't compare to Hunger Games and I would not want to have read this one first;  but eventually I couldn't put it down either.  I highly recommend the series of 3, starting with Hunger Games.  It surprised and delighted me.
B007SGM084|1.0|I really gave this a chance, but my time is worth more than spending days reading one episode of porn after the next. Ms. James is a good writer, but she needs to route her efforts into something more wholesome and realistic. Sorry! If I could have rated this with NO stars, I would have! Save your time...Read James Patterson or Diana Gabaldon!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I have mixed feelings about the book. At times the book was a real page turner. While at other times it really dragged. The father was not a believable character, and there were a few intimate moments inside the families house where the obvious questions and discussions just never seem to take place. I guess for me ultimately it left too many unanswered questions about the crime, motive and the main characters. Don't get me wrong it was a good read overall and about 3 1/2 stars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids and I love these games. They are a great way to past time while in line at the bank,  DMV or waiting in the doctors office.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|You'd better read if you don't want to lose at the starting line.  Victor Cheng's material has effectively helped me prepared my McKinsey interview.
158234082X|5.0|This is a fantastic book for anyone who is interested in a career in the culinary arts, loves food, or just wants to have a good laugh at the compelling tales of Anthony Bourdain.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|a lot to do without spending money...easy to navigate. fun for ice age fans. encourages player to rate game...but it is free...
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I thought this book was just ok. The writing wasn't too bad, but the dialogue left much to be desired. I believe there is a \\"strong sexual content\\" warning....I must have missed the strong sexual content, but being that it's about 19 year olds, that's probably a good thing. I finished the book because I'm neurotic about completing what I start, but if I wasn't I probably would have dropped it half way through.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it worked great for me and its woo fun...its way better than playing on an iphone or ipod becuz it is way easier to draw..love it!!!!&lt;3
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I have come to really love the TV show \\"Haven,\\" with all it's \\"Troubles\\" (the supernatural gifts/curses, depending on the \\"affliction\\" & your point of view, some of it's townsfolk possess).  It's a great mix of the supernatural, suspense, humor & so much more. FBI agent Audrey Parker's  struggle to find out about her past, & where she comes from, is at the core of everything (for me). As one questions seems to be answered, another pops up. As wonderful & complex as that part of the story is, it gets even better with the addition of Nathan (her, \\"troubled,\\" Haven PD partner & the one person she can truly trust), Chief Wuornos (Nathan's dad & the sarcastic Chief of police), Duke (the local smuggler, struggling with his own issues), &  the quirky Teagues brothers (Vince & Dave, who run the local paper, who seem to be a couple of town gossips, but have a LOT more going on beneath the surface). It's a wonderful show & I've enjoyed watching the 1st 2 seasons on TV, am very glad to own the 1st season on DVD & can't wait to get my hands on each new season, as they are made available. KEEP THEM COMING!!!

B0053VKP8S|5.0|After some research, I ended up buying this converter after seeing a lot of positive reviews. I wanted to do 2 things - 1. connect my TV to my set of Cyber Acoustics speakers that does not have a digital optical TOSLINK port and 2. connect my PS3 to the same set of external speakers.<br /><br />1. Now, like most new TVs, my TV only had a digital optical TOSLINK audio out port, so I ended up getting this FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter to connect an optical TOSLINK cable from my TV to the \\"Optical In\\" port of the FiiO D3 converter and my speakers to the \\"Audio Red and White Out\\" ports of the converter. All in all, everything worked out fine and I'm able to play TV audio from my Cyber Acoustics speakers now. (Make sure to set your audio output to external speakers or PCM under your TV settings.) Keep in mind that in order for the external speakers without a digital optical TOSLINK port to play TV audio, you need an additional cable - Rite AV 3.5mm to RCA stereo male cable - the red and white cables connect to the \\"Audio Red and White Out\\" ports of the FiiO D3 converter and the 3.5mm female end of the Rite AV cable is connected with the green plug from the speakers.<br /><br />2. Also, hooking up my PS3 to the external speakers using a digital optical TOSLINK cable and this converter worked fine. Just make sure to set the audio option in the PS3 audio settings to Optical cable (settings already preset - no need to change anything) in order to get audio through the external speakers.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers have mentioned that the converter can be USB battery powered. But an AC power wall adapter is also included for those with TVs that do not have USB ports. All in all, this converter is a definite must buy for those with new flat-screen TVs that only have a digital optical TOSLINK out port.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I usually read supernatural themed books but I decided to check this one out after reading reviews.  This book was awesome, very character driven.  The trilogy flowed gracefully and ended without any questions to be asked.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|the game is really good but if u don't do certain things right then u will get stuck on one level and never get off and sometimes it freezes up
B00004BZ16|3.0|This is not a five-star album.  \\"London Calling\\" is a five-star album, heck, it is a six-star album.  \\"Sandinista\\" suffers in comparison, although it is not without its moments.<br /><br />It was conceded by the band that they went into the studio without much prepration, and it generally shows (what with the constant touring, no one can blame them).  What we get in the end is a few great songs (Police on My Back, the Call Up, Washington Bullets), several pretty good songs I still like to listen to (Junco Partner, The Leader), and LOTS of unfocused experiments and jams that don't hold up too well. I got this album out the other day and found myself skipping about half the songs; they were just boring or bad.<br /><br />The album justifiably won praise at the time of its release for its embrace of so many types of different music, and the Clash was certainly one of the most versatile bands around.  I just wish the album had been more consistently good.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to Breaking bad - drama, seriously dark and violent but with a bit humor. Can't wait for Season 5
B008011XQQ|4.0|I have been a fan of Carlos Santana since before he cut his first album.  I've tried to follow him through all of his incarnations, hoping to grow with him musically.  Some I liked, some I didn't.  Although I bought Supernatural for the choice cuts, I've learned to cherry-pick his CDs for those few songs that ranked among his best stuff. For me, this feels like a shift away from all the guest stars and cover tunes and back to Carlos and his guitar.<br /><br />As mentioned elsewhere, this is mostly an album of instrumentals.  The exception being Eres La Luz, a fine Latin song, heavy with percussion and one of my favorites on this CD.  The piano of young Salvadore Santana on the last two cuts help make this album unique.  Angelica Faith, Never the Same Again -- my favorite cut, In the Light of Day, Macumba in Budapest, and Canela (with its lovely piano interplay) make this album worth downloading.<br /><br />After repeated listening...<br /><br />When I wrote the above review, there were only three 5 star reviews for this album.  To me, it does not have the magic of a Samba Pa Ti or Europa or any number of Santana masterpieces that would have earned it 5 stars, but I have to disagree with the guitar player who whines that he must look elsewhere to cop a little inspiration.  I don't mean to speak for Carlos, but maybe it's time to search within?  Carlos displays sheer brilliance on Canela. Anyone who has the chance to see him perform this song live will witness inspiration and mastery at the highest level.

B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to prove that he is gonna be around for a long, long time.  His depiction of a nihilistic punk with a soul is convincing to the core, and when you're an old feller like me who grew up in the mohawk punk era you knew guys like Hesher.  Hitting someone with a van was their idea of a joke.  Lighting things on fire, heck we all did that.  Metallica, not so much, that's something you gotta grow into.  And Hesher's sensitive side that doesn't make sense to a number of reviewers here- that's the point- many nihilists are so affected by the fate of the planet and the despair of humanity that it drives them to outwardly uncaring while inwardly suffering.<br />With just a glance at the broken crockery on the floor you can see Hesher's own traumatic childhood spattered on the cabinets, and when he tells T.J. to go walk with his grandma he means it with good reason, as he is estranged from his own family.  The kid, the dude from The Office, and Natalie Portman all bring something to the table in a well-acted indie that clips some noses and eats a few urinal cakes.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|To everyone who is complaining about only two worlds, SHUT UP. Haven't you heard of updates? I'm downloading one right now.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|The application functions very well and I enjoy the options for more games to download free. This application is not meant for beginners at all. Even at the easiest setting, many moves are made that would be impossible for a beginner to know or understand. Its also just a little too small. I have a Samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket, and its uncomfortable on the eyes. But to just download for fun, its worth it!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I generally like Picoult's incisive investigation of contemporary issues and angsts. However, I found this particular group of white middle-class Americans just a bit too smug and self-satisfied to care about very much - I wanted to shake them! Their offspring seemed spoilt brats who were never satisfied... yes, in a way this is what she is saying, but I'd had enough of them by the end.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a total waste of money.  Our book club chose this book, so I felt obligated to read it.  I don't understand how this book is getting good reviews; it is terribly written!  The writing style is very \\"teenager-like.\\"  I hated the characters from the beginning, so was never able to identify with them.  I also don't understand the comparisons to the Twilight books.  Although the writing style of the Twilight series was amateurish, I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and characters.  The \\"racy\\" sex scenes that so many people are talking about in this book are no big deal.  I couldn't wait to finish this book, so I could download some real literature!  I certainly won't be reading the rest of this trilogy!

B006ZZANG0|5.0|Most fans of Rufus Wainwright will agree, much as I do, that he has one of the most beautiful voices in music. To me, he has the most beautiful voice in music period. With that said, don't expect this subjective review to look at anything with much objectivity. All I can do is discuss what I hear and how I respond to it. His last album, the somber and stripped down [[ASIN:B0038JH3AU All Days Are Nights: Songs For Lulu]], made in the wake of his mother's death featured just his voice coupled with his piano. It was a great showcase for his vocal talent, but the songwriting was lacking and it emerged as one of his weaker efforts. Last year he announced he was working with Mark Ronson (whose producing credits include Adele and Amy Winehouse) and was working on his \\"poppiest, most danceable\\" album. After years of loitering in relative obscurity it seemed like Rufus was prepared to be a pop star...But I wondered if the album would be a new, modern sound for him and I questioned how well it would work. Not that \\"pop\\" is very far from Rufus' trademark sound in the first place. Well, Ronson's influence is apparent but this is thoroughly a Rufus Wainwright album that happens to feature some of the poppiest songs of his career without going anywhere near \\"selling out.\\" Rufus may have spoken too soon when he called it his \\"poppiest, most danceable\\" album, but if any record in his oeurve makes him a pop star, this would be it. While his sadness over his mother's passing reflected clearly in his last record, his happiness over the birth of his daughter is quite apparent here. This is Rufus rejuvenated.<br /><br />Out of the Game does not sound like modern pop music or a modern pop record. It sounds like it was lifted straight from the 1970s and Rufus has cited Elton John, David Bowie, and Queen as the album's main influences. It's undeniably Rufus' most accessible album, but it's just poppy enough to attract new fans without alienating old ones.<br /><br />Like all of his records, it's incredibly eclectic. The title track (also the album's opener) has a country tinge to it, with Rufus crooning the verses before bursting into an operatic chorus. I love this song; my only complaint being that the chorus doesn't fit the song as fluidly. Even Rufus seems to trip over the \\"look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you suckers\\" line. My apprehensiveness to this has waned and Out of the Game is a great track, a good choice for a single, and not a far departure from what we typically expect from him.<br /><br />Jericho is one of the best songs on the record, catchy but not in an overly poppy way. It's somewhere between classic Rufus and this new poppier version. The song's bridge is a thing of beauty vocally, lyrically, and musically. If you want to convince someone to listen to this album, this is a good song to use to help your case. It's hard to listen to this track only once.<br /><br />Rashida is a Queen-tinged song with soaring, hypnotic vocals. Barbara has a great `70s vibe. Welcome to the Ball recalls the songs of his first album and also stands as one of the best tracks here. Once again, the bridge beginning with \\"Something in your eyes has made this room a much more brighter place...\\" is well, quite stunning. Montauk has a swirling, Wizard of Oz-esque melody with lyrics about his daughter one day visiting him and his fiance at their home in Montauk. Bitter Tears is the closest to Rufus' description of the album and is the poppiest song on the record. Heavy on synthesizers, oozing pop it's one of the catchiest songs he's ever done and would be a wise choice for a future single. He follows this with Respectable Dive, a quiet and gorgeous tune with a heavy 1940s atmosphere. You can almost picture him wearing a fedora, singing this song in a smoky club.<br /><br />Perfect Man may be my favorite tune on the record and one of my favorite Rufus songs ever. To me, this song is pure, unadulterated perfection. From the funky opening chords, tothe \\"thinking over it, over it, how can I get over it...\\" refrain, to the perfect juxtaposition of the music and vocal prowess of Rufus and Martha Wainwright on the song's haunting chorus. Everytime I listen to this song, the chorus sends shivers up my spine. Will you have the same reaction, or even necessarily like the song? No. But I can't stop raving about it. It's a masterpiece.<br /><br />Sometimes You Need is a breezy little track; neither particularly special nor forgettable. Song of You took me awhile to appreciate, but is now a standout. Written for his fiance Jorn, the song is a slow jam with a show of vocal gymnastics from Mr. Wainwright. It's a lovely track with humorous, self-aware lyrics. The final track Candles is a nearly 8-minute track for his late mother, with backing vocals from his father Loudon Wainwright III. It's a bit indulgent and I didn't fully appreciate it until seeing Rufus open his San Diego show with the song, performing it acapella while his band slowly filled in the music as the song progressed. Seeing him standing in the dark belting out this song with no musical accompaniment really helped me appreciate it fully.<br /><br />The iTunes version of the album features a bonus track called WWIII, which can also be purchased separately. It's a song that's been floating around for about a year, only with a few added production flourishes. It's equally as lovely as the more simplistic earlier version and definitely worth acquiring. Out of the Game has also been released in a deluxe edition that features a DVD with Rufus breaking the album down track-by-track, a conversation with Rufus and Mark Ronson, and a performance of what Rashida sounded like in its original form. I can't vouch for the rewatch value of this DVD, but if you're a fan it may be worth it to grab this version.<br /><br />This is Rufus' seventh album and is certainly his most accessible. I've listened to it countless times since its release and I imagine I'll be listeningto it consistently until I temporarily burn myself out on it. This is a huge achievement for Wainwright on a musical, lyrical, and vocal level. Ronson has done a wonderful job producing the vocals and Rufus himself agrees that this is his highest achievement vocally. It's hard to disagree that he's never sounded better. Lyrically, he's always been a mixed bag. His lyrics scarcely rhyme and flip-flop between genius and overdone. That trend is mostly the same here, but I don't think any other album in his discography has such consistently well put-together lyrics. Musically, it's one of his most eclectic. Forgive the teenage vernacular here, but musically it's a total eargasm throughout.<br /><br />I can't recommend this album highly enough. While I'm rarely interested in more than a few albums released each year, this is my personal favorite of 2012 thus far. It's another piece of brilliance from Rufus Wainwright that has brought joy and beauty to my life and I hope it can do the same for you.

B000OCXIDK|3.0|I expected this to be my favorite Tracy Chevalier book and was very surprised to discover it wasn't. The main issue I had with the book was with the characters. I don't mind if a character has contradictions, in fact, I like it. But I need to have an explaination for actions that are out of character. If I don't understand the character's motivations I feel that I don't know them very well, making it difficult to relate to them. There were a lot of things I enjoyed about the \\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\\". As usual, Chevalier makes the atmosphere come to life in a way that few can. You feel as if you have really stepped back in time to mid 17th century Delft. The storyline, involving Vermeer's relationship with a young housemaid is very interesting and compelling. I recommend this book to fans of Tracy Chevalier.<br /><br />Jennifer K. Lafferty<br />Author of Offbeat Love Stories and More
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|I have to admit, i watch more movies then a socially acceptable person should.  So when i saw the previews for this action/thriller i knew i would have to see it.  What a waste of 10 bucks....  The only memorable part (and it is only memorable to me cause i laughed so hard) is the L.E.O part.  The rest of the movie was over shadowed my how completely bad the main actress (quite possibly could be an actor, the verdict is still out)is through out the entire film. The fight sceens are pretty good, but they way they filmed it makes it look staged. But hey, what do I know. If you think this movie looks like your cup of tea, i incourage you to give it a sip.  Its all about a persons point of view.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|What Leftover Cowboy noted in his excellent review is all true, though the early concession that taste is \\"subjective\\" wasn't necessary.  Any sufficiently-evolved conscious being with the requisite sensory organs, in any possible universe, who encounters Vulgar will have no choice but to call it a masterpiece.  If that isn't objective truth I don't know what is.  A person knows this album is immortal with a greater degree of confidence than he/she knows the sun is going to rise tomorrow.  I possess a richer degree of knowledge regarding this album than I do regarding the chair I am sitting in; after all, the chair might be a stream of computer code in the Matrix, but this album is god in musical form whether you are in the Matrix or not.  This album transformed one person from scrawny nerd to muscular stud over the course of high school; to put it in terms today's pimply youth can grasp, this is like finding the most powerful magic sword in Skyrim, and bringing it back to Earth.  Whether you are a testosterone-crazed youth hitting the iron or a 30-something on a recliner hitting an electric brain cigarette, this album delivers on a scale that is so far off the charts it embodies A NEW LEVEL!!!!!! Respect, m'f'ers!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|On August 2, 2007, I said of Pan's Labyrinth \\"So many people recommended this movie to me, I decided it had to be good. It was not.\\" I now suspect it was this movie they meant to recommend, at least most of them. This one is great!<br /><br />Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is frustrated and frankly bitchy because she hates having to babysit for her baby brother while her father and step-mother go out. She was in the park playing out her favorite fantasy book, \\"Labyrinth\\" when she hears a tower clock chime 7. Oh no, she was supposed to be home an hour ago to sit for that darn Toby! Once his parents leave, Toby just will not stop crying, and Sarah gets so annoyed she says \\"the right words\\" to have the goblins take him away. What's cool is that there is a collection of muppet goblins hiding within hearing (possibly in her closet?) making comments and shushing each other, waiting for her to say the right words.<br /><br />Once the child is gone, the King of the Goblins (David Bowie, in his most perfectly type-casted role ever) appears and tells her she has 13 hours to find Toby or he will keep the boy forever. By the way, his clock has 13 numbers on it, not the usual 12.<br /><br />Only problem is, Toby is being held in the King's Castle, which is surrounded by the strangest labyrinth you've ever seen. Way better than the one in the movie \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\\" if not in the book. [Why did they wimp out on making the labyrinth in that movie so boring compared to the book?]<br /><br />The characters she meets, the unexpected she encounters at every turn, more or less, and how she finally rescues Toby seem more like an acid trip than merely fantasy. In fact, at one point she is given a peach which turns out to be drugged to make her forget. (Shades of \\"Wizard of Oz\\" there. Well, Frank Oz did work on the film.) Being muppets, these creatures and objects that come to life have great senses of humor, and so many quips and puns and inside jokes happen so fast that I know I'm going to have to watch it several times.<br /><br />I was laughing throughout, but there's also surprises and adventure and even a nod to M.C. Escher. Through it all you will root for Sarah to find Toby, and you will be startled by her successes as much as her set-backs, and the whole thing will be great fun for all. It got a PG rating because there are some \\"body jokes,\\" and even one or two profanities, but nothing to surprise or shock a child who has been to public school at least a year.I know I'm going to have to watch it several times.<br /><br />I was laughing throughout, but there's also surprises and adventure and even a nod to M.C.

B00125WAWS|5.0|Inspiring, stimulating, frightening, and also, incredibly entertaining. This is the story of one brilliant teacher and four (reduced to three) brilliant students who made history, and did it right.<br /><br />Denzel Washington (whom I have adored ever since The Pelican Brief, and who plays the black men who are both smart and sexy almost as well as Sidney Poitier) plays Melvin Tolson. We are told he went on from tiny Wiley College in Texas to become famous as a poet. I guess I'll have to look up some of his works, although I'm not much of a poetry buff. Professor Tolson has two sides: the demanding coach of the Wiley College debate team, and activist union organizer of the southern sharecroppers.<br /><br />This is 1936 in the Jim Crow south. Things get nasty. At one point, the debate team comes across a lynch mob and the charred body of their victim hanging from a tree. Hot-headed Henry Lowe (passionately played by Nate Parker) wants to get out of the car and cut down the corpse, but his team-mates persuade him to stay in the car as they manage to make their way through the lynch mob and into the clear, but only just barely.<br /><br />Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett) is the only girl on the team, and as brilliant as she is pretty. She falls in love with Henry Lowe, who breaks her heart, while James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker) watches her and pines with unrequited love. But he's only 14, for all he is a college student, and short and round. Brilliant, and a genuinely nice kid, the son of brilliant preacher James Farmer, Sr. (played by Forest Whitaker, no doubt Denzel's father).<br /><br />Yes, there are also uneducated negroes (that's what they were called in 1936; or \\"colored\\") in the story, but mostly the ones showing considerable injuries from contact with the sheriff or the Texas Rangers. Those and the ones who managed to avoid violence but also probably never even saw the inside of a school room.<br /><br />It was hard enough to go to college at all in the 1930s, let alone being black, let alone in the south. But they won debate after debate, for an undefeated record as of the date Harvard invited them to come to Boston to debate with their famous team.<br /><br />Do I really have to tell you that they won? Or that James Farmer, Jr., who went on to found the Congress on Racial Equality seven years later, was the breathtaking final speaker? It was so perfect you couldn't help holding your breath to catch every word.930s, let alone being black, let alone in the south.

0783231202|4.0|I heard a lot about this film when it was new. As I understand it, there were some very mixed reviews. Some said it was based on a true story, but didn't stick close enough. Some said it was too close, including pretty graphic violence and nakedness, even frontal nudity. But people don't demurely turn their thighs to cover their privates when they are being tossed overboard.<br /><br />I agree that it was indeed violent, but then it was an extraordinarily violent true story. All of the violence was pertinent, although it might not have needed to be quite so graphic in spots.<br /><br />There's no doubt it's confusing. A significant aspect of the story is that the Africans did not know any language but their own, and nobody even tried to find an interpreter until a surprisingly long way into the story.<br /><br />The historical story is basic: In 1839, a slave ship called Amistad was taken over by the slaves and all but two of the whites on board were killed. Those two were ordered (by sign language, mostly) to return the ship to Africa so the people could return to their families. Instead the ship was recaptured and the prisoners were taken to New England.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the first legal issue was whose property they were. Quite a few people laid claim to them. It took a long time for anyone to realize that according to then-current law, they were only slaves if they had been born into slavery. Therefore, quite a few people had an interest in proving that they came from Cuba, and had indeed been born slaves. However, their clever attorney Roger Baldwin (played rather impishly by Matthew McConaughey) and his abolitionist allies Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard) and Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) set out to prove that they came from Africa.<br /><br />Once an interpreter was finally found, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) told the harrowing tale of how they had been captured by rival tribes and sold to Spanish slave-traders in Sierra Leone. A large \\"slave fortress\\" was doing a brisk illegal business. The brutality they experienced was almost literally unbelievable, and the slimy Secretary of State John Forsyth tries to prove that it is not believable. I was laughing at the casting here. Forsyth is played by David Paymer, whom I remembered as an equally slimy pornographer in a 1987 episode of \\"21 Jump Street.\\"<br /><br />The entire case became the most complicated legal mess you can possibly imagine. In fact, it ended up in the Supreme Court, more because of the politics of the situation than for any other reason. Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) was running for re-election, and he needed the votes of the slave-holding south.<br /><br />Baldwin and Joadson, with the help of Cinque, manage to persuade John Quincey Adams (Anthony Hopkins) to argue their case before the Supreme Court. (Forsyth quips that he will be remembered mostly for his middle name, which is of course the truth.) Adams' help was important partly because a majority of the Justices were themselves southern slave-holders.<br /><br />It's a very brutal story, rather brutally told. Still, it is of very important historical significance, and on the whole, Director Steven Spielberg did a good job. Good, not great. It is as good as it is mostly due to the actors I have mentioned, plus one more: Judge Coglin, who was hand-picked by the President to replace the original trial judge for reasons I won't go into here, was played by Jeremy Northam. I do hope to see more of him; he's quite a charming fellow.was doing a brisk illegal business.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|I believe that when I reviewed \\"Arsenic and Old Lace,\\" I said that real mass murderers were not funny, but fictional ones are. Well, Johnny Depp has been an exception in enough other circumstances that I ought to have known. It's also gruesome, but it is funny in several ways.<br /><br />The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is based on a true story. Or at least there's some reason to believe he was. Anyway, whether he was a real person or based upon several different stories, the fact is this is both a horror story and a humorous one. It's also, oddly enough, a musical. Yes, musical. Didn't know Johnny Depp could sing, did you? Well, you still won't after you see this film. He sings the way people who can't sing do: not so much off key as not really concerned with key.<br /><br />The story centers around barber Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp), of course, and his friend and landlady, and perhaps lover, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a widow who sells meat pies. When Sweeney first meets her, she is making \\"the worst meat pies in London,\\" mostly by capturing cats and no-you-don't-want-to-know-what-else. But after she and barber Sweeney join forces, her pies become much tastier and more popular. You see, Sweeney has created a special barber chair that tilts his victims down into Mrs. Lovett's basement. She has a meat grinder there . . .<br /><br />There's more to the story than that, of course. Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, who plays Snape in the Harry Potter series) is the villain who stole the innocent Todd's wife and adopted his daughter after charging him with a crime he did not commit and sentencing him to transportation, presumably to Australia. By the time he returns to London 18 years later, accompanied by a sailor named Anthony (sweet young lad named Jamie Campbell Bower), his daughter is all grown up, and virtually a prisoner of the evil Judge Turpin. Johanna (Jayne Wisener) is beautiful in that innocent, ethereal style so reminiscent of Jane Austen heroines, and ofcourse falls in love with Anthony, just from him standing outside her window gaping at her while she sings a sad little song so very, very sweetly. Ain't love grand? Of course Anthony has no more notion that she is Sweeney Todd's daughter than he does what the filling is in Mrs. Lovett's pies.<br /><br />Speaking of Alan Rickman and Snape, there's another refugee from the Harry Potter series in this one; the Beadle is played by Timothy Spall, who most of us remember as the sniveling Peter Pettigrew.<br /><br />Have fun, but turn your head when the razor gets close to a customer's neck. There's an awful lot of blood in this movie.

6305537321|4.0|It's great fun. Perhaps not great art, even though it was written by Truman Capote, but it certainly is great fun. This is the one where Henry Mancini got an Oscar for \\"Moon River.\\" Miss Hepburn sings it.<br /><br />The focus of the story is an apartment house in New York City, where Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) lives and parties and drives the photographer two floors up (Mickey Rooney playing a Japanese) quite crazy by buzzing his door to be let in no matter how late it is. She says \\"but I lost my key,\\" and he replies \\"But that was two weeks ago, you must have another one made.\\" Her answer is \\"Why? I'd just loose it. I lose them all the time.\\" But she quiets him by saying that if he's nice to her, she will let him take \\"those pictures we talked about.\\"<br /><br />In the apartment directly over her head there moves in an aspiring young writer (George Peppard) who is \\"sponsored\\" by a rich older woman (Patricia Neal) who calls him darling all the time and decorated his apartment for him before he even saw it. She's obviously using him as a toy or a pet, and he accepts it so that he can write.<br /><br />Holly's income is a little hard to figure. She gets $100 a week (in 1961 that was quite a lot) for going to visit a gangster at Sing Sing once a week, and taking his lawyer a message in the form of a weather report. She says that men give her $50 \\"for the powder room,\\" and if she asks for cab fare, they usually give her $100. As Truman Capote wrote it, she was more obviously a prostitute, but this sounds more like she's a fake. Twice she appeals to Paul, the writer, for protection from men who \\"followed her home.\\" In fact, her agent says she's a fake, but she's a genuine fake. That is, she believes the stuff she says.<br /><br />One of the funniest parts is a huge party she has in her little apartment, where all sorts of crazy things happen. Her agent (Martin Balsam) goes up to this tall, beautiful woman and asks her name. \\"She\\" answers \\"Irving.\\" He doesn't seem to mind; later Paul finds them necking in the bathtub.<br /><br />There's enough more to the story I'm tempted to go on, but let's leave a few surprises, OK?mind; later Paul finds them necking in the bathtub.<br /><br />There's enough more to the story I'm tempted to go on, but let's leave a few surprises, OK?

B004SEUIWY|3.0|Separating fact from fiction is much of what this movie is about, so let's start with this: it is NOT a biography of the brothers, and does not pretend to be. Instead, it is a hilarious and scary and wild romp through their stories and a world that, to some extent, they did indeed inhabit.<br /><br />I think their being in French-occupied Germany in the early 1800s is probably accurate. After that, all bets are off. We see the brothers originally as children, Will the elder and Jake the younger. Jake was sent out to sell the cow so they could pay a doctor for their seriously ill sister, and instead comes back with a handful of \\"magic\\" beans. (Sound familiar yet?) The next we see them, they are grown.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Will, and Heath Ledger plays Jake -- in glasses. You will have to do your best to forget what you know about these sexy young men, because they are definitely NOT in type-casted roles here. Frankly, they are con men. They go into a village that has a psychic problem, like a witch who haunts them although she has been dead 100 years, and perform an elaborate (and expensive) exorcism.<br /><br />The one example we get to see in detail involves a confederate dressed up like a ghostly witch and pulled around by pulleys in the rafters of the barn, and a magic potion which has to be shot at her with a cross-bow which is made of baby tears, among other things. Knowing it is fake, it's a lovely slapstick comedy. But the first time I saw the movie, I didn't know what was going on, and I expected one or more people to be killed at any moment. I've seen this movie three times now, and I still can't say I know what's going on at all times. But I'm getting closer.<br /><br />Rather than ruin the plot for you, I'll provide a list of familiar characters and situations you will recognize. We already mentioned Jack and the Beanstalk, but you will also see Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, the witch Disney made famous who asked her mirror if she was the fairest of all, plus bits and pieces of all sorts of magical stories.<br /><br />As I say, they were con men. But then a French general captures them and tells them that he knows they are frauds, and he is sending them to the town of Marbaden where little girls have been disappearing, and he figures it's another con artist like themselves. They are to go and unmask the villain, and the French general will be credited with saving the village. It doesn't take Jake long to realize that they are in over their heads, but Will goes on spouting theories of how all the remarkable events are being faked. But eventually, even he must admit they are up against a real witch.<br /><br />It's incredibly complicated, not everything is explained, and yet the screen ends with \\"and they all lived happily ever after.\\" A few seconds later it changes to \\"or did they?\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed it more each time, as I understood better. But I still think you should not have to watch a movie over and over to get a sense of what's going on. Maybe not all the details, but some concept of a coherent story. So I can't give it more than three stars.ked her mirror if she was the fairest of all, plus bits and pieces of all sorts of magical stories.<br /><br />As I say, they were con men.

B0013A1T8I|3.0|It's good. Even very good. But with the huge build-up it was given, I have to say it is not great. Perhaps if I was under 18, it would be great. Comes close. But then I read the book first. I kept wondering how it would be if I had seen the film first, and then read the book. I think the movie would indeed stimulate me to read the book.<br /><br />Dakota Blue Richards is a charming young girl who plays Lyra Belacqua in a world similar to, but not quite the same, as our own.  The movie does stick close to the plot line of the book, although as always, things have to change to accommodate the different medium.<br /><br />As everyone knows by now, Nicole Kidman plays Mrs. Coulter, who seems ever so beautiful and sweet and fake. She's mysterious in that she says all these nice things about the Magisterium, while the rest of us can tell early on that they are a bunch of power-mad pompous asses. It's clear they represent the Established Church in this world.<br /><br />This world is different from ours in several ways, but the most significant one is that people's souls are not inside them, but outside in the form of animals. They are called daemons. A child's daemon changes shape pretty much at will, but an adult's settles into a single form. You can tell a lot about a person by the nature of their daemon. Mrs. Coulter's is a nasty-tempered golden monkey. Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), who starts the movie by making it clear that the Magisterium and he hate each other, has a leopard. The other thing you should know is that, with rare exceptions, the daemon is of the opposite gender from the human.<br /><br />Think about that one for awhile. Carl Jung would understand.<br /><br />It's all very confusing, but I suspect twice as confusing if you've never read the book. The special effects are quite believable, and add a visual dimension to what I read. The spy flies are especially interesting; keep your eye on them.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but I'm not as crazy about the movie as I was of the book. For one thing, Kidman over-plays the pink and black witch role; sweet candy coating over something really nasty. Also, her hair-do in her first scene is ridiculous.as I was of the book.

I enjoy the fact that the band's role is just as important and incorporated with the music as Nate's awesome voice. Also the fact that each song has an idividual feel with the album is not monotone. I generally do not like autotune, due to the fact that I think musicians are using it more as a crutch versus enhancing the talent that they have, but Fun. does it right.<br /><br />Wish I would have found thier music sooner and I am excited to see how their sound will evolve in the future.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I avoided the book, and I avoided the film for the longest while, too. Over ten years, it says here. But Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas are almost as desirable to me as Johnny Depp, so when I got a bargain on it, I bought it. I'm not sure whether I'm glad or not.<br /><br />It's a horror film, alright, although it's beautifully filmed. The actors, set designers, location scouts, special effects men, costume designers, lighting men (oh, yes; many problems with light in the film, artfully solved) all did their jobs well.<br /><br />One of the reasons I avoided this film was the vampire Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst, who is only a child. Rather small child, in fact, maybe 7 or 8 years old. People who become vampires never age past the day they were bit. But their minds mature, they can learn things, and so she seems to be a child prodigy, playing the piano like an expert, dancing majestically, talking like an adult (way too much like an adult), and having the passions of an adult. But not the body.<br /><br />This disturbed me, and was the main reason I avoided the book and movie all these years. After all, this little girl (who must obviously be played by a child actress) is traveling with two very adult, very sensuous men. She eventually screams at them, \\"Which one of you did this to me?\\" and throws a considerable tantrum over the whole thing.<br /><br />Claudia turns out to be the most vicious and heartless of the three. Lestat (Tom Cruise) is bold and unapologetic, but points out he was not given a choice when he was made a vampire, the way he gave Louis (Brad Pitt) a choice. Eventually we meet the vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas) who \\"created\\" Lestat. But Louis has a conscience, and tries to survive on the blood of \\"rats and poodle dogs,\\" as Lestat sneeringly described it. But as Lestat predicted, he eventually got over that.<br /><br />They started in New Orleans, then went traveling, especially to Paris. There Armand followed Louis one day and, to prove he was a real vampire, danced on the ceiling of an archway. He gives Louis a card announcing the Vampire Theater, and Louis & Claudia go see it. It doesn't take them long to realize that what they are seeing is vampires pretending to be humans playing vampires. They also figure that the young woman who \\"plays\\" a sacrificial victim at the end of the play really is dead.<br /><br />OK, I'll not spoil it for you. Let's just say it's harder to kill a vampire than Buffy lead you to believe.o prove he was a real vampire, danced on the ceiling of an archway.

B00005O3VD|3.0|I have strangely mixed feelings about this movie.<br /><br />As I'm sure you know, this is the first part of the story of Fanny Brice, famous comedienne discovered by Flo Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon). She does some great songs, and one totally hilarious scene with the song \\"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\\" and a pillow under her wedding gown! Ziegfeld had hired her as a singer, but the audience loved her as a comedienne, so of course she did both.<br /><br />Of course the sets and the costumes are grand, not only in Ziegfeld's Follies but off the stage. The private dining room where Fanny discovers that pate is just chopped liver, and where she figures she's going to be dessert, is red velvet and gold trim, just like those marvelous old luxury palaces in San Francisco.<br /><br />But there's something about the story that bothers me. For one thing, Nick is a gambler, and has never done anything else except breed horses and bet on them, play poker (going on a cruise for the poker games), and wear his beautiful ruffled shirt. So why is he so determined to support his family when his wife is rich? And if he was really determined, why doesn't he accept the offer to manage a club and casino just because Fanny is one of the investors? I guess you'd have to say it's pride, but I can't see that kind of pride being consistent with being a professional gambler.<br /><br />Just before he goes to prison for embezzlement, he tells Fanny to divorce him, because he will never \\"catch up to her,\\" in the sense of have as much income as she does; be as famous as she is. She says wait until you get back home, and if you still feel that way, I won't fight you. But when he does come back, she tells him she realized he was right. Still, she loves him, and goes out on stage and sings \\"My Man\\" with heartbreaking intensity. I guess I just don't understand how the Beautiful People feel.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not a bad movie by any means, and in some ways quite good.
B0031RS64G|3.0|I have to admit i did enjoy this book and this could be a great set to get into.<br /><br />However... i found that there was far too much information to digest and i found myself just reading in the moment rather than apply what i was reading to other parts of the story.<br /><br />I will try the second book but not until i have tried another set like the farseer trilogy
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I've spent the last 18 months creating a tempting online persona. Amazon, more fond of me than my lovers, has always known what I like better than any one else. When I got the e-mail in my inbox saying that this was a golden ticket item, I panicked. Confusion, frustration, and regret poured over me. \\"Is it too late?\\" I asked myself. I immediately threw my coffee to the floor and raced to my e-Machine, opened up the browser to the Amazon homepage, and made four remarkable purchases of \\"The Sound of Music (45th Anniverssary Blu-ray/DVD Combo Limited Edition)\\". I still don't have Blu-ray or DVD player so if you have any suggestions, please let me know in the comments.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This is one of those classic books I've been meaning to get around to.  When it was finally on sale for less than a buck on the Kindle, I decided to take the plunge and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I've only read one of Matheson's other books (his latest one at the time of this review) but I'm a big fan of his work on the original \\"Twilight Zone\\" and \\"I Am Legend\\" certainly has much of the same vibe as many TZ episodes.<br /><br />Many \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes (including the pilot) dealt with a lone or small group of survivors after the apocalypse.  Only in this case instead of nuclear war it's a plague that gradually turns everyone into \\"vampires.\\"  It's important to note that in many ways Matheson's vampires are more akin to the zombies of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and such than the vampires in \\"Dracula\\" or especially \\"Twilight.\\"  These vampires cannot go out in the light and they drink blood, but they aren't super strong or super fast and they can't change into other shapes.  The way they shamble around, seemingly unable to even open a door, definitely makes them closer to zombies than vampires.<br /><br />Robert Neville is seemingly the last man on Earth, or at least the last man in his neck of the woods in California.  After about five months he's built his old house into an impenetrable fortress that's stocked with food and has a generator for electricity.  He even has a hothouse to grow garlic that helps keep the vampires at bay.  Every night the vampires gather around his house, hoping he'll come out.  One of his former neighbors yells at him constantly to come out while the undead women strike lurid poses in the hope of coaxing Neville from his fortress.<br /><br />Most of the story then deals with Neville's survival.  In particular in how he has to deal with the crushing loneliness and isolation of being the only real human left.  To help combat that, Neville begins trying to understand the disease that wiped out humanity and possibly to find a cure for it.<br /><br />Along the way we learn a little more about Neville's life before the plague, in particular what happened with his wife and daughter.  Though still by the end the details are a little skimpy, especially where the daughter is concerned.  One bit of confusion for me was that it took a while for Matheson to really establish whether Kathy was the wife or daughter and the same for Virginia.<br /><br />Still, I found this a riveting, suspenseful read.  Modern readers who yearn for buckets of blood and gore aren't going to find that so much in here, but it is a fascinating tale of survival in the face of great horror and adversity.<br /><br />Another note is that if you saw the Will Smith film from a few years ago you should disregard that as except for the title and basic premise they don't have much in common.<br /><br />That is all.for it.<br /><br />Along the way we learn a little more about Neville's life before the plague, in particular what happened with his wife and daughter.

0316010669|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  It actually has some insights that are worth listening to.  But ultimately it turns into a culturally biased commentary on why you are racist whether you know it or not.  Also, we are reminded that the author is better than you, particularly if you are a white male.  And finally, he manages to make the book political by using only examples to support his arguments that are out of the liberal playbook of stereotypes and false premises. I actually think some of his points are valid, but if he cannot see past his own viewpoint that racism is under every rock and behind every tree (which is patently false if you are a liberal reading this) how can you trust any of his conclusions?

B0035LGXXO|5.0|I have seen this flick a few times. It never gets old. Instant video isn't as good as the DVD, but it will do the trick.<br /><br />Character development is too fast but intriguing.<br /><br />Scene and sound are exceptional.<br /><br />I spent a month or two in NYC in the early 70's when I was maybe 13, this work strikes home.<br /><br />It causes me to think, \\"there is really no defense against a gang of anybody, acting on the spur of the moment, who aren't afraid of anything, unless you are hanging with a whole bunch of buds who will watch your back\\".
0345803485|1.0|Upon reading the first chapter of this book, the first four pages fell out. When I was 100 pages in, about 10 more pages fell out! I bought it new so I'm not quite sure why it was so poorly constructed.

B0053O89IS|4.0|You get season 7 of \\"Bones\\".<br /><br />While the season was only 13 episodes long, because of Emily Deschanel's pregnancy and Fox's desire to test \\"The Finder\\", it managed to cram in some huge changes - and big plotlines - into that short season.<br /><br />With the start of the season, we saw Brennan and Booth both adjusting to their new life together, awaiting the birth of their child. We also saw them let go of the last vestiges of their single lives and find a ramshackle home (which, with Wendall's FAST off screen help!) to move into. With the birth of their daughter, Christine, came a new sense of family.<br /><br />For many episodes, the family angle was played up. Some might even say it was played up *too much*, but with tonight's finale, I think there was a point to it, so I can understand the reasoning, even if I felt the season was drama light. Starting with \\"The Crack in the Code\\", we meet the likely reason for the emphasis on family. His name is Christopher Pelant, a hacker who had messed with the government and ended up with an ankle monitor for his trouble. But the viewers see that is not the end of his \\"fun\\", by any means. He is, very much so, an equal to the folks at the Jeffersonian in terms of brilliance. In the first episode we meet him, he manages to murder a reporter and have the remains cremated before they can be examined by altering government red tape. He also manages to fry Angela's expensive equipment when she tries to scan the bones of another erstwhile victim of his by putting malware inside said bones.<br /><br />An average criminal, he clearly is not.<br /><br />In between the Pelant arc, the audience gets a shout-out episode - using Easter eggs and hybrid staff names - as a wink and thank you to the fans, as one of Brennan's novels gets filmed into a movie. We also see how Angela and Hodgins are, themselves, adjusting to parenthood, often with Angela using her experiences to help Brennan deal with her own worries.<br /><br />Maybe TPTB knew there was limited time in which to really dig deep into the drama, so the fluff was used much more prevalently, in my opinion, than in past seasons, hence four stars instead of five. I like fluff, but the show is ostensibly a dramedy and there was a bit too little \\"dram\\" versus \\"edy\\". Still, I think that was to make things easier on Ms. Deschanel, and to give the viewers a quiet reprieve from the drama of the prior season.<br /><br />And, naturally, to really build up the happiness before Pelant made his creepy presence felt once again - in a *big way* - for the finale. In which a parallel between Booth/Brennan and Brennan's own past is made. I will not spoil what happens but, needless to say, echoes of Brennan's past make its way into the present with some heart-wrenching choices when it seems circumstances play against her. Which puts the future of Booth, Brennan, and their baby as a family in jeopardy.<br /><br />And with those unanswered questions, I look forward to seeing how things resolve in Season 8, which, on the bright side, looks to be a full, regular season come fall, including four \\"bonus\\" episodes that were ordered for either the summer or for the new season; recently, it was announced these four episodes would be included in Season 8 as stand-alone episodes (versus the usual episodes that seem to have a continuing arc).<br /><br />So, the moral is, enjoy the fluff while it is around - even if a bit too much - because the drama will always kick back in. Hart Hanson and Company have proven it once again.<br /><br />ETA: 06/20/2012: Oddly, while no release date for this set is still posted here, Amazon's Canadian site, Amazon.ca, is also taking orders and has a release date now for October 9th. This should apply as Canada and the US both have Region 1 DVDs and use Region A for Blu-Ray. Also, October 9th is a Tuesday, which is typically when new releases come out in the US. So just a possible update in terms of just when this set may be released!<br /><br />ETA, Part 2 - 07/19/2012: As you see, the key art for the DVD/BluRay set has been released. TV Shows On DVD has the release date as October 9th, though Amazon does not have that listed yet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After reading the vampire series, I was ready for another book filled with teenage angst.  Much to my surprise, I fully enjoyed this quick read.  Great job in character development and creation of suspense.
B005IZLPME|2.0|We need about 1,000,000 reviews of this product to point out that the 3D was \\"created\\" in post production.  That conversion is very disappointing.  To the other reviewer that also only reviewed the 3D aspects, and gave it 3 stars (3.5 stars), I would disagree.  If Avatar and Tron are at 5-stars for 3D, this is a negative 7 stars.<br /><br />To give an example, i saw it in 2D in the theater, and loved it.  My wife missed it then but we both watched the 3D blu-ray last night (7000-series Samsung 60\\" & Oppo), and my wife hated the movie.  I'm 99% sure it's only because of the terrible 3D effects.  I must say I pretty much hated it also, this time around.<br /><br />To put a monitary value on it, if I had the choice of ONLY buying 3D or 2D, I'd pay $8 extra to buy the 2D.<br /><br />I'm being generous with the 2-stars just to call attention to the problem - but I don't want to \\"sink\\" the ratings for a great movie.  Lesson Learned:  Never again will i buy a 3D movie without insuring it wasn't a post-production conversion.
B003I4LF3G|5.0|The story is great and heartfelt a remarkable acting performance for A. Hopkins and outstanding performance for John Hurt. Really worth watching...

B007SGM084|5.0|I was told by some woman that I should download the trilogy of 50 Shades of Grey.  So I did and wow I just finished it!<br />Last night I had my book club meeting and I was telling the girls that I would hold a caipirinha evening for those who read the book!  I can't say that it's a book club book, but a funny girl get together, type of book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The James trilogy is a unit; those who read only the first (Fifty Shades Grey) are often and justifiably appalled.  However, the trilogy is the story of transformation of the two main characters, and their growth and development.  Character development is prime, and most readers will applaud the growth of Ana, who was recognized in the first volume, by Christian as \\"not having a submissive bone in her body.\\"
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I loved it, expecially the ability to make a &quot;note book&quot;. It might seem slightly complicated but, after you get the hang of it its great.
0307951529|5.0|Just the kind of shot in the arm I wanted.  Very inspirational and encouraging.  So much of getting going is getting started and Chris does a great job whetting your appetite and breathing in fresh, energetic oxygen.  I really enjoyed this boost!  Easy to read, easy to pick up and resume, and fun!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|This is the best book to follow the \\"Shades of Grey\\" phenomenon that you have concluded.  Even though the storyline is ironically very similar, it is PERFECT!  I absolutely loved it!  For the Kindle price of under $4.00 you can't beat it.  I read the \\"Shades of Grey\\" trilogy in a weeks time.  I couldn't put this book down either (finishing it in 2 days).  With the promise of a second book Fall 2012 I cannot wait to continue my reading obsession.  Please don't bash this book!  If you don't like it, then don't ruin it for others that LOVE this type of story line and reading thrill and pull!<br /><br />Final note...Read it!  It'll give you something to look forward to this Fall!! It allow you to fall in love with a story that hasn't reached a conclusion yet!

They can't walk from one room to another without pounding eachother and it has gotten to be too much.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was very pleased with my Hunger games trilogy purchase.  It was very economical and was able to get it instantly.  This is very convenient for those of us living in rural areas, especially when there is a long waiting list for a book at the library and no stores to buy it, and you can't wait to know what happens!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I was very disappointed with this microphone. While I realized the cable was long, it is too long for any normal uses and ends up getting in the way. I've only had the item for a couple of months and it has begun to emit a buzzing noise while recording that ruins anything I record. I know you get what you pay for, but I would recommend buying something else similar in the same price range over this.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Book to be worthy for my life.<br /><br />This is a very significant book. Visualization and that of the wish give happiness to all people.<br />Because I am a Christian though this is a content that it is difficult for a lot of Japanese to understand, the purport of this book can be understood.<br /><br />By the way, it is achieved, too, if the wish is voiced and it prays though the method of achieving the ideal by visualization is also very good.<br />It was thought that a lot of people were means that only the effort obtains happiness.<br /><br />Now, it became a society that did not obtain happiness only by the effort.<br />A Japanese society today also has the difficult time fee though I am Japanese.<br />This book is necessary for a Japanese today.<br />And, it is necessary for the world.

1932100660|1.0|I returned this book because it was more of a extremely detailed research/data-research book.  I wanted not only this information, but more understanding about how to adapt the studies lifestyle, eating habits, and planning.  This is a great book for one who wants all the research results, data, numbers, figures, and so forth.  Not for me. I have returned it.

B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|Can't I give this monstrosity 0 stars? Where to begin: Slow, ponderous, boring and VERY anti-Semitic. Want a movie that glorifies the Nazis as \\"just plain folks\\"? This is your ticket! PC has never been as shallow, as offensive as The Debt. Helen Mirren has a bit role, just above a cameo. This isn't like Red at all!<br /><br />I was bored until I really began to hate this film. The young woman, seen doing great Krav Maga moves, is suddenly overwhelmed by an old, German doctor. Please! This was unreal.<br /><br />Skip this trash and watch Red a second time.
0385333846|3.0|It's hard to say whether I liked this book.  It was paced well, and had a lot of deep insights into the horrors of war.  On the other hand, the horrors of war are depressing, and so was this book.<br /><br />I was never sure if I liked the main character.  He was almost like two different characters.  Possibly three.  I think if I had liked the protagonist more, I would have liked the book better.<br /><br />Even though it is sci-fi, it also had a strongly literary bent.  Possibly not my style.  I'm less interested in people living in the real world, and with one small change, this story would not be sci-fi at all.  It was about real people living in real history doing real things, with some weird stuff going on in order to tell the story in a weird order.  There were no amazing new ideas about the possibilities of technology, no twists.  This book was about war, pure and simple.<br /><br />But it is a story that needs to be told, about the bombing of Dresden, about WWII, about how crappy it all is.  There were many deep political and philosophical insights, and this was done very well, thematically and symbolically, as well as through the prose.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Very good stand with a good design that looks really stylish and is functional. Assembly is straight-forward and does not require any tools. The clearance underneath my laptop is substantial and the laptop does not shake much at all on the table. The slight tilt forward of the stand is a nice touch. Looks really good with my white MacBook sitting on top.

1250000971|2.0|I have read most or all of Archer's books over the years, and for the most part have greatly enjoyed them.  The first book in this series was intriguing enough to propel me to purchase this one immediately after it was published.  The first chapter was actually pretty good;  it was downhill from there.<br /><br />The book reads like an outline of a novel.  Characters aren't fleshed out, plot lines are described rather than carefully crafted.  The whole time I was reading this I felt like it was a first draft, and a rushed one at that.<br /><br />I am not a hard marker, or a book snob.  I can read frothy fiction and get completely mesmerized by the story.  This one was barely worth it.  As I was reaching the conclusion of the book, I kept on measuring what was left and wondered when the good part would start.
B0041L0Z1S|4.0|I have been on a bit of a classics kick lately. After having just finished both seasons of Downton Abbey, I felt a bit sad that I had to wait until September for the new season. So, I began searching for something along similar lines to keep me interested and that's when I stumbled upon Emma. I was perfectly surprised, as I did not hear too many great things about the mini series. I think it was fairly genuine in comparison to the novel, and much better adapted than previous versions. I think there was much more detail that has been left out in earlier movies, such as the one with Gwyneth Paltrow, and I am very fond of details. I think the cast was well chosen too. They all fit the parts perfectly, in my opinion.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a great game with beautiful graphics and simple controls so its a game that anyone can play great time waster
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I decided this year was the year to fill my head up with positive reinforcement.  I'm on a quest to read as many books about positive thinking as I possibly can.  I have always been an upbeat and cheerful person, but not always \\"getting\\" what I feel I \\"deserve.\\"  Now I know why!!  Plus my insecurites are starting to melt away.  This book is one of the BEST reads on feeding your subconscious with positive thoughts.  One of the best stories I read in the book (paraphrased of course):  A young man comes to Socrates and asks how he can obtain wisdom.  Socrates takes the young man to a river and dunks his head in the water until the young man fights to come up for oxygen.  Why did you do that Socrates?  When you want wisdom as much as you wanted that oxygen, you'll get it.  Another jewel:  Whatever you wish for someone else, you wish for yourself.  Becareful what you wish for someone else.  So many more thoughts.  It just opens your mind to accepting life without being offended by it.  Read it!!
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I had tired of the endless parade of guest artists and wanted to hear Santana for what he is known for, playing his guitar and with that this record delivers. It has upbeat songs, and more chill melodies and each song takes you through a journey! If you've been waiting to hear Carlos on his guitar then you will be pleasantly surprised.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|I saw all of the lead-up films in the theatre, having been impressed, for the most part, with the first Iron Man, and somewhat impressed with Captain America.  While The Avengers is obviously a massive hit, I found the movie to be, in the end, a real snore, and nearly walked out of the theatre.  The first half of the movie is pretty good, with some good banter and a promising build-up, although the villain Loki quickly becomes very 1-dimensional.  Once the first major action sequence kicks in, the movie starts to feel a bit laborious, and by the time the final action sequence kicks in, it just becomes another typical barrage of inconsequential CQI that is neither fun nor exciting ... just plain boring.  I would equate the finale of this movie to the finale of The Incredible Hulk, which was another city battle between two CGI beasts, that had you checking your watch long before it ended.  Marvel readers and fans of popcorn blockbuster movies will eat it up, but I don't believe The Avengers has done much for the comic genre, other than show how much money you can make by teaming up a gang of B-level superheroes.  Building a comic universe around a blue magic cube and a 1-note baddy is not the most sophisticated approach to drawing everyone in, and for the demanding fan, it just doesn't cut it.  If Marvel is brave, they will really challenge themselves when writing the next installments, or they could just stick with their formula, and churn out more magic cubes and sneering Loki's, and rake in their billions.  While they are obviously winning in terms of the almighty dollar, they won't be getting any more of mine.

The author presents color theory in an easily understandable way then gives projects the reader can try for those of us who need to \\"do\\" instead of \\"see.\\"<br /><br />If you've drooled over polymer clay artwork with luscious color schemes and wondered how to achieve the same effects in your work, you will find this book extremely useful.

B003Y8YXGM|5.0|Choosing a John Lennon solo album can be frustrating. So many of his records were \\"arty\\" and \\"primal\\" and so many Yoko Ono crap tracks were released that it can be hit and miss or disappointing buying the John Lennon catalog, but \\"Walls and Bridges\\" (1974) is where it is at! - definitely a safe bet for Beatle & John Lennon fans. Strong songs, a great backing band, solid vocals, and no disturbing 'anti-pop art rock' on this album. 'Number Nine Dream,' 'Whatever Gets You Through the Night' and 'Steel and Glass' are the best, but there are no weak tracks here. Artwork and liner notes are good (but no bonus cuts on this one). Listen to the master do his thing without any Japanese yodeling or primal screaming therapy...

0312360266|3.0|I loved the story line in Marked by PC Cast, but listening to the Bolinda audio version was EXTREMELY annoying. The person reading the book obviously does not speak English with a United States accent, yet she tried to for this book.  Names were pronounced differently in different parts of the book. A few times I had to rewind to relisten to a word or phrase to try to figure out what the reader was saying. Stick to one accent or the other, slipping into a different accent for some words sometimes and not others is frustrating for the listener. I want to finish this series, but I will not be looking for any other Bolinda audiobooks.

0307594165|5.0|War is one of the most shocking events we can experience in our lives. For those who have fought in combat and have seen the gruesome and unexplainable attacks with their own eyes. Including others who watch television and hear about the attacks happening around the world which can bring a painful emotion in theirselves. But in Toni Morrison's latest novel, we feel more than just pains, we feel true beliefs.<br />In \\"Home\\", we follow the life of Frank Money, a veteran of the Korean War, who is back home with painful memories and an exasperated attitude. The story begins with Frank in a hospital, who doesn't fully remember why he's there, but manages to get back on his feet and to return home of Central City, Georgia. Along his way, he meets a few interesting people, and so are the memories of his past. He get re-aqquainted with his sister, Cee, who is facing many medical problems and Frank will stop at nothing to help his sister. However, Frank's memories of war still continue to haunt him, which starts to affect his behavior and who he is.<br />I'll start by saying that this is my 1st Tomi Morrison book, and after reading it, she seems like a very talented writer. She gives us a book filled with many emotions that will leave readers astounded. I think that \\"Home\\" is a perfect selection for those who have experienced war themselves and want to feel touched with their feelings. I can't wait to read some of her other books.

0312611692|5.0|Have you ever read history and thought, `well, this is all very interesting, but what does it mean?' Clearly some patterns of history are discernable:  Civilizations rise and fall, kings and states centralize their power, progress moves forward, although not always in a straight line.  Why do these things happen? Our textbooks sometimes offer explanations, but they tend to be partial answers at best. And even fewer try and answer the largest questions. If any of this has ever crossed your mind you are not alone. In recent years more scholars have taken on these questions. And in particular, they have tried to answer what William McNeil calls the \\"Rise of the West,\\" why Western Civilization advanced so rapidly after 1500. And these efforts have borne some fruit. William McNeil and David Landes (\\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\") have both pointed to importance of the colonization of the Americas by Europe in transferring the balance of power to the west. Landes has more generally emphasized the importance of geography, along with a culture's ability to harness its resources as the keys to development.  Max Weber (\\"The Protestant Work Ethic\\") and Charles Murray (\\"Human Achievement\\") have pointed to unique cultural features found only Western Europe. Jared Diamond (Guns, Germs, and Steel\\") has explained the origins of civilization in Eurasia and their subsequent domination of the globe as a result of \\"biogeography,\\" the presence of the largest number of species of cultivable grains and domesticable animals in the Fertile Crescent, along with an east-west axis along the Eurasian landmass that enabled their transfer laterally.<br /><br />Yet for all these advances, there has not been a volume that follows the pre-history of mankind through today, focusing on the relative advancement of each region. It is this void that classical historian Ian Morris sets out to fill.  And Morris' answer can be summed up in a single word: Geography. It is geography, Morris claims that allowed the first civilizations to develop where they did in the so-called \\"lucky latitudes\\", the temperate zones with an abundance of domesticable animals and plants. It is geography that dictated which regions dominated others in the ancient world, based on their ability to harness resources on a larger scale than their predecessors (the \\"advantages of backwardness\\"). It is geography that allowed empires to grow and reach new heights peaking in Europe at the 1st Century AD s the Roman Empire shipped goods around the Mediterranean, while the Chinese reached their peak in the 11th century after the contruction of the Grand Canal made shipping there easier. The declines of civilizations were also due to geographic factors, as the \\"five horsemen of the apocalypse\\" famine, disease, migration, state failure, and climate change overcame the best efforts of man. Indeed, even the Industrial Revolution, which led the West dominate the globe was due to geography, according to Morris. As Europeans sailed across the Atlantic, practical questions arose in sailing, navigating, and keeping time. In answering these questions, Westerners discovered a mechanical model of the universe, which led directly to the Scientific Revolution, and in turn, to the Industrial Revolution. Later, the abundance of coal in Britain sparked industry there. There was no major shift in culture in Europe during this time, nor were Europeans any smarter than their Chinese counterparts. \\"Every society gets the answers it needs,\\" Morris asserts. Other societies didn't have a need to answer these questions, therefore they didn't. Distance dissuaded the Chinese from sailing to America and hence trying to figure out how and why things work. Western rule therefore was neither a long-term lock-in nor a short-term accident, but a long-term probability.<br /><br />As for the role of culture, men, and ideas, Morris claims that these matter, but not nearly as much as material factors. For example, he writes that onceindustry became possible for the East, it was only a matter of time before they set out down that road. But Japan's road started in the 1860's, while China's was much later. Non-geographic factors account for this difference, Morris claims. Japan adjusted quicker to the new realities. Therefore other factors matter, but not nearly as much as cold, hard, material realities. Culture and free will cannot trump geography, they only change responses to geography: You cannot domesticate grains where there are not grains, you cannot domesticate animals where there are none to be domesticated, and you cannot mine for coal where there is no coal.<br /><br />If all this sounds a bit too tidy and reductionist, it may well be. But the measuring stick for any work is not whether or not the author has ended the debate, but whether he has moved it forward. And in this regard, Morris clearly has succeeded. By explicitly stating how the interplay between geography and social development shaped societies responses, he has pushed the debate to new understandings. He has also taken a massive amount of data ranging from anthropology, archaeology, history, sociology, biology, and climatology, and compiled it into one clear narrative that covers all of human history, something that has been lacking until now. His self-created \\"Social Development Index\\" provides a metric to track human development, although this will no doubt be controversial. But most of all, he has laid out a very clear case that material realities create certain unalterable conditions. Geography, as Jared Diamond pointed out in \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", is not fair. And like that previous work which Morris so clearly admires, \\"Why the West Rules\\" explains what those inequalities are, and how they shaped the very broadest patterns of history. Alas, Morris nearly undoes all his fine work in the conclusion. First, he argues that if 20th century trends continue, the East will overtake the West in 2103. It seems that Morris fell in love with his own metrics a bit too much here. Why should we assume that 20th century trends will continue? Are we to expect that Chinese economic growth will continue at 8 percent for the next century? Even worse, he postulates science-fiction scenarios for the future of mankind in which we either suffer total annihilation due to global warming and/or nuclear war on hand or merge with computers to for \\"a Singularity\\", new, more powerful species. Morris should have stuck with guns, stating that social development may be nearing its limit unless mankind can find greener forms of energy and manage to avoid nuclear Armageddon. This would have been in keeping with the previous chapters as well as in line with what we already know about our current situation. Still, this book is intriguing and makes for a fine read. Highly recommended.industry became possible for the East, it was only a matter of time before they set out down that road. But Japan's road started in the 1860's, while China's was much later.

1609613937|5.0|In T. Colin Campbell's Nationally Bestselling book, \\"The China Study\\"-- what the New York Times has called the \\"Grand Prix\\" of epidemiology Campbell has this to say about Dr. McDougall. \\"Dr. John McDougall's nutrition and health knowledge is phenomenal, greater than any other doctor I've met and greater than any of my nutrition colleagues in academia.\\" Where nutrition is concerned, Dr. McDougall is the man. Epidemiology is the study of health in well-defined populations.<br /><br />This, Dr. McDougall's latest book, \\"The Starch Solution\\" is not just another fad diet book. Other than a few tweaks here and there over the years this is basically the same diet he has been advocating for over 40 years. A whole plant food diet that centers around the starches. Fruits and vegetables are also part of the McDougall Diet but starch is the main course. Starches are the energy foods of the plant world-- rice, potatoes, corn, beets, squash, beans, carrots, tomatoes, pasta,... There are three basic types of carbohydrates--sugar, cellulose, and starch. For a sudden burst of energy nothing beats simple sugar. Cellulose is also a form of sugar, glucose, that is bonded to indigestible parts of plants. Cellulose doesn't provide much energy but does provide fiber.<br /><br />According to Dr. McDougall the Gold Medal for the most beneficial carbohydrate for humans goes to starch. Starch--complex carbohydrates, is valuable to us because we can break them down into simple sugars that provide sustained energy and keep us feeling full and satisfied. Unlike most other diets there is no need to go hungry on the McDougall Diet. It is not how much we eat so much as it is what we eat. Starches are filling without being fattening. The starch based diet is imminently practical. Most diets are not practical for they are starvation diets that at some point most of us will give up on and go on a binge, the unhealthy cycle of yo-yo dieting. A starch centered diet is the best way to get off the rollercoaster ride of the typical overfed but undernourished Western Diet. We are biologically \\"Starchivores\\". We have a plant eaters Teeth. Tongue. Throat. Stomach. Intestines. Liver. Kidneys. Around the globe healthy populations, past and present, get most of their calories from starch. For such groups of people the chronic diseases that are the product of the typical Western Diet that is high in meats, fats, and processed foods, are in most cases all but unknown. Type II Diabetes is by definition a disease caused by one's diet. A proper diet cures Type II Diabetes. For many if not most of us the \\"Starch Solution\\" is the cure for nearly everything that ails us. There are exceptions to every rule but this rule. In my opinion any of the Whole Food diets are far superior to the typical Western Diet. To each his or her own.<br /><br />\\"Let thy food be thy medicine.\\" Hippocrates.

B001BQDP90|5.0|I'm a big Stanley Kubrick fan, and Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films.<br />I had always wanted to own a copy, and figured if I was going to buy it, might as well try and find the unmodified, \\"European\\" version.<br />This is definitely the version you want to get if you're looking for the original EWS DVD not containing CGI images during the Mansion scenes.<br /><br />There are two discs: The 1st disc is the film in its entirety; the 2nd disc contains Special Features such as interviews with Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise, and Steven Spielberg regarding this movie and Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Kubrick, this is a great DVD to have in your collection, also, I hope I'm not the only one who prefers the Mask cover on this DVD over the original one with the main actors! It is creepy in a way, and really catches your eye.<br /><br />This is truly a mesmerizing film to watch... one I am happy to have on hand to view for many years to come! Thanks, Amazon!
0345803485|3.0|I must say that I was extremely annoyed by all the blushing,flushing, and holy craps! If you are expecting a well written book forget about it.  My issue is that I hate to start a book and not finish which is why I'm now on the third novel. In a make believe world in the mind of a teenager this book is a good book.  It seems to have grown on me and I find myself wanting to know what's going to happen next.  I have never read a book with BDSM so I found the sex sceens kinda hot.  Ana is a simpy character with no self esteem that can come if you look at her!(not realistic at all)Christian is more complex or bipolar should I say.... but I have grown to like him even though he is a super hott young sex machine billionaire in his twenties(roll eyes).  So I will finish the series and so glad that I didnt have to buy it to read it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Grabs you and keeps you the entire time. Loved it! Just what I needed at the time , a read that takes me away and keeps me hooked and entertained and thinking and guessing and then wanting more of these characters when it ended.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|First of all, let me tell you, I listen to all genres of music, but my favorite is hard rock/metal, but being a Gemini and eclectic, I get bored with the same type of music. My favorite band is Depeche Mode and anything the late Ronnie James Dio did.<br />As for Adam, this album does Rock, even though that's not the genre it's listed under, although a couple of songs have rock elements in them.<br />I've loved him since he was on Idol and he has an amazing voice, but at times when he was on the show he would sometimes oversing a song, but on his new album, he gives you just enough of his stellar vocal range and doesnt overdue it.<br /><br />The first half is so club ready and makes you want to get up and dance and it's great to work out to!<br />I've played to it over and over, atleast 50 times and can't stop listening. It's just that great and makes you happy if your are down!!<br /><br />My favorite dance tracks are: Cuckoo, Shady, Pop That Lock, Tresspassing and Never Close Your Eyes.<br /><br />My Favorite ballads/slower tracks are: Underneath (gave me chills), Outlaws Of Love, Better Than I Know Myself and Broken English.<br /><br />Least favorites: Naked Love (a little cheesy) and Kickin' In (too repetative), but still like them.<br /><br />His 1st studio album is good, but that album was definately rushed.<br />All in all, on this newest release, Adam really took his time co-writing most of the tracks and working with the best songwriters and producers. The vocals are truly unbelievable and all the songs are well written and very personable!<br /><br />I can go on and on....The deluxe version is a must with the 3 exra songs that are just brilliant and a nice addition to an already almost perfect cd, specially if you are a Glambert fan!!!<br /><br />~BUY IT NOW!!!!! You won't be disapointed: 5/5 stars~
B003Y74KC0|5.0|I just received my two Amazon Basics cases (pink and white) today for my iPhone 4 and I love them so much I had to write this review. First, the colors are exactly as they are in the pictures. The white is the same white as my iPhone, which is great, and the pink is a cute \\"easter egg\\" pink. Second, they fit perfectly on my iPhone 4 with no unnecessary gapping around the edges. Third, there are holes cut out perfectly to allow full access to all buttons and openings on the phone. The cutout around the camera/flash on the front and back cause absolutely no interference to pictures.The case is not thick but not too thin, and adds no extra bulk to the phone. The cutout to show the Apple logo allows the logo to be perfectly centered in the cutout instead of off to the side, like on some cheap cases. I ordered these cases along with two other items and received them all in just two days. I am ecstatic that I bought these and I recommend this product to anyone with an iPhone 4!

B000GOVK8Q|2.0|Slow moving.  I think I remember some interesting points made about the movie, but why the slow, boring start?  Perhaps it gets better.  Right now, I'd like to enjoy my evening with a good film.<br /><br />===<br />Next day:<br />Okay, I finished it tonight.  Another boring scene with the wife and then it picked up.  Although still slow, at least things happened.  It's about a black magic cult with which the couple separately rubbed shoulders. All that you can take from it is the existence, power and evil of such practitioners, and know why teachers warn to avoid them.  That's it.<br /><br />I raise my rating to a two.  It could have been made exciting and enjoyable.  It definitely has a French flair, if you know what I mean.

0439023521|4.0|Hunger Games was fun, pretty suspenseful, but better suited to younger readers, say 5th grade to 20 somethings without sophisticated tastes.  Since I didn't see the movie I don't quite understand how it devolved from the book, most of whicih comes from Katniss' thoughts.  Still a good read, but not enough to entice me to the rest of the trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the plot and the characters - each character was so different but each was important to the story. My daughter had read the books, and I wanted to read them before seeing the movie with her -- I was impressed.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Very well executed. Watched the entire season back-to-back.  Haven't been this excited about a television series since 24.  HBO has hit a home run yet again.
0439023521|1.0|This series is *trying* to be in the same vein as 1984, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, Battle Royale, and Jennifer Goverment. However, it flops as far as execution. It is obvious that the goal of Hunger games, like the previously mentioned books, is attempting to create a dystopian world that is based off of a flaw of currently existing government, and set to highlight this flaw.<br /><br />There is a major defect though in the way the book pursues this....<br /><br />It never shows any flaw with the original system.<br /><br />With 1984, the problem is \\"A government that views it as okay to monitor it's citizens' loyalty above all else.\\"<br /><br />With Brave New world, the problem is \\"Government feels its okay to make decisions for you for your own good.\\"<br /><br />With Lord of the Flies, the problem is \\"We can't trust that *everyone* will have basic human goodness.\\"<br /><br />With Battle Royale, the problem is, \\"Blind loyalty to government leads to a government that doesn't feel responsible.\\"<br /><br />With Jennifer Government, the problem is, \\"Reducing regulation on corporations and government size eventually results in corporations ruling as if they were the government.\\"<br /><br />With Hunger games it's vauge and hazy at best, the best summary being that \\"Having a centralized government is bad except when you have tiered centralized governments, in which case only the top one is bad, and if you get rid of the top one somehow the 'more local' centralized government will somehow be okay and somehow always has been and will be free of corruption, even if it is a centralized government in and of itself\\" ... yea. Kinda screwed up. Basically, the author is trying to make a huge story-line based case in this book about how \\"Federal government is evil* (insert spooky 'oooooo\\" here) but somehow regional governments are completely fine and good, without ever addressing the fact that they're effectively the same thing with just a difference of scale, and withoutreally pointing out any differences between the two.<br /><br />There's no valuable message here. Not vital lesson for making our world a better place, no things you have to really watch out for, no useful cautionary tale...<br /><br />It's just ... \\"ooooo, federal government is scary.... ooooo.... feel scared!\\".<br />Frankly, after encountering this piece of tripe, I'm more worried about this book and the fear-mongering it will cause than the federal government.<br /><br />Also, one thing that REALLY, REALLY, irked me about this book... especially since its supposed to be based on our world.... corporations and big business just somehow magically disappeared. We have these huge bloated behemoth of organizations in our world before the events of the book, and in Hunger games.. they just... aren't.<br /><br />There's no mention anywhere. No mention what happened to the corporations, no mention of who the big players sided with in the war (capitol or regions). There's not a single mention of who bribed who, where those corporations that exist outside of North America are doing today (or really, most other governments at all for the most part)... it's as if somehow some of the biggest players in socio-economics... in a story about socio-economics... just somehow... aren't. In a story and setting to where the positives and negatives of such organizations SHOULD have made a HUGE impact on the development of the story, and had an impact on the world getting to its present state..... nothing. Not even a whisper. Not even a nod of the head saying \\"yea, they're still doing their thing\\" or \\"government declared immenient domain on them\\"... not.. just... poof... gone. Never happened.  Even Battle Royale, which in almost identical to this book in many regards (except that it was written in Japan about China, Battle Royale came first, at least makes mention of this stuff, saying that the government closed its borders to all such things. Here.... it tries to pretend that such things never existed and somehow don't apply to the situation at hand.<br /><br />These aspects change what was obviously meant to be a dystopian cautionary tale into just a piece of smelly steaming propaganda. And like all other piles of steaming s***, deserves to be scooped up and flushed down the toilet.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps on my Kindle Fire, one that I use almost every day. The word of the day is not usually a hard one, but the definitions can bring out nuances of the meaning that I was unaware of. Better than that, this free app gives short historical fact articles about events that happened on the date or that involved people connected with the date and you can click on those articles to get more info. A very handy app for adding to your overall knowledge. Stretch your mental muscles daily and you are less likely to have mental problems later. So, this app could really help you. Highly recommended.
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|Following his exceptional work on House of the Devil, director Ti West does another old fashioned horror suspense film. This one is even a notch above House of the Devil, which looked and felt like a late 70's/early 80's horror. Solid suspense, fun characters and a creepy haunted house adds up to a fun movie that avoids the pitfalls of much of modern horror's in your face cheap scares. A little atmosphere goes a long way and The Innkeepers has it in spades. The special features are light - besides a couple commentary tracks and trailer, there's an interesting 7 minute featurette on the making of, where you learn The Yankee Peddler inn in the movie is a real place where they shot 100% of the movie. And it's reportedly truly haunted.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only thing that is missing is the money count, but everything works perfect. I have played a lot of solitaire games and this is the best
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent all the way through. Looking forward to the rest of his books. The images are so real that one becomes apart of the story.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is a book with a plot that reminded me about a Schwarzenegger's film The Running Man. Later I heard about the film so I decided to buy the book. It is very entertaining, but do not expect the book of your life. Also for me, that I like to read in English to improve my level, is a book easy to read. I also recommend to see the film after reading the book, they are complementarys. Now I am reading the last book of the trilogy, so I can say it is addicitve, you want to know what is going to happen.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|This cd is amazing...Love all the songs...what a great feel good first side...makes you just want to get up and dance your behind off...Second side...just as amazing...but a trip through an emotional roller coaster...The song Underneath is a masterpiece of lyrics, emotion, vocally incredible..the song Outlaws of Love...a statement by Adam on how the LBGT community feels when they are denied the basic right of happiness and commitment with the one they love, how it feels to be judged...Nirvana....wonderful song...feel good song about what it would be like if everything was perfect...Thank you Adam for taking your time...and producing something so wonderful.  Hopefully you will be recognized by the music industry for such.  By this one people...worth every penny.

0307951529|5.0|I rarely write Amazon review but here goes.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Chris' blog for a long time and wanted to buy the book to show support. To be honest, I didn't actually think anything would be that relevant to me. The \\"$100 startup\\" title sounded too improbable. But I get it, it's a catchy title.<br /><br />This book is like the new [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek]]. Actually, that's almost a disservice. 4WW had some interesting ideas but it didn't gel with me. The $100 Startup makes sense. I've always wanted to be a solopreneur but had no idea how. I'm not too excited about virtual assistants and all that. I just want to create something of value and live on my terms. I feel that this book gives you the road map.<br /><br />I wish they taught us this kind of stuff when I was in college.<br /><br />Roy<br />stickmenandunicorns.com<br />roymarvelous.com<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EISSEQ

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this games is just like the old fashion Mario and since I cant get Mario on my kindle fire I just downloaded this and its just like playing Mario I love it
B005K17RU0|4.0|one of the best apps<br />i love it!<br />you have to try it &hellip;i would definitely recommend it to my friends.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|What more is there to say? OK. This Blu-Ray is awesome!! I will watch it over and over. The quality is superb. The best video release I have ever seen. I still have yet to hear this with a proper surround sound system, but at home with Mackie's it is great. The bonus material is very cool. On my PC, the machine keeps freezing the picture and it really pisses me off. (windoze crud) But that is not a fault of the disc. I watch it on my friends Play Station and there is no freeze-up at all. So, if you are looking for top notch Sabbath concert video, do not hesitate to get this one. I am so glad I did. I can see clear close-ups of Toni's guitar and wah pedal.. and the drum kit is enormous. I've never seen anything like that one. And of course Ronnie's singing is right on.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|well I just cant stop playing it,  is just so additive its just like Mario but a leprican but I just love this game so much if you are the kind of person that has to beat a game to feel happy you'll like it.

0345803485|1.0|If you enjoy the degradation of women (not to mention a virginal college graduate)as the basic plot in a story, this book is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money.  Highly disappointing and cheap, with an extremely sophomoric writing style. Ugh, I'd like my money back.

0345803485|1.0|Ok so I'm almost done with this \\"book\\" The writing IS terrible. I just had to buy it because so many people either hate it or love it. I am going to tell you the truth. Save your money! If married woman all over america are dying to get this book to spice up their own sex lives.. WOW talk about vanilla sex! I have NOT read in the book anything that suggests real S&M... Its sooo bland, boring even! Like sex on an office desk? Really? yawn... Yes you read about either eye rolls, how high school.. or how grey his eyes are.. whatever.. There really aren't that many good words used.. I don't recall reading the word wet. Hmm.. you would think that simple word would be used a few times.. over her CONSTANT BLUSHING! ugh If anything if you are in your 20's maybe this might be fun. Not really.. But if you are in your 30s and THIS is hot sex? My goodness you haven't lived! I'm dying to see how this ends.. maybe there is a HUGE scene of terrible acts! Or hmmm maybe not. maybe it's her blushing and not wanting to accept fancy gifts from a really rich guy. I actually skipped pages! It was so dull.. I can see how she would be into this guy.. but he isnt even THAT bad. It's vanilla s&m at that! I really don't know what all the fuss is about.. banning it ect. Making a bad book even more popular! This shouldn't be a movie! It needs a complete rewrite! I'll do it!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|THEODORE BOONE: THE ACCUSED is the third book in this series. The others are [[ASIN:B005USZML4 Theodore Boone: The Abduction]] and [[ASIN:B005USZYDU Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer]].<br /><br />Thirteen year old Theodore is the brilliant son of two lawyers and todays Nancy Drew. Although it's a juvenile suspense mystery, even us grown ups enjoy this talented young boy. Pete Duffy is charged with murdering his wife. The first round in court ended in a mistrial. Now he's back in court again; same charges, sames lawyers, but a new witness. The town has already convicted Duffy but young Boone isn't so sure.<br /><br />Theodore's class was allowed to watch the first trial, but the school principal won't permit the class to watch the second one. However, the principal did permit one student to attend the hearing and Boone gets the nod.<br /><br />This is a good story with likable characters and fast paced. I read it in a couple of hours. Highly recommended if you enjoy a good suspense mystery.
B004M8CMVQ|5.0|I recommend this show to any SiFi or Myth fan.  This is a wonderful movie, it does the book proud. Having read the book several times i was hesitant to watch the movie but was surprised at how close they got it.  I was riveted throughout the show, to the point that i was surprised that it was over already.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|I really love this music! I'm all into the retro 60's soul/R&B sound. I grew up with that music and love it. This is a great debut by a powerful and rare singer. As soon as I started listening to it I immediately thought of the great Janis Joplin; like other reviewers have mentioned. However I have to say that there is a difference between analog no-frills production and poor production. Unfortunately I think this debut leans more towards poor production. Brittany's voice just doesn't sound right. The overall production is not the best sound. There is also something that seems restrained, confined, held-back in this production compared to their live performances on YouTube. All in all though I have to still say that this is a great debut of a wonderful new singer with tribute to the great music of the past. I look forward to incredible things from them in the future.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Works quite well and better then the W.Channel app. Simple accurate enough for my needs . Worth the price to eliminate the ads .
B007M45PMU|5.0|I really love this debut. What a great and unique sound! I love the acoustic folk pop styling and lyrical colorful songs. This is really an upbeat, hand clapping, foot stomping collection. I disagree with the professional critics. I enjoyed this much more than say Of Monsters and Men or The Head and The Heart; just for example. Get this and check it out! I think you will be surprised and really enjoy it. I have listened to it over and over.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this move. Plenty of action and attractive characters.  Not a deep thinker, but it's not trying to be. It's just good light entertainment.  Can't wait for #2.
0439023513|1.0|Very, very disappointing.  Not sure if the author went off the deep end toward the middle of this book or what. Story begins to lose focus and ramble in the middle of the book.  After that she just can't get back on track and then seems to not know what to write?  Several parts don't make any sense to the story line.  Seems to be finished by someone else that did not understand the story.  Please pull these off the shelves, burn them and start over !

B001AGXEA6|4.0|\\"Beetlejuice\\" announced the arrival for a lot of people of Tim Burton. He had already done the exceptionally funny [[ASIN:B005DZ35TU Pee-wee's Big Adventure [Blu-ray]]] which promised some great things from this former animator. Although his career has had its ups launching pop culture franchises([[ASIN:B001W6S0C6 Batman (20th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book Packaging)]]--which took the gamble and won of casting Michael Keaton a quirky vision of The Dark Knight) and his downs [[ASIN:B000K7VHHS Planet of the Apes [Blu-ray]]]--where he missed the entire point of what was so appealing in the original and in the material itself)but through it all he has remained an interesting director (even if he continues to have problems with the third acts of his films).<br /><br />This \\"deluxe\\" 2008 reissue of the title on Blu-ray looks decent on Blu-ray although skin textures are a bit over smooth for my taste and detail not quite as sharp as I'd hoped. The colors DO pop and while depth a hallmark of an exceptional transfer is better than the DVD it's not all it could be. While this film is nearly 25 years old, there are OLDER films that Warner has done transfers for that look better in the departments of textures and depth. The audio sounds quite nice with an immersive 5.1 mix for the film.<br /><br />The problem isn't with the film itself but in calling this a \\"special edition\\" at all--while we do get three episodes of the cartoon spin off as part of the extras along with an isolated music track, we don't get a commentary track nor a retrospective documentary on the making of this film which was important to the careeres of the three main actors--Keaton (it made him a star), Alec Baldwin (ditto) and Gena Davis (it helped her career quite a bit)as well as launching Burton into his own Steven Spielberg quirky orbit as someone who could get a film green lit just by his name attached to the project alone.<br /><br />The image quality for the cartoons is so-so; it's clear that the show was assembled on video and it has all the flaws for a video to DVD transfer. The shows are presented in standard definition which makes sense given the format they came from and all.<br /><br />So for those fans who just want a nice looking, inexpensive version of the film in high def this edition of \\"Bettlejuice\\" will fit the bill. For those (like myself) who like the bells and whistles that SHOULD be part of a special edition this is a bit disappointing given the popularity of the film. This edition reminds me of what happened when DVD was first introduced--we got the films with little in the way of special features and while, ultimately, the film is the most important element here for those who have seen it before, the special features would have refreshed the experience and made it somewhat new again.<br /><br />I'd recommend this edition although I'm a bit disappointed more care wasn't taken in preparing the 20th Anniversary release of the film. Hopefully Warner will it get it perfect one of these days.<br /><br />Five stars for the film, Four (as I can't know what the interpositive or negative looks like in terms of detail--some of the issues I mentioned COULD be due to the type of film stock used-- and my memory in seeing it in theaters is just that--an inaccurate memory) for the transfer and two stars for the special features.how was assembled on video and it has all the flaws for a video to DVD transfer.

1401235417|5.0|Out of all of DC's New 52 titles, I believe this one is easily the best. It is the perfect marriage of story and art that dispels the myth that superhero comics are just for kids. It's also easily accessible for new and old Bat-fans alike. Let's start with the story by Scott Snyder. Snyder had already made a name for himself in the Bat-universe with the now classic \\"Black Mirror\\" storyline, which saw Dick Grayson as Batman. Here, we see Bruce Wayne return to Gotham as Batman with a new sense of purpose (Grayson is once again Nightwing). As Bruce Wayne, he wants to restore Gotham to it's previous glory, and he wins the support of mayoral candidate Lincoln March. However, a new enemy with ties to Gotham's past comes out of the shadows to strike back at Batman and the notion that he owns the city. This new enemy is The Court of Owls. Owls are a natural predator of Bats, and it doesn't take long for them to hunt the Dark Knight and shatter his confidence by turning his own city against him. I was highly impressed with Snyder for creating a whole new threat for the caped crusader, and by not relying on the classic rogues gallery (although they all do make an appearance early on in the story). Once considered an urban legend, the Court has been a part of Gotham for centuries, along with their assassins called The Talon. There is a shocking revelation involving Nightwing in this story that sheds a new light on what he could have become if not for Bruce. Now, for the artwork. Greg Capullo blew me away on this story. After being the artist on Spawn for many years, he was a natural fit to draw Batman. Seriously, he does an amazing job here, especially in issue 5 when we follow Batman's descent into madness while being trapped in an underground labyrinth. You will literally have to flip the book upside down to follow the story, and while it sounds gimmicky, it was totally cool and impressive. My only gripe with this book is that it doesn't have a real resolution. That's because it's only the first half of the story, which will be continued in Volume 2: Night of the Owls. Don't let that deter you from picking this one up. I can't recommend it enough!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This isn't a mindless entertainment movie. There is struggle, emotions, and character development. A lot of people didn't get the ending. But those that actually use their own mind to comprehend the meaning will understand it and appreciate it.<br /><br />If you're expecting a mindless movie with men fist fighting animals for 2 hours, look elsewhere. But those that want a strong film that will make you think, this is a perfect movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this because once you download the app you can play it without internet so I can play it any time. It is great to have while waiting for my kids to come out of the school or anytime I have to wait. Its also a way to keep my sanity when my son has to sit more than two minutes. The mini games vary in difficulty so my kids and I pass it around so one of us can beet the game! Lots of fun and very addictive.

B007XWFZSA|5.0|This is by far one of the best case interview prep materials you will find out there. This book can convenienly replace Case In Point.

Nile Rogers' production style is all over it, which is a minus.<br />He was a pretty hot producer at the time. Just think of it as a brief departure and enjoy it<br />for what it is/was. It's got some excellent guitar work and should be in any Beck fans<br />collection. BBA was worse in my opinion.

I've picked-up all their recordings now and while I can hear a difference between the old IB and the new this album most definitely lives up to the spirit of their former days and lays foundation for renewed life and hopefully many more \\"albums\\" to come in the future.<br /><br />Highly recommended, on my third listen as I write this and it's just gettin' better!
0470503696|5.0|I purchased several of books from John Walenback, one of which was Excel VBA Programming for Dummies.  This book was very well written and provided the core basics of which allowed my further interests into his other books.  I have set a goal to learn VBA with Excel, I have advanced onto the Excel 2010 Power Programming with VBA of which I feel is also well written.  I have not yet completed reading through the last book but it has already provided me with some great tools and knowledge to begin the trek that I have set out for myself.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to the last 2 to come. I'm not sure why people were shocked to find out that this story didn't end with this book. If you look at GRRM's website it shows that 2 more books are slotted for this series before it ends.<br /><br />It is a little hard to wait for the next book since I don't know how long till the next one, but I still really enjoyed how the characters have developed and to which side people are on or how this will end up. There are characters that I hated, but now find i am rooting for and hopefully I'm not wrong in rooting for them.<br /><br />If you are a true fan than the length or time that it takes to read this book won't bother you. I'm a recent fan who read the previous books in about 2 months since I read them at every opportunity from the want of finding out what happens next. If you are a die hard fan of GRRM, which it seems like I now am, you will enjoy this book just as much as the last ones.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book! It is a must read series. Couldn't put it down. It keeps you imagination going! Women (and men) should read this. It has definite benefits to your relationship with your spouse.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really cant understand how it got to the top 100 in the first place. The writing is awful and the characters are more than a bit tragic. I regret reading but am glad I didn't spend money on it. :)
B0028MBKVG|5.0|As a runner for more than 30 years, I was awed by this book.  Friends and I used to joke that the ultimate running book should be called \\"Left, Right\\" since that is about all one needs to know to participate in the sport.  This is a truly amazing story and the author's ability to weave a series of stories together demonstrates real talent on his part.  I became interested in each of the people discussed in the book and have found myself doing web searches to learn more about them since discovering them.  Even those who have never run a step will find this a great book; for those of us who do run, it makes getting out the door and stretching out our runs much more appealing.  One trait that I really admired was the author's ability to point out the quirkiness of some of the people involved without making them look foolish or deranged and instead made them people we would want to meet and know.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was the \\"Sex and The City\\" DVD. I always thought of the title as associated with a TV show and I had no idea there was a movie of the same name. Well, it figures. I might add that I usually wouldn't buy a movie patterned after a TV series so I had a bit of a negative attitude to overcome as I viewed it. The movie was quite good and I found it to be surprisingly sad. You'd never guess from the title and the photo on the DVD cover. Well, maybe it's a personal thing. I went through over five decades of my life as a bachelor and then married at the age of 72. We had a wonderful little son, but my wife left me for another man after a total togetherness of about seven years and I'm still not over it. \\"Sex and The City\\" dwells on the single life and relationship problems, with an emphasis on the latter, and it cuts close to the bone.<br /><br />Well, a lot of people would view the single life as party, party, party, but that's because they have no real understanding of the single life. That's the single life as depicted by Hollywood and boasted of by a lot of single people who are looking for some type of cover. My single life was occupied by wondering when, if ever, I was going to meet that special person and what might happen afterwards if I ever did. That aspect of the single life is rather sensitively covered in this movie, as are the innumerable problems that can arise when two people meld into one more-complicated life for both. The story concerned four couples, but the main emphasis was on two people, a couple who had lived together for 10 happy years and then decided to get married. The marriage approached and the arrangements got ever more complicated and the guest list topped 200 people. Believe me, you can feel the anxiety build in both of the people. Finally, when the big day arrived, the groom got to the wedding, but couldn't go through with it. The rest of the movie concerned itself with picking through the wreckage and dealing with the problems of the other couples. It's complicated and rather well done. After about the first quarter of the movie, I thought it was going to turn out a dozer, but it actually turned out to be a very good movie, albeit a somewhat painful one,<br /><br />Gary Petersonwith the problems of the other couples.

B007ZT2Q88|4.0|Charles Miller's review (above) pretty much sums up my feelings about this release. Sure fans will always clamor for another raucous and wild release so long as they (and Iggy) have a pulse. But Iggy as always swung both ways. While his Stooges raw power side still rears its head (almost every other album) on discs like Instinct, American Caesar, Beat Em Up and Skull Ring, his softer side recorded some of his best work: Brick by Brick, Avenue B and Pr&eacute;liminaires.<br /><br />Don't like it? Iggy penned the perfect response to critics with the closing track of Brick by Brick and the opening track of Avenue B.<br /><br />If you have yet to discover this side of Iggy, I suggest starting with Brick by Brick (a loud and proud pop and rock record, providing 20 years of anthemic inspiration that has kept me moving forward whenever the times get tough). Avenue B is a confessional record about screwing everything up, fearing death, facing divorce and dealing with loss and regret - surprisingly it remains a joy to listen to all these years later. Pr&eacute;liminaires is the most ambitious of the three - a dark, adventurous and engaging work that inspires Tarantino and David Lynch images in the mind's eye.<br /><br />Apres is much lighter and straightforward, it is as much of a kindred spirit to Danger Mouse's Serge Gainsbourg-esque Rome project with Jack White, Norah Jones and Danielle Luppi as it is a companion to Pr&eacute;liminaires. This album finally delivers upon the promise of Iggy's classic duet with Deborah Harry (Cole Porter's Did You Evah). Imagine Iggy hosting a holiday TV special and crooning through the classics by a roaring fire (perhaps Bowie will show up for a duet?). Some tracks work better than others, but all are charming. It is easy, breezy, beautiful evening and dinner party music.<br /><br />Bravo to Iggy for recording music that moves him and releasing it himself. Whether he screams or hums his way through his next release, I will be at his side, singing along.

B007MJ9LA2|3.0|'Spanning from the late 1990's to the present and stashed away for such an instrumental project' it says. You may think it best if some of these had remained stashed away. Personally I think this is a major disappointment and a few of these tunes would just about be suitable for background music at<br />a dinner party. I wanted this album to be wonderful, a chance at last for long-time fans to get the soaring, lyrical Carlos not the one involved in awful collaborations in recent years with a bunch of miscellaneous vocalists. Gave him a new lease of life and opened his music up to a whole new audience?<br />That's great, but don't even mention 'Guitar Heaven'. Having seen a few of his live performances online it seems that he can still deliver the goods but there's little of it here, maybe because there's no cohesion, tracks having been selected from a 15-year span. In fact on several tracks there's not even much of him! There's nothing here that comes close for example to the magnificence of the title track of 1987's 'Blues for Salvador'.<br />And so to the album which starts off with the classic sound of Carlos in the groove on the title track. Extremely promising, looks like we're in for a 'treat'.<br />Plenty of room to stretch out on the gentle 'Dom' and the band in full swing on 'Nomad'. 'Metatron' is an awful anthemic thing that is now ruined for me as I can picture Spinal Tap on stage playing! There follow three 'early evening' MOR-ish ballads, but at least Carlos puts in some fine work on the superior 'Never the Same Again'. If you can sit through three minutes of easy listening on 'In the Light of a New Day' he breaks out then disappears back into the piano/synth mundanity which dominates the latter part of this album. 'Macumba in Budapest' is a fine example - Carlos must have been away so they decided to do it pretty much without him! He picks his way through the six dreary minutes of 'Mr Szabo' - it meanders along going nowhere - you've had your main course and are probably looking forward to dessert. A totally unexciting singalong 'Eres La Luz' follows but at least Carlos gets a little bit of trademark guitar in. 'Canela' cruises along gently, Carlos raising the tempo halfway and at the end to put in some exciting work. More synth and piano follow and it's home time with the totally bland 'Ah Sweet Dancer'. Probably expected too much after all this time guys, I'm off to listen to Derek Trucks.

B0018O6S6M|5.0|n 10,000 BC, a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Yagahl live in a remote mountain range in the Urals and survive by killing woolly mammoths. D'Leh, a young hunter, has a companion named Evolet, an orphan who was found by the tribe. D'Leh, while hunting mammoths, manages to kill one and wins the \\"White Spear\\". He also wins Evolet in marriage, but feels he deserves neither since he killed the mammoth by accident.<br /><br />One day, D'Leh and several others are away when horse-raiders called the \\"Four Legged Demons\\" attack the Yaghal camp. The horse raiders enslave Evolet; D'Leh, Tic'Tic, KaRen, and Baku pursue them to save her. They enter a rainforest where they are attacked by a large pack of terror birds. In this encounter, Tic'Tic gets wounded and Baku and Ka'Ren are captured. D'Leh rescues Evolet, but she is later re-captured. Continuing on, they meet others whose loved ones were taken by the raiders. D'Leh and Tic'Tic befriend Nakudu, leader of the Naku tribe. He tells D'Leh of a prophecy: whoever talks to a Smilodon that they call the \\"Spear-Tooth\\" will help free their people. D'Leh had earlier saved the Spear-Tooth from drowning in a trap and it had spared his life. D'Leh realizes the prophecy was about him. Nakudu explains that his loved ones were taken in the \\"Great Red Birds\\", ships with large red sails, to the \\"Mountains of the Gods\\", from which no one has ever returned. They then come together with other tribes, who agree to form a coalition to pursue the raiders.<br /><br />They find the ships with red sails holding Evolet and Baku. They have no means to follow the ships, so they journey through a vast desert, discovering an advanced civilization similar to ancient Egypt, ruled by an enigmatic figure known as \\"The Almighty\\", who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. The Almighty, who is regarded as a living god, possesses many thousands of slaves that he is using to build a huge pyramid complex in his honor. D'Leh finds an escaped servant of the Almighty and notices he is wearing a bracelet worn by D'Leh's father. D'Leh's father left his tribe for food and found the Naku tribe before being stolen by the raiders. In a night attack, the guards of the slaves discover D'Leh behind a pyramid. Tic'Tic dies from injuries from killing the guards before they raise the alarm. Meanwhile, the Almighty's priests discover Evolet bears scars on her hand patterned after the \\"Mark of the Hunter\\", the constellation Orion. The priests believe it is part of a prophecy that whoever wears the mark of the Hunter is destined to kill The Almighty. D'Leh starts a full-scale rebellion amongst the slaves. They cause the mammoth herd, used in building the pyramid, to stampede and kill a large number of troops.<br /><br />The Almighty offers Evolet to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. The Almighty says that if D'Leh takes his wife, his warriors can return, but the rest must be his slaves forever. D'Leh feigns acceptance of the deal which allows him to throw a spear at The Almighty and kill him, proving that he is not a god. During the ensuing battle, the raider obsessed with Evolet kidnaps her on horseback. Evolet grabs an arrow and stabs the warlord in the side, knocking them both off the horse. D'Leh rushes towards her, but the raider shoots her in the back. D'Leh kills him and returns to Evolet, and she dies in his arms. The scene shifts to the tribe's wise woman as she breathes in deeply and then breathes out her last breath. The scene then returns to D'Leh still holding Evolet's body when she suddenly awakens, restored by the wise woman's sacrifice. They depart for home and bid farewell to the other tribes.<br /><br />In an alternative ending, the scene shifts forward many years into the future, showing Baku's retelling of the story by the camp fire. It ends with a child asking what had happened to the \\"Mountains of the Gods\\", and Baku responds \\"They were taken back by the sands.

0345803485|1.0|This book is so bad that reading it will make anyone think they can be a successful writer.  I agree with all the other reviews that criticize the nauseating over-use of the same old adjectives, phrases and descriptions.  A gorgeous, Ivy league-educated, wealthy 27 year old CEO would want a backward, unsophisticated, tripping and falling all over the place, frumpily dressed, works in a hardware store, wears no make-up and doesn't fix her hair virgin???????  It is laughable.  His character is somewhat interesting but her character is so unbelievable that the story turns into a comedy that made me lose interest fast.  If you are so curious that you must check it out, just go to a bookstore and read a bit.  You will be glad that you didn't waste your money.<br /><br />One last thing....the author keeps referring to \\"sex' as a body part.  She writes \\"he cupped my sex\\", \\"he grabbed my sex\\", etc.  I think she is using the word sex as a noun for crotch or vagina.  Is this a British thing?
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I'm sure you've heard all the cliches before. Fast-paced, keeps you on the edge of your seat, page turner. For this book I wholeheartedly agree with those terms. From the second I picked this one up (and I'm glad I did.) I never wanted to put it down.<br /><br />I hate when I start a book and work ends up getting in the way. This is about Will Robie who's an assassin for the government. When his assignment goes wrong he's left trying to keep himself and a 14 year old straggler alive along the way.<br /><br />I really don't want to say too much about this for fear of giving something away. I'll just leave it as a great book that had me guessing for sometime. I had an idea who might be in on it but really didn't know 100% until it actually all went down. I love books that are not predictable.<br /><br />As a standalone this was an excellent read. If we were to see more like this in the future, I'd have to say I wouldn't be disappointed in the least.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never write a review, \\"this is a first for me\\".  I always read a handful before I purchase a book, but I take them with a grain of salt.  I believe that a readers opinon can be just that....an opinion...and therefore not always agreeable to me.  That being said, I feel compelled to write a review on this book, mostly because of it's popularity and some due to the unfair label I feel this book has obtained.<br /><br />I have read many romance novels and altho this book is labeled locally as a Momma's porn read, I must disagree.  This is a love story with humor and seriousness that takes you a moment to wrap your head around each verbal and written (email) scene as well as the physical scenes.  Every relationship has it's obstacles and in this book you go through Ana's obstacles as well as Christian's.  Maybe obstacles is an understatement, because these are some pretty high mountains to climb if this was the real world.  There are some points in the book that are unrealistic.....and granted, fiction is unrealistic....which is why I would only give it 4 stars if I didn't convince myself that fiction is fiction.  So 5 stars it gets!  I need to be a convinced reader and there are some \\"facts\\" about the characters that I am not convinced are realistic.  However, to say it is a page turner is an understatement.  I read the book in just over 24 hours and as a mother of 3, that is a mountain to climb in and of itself.<br /><br />What I basically want to say here is, read it!  Take the time to wrap your head around it.  Take it for what it is, not for what the \\"people\\" say it is.  And you will not be disappointed.  ENJOY!

Thank you Charlie De Lauzerika for producing one of the best movie experiences, and the special features were amazing. I especially loved the fact that our Bladezone site was mentioned so prominently in the special features.<br /><br />It was amazing how Charlie and Ridley went about fixing so many of the \\"lip flap\\" issues the film has been famous for, in this final cut.

The book did reveal a lot about the depth Keith's addictions but not enough about the music and who he really is as a person.<br /><br />I found the book losing me due to the random writing style one third the way through. I did eventually finish it with the continual hope it would get better.  It never did.

0345803485|1.0|I can't even begin to describe how this book becoming so popular has actually made me lose faith in humanity.<br /><br />The writing is trite and the dialogue is unnatural. I have read middle school term papers that are written better than this book.<br /><br />The characters are obnoxious. Christian Gray is an emotionally abusive psycho and a stalker. I say this based on the way that he treats Anastasia OUTSIDE of the bedroom. None of that opinion is based on his sexual preference for a dominant/submissive bedroom relationship. The only thing I can say about that is an experienced dom would never take on an unexperienced sub like Ana Steele, one who is also a virgin. Speaking of Ana, aren't we all sick of worthless female characters who are so sad and dependent on their man.<br /><br />There is just so much wrong with this book. Honestly I regret spending $10 on it.

1475143389|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this book. Mike has a pretty clear vision for what it takes to get muscley and the book contains quite a bit of information from workout techniques to diet to attitude. There is a lot of valuable information here and quite a bit of material is dedicated to debunking myths and building a more proven approach. I don't know that any of the ideas here are terribly groundbreaking, but Mike does claim that it is all backed up by the latest science, research, and personal experience.<br /><br />Actually, for me, that's the first place the book falters. Mike claims that his approach is based on facts, not myths, but he fails to provide any references to research that supports his claims. For example, he states that you want to consume easily digested proteins right after your workout so your glycogen starved muscles will get the nutrient boost they need to grow. However, there are no references given to legitimate scientific studies to back up this claim. And if you do a little research on your own, it's not hard to find people who make reasonable arguments that totally refute it. I'm not saying that Mike's claims aren't backed by legitimate science (in fact I know that this particular claim is), however if Mike really wants to sell this stuff, references to actual studies must be included. As it is, there's too much \\"trust me, I know what I'm talking about\\" and \\"if I had a nickel for every time I've seen some guy to A, B, or C totally wrong\\". Why should I believe him? Just because he's saying I should? Personal experience and anecdotal evidence does not equal science or even a convincing argument.<br /><br />The other problem I have with the book is that the layout really needs work. There's a lot that can be done to organize this book so it drives the important points across better (and I don't mean just CAPITALIZING IMPORTANT WORDS) and makes finding critical information easier. The book does have an overall progression of theory, to practice, to diet,to supplements, but it meanders along the way. Too many of the chapters (especially the diet related ones) seem kind of arbitrary and perhaps could be consolidated and clarified. Most of the book is just a big wall of text and it's pretty hard to thumb back through it and pick up the important points.<br /><br />Finally, I really wish he had given a sample weekly diet. He does give a good formula for calculating how much protein, carbs, and fat you should eat per day based on whether you are bulking, cutting, or maintaining, and that is extremely valuable information but taking that information and applying it to create a viable meal plan would be a great addition. He did this with training exercises, why not diet?<br /><br />I know I complained a lot, but I really did enjoy this book and I am actually planning on following its recommendations. I think if there was a little more emphasis on backing up claims with research and a better layout, this book could be great. And if it turns out that I \\"dramatically transform my body faster than I ever though possible\\", then I will wholeheartedly recommend this book and probably change my review.

1401923119|1.0|This is a silly book. There is no such thing as the \\"new biology\\", the author appears to be attempting to use fallacious appeals to mystery and other invalid rhetorical devices in order to obscure the fact that virtually everything he advances is empirically unverifiable.
0307951529|5.0|Chris has done a wonderful job showing that all of us have the ability to really create something epic and can turn any idea into a successful business. The real world examples given show you step by step the process that many have taken. There is no fluff in here, starting your own business takes hard work, but how important is it to you. If you are ready to saddle up for the ride of your life and become an entrepreneur this is a great place to start.
0142410705|4.0|I can't decide between 3 or 4. I would probably give this book a four and since most people seem to like it, a 4 it is. This book starts a little slow and for much of the book not a lot is happening. Of course there are other books I would recommend, but this is okay. Many people seem to like it more than I do, so maybe you will to. The book does send a good message and the main character is a semi-socially awkward, brilliant teen. Hopefully you will enjoy the book.

I was emotionally involved with the main character and found her decision that the book revolves around very difficult. Good book.
1451627289|5.0|I'll start out by saying that I have always been ambivalent about Stephen King. Though I love \\"horror stories\\" (the clasic ones: Lovecraft, Bloch, C.A Smith, Hodgeson, etc)and I have always acknowledges King's way with narrative, I have been mostly put off by his need to slice and dice characters I've invested emotional ties with. Having said that, I believe that 11/22/63 is King's masterpiece and that it leaps way beyond anyhting he has ever done. I also believe it has a chance of moving into the pantheon of classic novels. For a change, the violence in this book is almost entirely emotional and - for me at least - this makes it all the more potent. The relationship between Jake and Sadie could not be handles better. I fell for Sadie just as Jake did. The scenes between her and Jake form the beating heart of this novel (so much so that there were times that I found the \\"Kennedy\\" parts a distraction! I do not recall any recent novel that has caused me to gasp, smile, and yes weep at points of high emotion. But now to the end (and I won't spoil anything): I desperately wanted Jake to do what he planned after what happened to Sadie in Dallas. I could think of no better ending than to have Jake return to 1950s Jodie Texas and take up a life with his love. And now having said that, I must say that although the ending King went with made me ball my fist in anger, it stayed with me for weeks afterwards. The sheer authentic emotion that King generated when Jake and sadie have their \\"reunion\\" left me devastated. I was the perfect ending from a romantic sense; the \\"right\\" one without being the best one (for me). I still think about Jake and Sadie weeks after finishin this book. I suppose many of us (male or female) have a \\"Sadie\\" they wish they could have known - or did know and lost, and have wished to have a chance to hange things. Bravo to Mr. King for a fine, balanced mature novel with no zombies, vampires, killer clowns, giant insects, mad dogs, or and \\"boogie-boogie-boogie\\" moments.

B00633PFQC|2.0|The topic of the book is very interesting, that is the most positive aspect of the book.<br /><br />I'd hoped for some logical and well worked out analysis, but but did not find much of it. The typical argument is to take an obvious case. \\"Why don't sell Nobel prizes?\\" Then, without a real systematic analysis of the obvious cases, he portrays other markets as somewhat similar, hence trading should be an equally bad idea in those markets.<br /><br />Tired of weak arguments, I grew impatient and stopped reading after completing half the book. The review is thus only based on the first half of the book.<br /><br />BTW: At a form dicussion in Boston Review Sandel present his main points. Some critics state their opinion and Sandel responds.

B007LNJ4YW|4.0|Very much in the tradition of their first three albums, Beach House has created another lush, evocative, classic-sounding record. Ethereal vocals are bathed in dense, shimmering, swelling, synth-driven orchestrations and languid rhythms.<br /><br />Since the band hews throughout the album to a single, relatively consistent tempo and texture, inattentive listeners may write it off as tedious or soporific. But I see \\"Bloom\\" as a fruition and a blossoming of the band's unique, carefully crafted sound. Both beautiful and subtle, simultaneously simple and complex, this a record with a great deal of depth.<br /><br />I could write about individual songs, but I can't describe them in a way that would meaningfully differentiate them. There are many high points, especially on the first few mesmerizing tracks and on the long closer (which contains a hidden bonus song after five minutes of silence), yet there are no singles to speak of. The entire album is an organic whole, a unitary work of art meant for dreaming, swaying, lazing, and musing. It's pop music, but it's not for everyone, and it doesn't try to be.<br /><br />If you're in the right frame of mind, the warm, wistful, melodic, atmospheric music on \\"Bloom\\" sets a magical mood. It will be playing at many a beach house and on many a beach this summer.
0307957934|1.0|I am (was) a big Robert Harris fan.  I read Archangel 7 times so far!  I read The Hitler Diaries twice, and I read all his other books at least once.  But this is my least favorite.  Or rather - not favored at all.<br /><br />What I liked in Harris's other books was their originality.  But Fear Index is just another (I assume, since I never read one of those books) mass-market coming-of-age, emerging from the closet, vampire stories.<br /><br />1 star from me.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this because I heard all the hype and thought I should see for myself. Boy, do I wish I had listened to the people who said it was a poorly written waste of time!<br />I feel as I did when I paid two dollars to look at the World's Smallest Horse at the carnival sideshow--like I'd just been taken as a sucker and should have known better. I am not criticizing it because I am reacting against its runaway success; I'm criticizing it because it is horribly written crap by any measure. There are mistakes in this book that spell check should have found (James wrote \\"sandles\\" instead of \\"sandals\\"). The book is rife with stereotypes, cliches, repetition, grammar errors (\\"a mosaic of paintings hang\\"), errors of geography, confusing sentences and paragraphs (\\"reading a newspaper. It's the size of a tennis court\\") and plot points that contradict each other. Instead of using the word \\"says,\\" James opts for \\"murmurs,\\" \\"mutters\\"or \\"whispers\\" (nearly 250 times combined). This alone is enough to drive me batty.<br />Random House should be ashamed of itself. E.L. James can hardly be blamed. She's a first-time author who apparently knows little-to-nothing about writing. The editors at Random House could have spent a few minutes replacing all the \\"murmurs\\" with \\"says\\" and doing a quick spell check. Granted, it might take the better part of a year to make the plot coherent, but this is something a major publishing house should do BEFORE they start charging an exorbitant price for a hackneyed, sub-par romance novel. I just want my time, money and self-respect back.<br />I didn't even participate in the BDSM sex, but somehow this book left me feeling compromised, tortured and punished.
B004XQO90O|4.0|I have always been a fan of time travel movies or tv and this fit the bill. I like Jake and he did a good job. Great chemisty with his leading lady Michelle. A great job also by Vera F. This time travel movie did not get redundant and there is a message that is suttle that plays on some of our inherent biases. All of these things made this film pretty doggone good. Thanks for reading this.

B00001IVOR|5.0|Wu Tang clan in my opinion is the best collective in hip hop period. Their overall body of work including both as a group & solo are unmatched. Simply put, Wu tang is to hip hop what Iron Maiden is to Metal. 36 chambers was a instant classic up there with illmatic, follow the leader, & various other not just in being classic but highly influenctial hip hop albums. That album had a different sound, the beats were darker & so were the rhymes also there was hardly any offerings from U-God & Masta Killa. Everyone knows the vintage wu tang era was from 1993 - 1997. This is the \\"5 year plan\\" that rza spoke of in the wu tang manuel where they would take the rap world by storm for 5 years straight & that they did.  This album is the last classic wu tang album during the vintage era (they still have made some good stuff afterwards) The beats are more experimental than the ones on 36 chambers & the tone is lighter rather than dark as well. RZA really established himself as a top producer with the beats on here. Unlike the 36 chamber, we got to see much more of Masta Killa & U-God this time around everyone is here. The only dissapointment here is GZA & ODB are absent from a huge amount of the double disk album. Everyone did there thing of course but the members who really shined on this project was Method Man, Ghostface, Deck, & RZA( from a beat & MC standpoint). Lyrically, this album is 3 steps above the debut & the only guest apperances are from streetlife, Tekietha, Cappadonna, & Popa Wu. Every single track is a gem here & honestly the only filler tracks I can say could have been left off & replaced with something else is Dog ish & Maria. Contrary to popular belief, Black Shampoo is a great track from u-god a concept about pleasing a woman never understood why people bash that track. Wu tang truley is something special & we will never see another supergroup like them again espeically in their large number of mcs with an impact they had. Even though 97 was the end of the vintage wu tang era they still dropped some good albums afterward such as Cuban Linx 2, Beneath The Surface, Supreme Clintele, The W, Tical 2000, Legend of the Liquid Swords, Fishscale, Big Doe rehab & some others not to mention the wu tang affilates dropped some good stuff as well. Get this album & other future wu projects & remember wu tang is forever!tage wu tang era they still dropped some good albums afterward such as Cuban Linx 2, Beneath The Surface, Supreme Clintele, The W, Tical 2000, Legend of the Liquid Swords, Fishscale, Big Doe rehab & some others not to mention the wu tang affilates dropped some good stuff as well.

0312944098|5.0|I believe that this is Jeffrey Archer's best book of the many that he has written.  I could not put this book down once I started reading it.  It was funny and poignant. The flow of the story is just right, and I found myself frustrated and dejected along the many protagonists in the book for the injustices that they are subjected to and lauded for the poetic justice being suffered by the antagonists.
B004WKOCQC|4.0|Ok, so I have always been a big fan of Boyd and the boys. I bought this album last July and while I really liked the single \\"Promises, Promises\\", I was a little less than impressed that the whole album seemed to be of the same slow tempo as that track. And so I didn't listen much beyond that tune...<br />On a recent road trip I randomly decided to take this album along and I am glad that I did because It was on the road that I was finally able to appreciate what they did on this album. Opening track \\"if not now, when?\\" is a great into track and is more appreciated upon further listens.... Highlights to me are: \\"Promises, promises\\", \\"Thieves\\", \\"Isadore\\", and \\"In the company of wolves.\\" Don't get me wrong there is some forgettable stuff here, See track 3 \\"Friend and lovers\\"... But for the most part this is a great listen, as long as: you are willing to embrace the fact that people mature, bands mature, and evolve... and with that so does their sound!<br /><br />I look at this album as their attempt to stay relevant to their situation for many years to come. \\"Isadore\\" may be one of the best Incubus tracks in recent memory... For that and \\"promises\\" alone, this album was worth a listen!<br /><br />Not perfect by any means, but a solid listen that I am glad I gave a second chance!
B0002EXH54|4.0|This was the band's first album to be released on a major label. Dave Mustaine was still in the process of developing his vocal style. The music is extremely amazing and composed very well. The musicianship is mind-blowing considering the state of being of the band members at the time. As much as I want to give this album 5 stars, it really deserves 4 because Mustaine's voice is still trying to find a comfort zone and the bonus tracks are a nice sentiment but nothing I'll ever probably listen to more than once.<br /><br />This was definitely something that Dave Mustaine had to get out of his system though. In the liner notes, he talks about how crazy these times were and how the band spent alot of the album's money on drugs. Alot of the lyrics deal with frustration with society and it's love for war and violence, inner conflict, and a guilt about dabbling in the dark occult ways. Dave mention's the devil numerous times on this album ironically while kind of fighting his own inner demons (he said in an interview that nowadays, it bothers him to play songs like \\"The Conjuring\\"). On this album though, Dave doesn't condone or praise the devil, he warns about what a bad idea it is to get involved in that area and also sings about what comes with dabbling in that.<br /><br />While Dave's voice was just starting to find that intensity with conviction on this album, I would probably have to say that these are probably the most intense and personalized lyrics I've heard on a Megadeth album.<br /><br />So bottom line, I'd love to give this a 5 but there are some things I just can't overlook even though this has extremely amazing songwriting and musicianship (that would later be bested by \\"Rust in Peace\\" in my opinion).<br /><br />If you're new to Megadeth, start with \\"Rust in Peace\\" but I'm sure any fan of metal music in general could find something here that they like.

The writing looked like it had been written by a toddler the chapter names might of been been creative but a) they gave away the whole point of the chapter and are just stupid.

1609613937|5.0|I am thrilled with the contents and format of this new book from John and Mary McDougall. When it comes to building a foundation of health, it really is so simple and McDougall keeps reminding us of just that.<br /><br />A whole-foods, low fat, vegan diet is easy to implement and a joy to experience, coupled with the easy weight loss and health that results. In response to contemporary debate about what the first humans on the planet ate, the point is we are an omnivorous species and can easily do - and thrive - without the health, environmental and humane issues surrounding the use of animal products. When people object that the changes are too inconvenient, I answer it is far less inconvenient than being fat and hungry at the same time. Then I tell them, let me show you how I do it, I'm always happy to share.<br /><br />The Starch Solution is a rich resource of research supported answers to so many common questions that I encounter in my practice on a daily basis, and having them so beautifully packaged in one place is a big package under the Christmas tree. The McDougall approach is forming the foundation of nutrition programs that are in place and growing around the country, including Meals for Health and Whole Foods Market. And the recipes are from Mary's premium collection - I made her whole-wheat biscuits for breakfast this morning, adding grated orange peel to the batter and with the oats in the recipe they tasted like giant oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />A bold, honest piece of work, which we expect and appreciate from Team McDougall. Stars all over the chart.
0307951529|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo39HN8W7PLPW96]]The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau would have saved me THOUSANDS of dollars and YEARS of trying to figure things out on my own.  More in the video ...
B003YWUTJI|2.0|I had purchased Norah Jones latest album \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" and was thrilled with it. Hungry for more, I came back and ordered this one. That it had her name on it was enough- I didn't read the reviews. That was a big mistake on my part. My tastes in music do not include all genres.  I find rap music rather offensive; hip hop and country just don't interest me much. So there are tracks on this album I won't listen to. It says on the back, the \\"collaborations on this compilation span the musical spectrum.\\" If you are like me, you will be better off buying individual tracks you like. (There ARE some tracks here I do like). I deeply enjoy Norah Jones when SHE sings, in her own style. That is not what this is.
1601251505|5.0|As a player of D&D 3.5, I was somewhat hesitant in purchasing this book. My primary concerns were:<br /><br />1) Is Pathfinder different enough from 3.5 to warrant switching systems? Are the differences enough to warrant this switch?<br />2) Is this going to teach me anything new? Will it give me something I didn't have before?<br /><br />The answer to the first question is yes- while the differences may not seem overly apparent at first when switching from 3.5 to Pathfinder, the simplification of some rules (namely grappling) and the adjustment of the skill system make it well worth switching. I also prefer the leveling system; in 3.5 there were quite a few \\"dead levels\\". For me, the most exciting part about RPG gaming is developing your character through leveling up- dead levels take the fun out of this. The initial excitement of leveling up is there, but when you don't get any new abilities or your old abilities aren't improved in any way, it's somewhat anticlimactic. Pathfinder still suffers from this to some extent, but not as much as 3.5 did, and only for a few classes (specifically the Cleric and Wizard classes). Furthermore, the classes are differentiated in more ways that allow for more robust character development and customization. For example, the Sorcerer class is now much different from the Wizard class. In 3.5, the differences between the two were very subtle: the Sorcerer knew less spells but could cast more per day, where the Wizard had access to a wide variety of spells but could not cast as many. This basic aspect is still the same in Pathfinder, but the Sorcerer now also has a \\"Bloodline\\", which grants him or her different special abilities or spells- a unique feature that allows for the player to tweak their character more to their liking.<br /><br />For the purposes of answering the second question, I will compare the Pathfinder Core Rulebook to the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 Players Handbook. To answer the question succinctly: yes. This book not only gives you any information you'll need to be an adventurer in the Pathfinder system, it includes information on how to run a game. A very experienced 3.5 DM may not learn anything new from this section of the book, but I will say that it is very nice to have both a Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide in one volume.<br />If you are already familiar with the Pathfinder system, you may be aware that you can actually access all of the information contained within the Core Rulebook online or in legally downloadable PDF format. Why, then, would anybody choose to buy this book when they could have it on their computer for free? The answer to that question is a more personally specific one, and I do not doubt that many gamers will choose the free option, but for me it was a number of reasons. First of all, I prefer physical books to electronic copies. It's easier to flip through, or flip back and forth between  pages (which you may find yourself doing quite often to compare tables or classes). Secondly, the art included in the book is easily the best I've seen in any fantasy RPG text. While this isn't needed in order to enjoy the game or understand the rules, it is a nice edition that will make owning the book more pleasing than just flipping through the PDF. Personally, I use the PDF as well- in fact, sometimes instead of flipping between different pages of the book, I flip between the PDF and the book, keeping one page up on my laptop and another page open in the book.<br /><br />For closing notes, I'll just wrap up by saying that the book is bound well and durable. I will definitely be purchasing more Paizo Pathfinder products in the future, and if you are either looking to get into tabletop RPGs, or seeking a new system for your group, I highly recommend this book.only gives you any information you'll need to be an adventurer in the Pathfinder system, it includes information on how to run a game.

B007ZZ3RI0|4.0|This album is a very nice follow up to Mr. Lambert's first.  If you enjoyed \\"For Your Entertainment\\" you will almost certainly also like \\"Trespassing.\\"  Lots of the great vocals that we've come to expect, and there was also a very nice variety of songs on this album.  So many artists have been releasing albums wherein most if not all of the songs sound so similar that you can only listen to them so much at one time before getting sick of the repetitiveness.  Not so with this one.  Very refreshing.<br /><br />I have to agree with the first reviewer - the ballads are definitely the gems of this album.  I do have to admit that a couple of the songs were a little over-processed for my taste (but frankly, that seems to be industry standard at the moment).<br /><br />Overall a great album!  I'm definitely enjoying it.
B000TRTNOS|5.0|I cannot count how many times I've listened to this album and always assumed that it was live. When I finally discovered that it was recorded in a studio my jaw dropped. The sheer energy and power must have fried the recording console.<br /><br />Each track swings and swings hard. However, there is a quality to the last track - \\"Pensativa\\" - that touches my soul in some ineffable way. One unique aspect of this album for me personally is although I am a drummer I don't care much for Blakey's style of drumming. Not that Blakey isn't one of the greats because he is, but I am more drawn to the likes of Ed Thigpen, Connie Kay, Frankie Dunlop and similar drummers. However, there is something about Blakey's explosive drumming on this album that does appeal to me. I cannot put my finger on it, but he manages to inspire me with his playing here.<br /><br />With Wayne Shorter on tenor and Freddie Hubbard on trumpet I am naturally drawn to the album. This is not my absolute favorite Jazz Messenger line-up, but it does rank up there. The other members comprising this particular 'edition' had been together for nearly three years, which may account for the energy leaping out from the album. For the record the other members on the recording are Cedar Walton on piano, Reggie Workman on bass, Chris Fuller on trombone and, of course, Art Blakey on drums.<br /><br />For a studio album this captures a rare energy (and synergy) for any ensemble (not just the Jazz Messengers), and is one of the hardest swinging albums any edition of the Messengers cut - in or out of the studio.

0307594009|5.0|I've known the general story of Anne Frank for well over 40 years. Recently I picked up her diary at a used book store, curiosity haven gotten the better of me.<br /><br />The first entry was made when she was 13 years old. In many respects she was a typical teenage girl and the book, to my surprise, was not so much about the holocaust as about the musings of a young adolescent, albeit living in unusual circumstances. Her frankness at times startled me. She did not mask her thoughts or her feelings. She writes beautifully, and her writing got better as the days and months dragged on. She also describes, as well as any author I've read, the early stirrings of genuine first love, its intensity and manic nature.<br /><br />In the end however it IS about the holocaust. It gives away nothing to say that the diary comes to an abrupt end. We know what happens next though thank g*d we're spared the details. When the Germans murdered Anne Frank they killed the best of g*d's creations. Last November a new synagogue opened in Speyer, Germany on the anniversary of Kristallnacht. Let Hitler roll over in his grave.<br /><br />[...]

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Goes without saying that the vocals on this album are out of this world, but the production is also stellar.  My current favorites are Kickin In (very Prince-like but with a modern spin) and Shady, a track featuring Sam Sparro and Nile Rodgers.  Listen with headphones to fully appreciate all the quirky, atmospheric layers on tracks like Chokehold and Broken English reminiscent of Depeche Mode back in the Alan Wilder days. Great stuff here from a truly unique artist.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is hot! It made me blush quite a few times and I loved every minute of it. It is very freeing having an author write something so unexpected and needed. It is a very grown-up, less fantasy version of Twilight.  Christian is sexy, sophisticated, and a little effed up. He feels the need to control everything in his life, especially his women. Anastasia is not the submissive type to sit around and take orders- she is the only person that has ever been able to put him in his place. I recommneded this series to several friends, and they have all fallen in love with it!

B0052VUNHC|1.0|I was horrified by this book, and even more horrified by the glowing reviews that readers gave it.  This book is about a \\"romance\\" between two young college students.  As a therapist, I was completely overwhelmed by the level of dysfunction of a relationship that we are supposed to view as ideal.  The man in the relationship is controlling, obsessive, abusive, and violent.  The narrator Abby is just an idiot.  Some people claim that this is a young adult novel, if my child was reading this book I would be very very scared.

B004OR1XGK|5.0|I read the first chapters of CC2 for free on Kindle, and found the plain English easy to understand, but more importantly, the CONCEPTS easy to understand.  I buy very few books, but this has been a value purchase.<br /><br />CC2 is great at helping me determine WHAT to do; the HOW programming just follows naturally.<br /><br />The concepts are so well communicated that they are internalized.  Of the hundreds of books I've read, this is only the second that has \\"communicated directly with my subconscious.\\"<br /><br />As a retired business person with MINIMAL software background, I started programming poker deals to sharpen the mind. I found that a \\"working\\" program was less difficult than an \\"elegant\\" program, and had been looking for a better C++ book too help me program (5* for C++ Primer Plus 6th Ed.).<br /><br />Of the two books, CC2 has been the most valuable.<br /><br />A 2nd benefit of the book is that the concepts of organization and prioritization are so well communicated, they have influenced my real life personal habits.  The non-structure of retirement had evolved to \\"spaghetti-programmed\\" life habits. I have noticed a slight steady change to the good for a healthier lifestyle over the last month.  Coincidence???  I think not.

The brutal murder of her mother had long ago determined the trajectory of her life. And, over the years, that murder had also impacted CASTLE's overarching narrative thrust. I won't lie, Season 4's episode finale does address that long-running theme, sort of, but it's not like Beckett achieves any real traction with regards to resolving this. Instead, as we tune in, we end up settling for the show's other draws. Like, say, the consistently droll Ryan-Esposito bromance. The sweet father-daughter interactions between Castle and Alexis. The mystery-of-the-week as viewed thru the prism of Castle's outside-the-box perspective. Then there are Castle's off-the-wall remarks and Beckett's bemused reactions. And, of course, that simmer between them (or as the hardcore crowds have annoyingly anointed them: \\"Caskett\\"). Fans of that last bit should have something to talk about in this season.<br /><br />I wonder if them CASTLE showrunners took a peek over at what's gone down in BONES and so were galvanized into stepping their game up.<br /><br />In tossing in my two cents regarding prior seasons, I'd praised the hell out of the cast and their chemistry and the tone of the show. So, today, I'll just say that the acting is still aces and I still dig the (mostly) light tone. If there's one distressing element in Season 4, it's that several episodes got too heavyhanded with the soap opera aspect, what with Castle's having found out that Beckett had feigned unconsciousness when Castle told her he loved her back when she got all shot up by that sniper. I got a little fed up with Castle's moping. He seems to not have put enough weight on that Beckett was going thru her own sh-- at the time. So, yeah, the romantic thread became a bit too Mexican telenovela for me. But she's keeping a secret, and he's keeping a massive secret. Because, at this stage, Rick Castle is closer to the truth behind the conspiracy than Beckett is.<br /><br />There's a shift in group dynamics with the advent of the tough-as-nails Captain Victoria \\"Iron\\" Gates as the new head of Precinct 12. She takes an instant dislike to Castle, which is neat for ongoing character conflict. You'd think her stance against him would soften as the season went on... but nuh-uh. Meanwhile, Alexis begins interning with Lanie, the police medical examiner, except that this may be too close for comfort for her concerned dad. There's also some guff about Alexis agonizing over which college to attend. Another plot thread amusingly tracks Ryan's impending nuptials. A slice of trivia: In a very cool life-imitates-art moment, Seamus Dever - who plays Detective Ryan - married his real-life wife, Juliana, again, on camera (Juliana plays Ryan's fiancee on the show).<br /><br />It's another fine season, and full of episodes that mostly fall in the high watchability bracket. But I have my favorites:<br /><br />- \\"Heroes & Villains\\" - Beckett and Castle investigate an alley murder in which the perpetrator may be the comic book superhero, Lone Vengeance. Except that there are several suspects running around wearing the Lone Vengeance costume. Plenty of nods to us comic book geeks.<br /><br />- \\"Kick the Ballistics\\" - This ep focuses on Detective Ryan as his old service weapon - the one that was taken by the serial killer, 3XK, in last season - resurfaces in a homicide.<br /><br />- \\"Demons\\" - It's Halloween, as Beckett and Castle look into the slaying of a ghost hunter in a haunted house, with Castle theorizing that dark supernatural forces may be at play. But Beckett, being Beckett, scoffs at Castle's notion of a murderous ghost (or, as Castle calls it, \\"Apparition American\\"). Heh.<br /><br />- \\"Cops and Robbers\\" - Castle and his mom are in a bank that gets taken over by four bank robbers dressed up in doctor's scrubs. This pretzely (because it's twisty) episode startsout as a hostage-taking bank heist, but it spins off into something else altogether.<br /><br />- \\"Kill Shot\\" - As a world-class sniper with a mad-on stalks New York, a traumatized Beckett tries to overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder. Stana Katic turns in a stunning, heartbreaking performance. And for fans of Javi Esposito, your boy falls into the spotlight.<br /><br />- \\"Cuffed\\" - As if Beckett and Castle being cuffed together and locked in a room isn't promising enough, there's also a killer tiger on the rampage. Time to sit back and soak in the excellent banter and rampant sexual innuendo.<br /><br />- \\"The Blue Butterfly\\" - This is the awesomely awesome 1940s film noir episode. 'Nuff said (except that it's awesome).<br /><br />- \\"Pandora\\" & \\"Linchpin\\" - Okay, the cliffhanger ending to \\"Pandora\\" is a bit ridiculous, but I still like these two eps for digging into Castle's backstory. In this two-parter, Castle and Beckett become embroiled in a deadly international conspiracy and also get pretty much pushed around by the CIA. The gorgeous-as-ever Jennifer Beals guest-stars as CIA operative Sophia Conrad, with whom Castle shares a heated past (Castle and Sophia, sitting on a tree...). Hey, is that Beckett getting all jealous?<br /><br />- \\"Headhunters\\" - A disillusioned Castle decides to partner up with the unhinged, rule-breaking Sgt. Slaughter (Adam Baldwin) on a severed heads case.<br /><br />- \\"Undead Again\\" - Zombie episode. There's really nothing more to say.<br /><br />- \\"Always\\" - In this taut, game-changing season finale, are we witnessing the end of a steadfast bromance? Also, the return of Beckett's sniper causes a serious rift between Beckett and Castle.out as a hostage-taking bank heist, but it spins off into something else altogether.<br /><br />- \\"Kill Shot\\" - As a world-class sniper with a mad-on stalks New York, a traumatized Beckett tries to overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Bought the 3 kindle books after watching the 1st movie in theaters... I have to say it's excellent and fresh. To adult readers, it may seem a bit too teenage sometimes but always thrilling... It's original, new, fresh, convincing, exciting... I love the fact that you always wanna know what's gonna happen, i read the 3 books in 2 weeks.<br />brilliant trilogy, definitely recomended.
0763644765|5.0|Best buy ever. I am introducing my twin 13 mo old boys to the Portugal they love this book! We read it on the lofty, they point at the pics and shake their heads. A must have in my opinion!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Aside from a few glitches (deleted bill reminders still showing up months later) this is a great little app.  When my computer stopped working a few months ago I lost access to my Quicken bill reminders and this app saved me a lot of hassle and potential late fees from missed payments.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very hot and sexy.  A bit kinky at times.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You just can't put it down and if you do you can't wait to get back to it.  A bit of a mystery with the characters. You want to hurry and finish the book so you can start reading book two and three of the triology.
0393019217|5.0|If you're interested in science and/or have an unusual curiosity to discover the \\"how\\" or \\"why\\" of science, Feynman's adventures/misadventures will have you smiling and laughing while also wondering.  A highly suggested read for all my fellow nerds out there.
B006QKKMBA|1.0|Personally, I'm REAALY tired and VERY annoyec by the increasingly improbable Rube Goldberg-esque moronic new and improved ways to die. Plane crash in FD1, scary. Massive car wreck in FD2, scary sick, even in spite of some implausible things--ie, falling logs DO NOT bounce, they boringly just lie there or roll off to the side. That was something I discovered FROM the filmmakers in the film's Bio. By the time we get to FD3, which I waited MONTHS for, I was extremely disappointed. OK, carnival accident. Carnies aren't normally seen as responsible individuals, so maybe...but frankly, I just DIDN'T CARE. FD4, with the car race...hey, wait, didn't we DO that already??? Why not a horribly evil fire, ie, The Cocoanut Grove in real life, that killed 475 people, or the Iroquis in Chicago, the most devastating fire in US history, with DOUBLE the death toll of the famous Chicago fire, as 602 people died. In ONE building. Ford Motor Co now owns the old Oriental, without even so much as a little marker on the wall, but then, I never forgave them for killing all these dumb young people with the Pinto back in the 70's anyway. I only say dumb, because you can't buy a decent car for a dollar a pound, and the Pinto's case in point.<br /><br />Not that RECENT historical fires make a difference, if you count the Station fire in the earlier 00's. With one or two tiny bits of dumb, it boosted whatever was fourth deadliest off the list. Or, happening right in that same week, a crowd stampede would be scary. The E2 nightclub stampede was days away from the Station tragedy.<br /><br />Of course, the point isn't to dramatize real events and say 'look, isn't this fun as well as sick?\\" But that it could be more like the Titanic in terms of a GOOD story with scary events involved.<br /><br />We SAW that water and electrictricty do not mix in at least ONE of the other films. I mean, if someone were writing for this series, and wanted odd deaths, there was a book by a pathologist about weird deaths, including the Pill and a vitamin/supplement OD. One REALLY freakish one involved a harder who tripped over her junk, and the hairbrush she had in her hand got her in the eye socket.<br /><br />I'm having a VERY hard time even watching this one, even the parts that have \\"the creepy black guy,\\" Bludworth, is it? Played by Tony Todd. he was scary as hell in the freakin' Candyman, which is STILL scary 25-30 years later, and STILL a GREAT horror film. For those who like odd trivia, I HIGHLY recommend the Candyman, and that the building they drive under in the title scene at the very start of the film is the old post office. Now closed, I think. As is Cabrini Green--it's been razed, last building went down last summer, tho it wasn't as bad to drive around as it was at the time of the Candyman, when it really was a DMZ. Vanessa Williams the singer is the main character's best friend.<br /><br />If you insist on watching the awful, less than one star worthy film, PLEASE request it from your library as I did, so at least it's FREE!<br /><br />Oh, the bridge scene. I'm a facts dork, but not an engineer. I believe that perticular bridge would have had more redundancy, ie, structures, once they're up, REALLY like to STAY up. It takes some doing to get them to fall. While there are bridges that WOULD fall due to some miniscule crack, I don't think this is one of those designs. There's one that looks like a bicycle chain, and one of those DID fall due to an eighth-inch crack. Plus, I'd be moving a bit more seriously if I even THOUGHT a bridge I was on was going to drop. Trust me, you don't NEED glasses to get off a bridge. As near-sighted as I am, I can still see a CAR! And even I wouldn't be looking for them if they fell off my face. And you generally DON'T live after you drop from a bridge. Nice job getting a pristine 25-ish year old LeBaron convertible to drop on that character, as well as the other car aquiring, though.<br /><br />Isn't it CA? Why not an earthquake, already?? Oh, in FD2, there's NO WAY that bus had enough room to get up to the speed fast enough to squish her like that, but because I was ENTERTAINED, I didn't care! I spent some time looking for the digital break, and never found it, actually. Here there's way too much unnecessary and VERY annoying green screen backrounds,  for NO obvious reason!!!<br /><br />Some movies that are much better<br /><br />Halloween.<br />Psycho<br />FD 1 & 2<br />candyman<br /><br />At any rate, thank you for reading, hope it helped.y??

0316776963|5.0|While all of his books are hilarious, this book in particular ranks as my personal favorite.  It was difficult NOT to laugh out loud.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Why 12.99 for the kindle when it's 10 dollars in paperback! ? I would love to read it but refuse to pay 13 dollars for a book that has been out a while.
0345803485|2.0|Shades of Grey is a pathetically redundant, juvenile, amateur piece of crap!!! I'm quite sure that the fact that the authors husband is a television executive is the ONLY reason this ridiculous book has received so much positive publicity.<br /> I could make a list nearly as long as the book of the repetitive words and phrases the author uses ad nauseum... 'Petulant', 'control freak', references to his \\"intense grey eyes\\", 'sculpted body', his \\"mercurial moods\\", \\"cocking his head to one side\\", him \\"tucking a stray lock of her hair behind her ear\\", her 'blushing' or 'flushing', or 'cringing', referring to one another as \\"Miss Steele...\\" and \\"Mr.Grey...\\" His \\"graceful' movements, and the \\"inner goddess\\", eye rolling, 'growing erection' , \\"Christian Please, I beg you\\" 'growls', 'groans', 'moans', and 'condoms' \\"oh my\\"!!<br />If you made a drinking game and took a drink every time the author refers to her \\"Inner goddess\\" you would be trashed and vomiting by the second chapter.<br />I've read several reviews that compare the Shades of Dread... Er, Oops \\"Shades of Grey\\" Trilogy to the \\"Twilight\\" Trilogy. I think this is grossly unfair to Stephanie Meyer. Do not misunderstand I am NOT a Twilight fan! I read them because my teenage son and daughter were reading them and I thought it was a good opportunity for us to connect through literature.<br />While I found the Twilight books juvenile they were in fact written for the adolescent population and it is readable. Shades on the other hand was supposedly written for adult readers. I of course only speak for myself but I believe a few others will agree that after reading the same exact description of Miss Steele and Mr. Grey's sex romps right down to the \\"tearing open of the condom wrapper\\" for the 10th, 15th, 20th time it begins to lose its \\"erotic\\" edge.<br />I read quite a lot. I make a goal to read 100 books a year and I usually meet my goal or come quite close and I can say without hesitation that this was the most god awful verbose, adolescent, obnoxious piece of nonsense I've ever had the displeasure of reading. You would think someone involved... her editor, agent, or husband would have introduced her to a thesaurus! TERRIBLY AMATEUR, ABSURDLY REPETITIVE, DREADFULLY IMMATURE and just plain terrible, absurd, and dreadful!!! If you actually want to read some excellent worthwhile literature I can recommend a few HUNDRED genuinely worthy contributions. Forget about this disappointing waste of time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|soooo much fun!!!!!!!! is really enjoyable! although it can be time consuming it is very addicting and u always have new goals.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I saw this movie in theaters and the only way I could have left happy was after the first 5 minutes. That was the only part that had me interested. Then the next 2 hours of my life were wasted watching Ryan Gosling's un-named character stare awkwardly into the eyes of every person he encountered. His script must have been pretty light.<br />Anyone who rates this movie a 5 star must be a Gosling fan because if they hired some nobody on the street this movie would not have done well. This movie would have gone straight to DVD and would have been burried in the depths of your local Wal-Marts inventory. Even the so called \\"action\\" scenes are slow and awkward to sit through. Nothing about this movie is fast paced except for the first five minutes. The story line is hardly worth getting into because its the same mob crap that we've all seen, but even the worst mob movie can top this movie.<br />I wish I could be refunded my $11.50 and 2 hours of wasted time to see a movie that made me want to go home and beat my hands with a hammer to rid myself of all the pain this movie had given me.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is cool and pretty easy for a free game. I love it.....so check it out some time well thanks for the fun G5 Entertainment but a twenty word minimum for a review stinks. I like the game though
B0000025DR|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from the seventies. Songs like \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Strange Magic\\" were successful singles, but it really is an album that's more than the sum of its parts. No bad songs on the thing - EPIC!
1455518999|5.0|Great read.would make a great movie script. I hope we see more of Puller.he reminds me of Reacher in a way , but perhaps a little less mysterious and maybe a little more easily likeable.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Loved this movie from when it was first released. Story has not dimmed over the years. Hilarious, good fun that I will watch and share with friends.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I enjoyed learning a little more about Reachers past and the reasons behind his leaving the army .After 16 books while we feel we know Reacher quite well there is still much to learn about him .I found this book especially readable and the plot not at all predictable making it yet another very enjoyable Reacher read .
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was absolutely brilliant. I loved it! The characters pull on your heart-strings. The whole story was moving. If you like this, try Divergent by Veronica Roth.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is excellent. It provides the usual weather plus allergy, asthma, and other alerts. Also has live radar coverage.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the features that are included with this game.  You have the option of dealing a winning game or a random game.  If you don't win the &quot;winning game,&quot; then you can redeal the same hand and try again.  Try it, you'll love it too.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I know it's obsessive, but I watch an episode of Game of Thrones every single day.  It's like going to the movies right in your own house.  The locations are so beautiful and the characters become so loved (or hated)...just like your own family!
B006OB3K56|1.0|Ok here is the deal.  This dude acts all unhappy and conflicted over everything in his life, his job, his love life, his relationship with his sister, and your like WTF.  I mean, come on, if any man in USA was endowed like him, getting the action he is, looked like him, what is the problem.  Honestly.  The \\"acting\\" is wooden, to say the least, boring to tears.<br />The movie is appropriately named.<br />Skip it.
0345803485|5.0|This was the very first serious I had ever read that involved such graphic details about sex. How ever with that in mind I still loved it! I fell in love with Christian Grey! This book is such a good love story with some really kinky sex .and a great background story. My new favorite serious. I am still dreaming of gray eyes.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|runs on my PC and Roku, syncs nicely with all.  Good for terrestrial and online radio.  well worth the price for the pro version.

0345803485|1.0|...then all of my literary goals and fantasies have now come into question.  Why?  I couldn't even get through the first few pages of the Amazon sample...much better authors on Literotica.com.  Sorry.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased this set of DVD.  Love it!  The graphic is crisp and clear.  It is just amazing to see all the living creatures up close.  Definitely has educational value.  Great for anyone of any age.  The narrator does a pretty good job too.  I higly recommend it.
0756407125|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one. This is day two I the series and it hasn't failed to keep my attention. Good action, magic - Harry potter meets Dragonbone Chair.
0140277447|5.0|This is one of the most moving books I've read so far.  I could imagine it must be extremely difficult for the author to even put this book together.  I admire Iris Chang for her courageousness and dedication.  This is one of those historical piece that was very hard to read but in the end, I'm glad I read it.  Definitely takes courage and a strong heart to read through the whole book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There is so much imagination in the book. The characters are believable, their feelings and reactions to them.  Always a surprise other than what you expect to happen.
0783226888|3.0|Richard Gere and Bruce Willis put in fine performances. This film is based on a great film, The Day of the Jackal. This film, The Jackal could have shined too but the writing resulted in an awkward story. As much as I like Sidney Poitier he wasn't needed in this film. The producers were required to make a decision. You stick with the script and make minor changes or you makes major changes and tip your hat for the inspiration that the other film provided you. In the case of The Jackal what was really important was Gere's pursuit of Willis. The writers revealed to the audience how the Jackal crossed paths with the IRA team in Qaddafi's Libya. The Jackal is caught in an indentity crisis. It wants its own identity from its own script while it struggles to remain true to the original script in The Day of the Jackal. It would have proven far less awkward if Gere made contact with some agency and offered it a proposition for the capture or killing of the Jackal. Still I can understand why. The Day of the Jackal possesses a great script and people hate to lose this sort of writing. They just didn't trust their own writing like the subway scene. How many times do you need kill Bruce Willis? If you're a fan of either actor you'll enjoy their performances but buy it second hand. Don't pay through the nose for a new copy of this DVD. If you have never seen The Day of the Jackal then buy that DVD. You'll understand my gripes with The Jackal and why Gere and Willis were short-changed.

0385340990|4.0|Loved this book. On the surface it seems like an unlikely premise for a book: author visits Guernsey Island after World War II because she's intrigued by the name of the literary society that was formed during the war. The story unfolds through a continuous series of letters to people on the island and people back in London. Nifty job of writing that fairly holds the reader's attention.
B00127RAJY|4.0|great workout, not for beginners.. Modify if you are a beginner. No holds barred workout. It works! WILL MAKE YOU REALLY SWEAT.
0385344228|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I'm sure there are other books that show what happens to a family after a member is accused of a crime.  Another reviewer even bought up a book with similarities to this one, but for me, I thought the author did a very good job.  The emotions seemed true to the characters, along with the disintegration of the family.  I liked the ending, especially what he gave me so that I could predict it and the last part which I didn't.  I consider it a good work of fiction that I enjoyed.
B001O7JHJ8|5.0|Erasure was the Abba of the 80's/90's! Sang my fool head off in the car on the way to work. Worth the sore throat.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|Anyone who knows me considers me a crank, a curmudgeon when it comes to SF and fantasy film fare. And If I know the material I'm even worse. The formula for what works for me is simple: don't treat me like an idiot and I might like your film. I'm not an art snob.<br />That said I did NOT have any hope for this film. The fact is I've grown to loathe Hollywood's attempts at adapting good pulp writing to film. Few exceptions are made to this well established, personal outlook because I honestly think that Hollywood's efforts to own the material starts with denigrating it. Then they try to build it up by modernizing things or making them more and often even less logical than the stories they're adapting.<br />This film is certainly guilty of that. However, this time the evident contempt was left out. Yes, it's a bit modernized but not in any bad way. The story is a bit more layered than the original and of course nothing in the character's motives remain intact from the original story but the character ARE sincere, at least as much as they are in the book without being embarrassing.<br />This is not my John Carter, but he is a close cousin and that was enjoyable enough for me.<br />Taylor Kitsch as John Carter and especially Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris make these characters come alive in ways I did not expect. No, this john Carter makes no mention of his inability to remember his past or how old he is. This guy is a likable character driven at first by his being sick of war and the process of war. He wants wealth and place to get away from his past. Well, he gets his second wish.<br />-As a side note I like this take on Carter even though I miss the ageless man, the warrior. However given our nation's constant state of war I'm not sure we would sympathize with Burrough's Carter who is described as grinning when he engages his enemies in bloodletting. Burroughs thought that war was noble, that it made a man of you. Later in his life as a war correspondent and seeing thetravails of war he no longer clung to naive notions of war's nobler virtues. So, this is essential a Carter from that older writer's perspective-<br />Collin's Dejah is a woman of conscience, a princess who now is also a scientist but also willing to endure a lot to save her people and her father's kingdom though that price is very steep. The original Dejah is also very loyal to her people, her city and her father. So, some change but not a facelift or even disdain, just a more humanized take on both characters.<br />This is growing long but suffice it to say I liked it. I not only liked it I did something I almost never do for a SF/Fantasy film; I endorsed it and even argued with my illustrator/comic artists peers over how good it was. Normally we're very much in agreement but here we had to agree to disagree in a big way.<br />One last thing, I also have come to be very disappointed with FX. This film has turned me around on the use of digital FX. The use of digital affects is used so seamlessly utilized in both settings (beautifully rugged Utah!) and in the characters like the Tharks (they look feel and act so much like they're real it's easy to believe it) are the best use of digital animation I've ever seen. The way they each have individual character, with little mannerisms, speech patterns and facial tics makes them as real as they can be. And the ruin of ancient, dying Barsoom can be felt and seen.<br />Needless to say, all my reservations are on vacation from my usual cynicism. This film gives me hope and I know no one will agree but considering all the crap it takes to get a film like this made, well, I won't disparage the cost it took to make it. I won't say everyone will like this film. There is the hope that many more viewers will ignore the negative campaign to derail this effort and give it a chance.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|I've just discovered this album 30+ years after its release on a tip from Mr. Eddie Trunk.  Indeed, I was in the studio audience of That Metal Show when Michael Schenker was a guest.  Michael's guitar work is hotter than a grease fire.  Heavy and melodic with a tone that annihilates.  This album simply cranks, a must hear.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2<br /><br />Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the last epic conclusion movie in the entire Harry Potter series written by J.K Rowling and directed by David Yates. In the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 Harry, Ron and Hermione need to find the Horcruxes that contain lord Voldamort soul and destroy them with a magical object like a Basilisk fang, Harry has only destroyed two Horcruxes, which would be Tom Riddles diary and the locket of Toms also the previous Headmaster Professor Dumbledore destroyed Voldemorts ring that was his mothers. Now Harry, Ron and Hermione must go to Hogwarts School and destroy the final 3 horcruxes that we don't know what they are. In the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 the three wizards along with every good wizard must face off against Voldemorts army, creatures and all while Harry Potter faces off with Voldemort himself. In this epic blockbuster film two sides of good and evil face off at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry while Harry faces off with the leader of the death eaters.<br /><br />In my own opinion I think the best 5 parts would be the following (from start of the movie to finish)<br />· Robbing Gringots bank<br />· Harry's return to Hogwarts<br />· Voldemorts warning<br />· (My favorite) Courtyard apocalypse<br />· Harry's final clash with Voldemort<br />One part I think could've been better is the courtyard apocalypse because the director should have put part of the scene in first person point of view to let the viewers see what a student saw. The second improvement  scene I thought could be slightly improved is the attention to detail. The final improvement that I know shouldve been in the movie is I would've like to have seen what hogwarts looked like with Voldemort in control such as how the students were treated.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to \\"complete the journey.\\"
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|You've already seen the Avengers and that's ok.<br /><br />You've seen it in every other Marvel movie yet released.  You've definitely seen the finale, and even the McGuffin, because they took it straight from the first Transformers movie.  The Avengers is great fun, but it's fading from memory faster than who won last season's American Idol.<br /><br />While fans of Joss Whedon will likely be pleased, I think his victory with the Avengers is a double edged sword.  He carefully corrals the thicket of big names here, but in the process we're stuck with a laundry list of cliche scenes, a very weak villain, dialog that exists purely to waste time and characters who rely far too much on their costume to get them through the movie.<br /><br />One can't shake the feeling, no matter whose names appear as writers, the Avengers smacks of committee construction.  Excluding Sam Jackson, most of what is here is by the numbers.  There are precious few moments of humanity in a story that should be overflowing with it.  In this respect,  think this movie is a polar opposite of Ang Lee's HULK.  A film that was painfully boring, but also full of human touches - it had a style that could have been robbed like a gold mine to add more character in the place of the dreadful and endless expository dialog exchanges before we're shuttled to the MIchael Bay Transformers action scenes we've seen a thousand times by this point.<br /><br />But is it bad?  Heck no.  The Avengers is ultimately a good time if you can settle for less.  There are no motivations for anything in the film other than to recycle everything that's already been done and play it safe to please an audience.  Yes, you've seen the Avengers already, but that's ok.<br /><br />B-
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a very fun game. but the only thing wroung with the game is that you have to buy the stuff.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|Green lantern really isn't any better or worse than any of the other cookie cutter comic book movies out there.  It's pretty average in most respects but also kinda cool here and there.  I think Martin Campbell is a very competent director but I don't think he took the movie as seriously in some places where he could have.  Basically, in a first movie like this, focus less on all mythology and focus more on Hal Jordan.  Leave most of the aliens for the sequels.  Skarsgard is pretty darned good as the bad dude and surprisingly Ryan Reynolds, who I normally can't stand, is tolerable as Jordan.  The 3D is pretty uneven, but I've yet to find all that many movies, even Pixar ones,  that truly hold up over two hours.<br /><br />Yeah you can do better, but you can do a lot worse too.  Green Lantern is pretty tame.

B005OOSPZO|5.0|I have the DVD version and grabbed this when it went on sale. Overall the disc is worth the price for the movie alone. The video part being in BR is a big improvement over the older DVD. The audio is even more outstanding which together presents Tora-Tora-Tora as it should be seen and heard. The disc has both American and Japan versions with the japan version longer with additional scenes. But I found the \\"extras\\"....the documentry and the making of Tora-Tora-Tora really intriguing and with some interesting facts. There's a gallery with various stills from behind the camera, actors and sets. Some interviews with those ho were actually there that day. Want to know how they did the ships and get all those planes....it's there.<br /><br />Tora-Tora-Tora is not full of masterful CGI effects, wow you with a great hollywood story or be used as some reference material to show off your HT to friends. What it IS, is a solid good cross of movie & documentry that's as close as you'll get to the real protrayal of Pearl Harbor without some added love story or CGI effect thrown in. It will leave you asking a lot of \\"what if's\\". I would be all for it if someone wanted to do a remake of Tora-Tora-Tora with today's wizardry in film but I fear political correctness would ruin it's facts and history. For a war, history buff or the those facinated with the history of that infamous Decmber 7th at Pearl Harbor, it's a must buy.<br /><br />Kenny J
1401937268|4.0|These cards are very nice. I just received them in the mail yesterday, and I have had a couple of very good spreads already. The pictures are very nice and the messages I receive from them stand out in a way that some other cards can't for me. I like the little notes on the bottom, giving a brief description about the card, little hints, but later on I can perceive there being an issue with them. The cards are very big though, way to big for my hands. These are the biggest cards I have owned. I do believe these will be a great help to new beginners entering the craft, the hints and pictures are great tools.<br />Pros: Great hints, very nice pictures, good for beginners<br />Cons: Cards are very big

0545265355|5.0|Unless you live under a rock, you have heard of the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.<br />They recently made a decent movie out of the first book. Like in What came after, the books describe a near-future dystopia where war and oppression have reduced humanity to few towns supporting a relatively wealthy capital. What I found interesting in these novels, is how the main character (Katniss) is an anarchist. That is, she cares for those she love (her tribe), but she is rather immune to big ideas and propaganda. This becomes clearer as the story progresses, and many people have hated the ending for this reason.
0802473156|5.0|This book was given to me when I was a teenager going through one of my first relationships. I think it is a great book for young people because it teaches them how to love practically! The book teaches you how to be open to reaching a consensus with your partner in day to day life by recognizing each others personal needs. It allows you to come up with simple practical solutions on how to make each other feel fulfilled in love by helping you recognize what the other person needs from you and allowing you to recognize what you need from your partner.

0385738773|5.0|As the final book in James Dashners The Maze Runner trilogy, i was disappointed.  Not, of course in the book, but the fact that it is over. This book was almost more suspense than I could handle, but I managed.  This book, also, I don't believe I set down once.  It kept me up late at night ( which my mother did not find at all pleasing considering the fact of I had school at six in the morning...) and I absolutely loved it.  James Dashner is clear about everything, but still seems able to leave it up to your imagination.  With many twists and thrilling events, I think this was a great ending to a great trilogy.  The ending of the book didn't suck either( You know how that goes-- you read the final book in a series, and the ending makes you furious).  Of course, there was still that feeling of remorse that the adventure was over.  If you love action, sci-fi, amazing writing, and enough suspense to make your heart explode, then these are the books for you!<br /><br />Watch out for the prequel, coming out in August of 2012: The Kill Order<br /><br />~ Willow Naveen ¢¾<br /><br />Overall Rating: ¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;¢&Agrave;  (This review originally posted at Brazen Broads Book Bash)
B007PS0X0W|5.0|I have to admit my expectations were low after watching Rise of the Lycans. Underworld Awakening was not only action packed from beginning to end, the movie encompossed a great plot with some nice surprises and a well written script I might add. Selene is one the sexiest vampires in my book. Very entertaining. Loved it from beginning to end.<br /><br />P.S. Dont forget to watch the blooper scenes when you've finished viewing the movie.

Chris has put together an excellent read and an even better resource for getting your idea off the ground.

For anyone who's curious, I recommend you let these ideas into your head. You'll never be the same.
0345803485|2.0|Anyone actually into BDSM wouldn't have lasted 5 pages into this book. Absolutely no credibility, and the writer obviously didn't do her research.

0345803485|1.0|This was one of the worst books (I read all 3 volumes) that I have read. I kept on reading volume after volume in the hope that I would reach some kind of plot and story line. To no avail! I enjoy erotic literature like any other person. I have enjoyed Jackie Collins and Harold Robins. But, in this case, it was so frequent and so tiresome that I started fast forwarding the sex scenes. Even chocoholics get tired of eating chocolate if they work in a candy factory! Get real! As far as the rest of the book... it was tiresome. How many times do we have to read about them calling each other Mr or Mrs. Grey? Enough already! Lines like \\"you look mighty fine to me\\" were repeated way too often. How can a genius level CEO run a company when he is spending his time either having sex, thinking about sex, stalking his wife, or exchanging e-mails with his wife? It is clear from the book Anastasia never got a chance to work due to non stop interruptions by her husband or by her own erotic thinking! By the way, I also found a few mistakes (transposed words) that were not caught by the editor! All and all, that was a waste of my $$ and time. This was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It read the way a housewife/wanna be writer would dabble with writing.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|The cast, the filming, the dialogue...what's not to like about it? Although it is a little long. Though, overall it's an absolutely great movie and so convenient that you can rent it here.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|This is one of the most exciting books I've read in a long time. It started off being a very interesting book, then just after half way through I found that I *had to* know what was going to happen and couldn't put it down (until I finished a few hours later at 1am!).<br /><br />The book is a psychological thriller and tells the story of a lady who has lost her short term memory and cannot remember anything from the days before when she wakes up each day. When she wakes up in the morning she thinks she is in her twenties and doesn't know her husband lying next to her in bed.<br /><br />It's hard to say anything more without giving away anything, but the book is written in a very compelling way with excellent character development. It could have easily been boring, reading about this woman getting up each day and discovering yet again that she had forgotten everything, but the author managed to keep it interesting and a little bit creepy at the same time.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love the whole series, but this movie was very... off.Though I did like the story and I LOVE Kate Beckinsale this film over all left something to be desired. It was like when you read a book series and there is that one book that they throw in there just to keep the story going but really it could have been condensed to fit in the previous book, and when its over you're like \\"ok well i'm glad that I now have that information but where is the rest of the story?\\" thats pretty much how i felt about this movie, also the effects were a bit off and I struggled with the look alike Michael character. I am hoping for another movie with Scott Speedman back as Michael Corvin. So bottom line is that its worth watching but it takes a real underworld fan to give this movie a 5 star review.
B0079J28NC|2.0|I am sadden to read that the release of this will not include the VH1 1999 Special where the remaining  Beatles dicuss Yellow Submarine for those whom may not be aware it was VH1 Special on the re-released of the Yellow Submarine film, this special showed behind the scenes of the producing of the movie, and containd with new interviews with the three surviving beatles Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, among others who produced the movie!<br />Next is why did they place a new voice over on the trailer?<br />A huge crying shame is they also did not include the BBC doumentary about the film.  This is simply a shame they dropped the ball on this. I ill buy this and I love the Bealtes forever.  Who is in charge here?

B0049JPU8A|4.0|This is a rocky album. Not in the 'it rocks' meaning of the word, but more in the sense that The Script deals with upheaval in love and politics. The trio of Dubliners waste no time in going for the gut with the opening \\"You Won't Feel a Thing,\\" which deals more with the austerity measures that Ireland is going through than a breakup. These former boy-banders have more on their mind than getting the girl; U2 echoes throughout \\"Science and Faith.\\"<br /><br />Too bad that \\"You Won't Feel A Thing\\" is the best song here. The Script know their way around solid melodies and good hooks, but they are smoothies from the school that also includes OneRepublic (they used to work with Ryan Tedder as producers), Snow Patrol and even Coldplay. The single \\"Walk Away\\" does make for good radio fodder, and the fine \\"This = Love\\" being the only song that really breaks the formula. Heck, \\"Walk Away\\" even features a rap cameo from B.o.B. in the 'everyone else is doing it' category. If you get the extended version, you'll likely enjoy the piano based and rapless version more, if only for the reason that the rap version sounds more of the moment than of the band.<br /><br />That said, \\"Science and Faith\\" is pretty decent overall. There are moments that suggest The Script could break the rut and maybe find their way into Coldplay's creativity or (if they were willing to get away from the over-production) Maroon 5's pop-soul. Just too many times on \\"Science and Faith,\\" you keep wishing for the big payoff when all you get are little fireworks of inspiration.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|this app is really wearer I love the bible and am a Christian but this 1 does not work right you have to do all this e-mail and stufff and there is no wed sight I looked it up excatly so I would recommend getting an offline Bible so you can use it in in church and stuff so I got the open Bible with a ring over it I think it works better happy Bible reading :D
B005HXGEDC|3.0|Like so many older artists, Pater Gabriel has ideas about his older works. For some reason, those wonderful, ingrained and intensely personal songs from your life (and his career) need to be re-imagined. \\"New Blood\\" takes 13 songs, orchestrates them (think the \\"Scratch My Back\\" CD), and submits them for our consumption. It's pretty grand sounding music, cinematic and broad. But when you think of how a song like \\"In Your Eyes\\" wove such a spell the first time you heard it, this version will leave you with a tepid feeling.<br /><br />So let's look at the songs that gain from the treatment. \\"Mercy Street\\" and \\"San Jacinto\\" gain in scope, while \\"Intruder\\" becomes a whole new menace. That's three. Then there's the songs that give you a serious dose of WTF. \\"Solisbury Hill\\" was as perfect a song as Gabriel has ever written, and the new version all but made me grind my teeth. \\"The Rhythm Of The Heat\\" has the word 'rhythm' in the freaking title, so taking away the drums functionally neuters that song. Same for \\"Red rain\\" - all the drama is sucked out.<br /><br />Which leaves the rest of the album in a holding pattern, with a bonus point for not forcing us to listen to \\"Biko\\" one more time. Also, \\"Up\\" is already a ten year old album. \\"New Blood\\" is making me wonder if Gabriel, like David Bowie, has hit a dry well. Bowie is at least sitting his time out, \\"New Blood\\" is mediocre enough to make me think maybe Peter Gabriel should give consideration to a similar spell.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Took a while to get the story to move but once it did I couldn't put it down. I did feel that the author went into far too much unnecessary detail. Having not read the other two books in the series I could be wrong about that.

Nice when it comes time for a campfire, and find out your Zippo is dry! No problem.

I highly recomend product.

0525478817|5.0|I just finished* it today. I'm hesitant to recommend this book to many people, but only because I think many people really don't want to spend their free time reading about dying children. Which is understandable. But it's really, really good. Certainly, everyone who knows a kid with a terminal disease should have to read this, and a lot of other people should read it, anyway.<br /><br />Both main characters (the boy and the girl) are thoughtful and funny and sharp and witty and cynical, and they make the story delightful to read. Well, 'delightful' insofar as a book about kids with terminal cancer can be delightful. 'Delightful' in a way that leaves you crying for an hour. But delightful nonetheless.<br /><br />It's young adult fiction, but written in a way that that recognizes the 'adult' in 'young adult,' and doesn't underestimate their capacity for nuance, intellect, and emotion. It reminds me of the Maurice Sendak quote \\"what is too often overlooked...is the fact that from their earliest years children live on familiar terms with disrupting emotions, fear and anxiety are an intrinsic part of their everyday lives, they continually cope with frustrations as best they can. And it is through fantasy that children achieve catharsis.\\"<br /><br />The protagonist, Hazel Grace, is simultaneously wise and angsty, though much more of the former than the latter. This very precociousness is what makes the book so wonderful to read--she comes out with casual gems of wisdom that set this adult reader back on her heels. But while she refers to herself as a 'kid' and a 'child' throughout the book, you are hard pressed to remember that she is one. This would really strain belief in most books (and it does to an extent here), but you can accept her precociousness if you accept that someone who is unique to begin with, and is then forced to grow up far too fast, could become so sage.  The main male character, Augustus, shows a similar sagacity. He's the kind every bookish teenager(or bookish 20-something) wants to fall in love with. And I can that you will fall in love with him (and that it will make you feel pedophilic, since he's 17).<br /><br />I caught myself about to rate it 4 stars, but then realized that that was only because it's a little too young-adult for my taste. But I can criticize a book for belonging to its genre. So, in conclusion, this book gets the first star for making me think; the second star for making me feel so keenly; the third star for surprising me with its plot twist; the fourth star for making me skip dinner because I couldn't put it down; and the final fifth star for making me laugh out loud while there were still tears on my face.<br /><br />**also, started

It is erotic fiction, not intended to be real and people who wrote bad reviews based on the story line should realize that the book is fiction. A must read.

B00436GNVC|2.0|Moulded by Bernard Butler (Suede), and with such writers as White and Jimmy Hogarth, Rockferry was a heartfelt, home grown tribute to a faraway era. It exuded charisma and class, and based on this I was expecting great things from Duffy's follow up album. I was so disappointed though.<br /><br />Endlessy is a very different production, derived from a very different process. Endlessly shifts the scene from Britain to the US, and in doing so loses the very talented Lee and Butler in favour of Albert Hammond Sr, who has worked on countless hits for Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.<br /><br />For me though, this just doesn't work. I won't go into every track, but this album never grabbed the heartsrings the way Rockferry did. Endlessly, for the most part, lacks the hearfelt warmth of Rockferry. Whilst perhaps a technically proffecient follow up, it feels hackneyed, and for the most part, just muzak.
B003NX76BM|5.0|love this book  love nr  i am a dog trainer and love them  nora is right they give you unconditional love  the canine search and rescue was great the dog training was great it shows how important it is to send your best friend and the owner to training  the story line was great
B0070TDERU|5.0|Excellent series, wonderful cast, and the settings are breathtaking! The plots are a little obvious but  the actors carry them off with aplomb, especially Maggie Smith
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Heavy duty knife, It wont crack or break and it can take a licking, not the best for deer dressing but a good knife for those tough jobs. Sheath is rubbish I like a leather sheath for a knife like this
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fiction and love containment stories with a mix of the well known 3part hero tale that Hugh tells in his own way so well.<br />I came across this book from a suggestion on Amazon and read it was an omnibus for such a bargain and that it checked all my boxes of awesome that I had to get it. I am a game developer hobbyist and comicbook artist and Wool( all books within the series to) have inspired me to no end. I will be making fan artwork and gamework and will let you know personally when I do Hugh Howey. Bravo for an incredible journey with your characters and I eagerly await more and will begin reading your other works. I am a dedicated fan now.<br /><br />J.Allen

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the series. Definitely some great brain candy. I couldn't put it down until I was done with all three books and still wanted more. Enjoyed the romantic plot with the racy edge- definitely a more enjoyable romance novel. Fell in love with the unpredictable Christian Grey and all of his sexy appeal. A recommended read.
0060574909|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book. If you are working in your business rather than on it you are making a huge mistake. Most people think they can make more money by just grinding out more work. Not so.<br /><br />Solomon Neuhardt

B003WUYP56|3.0|The Trouble with Physics seems a seminal book; written by an important physicist it purports to spill the beans on the current situation in physics and specifically in string theory and the string theory community, which Smolin sees as the bad guys. This isn't hard to figure out why, as he makes it clear that he isn't a string theorist and that his is one of the alternate, competing theories.<br /><br />Smolin could be right about the lack of evidence meaning that string theory is on the wrong track; I'm no expert on these matters not being a physicist myself. However, I note that the alternative theories that Smolin likes better also suffer from a notable lack of empirical evidence. Smolin wants to paint string theory as the 800-pound gorilla bad guy, but the reality is that none of these alternative theories has any support either.<br /><br />I understand that the lack of confirmation is worrisome for the current generation of physicists, all of whom are of course impatient for results and want to get on with their research programs. But one must remember that it has often taken decades or even hundreds of years for new developments in math to find practical application as part of a physical theory, and then to achieve empirical validation.<br /><br />Einstein had to wait 10 years, after many false starts and stops and failed eclipse expeditions, before one finally succeeded and confirmed the bending of light around a star. String theory makes far more esoteric predictions and so it's not surprising to me that it has now been 30 years with no results, but it might take hundreds of years, or it might never happen. We just don't know. I know this troubles contemporary physicists for whom things seem to be at an impasse, but then ideas like alternate universes with different laws and properties than our own are so fantastic that we may never be able to confirm their existence. Certainly it would be nice to confirm more \\"humble\\" predictions like the Higgs boson but as of yet there's no word from the Large Hadron Collider on that. We can hope. But it seems clear that the present and subsequent generations of physicists are going to have a  much tougher time succeeding than their predecessors. All the \\"easy\\" theories have been created and confirmed (as if General Relativity was easy :-)).<br /><br />So far so good; I have no problem with what Smolin has said there. But I have several other problems with the book. The first is that Smolin doesn't give credit for the things that string theory does well, which is to unify the various forces, and to explain where many of the fundamental constants in our universe come from. I note he also, in criticizing string theory, doesn't mention physicists like Stephen Hawking, Stephen Weinberg, and Lisa Randall, none of whom are string theorists, and all more important physicists than Smolin himself, and all of whom have said that string theory is on the right track.<br /><br />The second is that I agree with another reviewer here who has commented on this, Scott Locklin, which is the problem of aesthetics. I've thought about this myself and agree with Dr. Locklin (he has a Ph.D. in physics which I don't) that aesthetics has no place in physical theory. The only reason Smolin likes quantum gravity better than string theory is for aesthetic reasons. Quantum theory is a good example. It's just a butt-ugly theory that only a mother physicist could love, but it works. The Standard Model is well established and confirmed and I don't think that's likely to change no matter what happens in the future with string theory.<br /><br />It's the same with the Nobel Prize. You don't get the Nobel for dreaming up another beautiful theory. The history of science is filled with great theories, even beautiful theories, that were killed by nasty little facts. You get the Nobel Prize for being right which I agree is how it should be.<br /><br />The third problem is that the title of the book is very misleading. Ofcourse this might have to do more with the marketing realties but anyway physics in general is not in any particular trouble; in fact it's doing quite well. The book really only pertains to theoretical physics, which only a handful of physicists actually work in. Most physicists these days find work in more applied areas such as the dozens of areas of applied  physics, high level engineering, technology, and even the financial world, where advances over the last 20 years in many fields, from solid state physics to materials science to electrical engineering, have been substantial. In fact, most physicists don't want to work in theoretical physics; the breakthroughs are few and far between, it's difficult to get confirmation, and the odds that one will make any substantive contribution in one's life time are slight, not to mention the fact that the pay is poor. These days many physicists work in private industry where they can make much more. I know several physicists all of whom were well off enough to retire in their early 50s because of their inventions or the stock options they received back in the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />The fourth problem is the allegations Smolin makes about a systemic bias against women and minorities in physics. I find this very unlikely. Although not a physicist myself, I've been around physicists all my life, and one of my relatives was a Nobel Laureate in physics. Physicists as a group are among the most liberal people anywhere. Even if there are a few who aren't, you would have trouble finding another group less prone to such bias. There might be a few physicists here and there, but that does not translate to a general bias in the physics community as a whole which is what Smolin is claiming. Distorted claims like this just cast doubt on the overall objectivity of the rest of the book.<br /><br />On the good side, I did learn something about the details of  string theory and the competing theories such as Smolin's. However, for me the book is marred by some clearly exaggerated and dubious claims and the same lack of objectivity that Smolin says affects the entire physics community.course this might have to do more with the marketing realties but anyway physics in general is not in any particular trouble; in fact it's doing quite well.

B005VPRF9I|5.0|Product arrived just as expected, and was exactly as described.  We weren't aware this item was going to be shipped from Germany when we ordered it, so that justified the time it took to receive the product.  Besides, it was fun helping my son (who we ordered the item for) learn that his new toy came from halfway around the world, just for him.  He loved that!  Thank you!

B001B6PBBK|1.0|Horrible movie; made myself sit through fifteen minutes, waste of time.  Why this movie got almost 4 stars is beyond me.  This movie should have just been called Disaster.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|Great Album....bad reviewer. Love alot songs on this one, but my favorite is this love. They even got more brutal with the next Album \\"Far Beyond Driven\\". RIP Dimebag.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this book for my Kindle after seeing and reading \\"The Hunger Games\\", which I thought was amazing.  Well, \\"Catching Fire\\" was every bit as good... if not better.  It resulted in me buying the third book the day after I finished this one... and I'm NOT a big reader at all!  I just had to know what happened next.  The book moves along at a steady pace which kept me from being able to put it down, whch resulted in a quick read. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun game yesterday I pladed for 3 hours straight it is the best I only have 5 levels. left
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I haven't been inspired to write up an Amazon review in a while but I must say I am very pleased with \\"Shape Shifter\\". This is the Santana I grew up listening to, not the glorified session musician that backed up a bunch of third rate pop stars. The music is as inspired as ever and a true joy to listen to. If you're a fan of Santana, it belongs in your library.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|I caved.<br /><br />I mean, I was never a fan of the cartoon series or the action figures as a kid and so the idea of Transformers on the big screen way back in 2007 wasn't something I was salivating over.  Still; I kind of loved it.  The first film was fun and fresh and witty and it just felt right.  The second film was a mess.  I kind of hated it.  It had its moments, but overall it just felt forced and overstuffed and messy.  `Transformers: Dark of the Moon' looked promising and then again, it suffered from a barrage of nasty reviews that kept me from giving it a shot; until last night.<br /><br />I caved.<br /><br />I said that already.<br /><br />Here's the thing.  The acting is horrible.  The action is chaotic and stuffy and Michael Bay still has no idea how to edit.  I seriously fell asleep during the films horrifically elongated closing battle.  It was ridiculous.  Sure, the effects are spectacular and are probably the best in the series, but there is such a thing as too much and Bay doesn't know when to stop.  It just kept going and going and once you've seen one overlong battle sequence you've seen them all.  Bay should have trimmed it down a bit and maybe injected something unique instead of regurgitation.<br /><br />Shia is charming and is becoming his own actor.  This is the worst of his latest performances, but that's because the character is written stupidly.  The rest of the characters are mere stereotypes and serve no purpose.  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is hot...I mean REALLY hot, but everytime she's on the screen Michael Bay apparently thinks he's filming a music video.  Her introduction scene was retarded.  The rest of the cast is also surprisingly horrific.  John Tuturro thinks he's Al Pacino all of a sudden, and Al Pacino isn't even good at playing Al Pacino.  Frances McDormand must have had a big fight with her hubby, because she is so above this tripe.  Tyrese and Josh are here for their muscles and Dempsey has no point being here.  John Malkovich reenters his annoying habits for this film.  Yuck, and then there is Ken Jeong.<br /><br />Just...NO.<br /><br />The plot, while something `new' seems reminiscent of the previous films and the twist is one you saw coming a mile away.  The ending was also baffling.  The film literally just ends.  It felt off, severely.  I hated the voice over too.  Are we that stupid?  Don't answer that.  I also find the way the transformers talk to one another to be annoying over time.  The fact that they have to explain everything like we're all kindergarteners is just `eye-rolling'.<br /><br />Yeah, this movie was terrible.  It honestly put me in a bad mood last night.vich reenters his annoying habits for this film.

B000001ES9|5.0|As others have mentioned, this is not your standard Rush album.  No Neil Peart, no 20 minute songs, no sci-fi lyrics.  What's left?  Some great Led Zeppelin style rock 'n roll.  Alex is on fire, Geddy's vocals and bass are top-notch and John Rutsey's drums are more than solid.  Start to finish it's a great record.  Working Man is certainly the most famous, but Finding My Way also gets some airplay every now and again.  In the interest of full disclosure, I like Rush okay but don't have the patience to listen to any of their albums straight through - except this one.  If the 2112/Moving Pictures Rush is more your cup of tea, you may not love this album.  However, if standard Rush is a little \\"out there\\" for you, this may be just what you need.  Probably not the best place to start when creating a Rush collection, but essential for sure.  Play loud.
0061146307|5.0|The Unfortunate Events<br /><br />  This enthralling and adventurous book will have you captured inside a series of unfortunate events with the wealthy Baudelaire children. It all starts on a crisp morning at the beach, when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny hear the shocking news of their dead parents from a close friend, Mr. Poe. After staying with Mr. Poe's barbaric family for a while, Count Olaf, a supposedly old \\"relative\\", takes the children under his wing. Count Olaf is a treacherous man. While secretly planning to over- take the Baudelaire fortune, Count Olaf gets ready to act in a play called \\"The Marvelous Marriage\\". With extremely useful talents: Violet- inventing, Klaus- reading, and Sunny- biting, the Baudelaire children just might figure out his plan. All of the sudden, Count Olaf asks Violet to act as his bride in \\"The Marvelous Marriage\\", but will Violet be acting or will she and Count Olaf legally bind?<br />  By: Rebecca L.

I can't remember most of the books but for whatever reason I loved this book so much that I remember it and bought a copy for a friend of mine when she was feeling down. I think the message is fantastic for girls and boys, though it's an easier sell for girls. She could rescue her prince just as well as a prince normally rescues a princess *and* she didn't have to stay with him when he didn't like her for who she really was. :-)

B005ONTD42|2.0|The previous reviewer that managed to pull 30 minutes of fun out of this ball enjoyed it for half-an-hour more than I did.  I pre-ordered this and was immediately underwhelmed.  The white ball picks up anything and everything it rolls through ( pet hair, dust, etc ) and isn't quite as agile as you might think.  I also had to recalibrate mine far too often.  If this was on sale for $100 less than it retails for I still wouldn't buy it again.  Pick up a remote control car/truck/plane/hovercraft/child with the money you save not buying this and you'll be ahead of those that did.<br /><br />As always, Amazon was great with the return and shipping.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll abashedly admit that there are two things I've never done before. The first is purchase and read the work of an independent author. The second is write a review for a boook on Amazon. I am also not the sort of creature who makes a habit of breaking with precedence. So when I say that this book was absolutely riveting, I do hope it'll carry some weight. I absolutely adored this story, and am gnashing my teeth for more! Please, more HH! I cannot wait

1401235417|4.0|Graphic Novel Review (ARC) by Chris for Book Sake<br />This book does a great job of pitting Batman against a new criminal organization called the Court of Owls. Not only are they masters in martial arts, but they are even more secretive then Batman. They've been creeping around in the criminal underworld, right under Batman's nose. The story does a great job of putting Batman back on his heels and sets up an even larger struggle to come.<br /><br />Greg Capullo's art in this book with full of energy. He does take some allowances with the look of certain villains that may not sit right with some fans. However, they only play a small part to the introduction of the Owls, who look utterly awesome. Sometimes his art feels a little cartoony for the dark nature of the book, but other times it is spot on.<br /><br />If you are a Batman fan or have been wanting to start reading, this is a great jumping on point.<br />Book Rating: 4 /5<br /><br />Graphic Novel Review (ARC) by Kole for Book Sake<br />This version of Batman is pretty good. It has a different story from all the other Batman stories and a new villain. But it has really no back story to it. Can you really call this part of the \\"new 52\\"? Anyone who doesn't know who Batman is or the back story on him is going to pick this up and ask \\"what the hell is going on and who is this crazy guy in a bat costume?\\"  But from the perspective of someone who has read Batman before and knows the back story, it's a great read. It's a fresh new problem for Batman to overcome. So my advice, if you haven't read Batman, don't read this as a start. Go back and read some actual origin stories of Batman.<br />Book Rating: 4/5
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Nice fun graphics and fluid gameplay. Perfect to pick up and play without having to learn it first. Having coins you purchase is kind of lame.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read the entire trilogy and kept thinking that the ending would explain more about abuse that lead up to the sexual addiction. It was obvious there was early severe chldhood emotional damage and then the abuse suffered by the teenage \\"Grey\\" at the hands of an adult woman. That needed to be explained more thoroughly to the reader. The author went into every act of sexual deviance and not enough about the  childhood pain the character experienced.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I cannot emphasize this enough: get the deluxe edition! For an extra $2 you get 3 more awesome songs. It is SO worth it! [[ASIN:B006MVJ2L4 Trespassing (Deluxe)]]<br /><br />Here is the review I wrote for the deluxe edition of Trespassing:<br /><br />\\"Even if you're currently a non-fan, this album will blow you away!!\\"<br /><br />(I didn't intend for this to be so long, but I hope it is useful for non-fans and casual listeners. :-) And no, I don't work for Adam or RCA! LOL)<br /><br />My cd arrives today, but I've spent the last week listening to the online stream. Until now, I've never heard an album where EVERY single song is awesome. My reactions to each track range from \\"I love this song\\" to \\"OMG I'm gonna faint!\\" Enthusiastic track-by-track reviews from reputable publications/blogs are cropping up everywhere. I've not seen any reviews that weren't positive. (With the exception of one shockingly homophobic rant. I won't say which site because they don't deserve hits.)I've seen several reviews that actually had a disclaimer that the reviewer was a non-fan but was happily converted by this amazing album.<br /><br />The first 7 songs are exhilarating dance pop hits. \\"Trespassing\\" is all attitude and swagger; \\"Cuckoo\\" is a 'lets get crazy' dance party; \\"Shady\\" is naughty and absolutely funkaliscious; \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\" is a joyous celebration of life with soaring vocals; \\"Kickin' In\\" is an ode to the intoxication of the clubbing scene; \\"Naked Love\\" is an infectious, playful romp that's easy to sing along to; \\"Pop That Lock\\", about claiming your power, escalates to a bombastic blow-the-lid-off jam session.<br /><br />The energy of the second half of the album shifts to mid-tempo songs and ballads that are soulful and personal. \\"Better Than I Know Myself\\", which is about seeking reconciliation between the light and dark sides of self, is a great transition piece with a balance between slower, emotional verses and a more energetic chorus; \\"Broken English\\", about thefrustration of communication problems, is a powerful, slow burn and some parts remind me of George Michael's heavier ballads; \\"Underneath\\" will rip your guts out. Achingly beautiful and deeply personal, it ebbs and flows between quiet vulnerability and a powerful demanding cry. Only Adam has the skill and artistry to pull off a song so emotional and vocally demanding; \\"Chokehold\\", about the addictive nature of a toxic relationship, has a throbbing beat and is both dark and hauntingly sensual; The standard album closes with \\"Outlaws of Love\\", a stripped down heartbreaker that also highlights Adam's incredible voice. It is a soulful lament inspired by the struggle for GLBT acceptance, but it captures the pain of anyone in a relationship that is unfairly condemned.<br /><br />The deluxe album includes 3 bonus tracks. Trust me, these gems are well worth the extra $2. \\"Runnin'\\", an intense, pounding plea for the strength to take command of a life that is dysfunctional and out of control, is utterly spellbinding - Adam uses his rarely-heard low register and soars almost 3 breathtaking octaves. \\"Take Back\\", also more up-tempo than other ballads, is filled with energetic frustration and the painful regret of a crumbling relationship. The rhythmic vocal embellishments are at times hypnotic, but in a very good way. \\"Nirvana\\", about the spiritual beauty of love, is a beautiful, etherial lullaby and perfect to close the emotional journey of this album. Adam's voice is both exhilarating and calming.<br /><br />Unlike most albums that are just a couple singles with filler, Trespassing is an amazing, cohesive work of art. With the impressive soaring vocals and the maturity and depth of the song writing, one could call this pop music for grown-ups. There are many A-list collaborators, but Adam is the glue that binds it together - he was executive producer and co-wrote 12 of the 15 songs. I urge you to invest in the album, don't just cherry-pick and download individual tracks. I agree with many reviewers that if Trespassing can just get enough exposure, it could easily be Album of the year.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|I bought this because I couldn't stand the Trident Kracken II case that I started with. Way too bulky! The Amazon case is everything I expected..  Easy to install.  Looks good.  Effortlessly slips in and out of the pocket.  The screen protector went on easily.
B006OB3K56|2.0|This is what I waited for all these months!?????<br /> 1st of all I would like to say I'm a huge Michael Fassbender fan.HUGE!I was so exited to see this film and I just viewed it and now I am so glad I didn't purchase it as I intended to do without seeing it.He is an excellant actor no doubt and he did all that he could do with what was offered but I still found the film wanting.I get that he is a sex addict I knew all about what the film was supposed to be about and I have seen the trailers.I did empathize with Fassbender's character and I get that this is a real problem for many people and it isn't their fault.I think what annoyed me the most was Mulligan's character,Sissy.I found her character SO unsympathetic!!! And at the end SOOO predictable!I could see the insinuation that there was some kind of troubled past for them but for her to just barge in on his life with no warning,leave him no privacy and screw his married boss practically the moment she arrives I would want to throw her butt to the curb as well!!!I didn't blame Brandon 1 bit for being beyond pissed off!!And then her saying that she was trying to help him!! HOW??By being a prat??!!!She didn't commit ONE unselfish act while she was in his home NOT A ONE!!Yes! She is a parasite!Lord she was irritating!I hated her!And then what she did at the end was even more selfish{typical her} and predictable!!!That is one of the reasons I hated this film.I expected to be blown away but was sadly dissapoited.Oh and as far as her singing also very unimpressed.I'm afraid it would take quite a bit more talent to be booked at a N.Y. club.{She must have diddled the club owner as well as Brandon's boss.}So that as well is not believeable.I guess the last scene insinuates because of her neediness and that act that she commited that he is possibly changing?All I can say is I only wish she finished the job!!{And not the REAL actress mind you I usually love her roles and she is fab.She didn't write this script.}On a good note I loved Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds and even more in Eden Lake although that was hard to watch.But my fav was Fish Tank a must see for his fans.

B007OAAK0O|5.0|I just received my gift of Diana Ross: Live In Central Park and I am thrilled beyond words. I was working across the street from Central Park that night and couldn't attend but saw the crowds running from the rain. I also had to work the next evening thinking about Diana so close.<br /><br />Now I don't have to wait any longer! My partner bought this magnificent DVD which has beautifully written liner notes by Diana that are heartfelt and sincere. This is a must have concert event for anyone who loves Diana's voice, performance and style. You also get to see NY's magnificent Central Park.<br /><br />For added pleasure may I suggest that you also order [[ASIN:B006ISJQ3K Diana Ross 1976: Special Edition]]<br /><br />Enjoy again and again!
B007SGM084|1.0|i to need to agree with the price gouging of kindle books! why should it cost more for a download than paperbacks? it makes me made that cause the books were suposed to be a better deal: no mold,save on space,storage and cost. but a don't see that at all! so thank goodness for free books on other sites! but i'd rather do all my buying through amazon,not finding other books then it directs me back to amazon for the deals! why should a book cost $14.99? when paperback at walmart is $5.49 or less for the NEW BOOK!!! i got the kindle thinking all that, but what a ripoff 98% of the time.

B007SSEBCU|3.0|Meryl Streep is really the only reason to watch this movie in my opinion. She makes you believe she really is Margaret Thatcher but otherwise a real snoozer. The other characters are one dimensional and uninteresting.
0756405890|4.0|When I was younger, I used to be a hardcore fan of fantasy. Eventually though, I grew disillusioned with the dozens of High Fantasy novels that were often little better than Lord of the Rings inspired works. Thankfully, my interest in Fantasy was revived when I discovered low fantasy in the form of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire. That led me to try other fantasy novels in a different direction such as the Abercrombie books and finally led me to Rothfuss. While I will admit there is a slight element of Hogwarts in this novel, for the most part it is a unique, exciting world. While there is nothing in particular that sticks out as either extremely amazing or extremely terrible, this novel is a journey one can enjoy because of the realism of the characters, the interesting magical elements, and the unique world. One reads fantasy to relax, to journey without actually leaving their chair, to have some fun in the midst of a busy life dominated by work or school. Thus, it is important to allow yourself to get lost in an interesting world without thinking too much about it, as long as events of interest happen from time to time. On the other hand, you want a different type of world each time, because repetition could become tiresome. Despite the fact that they are sometimes corny, it is important to have a main character who speaks with his own distinct voice, who has emotions, doubts, ups and downs- in short, it is important to have make the intimate acquaintance with a character or characters for a novel to be enjoyable. Kvothe, like Katniss, is one of these characters. Halfway into the book, you know you want to follow Kvothe and his adventures to the end of the series because he is a compelling and somewhat tragic character.

B00007BH5C|5.0|I must say, that unlike many others, this is my favorite LOTR soundtrack. It features the Rohan Theme (The King of the Golden Hall, Riders of Rohan), as well as many breathtaking battle cues (Forth Eorlingas, Helm's Deep, Isengard Unleashed). It also has The Ent's March Theme (Isengard Unleashed), as well as the most beautiful love theme written in LOTR (Evenstar), an inspiring \\"Breath of Life\\", the breathtaking theme of \\"The White Rider\\" (heard also in Forth Eorlingas) and a really nice song (Gollum's Song). If this is not enough for you, it also has Mordor's Theme (The Uruk-hai, the Black Gate is Closed), the Main Theme in it's full glory (The Uruk-Hai, Forth Eorlingas) and The Fellowship theme heard in the first movie (Samwise the Brave).<br /><br />I mean, ¿How can you top this? For me, the best LOTR soundtrack, if we include the complete recordings, is Return of the King. But if we are talking about the Original Soundtracks, this is definitely the best. And overall, taking in consideration the costs, I would have to say that this has a very fair price compared to any of the Complete Recordings versions. Buy it if you are a soundtrack collector. A true classic.

0345803485|2.0|I have never felt the need to write a review of a book before, but I feel this one warrants it.  I have NO idea how the hype behind this book has reached its current level. The writing is atrocious.  Halfway through the first book I was trying to get into the story but all I can think is WILL SOMEONE GET THIS WOMAN A THESAURUS!!!  I reread the same words/expressions so many times that I found myself getting annoyed and had to put the book down and take a break. And here I ask- bestseller??? How?? Sure, it'll spice up the sex life of some wives that haven't read actual quality erotica, but how it was published in its current state is beyond comprehension.<br />All that being said, somehow Ana is portrayed as sweet,  brazen, innocent and likable while Christian is cold and tough but without coming off as a jerk. Had this particular story been written by someone that has actual writing talent (or if this book had an editor) it would have been much much better. Definitely NOT a five star book. I flush (this word is used 50+ times in the book) with annoyance when I think of how many times I read the word flush in just book one, nevermind two and three.  Ahhh!

I use the headphones every day connected to a Sond CD Walkman while riding my bicycle. They fit great and with my hat on (it always is), they are immovable. That's what I wanted and that is exactly what I received. The sound quality is superb and thoroughly acceptable. I couldn't be more pleased.
031603441X|3.0|I should probably qualify this review by first saying that I don't read many autobiographies (in fact, this may be a first for me). Generally speaking, I'm not very interested in the personal lives of famous people.  I don't care who they are dating or who they've broken up with.  I read Life because I'm a big fan of the Rolling Stones and I'm interested in the music.  As I read my interest fluctuated up and down.  I was interested in how the band came together, their influences, their rise to stardom, the origin of songs, the recording sessions for albums, the creative process, the collaborations with other artists and so on.  My interest waned when it focused on Richard's personal life.<br /><br />The book starts very strong with an entertaining story about a run-in with the law in rural Arkansas during the Some Girls tour, Keith's childhood (which I didn't mind reading about despite my lack of interest in his personal life) and the formation of the band.  The book focuses on the music in the early years providing some interesting insights, how the Glimmer Twins started writing their own music instead of just covering the music of other artists, the genesis of many of the early guitar riffs, and Richard's discovery of `open tuning'.<br /><br />I enjoyed much of the middle section of the book as it covered the period of time when the Stones were at the peak of their powers and recorded many of their best albums.  This section though does get bogged down considerably with tales of drug use and relationship troubles which didn't interest me nearly as much (although others might find it fascinating).<br /><br />The final section of the book really doesn't have much to offer and seems to only be there to complete the time line and bring the reader up to the present day.  Much of it reads like a series of unrelated amusing anecdotes.  For a reader primarily interested in the music, the Stones didn't record anything worth getting excited about after 1982, and as far as that goes, the music was barely mentioned anyway.<br /><br />From my perspective I'd love it if the autobiography of Keith Richards glossed over his personal life and focused almost entirely on the music (up to and including 1981's Tattoo You).  Of course, I recognize that this isn't what most people want.  Most people want to read about the drug use, the drug busts, the court dates, the withdrawal symptoms, the parties, the trashed hotel rooms, the romances, the break ups, the children, the suicides, and the funerals, and everything else that makes up a Life.  So you'll have to take my 3 ½ star rating with a grain of salt I guess.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed this autobiography.  Richards comes across as funny at times and for the most part he's as frank and honest as I think he could be (although I think he has `rationalized' some of his behavior and convinced himself that he wasn't as big an a**hole as he almost certainly was).  I was disappointed that he skimmed over some significant album releases with only a cursory mention and some important songs were completed ignored.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the band, Richards provides some fascinating insight into the music.  For me, I could have done with less of the other stuff but I understand there are millions of people who love it.  This is why it will probably be long time before I read another autobiography.  I'm glad I read this one though.hat goes, the music was barely mentioned anyway.<br /><br />From my perspective I'd love it if the autobiography of Keith Richards glossed over his personal life and focused almost entirely on the music (up to and including 1981's Tattoo You).

0393057240|4.0|I struggled at first with this novel and have to admit, now that I've finished it, I'm surprised by how impressed I am by it and how affected I was.  The most obvious challenge to reading this novel is immediately apparent to anyone who reads the first few lines.  Most of the novel is written in a phonic Scottish slang.  To give you a taste of what's in store, consider these lines from the novel (it wasn't easy to find lines free of profanity):<br /><br />\\"Ma heid's gaun doon.  It jerks up so suddenly and violently, ah feel it's gaunne fly oaf ma shoulders ontae the lap of the testy auld boot in front ay us.  Ah hauld it firmly in baith hands, elbays oan ma knees.\\"<br /><br />It takes a few dozen pages but if you stick with it, comprehension becomes second nature.  (Translated it says: \\"My head goes down.  It jerks up so suddenly and violently, I feel it's going to fly off my shoulders onto the lap of the testy old woman in front of me.  I hold it firmly in both hands, elbows on my knees.\\")<br /><br />The second challenge is that the novel contains a large number of characters, some of which appear (and even narrate) a single chapter, never to appear again (or only fleetingly).  Most chapters are written in the first person by our protagonist Renton (aka Rents) but other chapters are written in the first person by other characters (sometimes very secondary ones) or in the third person.  With each chapter it takes a while to determine whose head you're inside.  It appears to be deliberately confusing - as if the novel were written by a foul-mouthed Scottish Faulkner.<br /><br />The third challenge is that the novel lacks a coherent plot.  It can more aptly be described as a random collection of stories, anecdotes, and introspections.  I have to admit that for the first 100 or so pages, I struggled with the novel's disjointed flow.  The novel lacks a logical link between each chapter and never really builds momentum.  Instead it's like a series of snapshots of moments in time.  The overall effect of these snapshots doesn't take the shape of a story with a beginning, middle and an end - but it does provide a better understanding of the nature of drug addiction.<br /><br />The fourth challenge wasn't really a challenge for me but I can see others having trouble with it.  I recently watched the movie to compare it to the novel and the most obvious difference is that the movie (aside from dramatically reducing the number of characters) makes at least some of the characters likeable.  Not so with the novel.  The characters in this novel have little or no redeeming qualities.  I have no qualms with this, but I know a lot of people have trouble reading novels where they dislike every character in the book.<br /><br />So all in all, this doesn't sound like a very positive review.  It's hard to decipher, it has too many characters, lacks a plot, and features some of the most unpleasant characters you're likely to ever read about.  What's not to love?  Strangely though, the cumulative impact of the novel is unexpectantly affecting.  The novel explores what it means to be Scottish - a nation, the novel argues, that lacks a true national identity and is ripe with self-loathing (Rents calls it a country colonized by wankers).  It explores the values of Generation X (my generation) and its rejection (by a large cohort at least) of their parents values (go to school, get a job, get married, have kids, buy stuff, watch television) but this rejection isn't replaced with anything except an aimless cycle of self-destruction.<br /><br />And of course the novel explores the nature of addiction. The novel portrays the causes of drug use and what sustains addiction in its many forms. Much of the novel focuses on Renton's multiple attempts to kick the habit and his subsequent relapses.  It illustrates the risks of drug use from AIDS to overdoses, but more powerfully portrays the extreme degradation addicts will subject themselves to to get high.<br /><br />I like the ambiguity of the ending and the symbolism of Renton's betrayal of his friends.  This is a novel that evokes adjectives: disturbing, repulsive, hilarious, poignant, insightful, powerful....  Yes, the novel has its flaws but I'm glad I read it.  It had an impact on me and I'm not likely to forget the images it created in my mind anytime soon.br />I like the ambiguity of the ending and the symbolism of Renton's betrayal of his friends.

Don't buy this movie in other words.

B007HJ84ZK|2.0|I love the show and easily give it four stars. My problem is that the digital version does not appear to have the same special features as the DVD version. This is something I care very much about so I cannot recommend this version of a fine television series.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good story line, Strong female character, a little strange when it comes to the sci-fi, but aspects were kind of neat, but loved the romantic or longing for love . . .
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I ordered this book based on a review in the paper. Bad Choice!!! I didn't finish it.  Shallow, not representative of woman who have really lived through an abusive relationship but a poor literary try to romanticize it, and cheapen these women's experience. Embarrased to note a woman wrote this.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|I was excited to see The Grey.  The premise of the movie sounded awesome and I waited a couple weeks for it to arrive on iTunes as a rental.  When it finally arrived I happily rented it.<br /><br />The movie was pretty formulaic from start to finish and the actions of the wolves seemed a bit exaggerated to me, not realistic, which took away from the film.  The way each person gets picked off one by one and all of them had or acquired injuries that made them easy kills, it was just too cliche in my opinion.  The movie should've been called \\"Bad luck strikes repeatedly, then wolves attack.\\"  It's basically a horror movie in the snow.  You can't even get away from the cheap scare cliche with this movie.<br /><br />Other items that just made it worse...  When you spend 5-10 minutes in freezing water, you're dead.  Instead of immediately building a fire when he got out of the water, Ottway just sat down.  In the next scene he's dry.  The watch with the beacon only seemed to beep when it was given attention by a character (I can't stand the momentary beeping timer/countdown/beacon cliche, it drives me insane).<br /><br />The movie was predictable from beginning to end and was chock full of cliches.  After muddling through the whole film (plodding through cliche land) and getting to the end, we're left to decide who won, the alpha wolf or Ottway.  How frustrating is that?!<br /><br />I had high hopes, but I thought it was terrible.  You've seen it before many times, just in a new package.  One positive note... Liam is a great actor and makes you believe in the character.  The rest is forgettable.

B007G5O3K0|4.0|I have been a fan of a-ha since seeing the Take on Me video in 1986. I even flew to NYC for their final US concerts in 2010. I own all of the a-ha CDs (plus some 12-ince singles on vinyl) and all of Morten's English language solo CDs. When I listened to the entire album the first time through I wasn't impressed. After listening to the entire CD for a week I have fallen in love with it! it is now my favorite Morten solo effort. As other reviewers have mentioned the disc is painfully short at only 10 tracks. The best tracks are at the back half of the disc. Lyrics, in my opinion, have never been the strength of a-ha. For me it was always the vocals and Morten's voice is in fine form on this disc. There are tracks that showcase his impressive vocal range. Since a-ha has disbanded I'll gladly take any solo disc from Morten who for me was the \\"voice of a-ha\\". My favorite tracks are \\"Keep the Sun Away\\", \\"Burn Money Burn\\", \\"When I Reached the Moon\\", \\"just Believe It\\", and the title track, \\"Out of My Hands\\".

B004QK5N5W|1.0|I purchased this for the iPad 3.<br />When I plugged it in it comes up with \\"this accessory not supported\\" and freezes  until I touch screen.<br />Then it works.<br />Plug disconnects rather easily when using and needs to be readjusted and not supported message comes up.<br />I called apple and only thing they could tell is the one listed on their web site has side squeeze releases for male plug side that plugs into iPad. I told them the item number are the same.<br />This is listed as apple authentic, I don't know if it is an older model, but does not function.<br />Went to store and obtained one listed at apple site, packaging is different- store bought is in box, amazon is in bag.<br />I purchased directly from amazon, not one of their sellers, and so expect it to be apple authentic.<br />Tried returning but waited too long.<br />Very disappointed.<br />Just noticed that since I purchased it they have changed tilte to include old version.
0307387178|5.0|What drives a young man to abandon his former life completely? In April of 1992, a young man named Christopher J. McCandless donated his entire savings to charity, burned most of his possessions, packed up his yellow Datsun to reinvent a whole new identity for himself.  In the book \\"Into the Wild,\\" the author, Jon Krakauer, helps the reader understand the mind of Christopher McCandless.  Through-out the book the author touches on his own life experiences.<br /> The reasons are unbeknownst to his parents Walt and Billie and a sister Carine with whom he was extremely close.  He was a man of intelligence and fierce ideals.  It seemed Chris McCandless was driven at a young age.  He seemed to be especially hard on himself and set the bar high.  He, unlike most was willing to live out his dreams and ideals no matter what the cost.<br /> Into the Wild begins with Alex, the moniker he invented to disappear if you will stumbling upon Jim Gallien hitching in Fairbanks, Alaska.  This would be Alex's final and ultimate adventure.  Gallien picked him up and agreed to drive him to Denali National Park en route to the Stampede Trail.  He thought Alex was \\"another delusional visitor to the Alaska frontier.\\"  But like most people who met him at first Alex seemed to win them over as thoughtful and intelligent.  He was not some wild flake trying to get lost in the wilderness to escape societies pliers.<br /> One of the things main things that affected me when reading this book is the impact Chris McCandless had on the people he came across in his two plus years tramping.  It's awe-inspiring to witness anyone living out their dreams in our society that go against the norm especially against one's parents.  It was apparent to anyone who had gotten close to Alex that he was struggling hard with his parents materialistic ways.  He was especially offended when they offered to buy him a new car for his college graduation demanding that his used Datsun was more than sufficient; that he worked hard to buy that car he had since high school, the car that brought him to Miami then across the country without a single problem.<br /> Overall, I felt the book was an easy read.  The story of this man's life is compelling and intriguing to readers of all age groups.
0439023491|5.0|About the Book:<br />In the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy, Katniss is forced to keep up appearances for the Capital to make them believe that she and Peeta are in love. She is also told by President Snow himself to make it so convincing so that the riots in the districts will cease. However, riots and President Snow aren't the only things Katniss has to worry about. This year's Hunger Games has a twist. This year the tributes won't be new but past victors. This year Katniss will be playing the Hunger Games ... again.<br /><br />Review:<br />While the first book was good, this one was even better. Collins continues to work her magic. I did not want to put this book down. Catching Fire was quite the entertainment and had several surprises appear. Again, Collins managed to capture several parts within my mind, parts that burned brightly for weeks on end. I could feel the sickening clench in my stomach when she described Snow's overpowering smell of blood and roses, leaving  a sense of unease any time he came into play.<br /><br />Collins also introduces new characters in this novel, and they are just as intriguing as the others. Not only that, but we get to see more deeply into the characters we have already come to know, along with how each one reacts to the Capital's tyranny.<br /><br />Without giving away spoilers, all I can really think to say is that Collins has produced another fabulous read. It's entertaining and shocking, and she manages to show the coldness of President Snow's  that left me with a sense of wrongness. If you liked The Hunger Games, you're bound to like Catching Fire even more. It holds all the thrills of the first book, but with a whole other layer to enjoy.

0345803493|5.0|I am not a big reader at all but when I read Fifty Shades of Grey I was compeltely invested in the book and the charectors. I barely could put it down and finsihed it in record time. Well, book two of the trilogy does not disappoint!! I actually think it is better then the first book. Its so encapturing of all your feelings and thoughts. I love the writting style and the way we get glimpses into Ana's inner goddess and thoughts. I can't wait to read book three. Hope she write more as I don't want it to end!!!

B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|I've learned by now to pretty much never trust the critics.  They end up giving really low reviews to most movies I find entertaining, and really high reviews to most movies that I end up thinking are really boring (of course there are many exceptions to that rule).  This is one movie that I was hoping the general positive reviews from critics wouldn't ruin, and while for the most part I liked it, there was just a lot that was missing from it, or that felt out of place.  It has an awesome cast, and Gina Carano is incredible in it, but there were a lot of scenes that just...needed something.<br />The fight scenes, while well choreographed (I know that she's an MMA fighter and an excellent athlete, but she still makes it all look so easy), needed some music or better sound effects to emphasize the urgency of the fights.  They looked really cool, but they just weren't as exciting as they should have been.  They needed an additional something to draw me into the moment.<br />Another element that could use some work was the music.  For some reason, while watching this, I was reminded of a 70's cop show, and it ended up just feeling a bit out of place, since the movie takes place in a modern day setting.<br />For the most part, I like Steven Soderbergh, but now I'm going to have to go back and re-watch the Ocean's movies to see if there were similar items that would have bugged me (although those movies really weren't action flicks, since they were about con men and thieves).<br />I hope that we see more of her soon in something that takes advantage of both her athleticism and her natural good looks.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|The Adam Lambert \\"Trespassing\\" album (which the fans have been long awaiting) was definitely worth the frustration of the debut delays.  Every song is a pop masterpiece and can stand on its own. \\"Trespassing\\" is an incredible anthemic song championing individuality.  \\"Chokehold\\" is such a silky atmospheric sound it just oozes in your ears.  No way you can sit still when \\"Kickin' In\\" is playing --it literally forces you up on the dance floor (or your living room floor).  \\"Shady\\" is such a great collaboration with Sam Sparrow and Nile Rodgers---love the bridge.  What do you say about \\"Underneath\\" or \\"Outlaws of Love\\" except they are emotional and powerful--both deserve a Grammy Nod.  Love the chorus of \\"Broken English\\" and \\"Cuckoo\\".  \\"Pop that Lock\\" shows the vocal gymnastic ability of Adam Lambert's voice.  \\"Naked Love\\" is going to definitely be a crowd pleaser when he performs live.  Who would think \\"Runnin'\\" which was an add on to the album would be so great.  Bottom line is this album rivals any of the No.ONE Pop Albums past and present.  The voice of Adam Lambert is one to be reckoned with --it is so amazing that he will even sound better when he performs these songs live.  Already heard him on the Kimmel Show, GMA Show and IHEARTRADIO concert--proof that he sits above so many of the artists out there now who have to be auto tuned to sound half way decent or lip synch their songs when they perform live.  Can't wait to see him on tour.  You need to add this album to your collection. Don't forget his single out there now--\\"Never Close Our Eyes\\"--get that on your IPOD too.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I have loved falling asleep to soothing sounds for many years now.  However, the sound machine that I purchased several years ago finally quit working about a year ago.  I could not find another machine that had the sounds I wanted for a reasonable price.  I found this Sleepy Time app while browsing through the apps for my new Kindle Fire.  It has all of the sounds I have loved in the past plus many more!  I just choose which sound I want to fall asleep to, set the length of time, prop my Fire up at the head of my bed, and away I go into dream land.  It was the perfect solution to my dilemma.  If you like to relax to or fall asleep to soothing sounds, this app is for you!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I enjoyed the first book, found the concept compelling and the writing strong.  This book is a clear let down from that.<br /><br />The actual hunger games part is maybe 25% of this book.  The author has the chance, with them visiting the other districts besides 12, to do some interesting things, but basically uses it only to reinforce the brutality of the Capitol.  The new hunger games arena is innovative and exciting, but we spend three days there.  The end is too convenient, too contrived.<br /><br />The revolution has started, but we know nothing new from the end of the first book aside from the existence of the mysterious district 13.<br /><br />All in all, she could have put us in exactly the same spot with 20 pages at the beginning of the third book.  It's not that it's not an entertaining read, it's that it adds little to the tale to be told.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|The popularity of this book and it's  inferior writing is further proof of the rising illiteracy rate in this country. It is a depressing fact that literary agents and publishers are no longer interested in literary fiction of the Jane Smiley and Ann Tyler standard. They<br />By pushing inferior writing on the public, they are conspiring to perpetuate this sad fact.
B004I1WIWU|4.0|Wife had heard Adele on the radio, and downloaded the mp3. I bought the vinyl for her for Xmas. Great. She can easily hear the different sounds of the different studios. I assume this was a digital master, but the vinyl is quiet and has good dynamic range. Love it. Played on a VPI Scout with a Dynavector DV20XH through Plinius 9200 integrated amp. After listening to this record and comparing it to her download, she understands why I like vinyl.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed these books and not just because of the naughtiness of them.  They were well written and story line was really good.  I felt I could really attach myself to the characters in the story. I could have kept reading and hated when I was finished with them.  I heard there may be a movie coming out and I hope it is true!
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|I have thriller on regular CD and on SACD. I am not sure why I bought the 25th anniversary vinyl edition but I did. Buy it. The whole album is great. Human Nature is stunning on this version, if you have a turntable get it.

B004CR5TD0|5.0|This is an example of an album that starts of with great expectations, is met with a reasonable appreciation, and then infiltrates your soul and stands on stilts.  What more can I say?  Listen to it many times on repeat and you will see what I mean.  Not only will the hypnotic melodies capture you, the trance-like reverberations and the provocative, poetic lyrics will speak to you.  It takes a while, but it gets into you. Appreciate this beautifully composed album when your senses aren't competing.  When you can embrace it for what it is... a well poised sound.

0307593312|3.0|I just did something I never do...... A crime against story-telling, really. But when the book is 920 pages longand there's a plot summary online - is it really so bad to forgo the last hundred pages in lieu of slogging through the book?<br /><br />I think the main problem with 1Q84 - the latest release by Haruki Murakami - is that it was originally published as three novels in Japan. For what I'm assuming were marketing and audience reasons, the English-version was released as one giant book - which makes for an uneven arc, and a lot of story repetition in each section. It's the kind of thing that makes you wish you could have read the books in context - because the alternative world that Murakami creates - rife with magical beings, malevolent cable-service fee collectors, cult-leader prophets, and feminist murders - has lots to offer. But as a single - superlong - novel, it drags.<br /><br />The Globe and Mail review sums it up best:<br /><br />\\"Whatever else about 1Q84, it is maximalist Murakami. With its animal allegories and echoes of folk legends, the references to everything from Alice in Wonderland to the Gnostic thinking of Carl Jung, the novel offers the most complete précis of its author's lifelong preoccupations and eccentricities. For fans, the more is the merrier; for newcomers, the book may be a few oddities, and a couple of hundred pages, beyond the patience threshold.\\"<br /><br />Though even as a fan, my patience was sorely tested, to the degree that I've sought out the spoiler and can now move onto other things. This was obviously a new attempt for Murakami - at more than double the length of anything he's previously published - and I find myself hoping that for his next work he will return to more condensed surrealism. A world created within 300 pages is frankly a far greater accomplishment than one which takes 920 to explain.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is great game for all ages. I can't believe that it is free. I recommend it highly exspeacialy for the price......

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought a case for my Fire when I got it.  It was one sold at Target and worked for a while.  Unfortunately it was thick and the section holding the Fire loosened up after a few months rendering it nearly useless.  My wife had the Marware and had never complained about it.  I can see why. The Fire snapped into the case with a solid click and has not shifted since then.  The texture mimics the back of the Fire which I like, not rough but slightly rubberized and easy ro grip.  The elastic strap which holds the thin folding cover on can reverse to hold the cover around back or provide a second \\"notch\\" for a lower stand angle.  This case is light, durable, and perfectly fit.  I love it.
0670023329|4.0|After having been stationed in South Korea on 2 separate occassions 20 years apart I can see the mentality of the South has changed.  This book is very interesting in the fact that this guy was born and raised in a no release camp.  He never missed Freedon because he never had freedom.  Don't want to ruin it for anyone but it seemed redundant at times.  All in all, I enjoyed the book.
B007RAJVR4|3.0|I'm very judicious of each song that makes it into my iPod. Jason Mraz is the only artist that owns his own playlist on my iPod. The playlist currently has 38 tracks (59 total, if you include the live versions), all which I know the lyrics by heart. I attend his shows religiously (3 during his last US tour in Boston, RI, CT). I remember hearing \\"You and I Both\\" and how it almost brought me to tears, then immediately running out to buy Waiting For My Rocket To Come which would eventually wear out my CD player. I get jealous of all the people who got to hear pre-superstar Jason play live at coffee shops in San Diego and get annoyed how all these people seemed to only discover him after \\"I'm Yours\\". He has easily been my favorite artist for the last DECADE.<br /><br />That said...I feel like after my dedication to him over the last 10 years, he kind of let me down. This album is...sigh...boring? I hate myself for typing that, but it's true. I'm listening to the album on repeat while I'm writing in hopes that it can make a last ditch effort to change my mind. Most of the songs all kind of sound the same...soft country pop-ish. Missing from this album is the witty, funny, playful, dancy and naughtiness from all his previous work. It's safe, mellow and often times boring. Don't give me that jazz about him \\"maturing\\" and \\"growing up\\" because in his last Instagram post, he has a picture of himself holding two avocados in front of his crotch. Perhaps this quieter/subdued album was due to his break up with Tristan Prettyman? I hope this is just a bump in the road for Jason and not the beginning of his decline.<br /><br />1) The Freedom Song (2/5) - The upbeat, funkiness and instrumental arrangement is typical Jason. Missing however are the lyrics. Nothing clever or catchy about any of the lyrics. This had potential to be a good song, but the lyrics are so lame and dull it induces eye rolling.<br /><br />2) Living In The Moment (3/5) - A decent and very simple song. It soundslike the country version of \\"I'm Yours\\", but not as good. I won't skip this track when it comes on, but it's not a song I look forward to hearing either.<br /><br />3) The Woman I Love (3/5) - Sounds like safe country pop. Again, the song is listenable and won't make me skip the track...but sounds almost lazy.<br /><br />4) I Won't Give Up (5/5) - I actually didn't like the song that much the first time I heard it, but the lyrics sound like classic Mraz. It eventually grew on me and has cracked my elite Mr A-Z playlist. Very soulful and touching song.<br /><br />5) 5/6 (3.5/5) - This is one of the few songs that grew on me. It's got a little jazzyness to it. I like it, but it doesn't excite me. It's on the verge of getting into my iPod.<br /><br />6) Everything Is Sound (3.5/5) - Very pop-ish and would not be surprised to hear this on the radio. Another song I like, but doesn't really excite me. At least it sounds more upbeat and more like vintage Mraz. I think I have the potential to like this song more after a few more listens.<br /><br />7) 93 Million Miles (5/5) - Love this song.  If you like \\"I Won't Give up\\", then you'll like this song for sure.<br /><br />8) Frank D. Fixer (3/5) - I like everything about this song, except for the lyrics. It's a personal song for Jason to his grandfather and it's great that he admires him, but the song is just not relate-able to the listener, unless your granddad is like Frank D. Fixer.<br /><br />9) Who's Thinking About You Now (3.5/5) - Another song I like, but doesn't excite me. It's almost a clone of 5/6. The song goes for a bit too long. The last 1/3 of the song is a boring instrumental that puts me to sleep.<br /><br />10) In Your Hands (1/5) - What an awful place on the album to stick this song. At this point, if I haven't skipped this track, I am usually asleep. It's just 5 minutes of slow, quiet, boredom. Not Mraz like at all.<br /><br />11) Be Honest (4/5) - On the first couple of listens of the album, I actually skipped this song because the song before made me so bored that I needed something to wake me up. Luckily, I listened to the album on shuffle and gave this song another chance. This song is slow and quiet, but actually has some complexity and he actually sings. A nice song to just relax to on a summer day.<br /><br />12) The World As I See It (5/5) - This is my favorite song of the album.  I LOVE the dreamy opening. I can see him opening a concert in typical spine tingling Mraz fashion with an extended version of the opening. It's just a sweet, upbeat, uplifting song. Now that's the Mraz I remember!<br /><br />13) Hidden Track (1/5) - Meh. This does not sound like Mraz. Just dull and boring. No complexity to this song at all and sounds like just album filler.<br /><br />14) I Won't Give Up (Demo) (4.5/5) - Acoustic version. It's good. I prefer track 4.<br /><br />15) The World As I See It (Live) (3.5/5) - Live acoustic version. I prefer the studio version which is more upbeat.<br /><br />16) You F'n Did It (Live) (4/5) - FINALLY. Some quirkiness and playfulness...vintage Mraz. Glad to see he hasn't gotten completely old and dull. A silly quick spitting song with Toca. Reminds me of \\"Conversation with Myself\\". I think I rated it higher simply because it reminded me of a younger Mraz.<br /><br />17) The Woman I Love (Live) (3.5/5) - Live acoustic version. Slightly better than the studio version.<br /><br />18) I Never Knew You (Live) (3/5) - I like this track more for the banter than the actual song itself. It sounds like an old school Mraz live track.<br /><br />There was nothing exciting or innovative from this album like showing his funky side in \\"Curbside Prophet\\", doing some opera in \\"Mr. Curiosity\\" or rapping in the \\"Dynamo of Volition\\". I bought tickets to see him in concert this coming Sept before this album came out and I would have still bought tickets after this album, but now my expectations and excitement for the concert has been slightly lowered. I'm hopingthe live version of Jason Mraz can sell me on more of these songs because right now I'm just not feeling them.

B007OAAK0O|5.0|Almost 30 years later, Diana Ross fans are treated to a DVD of her rained-out concert in Central Park and the rescheduled show from the next day.<br /><br />To be honest, I wanted this DVD for the first night's performance.  Although it is only about 46 minutes long, it is some of the most dazzling concert footage I have ever watched.  How many occasions do you get to watch a superstar perform in heavy winds and a downpour?  Diana Ross takes on the task of performing in a rainstorm.  What is so impressive about Ross' performance is not simply her stage presence (that is a given) but how she handles the crowd.  Remember this was a free concert - in Central Park in the '80s.  Watching Diana Ross perform amidst a rainstorm is simply mesmerizing.  If nothing else, this DVD is a showcase of a superstar in one of her most iconic moments.  Surely the sight of Ross's hair and shall blowing in the heavy wind and rain is perhaps her most iconic image.  Watching Ross give so much audience - and she WANTS to stay - says a lot about her dedication to her audience, and how important this moment was to her (she did not want to leave that stage!).<br /><br />The next day's show featured a still-energetic Ross performing in the warm sun.  It is a good performance, and watching Ross sing \\"Endless Love\\" provides the rare opportunity of seeing an emotional, teary-eyed Ross letting her guard down.  My only complaint is that the DVD says this features both shows in their entirety; however, \\"Pieces of Ice\\" is not included.  I know some bits were cut out, but it is a bit puzzling that \\"Pieces of Ice\\" was cut out, considering it was released around the time of the Central Park concerts.<br /><br />Small quibbles aside, this is a treat for Ross fans.  If you're only a casual fan, it's also worth seeing - for the pure spectacle of seeing a superstar at the peak of powers, literally turning from concert performer to goddess amidst a rainstorm.  It's also a pleasant snapshot of New York in the'80s.
0865478570|2.0|I am an amateur linguist and love reading about languages, especially obscure, little known languages, so what could be more interesting than a book about the vagaries of language translation?  Unfortunately, there are a only a few interesting tidbits scattered throughout the pages of dull, repetitive, overly technical ruminations.  Why, exactly, did the author write this book?  Who is his intended audience?  Professional translators would want something more practical, and the general public, something at least a tad interesting.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|To the good reviews already here, I can add only this: As a retired person, I can say that so many of the issues raised in the movie hit home, and in two different ways. We elders can identify something of ourselves in every one of the major characters and can laugh, or nod our heads knowingly, or recognize one of our positive qualities. On the other hand, we can identify something in every one of the major characters that brings us up a bit short, with a small gasp of shock, regret, or embarrassment, perhaps, or the feeling that we must think that thing over carefully, examine it and ourselves, once we get home, and ask ourselves some probing questions. This is a movie, I predict, that will stay with most elders for at least several days after viewing. There aren't all that many movies like that these days, especially not for those of us with white hair, so don't miss this one. And on top of all that, it is also fun, so treat yourself and enjoy.

0307956350|3.0|So one's husband wants to move to Brussels. The wife is an ex-CIA with 2 kids. The first few pages are great; there is promise of<br />a Nora and Nick Charles or Mr. and Mrs. North (you really have to be old to remember them) romantic suspense. However the author gets serious and the flash back is a killer in more than one way. The concept of the light hearted genre gets spoiled. The book moves into<br />heavy territory, with gratuitous, yes, very much so, violence which characterizes most modern spy novels. The ending twist is tame and adds nothing to the enjoyment.<br />Three stars for some sprightly writing.<br />Let's see what he does next.

B004GGM444|4.0|Skrillex's \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" is the ultimate hyperactive attention-deficit music.  With heavy synths, tons of video-game noises, and chopped-up samples that ratchet back and forth across the tracks, at times it can make you feel like you're being frog-marched out to the dance floor and forced to throw down.<br /><br />The sound here is fast-tempo dance beats, punctuated with staccato notes and short, stuttering samples.  If you're in the mood for robot-noise without the fuzzed-out mess of industrial music, \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" will be your guilty pleasure, with blips and bloops aplenty.<br /><br />As a child of the '80s, I am highly susceptible to the sound of robot voices.  \\"Kill EVERYBODY\\" sounds like the turrets from Portal 2 cheerily singing about the fact that they have been programmed to kill you...my ears perked up at that, and I felt compelled to listen (and suppress a giggle). \\"All I Ask of You\\" is fairly typical dance fare:  steady beat that could fit well in the soundtrack of a driving game, female vocalist lilting about how her lover could stand to, \\"Just open up a little bit more\\". Then we have \\"Scatta\\" switching things up a bit to the mic-steppin', gun-totin' hip-hop as pressed through a digital filter.  What amazes me is that tracks like \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" sound like the very birth of electronic music:  as if Wendy Carlos spent an afternoon in the studio with Skrillex and lent her touch to the boards--there are bits & pieces here that would be right at home in the score to A Clockwork Orange.  The same is true of \\"With You, Friends\\"--Daft Punk would love this stuff.<br /><br />If you're not much for dance music, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites might test your patience.  But if you're into electronica, Skrillex will make an enjoyable side-trip from the carefully-produced land of electronica's mainstream.  I don't see myself calling this, 'a major turning point in music history' ten years from now, but in the meantime I am certainly enjoying the ride.meantime I am certainly enjoying the ride.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I actually read this book in less then a day. It was absolutely fantastic! The syntax, the flow, the entire book was absolutely amazing! Would definitely suggest it to all of my friends!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is just like the original with even more cool effects, including suction tip guns to grab the candy and a button to reverse gravity. The first few levels start out simple but since Zeptolab assumes that most people have played the original game, the difficulty increases rather speedily. Over all a great game, I have no complaints.<br />If you loved the first one, you will love this one.
B0000B1A2G|4.0|This is an essential jazz recording of two great great musicians who made something very special happen together!  But this cd only contains the small amount of music that is on the the original LP.  The re-release also passes up a chance to fix a bizarre choice that was made on the LP, namely to include an alternate take of \\"Well You Needn't\\" on which Coleman Hawkins, rather than Coltrane, solos. (Hawk is, of course, awesome but this is supposed to be a Monk and Coltrane album, no?) The version of this tune with the Coltrane solo is on the wonderful \\"Monk's Music\\" album but it's weird to use a Mont-Trane album to release the Hawk version.<br />Also, I believe there were at least a couple of other Monk-Trane Riverside cuts that could have been included on this disc. There's room for plenty more. It's a very stingy offering for the CD format.<br /><br />If you want only one Monk-Coltrane cd get the Carnegie Hall concert - there's a lot more music on it and it's great.<br /><br />That said, this music is priceless.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really cool and I like how there's a different variety of games instead of just one lousy game. also there is 124 games not just 101!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Characters are well developed.A look into a lifestyle many of us no nothing about. A fun read,I enjoyed it. I buy all my books from Amazon.it is so easy and a very reasonable price.

B0035JRUZQ|5.0|This movie has much in common with Rio Bravo but it is not the same. They are both great John Wayne movies in their own right. Robert Mitchem & John Wayne together are great & James Caan in his younger years is terrific, too!

0061353248|5.0|By explaining the way in which we are not perfect, and providing solutions to help us in our day to day lives, Dan Ariely shows us a new way of thinking about our world. Asking what the best system of government or economics isn't enough. The question must ask what is the best system that people can work in.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|This is a great microphone that delivers top quality audio for how small it is.  I'm using it in combination with a GoPro Helmet Hero small HD Camera and I couldn't be more pleased with the results.
0439023491|4.0|I read the first book (the hunger games) and just loved it! This one is good, too, but not as good as the other one. I still didn't want to stop reading :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 in 1 games are the best, they give u games that you have yo use ur smarts to break,  hey I'm 13 and I like to play lots of challenging games and this is what I've been.looking for.
0439023513|4.0|I loved the hunger games, liked the second book and also liked this one. When I read the hunger games I wanted to read every word, don't miss even one. Here I sometimes wanted to skip something but I still liked it.
0345803485|2.0|This book is just like watching a pornography. The acting (read: writing) is terrible, but because of the racy content it is addicting. The author uses the same words over and over to describe situations ( if I read the words \\"hitches\\"or \\"clamber\\" again I'm going to scream) making the book seem redundant and predictable. So if you are looking for a diryy pleasure read then go for it with this book. But it is by no means a respectable piece of literature not due to the content but due to the nature of the writing.  I don't think I will bother with the other books.
B000M3452Y|5.0|I discovered LCD Soundsystem around the time their self-titled album was released, and when I got wind of a second album I was super stoked. That was 2007, and I still listen to it now. All My Friends has become one of my all-time favorite songs, and most of the album keeps up the pace. Reviews for the album are everywhere and everyone has their own taste, so that's not something I'll really discuss at length here. Besides, who comes to Amazon for music reviews? The front insert has the lyrics for the whole album, which is nice, and that's about it. It was reasonably-priced and I loved the whole album from start to finish. Highly recommended.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|I think it's okay, but the downside is that it opens up your web browser to access your emails. I think I may be comparing it to yahoo's app, which allows me to access my emails without opening a web browser.
B005FITIK0|5.0|I'm going to the matresses for \\"Young Adult\\".  I don't understand the plethora of negative reaction to it.  This is one of the best movies of last year.  Mavis Gary(Charlize Theron) is a thirty-seven year old writer of unfashionable teen fiction who emotionally hasn't escaped high school which kind of explains her occupation of choice.  She receives an e-mail from her high school beau, Buddy(Patrick Wilson), announcing the birth of his child.  Mavis surmises that Buddy wants to rekindle their former flame even though he is married with a newborn.  Is she on to something or deluded?  Regardless she hightails it to the Minneapolis suburb she grew up in to reunite with Buddy.  While there she encounters Matt(Patton Oswalt), a gnomish man who was crippled by some jocks in high school and scarred for life, who she didn't give the time of day.  During this visit Matt serves as the unlikely conscience and confidante to Mavis.  Theron is nothing short of stupendous here.  She conveys the complexities of Mavis-the narcissism, the vanity, the self-hatred, and the depressiveness.  Oswalt is every bit Theron's equal giving depth to what could have been a cliched character.  One of the more tender scenes I've seen in years is one towards the end of the film between Mavis and Matt.  Jason Reitman is proving with this and previous work to be a humanistic director.  Diablo Cody is also one of the better scribes as she crafts a script here that is colorfully detailed and nuanced.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Mavis is at a bookstore attempting to sign one of her books designated for clearance.  The bookseller exhorts her not to because he tells her they can't return damaged merchandise to the publisher.  I think the film failed to find it's audience because it was promoted as straight comedy when in reality it is drama with comedic elements.  I think, too, that even though you're not supposed to like Mavis the makers of \\"Young Adult\\" take the leap that you will atleast sympathize with her.
0307951529|5.0|I'm in the process of being laid off at work, so this book could NOT have come at a better time for me personally. Chris Guillebeau's passion for individuals to create powerful, profitable businesses in an economically savvy way was so clearly laid out, it was basically like a blueprint for how to get started and then how continue building. He doesn't go into writing it with any assumptions, and I firmly believe his insight and suggestions could be applied to absolutely any business venture. I absorbed it like a sponge! Now I'm ready to make something happen! READ IT! Also, if you get the chance to attend one of the stops on his $100 Startup tour, I highly encourage you to go - you won't be disappointed!
B0041KKYGU|3.0|You can nutshell this as \\"Bad Santa\\" on estrogen.  No surprises here.  This is a catalogue of rude behavior that doesn't include Cameron Diaz soiling herself or seducing her students.  Diaz is adequate, not remarkable, in the title role.  Jason Segel is essentially wasted as the gym teacher and frustrated suitor for Diaz's affections.  Justin Timberlake, though, continues to impress as a nerdy substitute teacher.  Lucy Punch is a real find as Diaz's squirrely adversary.  Regardless, if you want to see women behaving badly watch a repeat of \\"Ab-Fab\\".
0345803485|1.0|Don't buy into the hype. I borrowed this book from a friend after hearing all the good things about it. My friends daughter finished it in two days. It is one of the most boring books I've ever read. Boring erotica? Who'd ever think such a thing existed?<br />Anastasia is so annoying and weak, I'd like to gag her (and her subconcious) just to get her to shut the hell up. She's a grown college graduate who's never touched herself. More unbeilvably, she's never had  a email account until Christian gives her her own computer.<br />In between the sex scenes, you have to read about every boring thought sshe has. and about her packing for a move. and going on a job interview. and studying for a test. and read pages of awful emails. The dialogue is awful. No one talks like any of the characters in this book.<br />skip this book. If you want to read good erotica, get Ann Rice's Sleeping Beauty Triolgy
B006OCM0G0|5.0|one of the best games on here along with the other stories I ca. play for hours checking it all through out the day
B005EM8O8O|4.0|This book is a fascinating example of the complexity and potential of computer trading. The story flows with parallel themes using an engaging style. Hard to put down, it powerfully makes one wonder about how our markets might actually be manipulated.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Great game, this has terrific atmosphere, great story, fun puzzles and helpful hints. I'm a fan of Alawar games now!!
B004DTXJ4S|4.0|I usually don't like video game films. That being said, the Resident Evil film series has been a lot of fun for me though. Afterlife DID confuse me a bit though in that something seemed to be missing in the transition from Apocalypse. Actually, this has sort of been a problem all along with the series for me. If you don't play video games and I don't, there will be some disorientation going from one film to the next. Anyway, I enjoyed the visuals of the burning and abandoned city and the humongous prison citadel in the middle of it. The action was non-stop and kept my attention...I was never bored. My ONLY complaint is that they could have kept Kacey Barnfield on screen for much, much longer than they did. She is an actress who is VERY easy on the eyes!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I am certainly NOT a person you would think a fan of Adam Lambert.  Trust me, there is little 'glam' about this 48 year old guy.  Yet, I remember thinking what a travesty that Lambert did not win on American Idol.  His rendition of Ring of Fire should have garnered him the award.  Still, Adam Lambert's talent cannot be denied as this sophmore album shows.    For Your Entertainment was a much more fun album than this follow-up, but Trespassing maybe a more honest portrayal of Lambert as he bares his soul.  Lambert shows maturity on this album.  You still get the soaring vocals, but not so overdone as on his first album.  The songs on the last half of this album are my favorite of the bunch.  I like Lambert's direction and look foward to what he has in store for us in the future.    I highly recommend the Deluxe Edition of this album as you will not want to miss out on the addititional tracks.
0307266303|5.0|I am completely non-athletic but after reading this book, I began to run.  It is a capivating book at many levels; good story, great character description, interwoven with history and anthropology.  I can highly recommend it.  Best book I ahve read in  along time
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I waited in anticipation for months for this movie to be released,I wasn't disapointed.<br /> This is one of the best made and engrosing films made in many years,at least since star wars.<br /> Don't believe the the movie critics on this one,It is excellent..<br />  Amazon has the best price
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|everyone should play it. it start off slow. but once u get started. love it love it. recommends for everyone
B004132I20|5.0|At last, a series that requires sustained attention, a good vocabulary, erudition and an appreciation of the arcane. . .Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is fantastic, new, and yet seemed so familiar - eccentric, long coat. . .brilliant. . .finally it hit me. . .he's channeling Tom Baker's Dr. Who!<br /><br />Think about it; an unfathomably brilliant, curiously unrelated; curly hair and greatcoat. .gesticulating mannerisms. . .all he needs is the long scarf and a few Daleks. .  .  but be that as it may, it's a brilliant and refreshing take on the original Sherlock and completely in keeping with the original work.<br /><br />Martin Freeman has far more to do and a much more complete personality then he did as Arthur Dent in the Hitchiker's Guide. . but still retains some of Arthur's guileless incredulity.  He's immensely likeable, and as such, is a great contrast to Cumberbatch's awesome, but not exactly adorable character.<br /><br />The supporting actors are good enough; Detective Lestrade is nowhere near the idiot of the books; a hardworking detective who knows his limitations.  The rest of the cast are quirky and good foils.<br /><br />So Good Job BBC!. . .keep those Dr. . .err. . .Sherlock episodes coming!
0517548232|1.0|Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!
B004KPLZKA|5.0|Love this CD! it was totally worth buying in CD form, didn't want to wait for it to come out here in the US...<br />tracks are fun an upbeat mostly, great sound ;)<br />I love cher, can't wait for her next album!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really resisted reading this series; but, I have to say that I have fallen completely in love with its characters.  I very much love the plot twists and all of the new characters in Catching Fire. This is an excellent book!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the trilogy. I heard all the hype about it and I must say it is good. It is just not what I expected. I really love it though and read all 3 books in 3 days. I am now a little sad that I have read it all and no longer have anything to read but I just could not stop! I hope the author redoes the trilogy from Christians point of view. I thnk that would make for an interesting re-read. Impatiently waiting for what is next.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|This is my second case for my at&t Samsung Galaxy S2. First one was not at all good. Otterbox cases are famous for toughness and relaiability. I found the case very reliable. Only issue I have with it is while putting and taking out of my Pocket. At times my calls get disconnected in the process of taking the phone out. As long as the phone is safe, I'm good. Hope this helps.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is awesome. its really fun to play. its a. great game cause it gives you missions to constantly do and you still rack money up even when ur not playing.

0345803485|1.0|As christian women we should be careful what we read and put in our minds. This kind of reading pollutes the minds of those who read it, especially our teenagers. It gives them a false view on sex. This book is nothing but pornography....  Here is a great article  [...]
0345803485|5.0|This book captured me at the first page and held my attention until the very last word.  I ordered the second book in the series even before I finished this book.  Of course this book is for mature individuals only!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a descent way to past the time. I would have given it five stars be the recent update has stopped me fro.m playing offline. other then that pretty good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|MobilityWare Solitaire is easy to learn and is as challenging as the standard playing card version of the game. All pros, no cons!
B004OEIL5E|4.0|This was almost as good as the original, though it does have its faults, the good definitely outweighs the bad. It was nice to see the original characters return. And FYI my favorite character is Dewey, David Arquette did a great job of playing his character.
1451627289|4.0|I'm an intermittent King reader.  Started with Carrie when it was published, railed at King's inability to pull epics like The Stand together for a satisfying ending, and gradually drifted away from all contact with him.  But the premise of this book was a fine one, and I stuck my reader's toe in the pool, liked the temperature, and jumped in.  Loved the swim.<br /><br />Steven King has been through quite a bit in his life, including his near fatal car versus pedestrian accident a few years ago.  He has a long term marriage, and some real authority on what love is.  He was once a full time teacher, a heroic job by anyone's standards.  He has known poverty and he has known great wealth.  And by virtue of all that, in 11-22-1963 he instills what can only be called wisdom into the tale.  Yes, there are the trademark squirm-fests, when describing gore and the emission of various body fluids/solids.  But they are subdued.  Yes, there are the thinly veiled pokes at religious obsession, but no rants.  Yes, at times one wishes that King was forced to write the way that chess masters sometimes play speed chess, with only so many minutes allowed for moves.  And yet....in 11-22-1963, it all works.<br /><br />It all works because Stephen King LIKES being human.  He LIKES America.  He LIKES women that are smart and strong.  He likes to imagine, and he believes that the actions that we take in life make a difference, maybe a huge difference.  I'm going to remain solidly non-spoiler here:  this is one of King's best works in years, it's a work for him to be proud of.  More thought-provoking than scary, it'll leave a mark on you.  A good one.
B004FEFZU2|2.0|From the pink blood to the horrible 3D, this movies just plain sucks, and let's not forget about the bad acting! Hopefully they finally get it now and just quit with this series, like they should of done after the third one. I gave out 2 stars just for the comedy, though I don't think it was intentional.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I've searched through the reviews and I can't understand how nobody else is commenting on the fact that a blue line scrolls up the screen at just after the 49 minute mark when we first see Loki as king.  I've gone through 5 different copies of this blu ray combo pack, from two different vendors, and all of them have the same issue at exactly the same spot.  I've tried both the blu ray and the DVD and I've tried playing both on different blu ray players and with different TVs and that annoying blue line is there in every scenario.  I'm really hoping that this issue will be fixed because I think the movie is excellent and I can't wait to own an copy that isn't flawed.
B004OEIL5O|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two scream movies, but this one just seemed a little off. I think it was the whole step brother thing that threw me off. Once again, it was nice to see the original characters return, with some new faces thrown in also, but it just wasn't there for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not even sure how I came about the Wool series.  But, I am glad that I found it.  The writing is clear, concise, descriptive and captivating.  The story will keep you reading and make it hard to put down.  I would like to point out that it is also a simple story with few characters, and that is a compliment.<br /><br />I understand that this is a self-published work.  If true, its even more impressive as the writing, as others have noted, is pure, concise, grammatically correct and just plain well put together.  I recommend it highly.
B000EWBKLC|4.0|This is one of the movies where after you watch out the first time its not really good anymore. I say that because after you watch it and find out everything, out loses its suspense the second time around. If you have never seen this you MUST check out it, out is an absolute for any horror fan!
0307951529|3.0|This is an inspiring book. At least a couple times while reading it I took a pen to jot down some ideas.<br /><br />My problem with the book is that there are too many success stories but no real detail on the struggle for that success. I think this book would have been more successful if the author had chosen one or two examples per chapter to really dig into. I agree with one reviewer who said that most of the examples are in the form \\"got an idea, started a website, made money\\". How did they do it all? That what I like to know. It's great to know that people have started businesses with so little capital but I want to know the struggles, the low points and how they persevered.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book I just skimmed. I wanted someone to cheer for and I didn't find that in 1/2 page examples.
B000LPR9ZS|5.0|This movie was another great horror movie. This is just as good as the second one in my opinion. The brain surgery scene was one of the most disgusting scenes I have seen in a movie in a long time. This is where I believe the series should have stopped. This would have made a great trilogy, but unfortunately Hollywood doesn't know how to quit when they are on top.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|My response to this movie is similar to many that have already been posted.  Although Meryl Streep  stunningly transforms herself into an aged, confused and alienated woman, I am not convinced that it was an honest portrayal of the truth of  her character or the politics of her time.  After watching Iron Lady, I felt as confused and alienated as Margaret Thatcher must have felt both while in office and afterwards.  I came away from the movie disliking her, her family and the people that she was elected to serve, while at the same time feeling compassion for the hopes and disappointments that they all experienced.  This is also a movie that has stayed with me, if for no other reason than to try to understand why anyone thought that it would humanize someone by focusing so heavily on their mental decline. Maybe if I had personally experienced the woman and her policies, it would make more sense.  Margaret Thatcher evoked strong feelings, both positive and negative, and like her or not, she was a significant influence on the direction that Britain took in the future and should be given a bit more respect than this movie offered.
B004OEIL54|5.0|I remember when this was first released, out was all over the place, everyone was talking about it. Even when they released it on VHS they had something like for different covers to chose from. One of Wes' best movies.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|only problem I have is it really almost requires micro transactions to have full functionality. other than that though it is rather fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is perfect for the kindle fire. I'm so happy that this app is crystal clear and doesn't glitche.
B005FJ7DOM|2.0|The movie was dragging past one hour but up to that point it was reasonable. The ending was a huge disappointment.
B0061TQBRK|3.0|Not a bad album, but with this band, I keep waiting for Cristina to cut loose and belt out some soaring vocals, but it just never really happens.  It may be partly because I got two Lacuna Coil CDs and two Evanescence CDs at the same time.  Amy Lee's vocal style is so much more powerful and passionate.  I think Cristina could be like that, but the writing and tempo of the songs they do just doesn't cater to that style.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an excellent writer.  I read three of his books, and of course, I have seen the movie, \\"The Notebook.\\"  I will read anything he writes.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|As a post-MBA in financial services, this book has provided excellent insight into the interview process and the techniques to be prepared for case interviews.

0385534639|4.0|'The Night Circus' takes a fun conceit -- what if performance magic is real, and we are merely trained to 'know' that it is trickery? -- and weaves an intricate fairy tale around it.  Without giving too much away, the gist of the plot is this:  in childhood, two apprentices, Celia and Marco, are pledged to a competition by their respective magician mentors.  There is no date of competition, no 'finals' for which to prepare.  Rather, their lives and the way they master and employ magic is the metric by which they are judged.  The setting for the competition is 'The Night Circus.' To add dramatic flair, there is no opportunity to tie.  A winner must be declared.  And the loser? Well, there is no future for the loser.<br /><br />This novel marvelously, richly describes the settings, most especially the Night Circus itself, telling the reader all about the performances, the colors, the foods, the aromas, to the extent that the reader feels quite present in the tale.  Periodically, the perspective of the novel changes to second person, which serves to further root the reader 'in' the story.  Months after reading it, I still find myself drifting back to that world, wishing I could visit some of the tents, and see some of the acts.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|only have the free version. I may buy it. good for occupying time but that's about it. wish it was a lil more mentally stimulating
B004SYP5WC|5.0|The only thing that would make this app better would be if it paid the bills for you. It's very helpful.
B007M6OIF8|5.0|What an season finale, and what a series. Hopefully they continue to go well beyond season 3 and continue to take the artistic liberties they're taking form the comic book, it's making for great television.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was definitely drawn into this book and couldn't put it down!  It was a great story, very well written.  I was so into the story and what was happening I tended to skip some of the detailed paragraphs.  It is amazingly written, and the characters are so real.  I have no complaints to this book whatsoever and I hope that one day it is turned into a movie.
B003Q97D48|5.0|A fun program about a group of friends and the drama that plays out when one among them dies under mysterious circumstances.  Great for tweens.  My 10 yr old daughter is a junkie.

B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Great acting,and must admit the movie kept you watching.<br /><br />The ending however ruined the whole movie.<br /><br />The plot of this movie comes out in the end,and it left the viewer shocked in saying to themselves..\\"This is the plot\\"?<br /><br />One time watch,and not worthy of my movie collection.<br /><br />The movie started off great,just the ending was a huge let down.<br /><br />To bad someone in Hollywood allowed such a stupid ending,that ruined a perfectly good movie at the start.<br /><br />Lots of movies are made with alternative endings,they were asleep at the wheel on this one.<br /><br />Dam.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I've read the first three Iron Druid books, and really liked them all. If you like Dresden Files and similar supernatural suspense novels, these will not disappoint.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books, didn't want to put it down, it was an interesting read.  I am glad I purchased all 3 together for my Kindle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a cool game but I think it should give you more points for replaying games. It takes a while to unlock new games.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I guess this game is alright I play it when I'm bored its pretty fun you should try it cause its free
B007J4T2G8|5.0|AWESOME book.. great reading . It's more than just the sex. It has an actual story line. You would not put this book down
B0054JZC6E|3.0|sort of fun but way too many adds. games themselves are amusing but not extraordinarily fun. an ok app but not a must have
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, I was reluctant to read this book, but not because I was afriad I wouldn't like it. It was because I knew I would love it, and I did. I fell into the story and had an immediate need to finish it. I read this book in one day and bought the next that same evening.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is one of the most enjoyable reading experiences that I've had in quite some time. I think that we all have made choices to reveal partial truths, withhold facts, or simply manufacture substitute fantasies to protect ourselves and loved ones. This exciting tale is about the devastating results of doing so and the terrifying journey we begin when we decide to create a stage-set from the facts. It is an intimate glimpse of the heartbreak of losing a grip on the safety of our children and of the pain endured as a marriage, at the core of our existence,  begins to dissolve because of our actions.<br /><br />All this is bound together in a truly wonderful mystery that's a bit like watching a train heading for a washed out bridge. It's an extremely well written book and a haunting tale from a great story teller.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Day two of reading this series....I finished this second book in one day, fascinated by the intriguing Mr Grey. The love and devotion that they have is funny at times, because they are so bad at showing it. It made for a fabulous read.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|this is a great app and use it as my go to for all things weather.  couple features of note are the long range view and the wind indicator.  I do a lot of riding and it is great to see the hourly forecast of wind speed/direction.<br />only suggestion might be a catchy name so I can tell my friends easier about the app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Take it as it is people.....If you are a prude, then you probably won't enjoy reading this book. If you are open minded and love an adventure, in love, romance, and the bedroom...well this is right up your alley. Christian Grey is one hell of a man. Thank you for writing something with an edge that kept me turning the page for more.<br /><br />Jennifer Foor<br />Author of The Somnian Series
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read all three books, and the whole time I did, I couldn't figure out WHY I was still reading.  The dialogue was forced and ridiculous - people don't speak to each other that way for the most part and Ana's thought process made her sound like an idiot.  While she had an expansive vocabulary due to her English degree, her thought patterns were that of a 14-year old at best.  \\"Oh my\\", \\"down there\\", etc.  Seriously?  Hard core BDSM sex and the best she can come up with is \\"Oh my\\" and \\"down there\\"??<br /><br />The sex scenes were steamy (thought wildly implausible at times), but the wooden dialogue and redundancy of their escapades just ruined it for me.  It read like a bad YA book with porn.  My 10 year old writes more complex emotions and dialogue than this.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Rarely have I read a book that made me feel so much. I experienced a kaleidoscope of emotions while reading this story. At times it was pity, then annoyance, to heartbreak and sheer joy. And to top it all off, this book sizzled.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie and say the comparisons to another novel didn't pique my interest with this book. But I'm not here to review that other work, I am here to share my feelings for Bared to You. Are there similarities? Sure, but let's be honest with ourselves. If you're an avid romance reader, you've come across a book or two that reminds you of another book or two. How many times can an Alpha male be written? Or a vampire? Or a shifter? When something is receiving so much attention, it's impossible not to be compared. But that's grossly unfair to this book and the other.<br /><br />First we meet Eva, a sweet down to earth woman who comes from money, thanks to her mother's advantageous marriages. Despite never wanting for anything, she decides to go to college and make her way in the world by getting a job. Shocking, I know. As the book progresses you understand why she needs this standard of normalcy. It's not a want, but an absolute need.<br /><br />We also get to meet Cary, a super sexy up and coming model who is Eva's brother from another mother. But in actuality they are each other's support system. And if ever two people needed one other, it was these two. They are the ones who call it when the other has their head too far up someplace it shouldn't be. For all the reasons that they were brought together, they were extremely lucky to have the relationship they did.<br /><br />And then there's Gideon. Oh, dark and dangerous Gideon. While he's compared to another fictional who is also dark and dangerous, I felt Gideon is very much different. Is he controlling, of course. However, Gideon shuts down his emotions. Does it affect his personality? Absolutely, but Gideon builds a wall so thick that he's almost childlike when it comes to emotions of the heart. Because he's never had them as an adult. Until he meets Eva.<br /><br />\\"As he stared back, he altered...as if a shield slid away from his eyes, revealing a scorching force of will that sucked the air from my lungs. The intense magnetism he exuded grew in strength, becoming a near tangible impression of vibrant and unrelenting power.\\" I shivered a little at this. Here you see he's a dominant person, you feel it. Eva responds to it, even if she's terrified by her reaction.<br /><br />Together, they are explosive. Their love making, their fast growing emotions, their possessiveness, their everything is scorching. From the first time they touch until the last page, no matter how tumultuous their relationship is, it's the passion that grips you. Gideon and Eva are almost too passionate for their own good. They break self imposed rules, experience firsts together, and live in a non-structured Dominate/submissive relationship.<br /><br />I wanted to point out that I listed `forced seduction' as an element of this book. It's not what I think of as hard core forced seduction, but more as seduction used to bend Eva to Gideon's will. He uses his arsenal of knowledge when it comes to Eva to bend her his will, or stop a fight, or whenever there's something they are having a hard time dealing with. There were a few times where I felt myself go \\"ummm\\", so I felt it would be better to safe than sorry.<br /><br />In closing, I adored this book for so many reasons. I can't tell you the last time I blushed from my neck to the roots of my hair. There's a scene that just flat out floored me, and I read it three times to make sure I got all the details in my highly imaginative mind. Ms. Sylvia Day did a fantastic job with this. The writing was superb, the characters flawed, overall just stellar work. I will be anxiously awaiting Deeper in You when it releases where we will be able to continue the story of Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviewsotic Reviews

B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great book!  Had trouble putting it down because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Can't wait to read more of the Wool Series when it is published.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|This is simply awesome for statistics and asking it to solve equations, take derivatives, compute integrals, etc. For all those people who've bee trashing it, they should understand that it is a computer, not some college kid working for chacha who has nothing better do than look up stupid facts to questions. Queries need to be pretty specific and split up a problem into its parts yourself, and it should give the answer to pretty much any question you have.<br /><br />Also, this is a review for the app itself, not the quality of WA databases.
3836503050|5.0|Product was received very quickly. It was in perfect condition. Would be happy to buy from the seller again. It was a present so it was paramount that it had no damages to it, and it didn't. Thank you!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|The moment I finished the sample I knew I had to get the book. I really couldn't put it down at first. Then I realized that the events in the story were kind of repetitive & I began to get disappointed in the way that everything started to unfold. It was a good book, their relationship was nuts & i loved every second of it don't get me wrong but It's just so unrealistic. Guys don't go from whores to husbands. I'm very into the fictional romances though so I'm all for it.<br />If you're looking for a realistic romance don't read this book. If you're looking for a thrilling, chaotic story then this is for you.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|They probably focus their advertising based on your cookies lol. Browse much porn lately? That would be my guess. Bout to download it now.
0307594165|5.0|Frank Money has had a bad war.  It's a few years after he's returned from Korea and he's still battling ghosts especially those of the two home town pals he saw die.  He's living with a woman he loves though she's running out of patience with his frustrating behavior and his inability to find work.  Then he gets a cryptic note telling him his beloved younger sister is near death.  He sets out to find her.  Along the way he suffers flashbacks, racism, inexplicable violence both inflicted on him and that he inflicts on others.  He also meets several strangers who treat him kindly and offer help.  On his journey he contemplates his childhood and the Georgia town called Lotus that he couldn't wait to get away from.  He wanted away so badly he joined the army.  Only his love for his sister makes him determined to go back.<br /><br />As always Morrison writes beautifully about interesting people.  She clarifies male and female outlooks on similar topics and though their focus is different their actions are mostly done out of love.  \\"Home\\" is a more concrete story than her last several works but it's no less gorgeous.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I really enjoyed parts of the book.  I got hooked from the beginning which kept me reading, but it seemed to drag on too long.  I watch and read a lot of crime novels and I could not understand why \\"other\\" suspects were \\"forgotten\\" especially since Jacob's father was liked and respected by the police department.  Then as usual after dragging on it just ends.
B007Z9QS5K|1.0|I mean--I enjoy a good romance, I enjoy a good comedy; HECK, I even enjoy a good holiday movie.  But above all, I enjoy a character with a purpose and a story with meaning--and let's not kid ourselves, it has to feel plausible.<br /><br />This movie had very little depth, and most times, seemed so superficial.  Allow me to elaborate: Two couples competing to have the first baby in the new year; a teenager who disobeys her mother to run about Times Square with her crush, a man who has been waiting AN ENTIRE YEAR to re-meet some lady with whom he shared a moment on NYE 2011, a bitter guy who hates NYE for really no good reason; and so on and so forth.  Seriously, is this how deep our lives get?  Something about this is just too bothersome to me.  Maybe it was the lack of diversity insofar as to whom this movie was targeted--a very middle class to upper middle class, American audience.  Maybe it was because the Ball dropping in Times Square supposedly set the tone for the hopes and dreams of not only everyone in the country but in the world.  It's commercial.  It's materialistic.  It's disingenuously saccharine.  But above all, it's 1-dimensional.  Don't get me wrong, there were some good moments for me--usually the scenes involving Hilary Swank.  But overall, this movie needs to retire with the New Year.<br /><br />But as the title suggests, some people like this sappy, gimmicky stuff.  And that's ok.  I've given \\"Valentine's Day\\" a chance.  I gave this a chance.  No more.  I'll stick to \\"Love Actually.\\"
1423113454|2.0|I loved the Percy Jackson series, and while I didn't expect or want this to be similar, I did want it to be interesting. This book was so hard for me to get through, and I had to make myself keep going. The story line was weird. I just didn't like it.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|If you appreciate:<br />- researched and thorough information;<br />- well written, well-paced novels;<br />- travelling through time or being absorbed by a good story;<br />- learning about people, the evolution of civilization, the history of economic development<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"London:  The Novel.\\"<br /><br />The richness of the content supported by factual events and great characters make the reading of \\"London\\" as much a vacation read as a learning experience.  This book was my first Rutherfurd read, and since I have read almost all his other books and referred them as well.  Now my wish is he covers some cities or regions for my personal interest (say Paris or Montreal).<br /><br />Historical fiction, when in the hands of a solid author, is a fantastic way to learn about our past to understand the present.  Rutherfurd has mastered the art of storytelling in a compelling and informative way.  No doubt purists will say there are questionable areas on some facts, but history is not always about the actual day the event happened or if there was more or less rain during a storm; it is about providing context to help understand and build our own referential.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a must have if you carry a blade. The flip out sharpener for serrated edges works like a charm. I keep my in my lunch box and use it often. I'm sure 3-4 guys I work with have already bought one after checking out mine. Great product.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I loved the game untill I shut down my kindle for the night. The next day all my timers were reset to 300hrs and more. Awful glitches. Needless to say I uninstalled it after it happening 15times. Please fix this glitch.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|\\"Chronicle is one of those movies that made you want to go see it just by the constant t.v. spots that Fox ran for it in the weeks leading up to its release 3 months ago.But depending on who you ask who went to go see it,it was either hit or miss.In my opinion,much credit has to be given to filmmakers Josh Trank and Max Landis for coming up with a premise that didn't sound so exciting(a superhero-like film wrapped in a teen drama in the \\"found footage\\" format).But it worked, given the performances of the 3 boys(notably Dane DeHaan and Michael B. Jordan)and the incredibly short running time-83 minutes.I have to admit,my favorite part was when the boys were playing catch football while flying superman-style in the sky.I am surprised that \\"Chronicle\\" only cost $15 million(even more shocked at how much it made:over $120 million at the box office),and filmed in South Africa-doubling for Seattle,WA.Long story short,\\"Chronicle\\" might not deserve multiple viewings(you might get bored looking at it the third or fourth time around),but I would recommend it to anyone.Note-the scenes with Andrew (DeHaan) may be a little hard to watch for anyone who had a hellish home life and/or rough time in high school.The visuals do not get in the way of the story and you sense the friendships and happiness that Andrew has-until it all falls down.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Fun at first but when you get to level 4 it keeps repeating the levels over and over. Don't listen to the good reviews!
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when watching this movie but I was surprised at the direction the movie took. It was not a movie about Marilyn as a whole but truly an intimate look into one week with Marilyn by Colin Clark, the &#34;third&#34; assistant director. Colin is a bright eyed, and hard working guy trying to make it in the film industry and he shows through determination, that he can do what is necessary to get the job done.<br /><br />But what happens, which seems to be common in Marilyn's life, is that she connects with Colin and uses him to get through this tumultuous time. He is her soft place to land when everyone around her is scrambling to either holler at her lack of professionalism or kiss her feet as the greatest weak psyched actress around.<br /><br />It is not a huge, fast paced movie but gives us a glimpse at what a troubled young woman she was, brilliantly portrayed by Michelle Williams. The only thing that bothered me throughout the movie was that Kenneth Branagh didn't make me think of Sir Laurence Olivier at all.
0345802934|1.0|I will keep this review short: lots of words that fill too many pages with a meaningless story. I'm sorry I wasted my time reading the whole thing. I hoped all along it would get better - it did not.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I bought this app hoping to find a fun game to waste some time. Turns out it's a really great game. A surprising amount of 9 hole courses of varying difficulties keeps it challenging and fun. There's both campaign and a practice mode whether you want to just shoot around for fun or try and best your last score. Very well done, simple but executed perfectly. No problems on kindle fire.
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun, nice graphics, ads not too annoying. well done! hate amazons 25 word review requirement however! game is great. play on my iphone too
0545265355|5.0|After I saw the movie, I decided to read the book.  I couldn't put them down. This is an excellent set of books if you like to read.  Exciting, tear jerking, twists and turns.
0553801473|5.0|I love this series. Some reviewers have criticized some of the later books in the series (including this one), saying that there are too many character POV's and that it gets confusing, but I really didn't find it at all confusing. It enriches the story quite a bit, making for a better read in my opinion. The 4th and 5th books take place simultaneously, focusing on different characters in each. I can see how this would be annoying if you allowed a large amount of time to pass between reading the 4th and 5th books. But if you read them back to back, the 5th book (while focusing on completely different characters/locations/events than the 4th book) really improves upon the character's stories in the 4th book. Overall, I definitely recommend it.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|It is a terrific movie, I can not think of a single reason anyone would think otherwise! I hope they keep making them. Long Live the Muppets!
B005LAIGPU|3.0|Things you need to know: THIS IS A FOUND FOOTAGE MOVIE!!<br /><br />Ok with that out of the way this is probably the best movie I've seen that uses the found footage technic. As you will see after the fun begins there power assist the camera at times which makes you not notice the feel of found footage as much.<br /><br />This movie is about one troubled teen that starts videoing he's life. After meeting up with one of the popular kids at his high school and his cousin they investigate a strange hole in the earth in which they find a strange rock. This is where the adventure starts they discover that they now have certain powers which get stronger over the corse of using them. They have fun testing these powers out until one of the teens goes to far then things get a little out of hand....<br /><br />The special effects are good all except the flying its a little cheap at times but other than that decent effects over all.<br />Acting is somewhat lacking at times but good over all.<br /><br />If you like scfi and super hero movies this is worth checking out!!
0385344228|3.0|A friend recommended this book,it's not the type of book I usually pick to read. I was very dissapointed in it. I thought the story line was drug out. The concept was good, but just didn't go any where for a very long time. I knew how it was going to end before it ended, and didn't really care for the ending at all. I did like the style of writing, but can't really say I would recommend the book to anyone. there are so many books out there to read, I say, just skip this one. Glad I borrowed it and didn't pay for it.
B007R41E8O|4.0|Fun and entertaining!<br />I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery and puzzles.<br />Great price and well worth it.
B000E33VWW|5.0|I'll be brief since this motion picture has already rec'd nearly 300 reviews - CAPOTE is an exceptional, somewhat complex, mature film that engages and satiates the viewer on so many levels.<br /><br />The acting here is simply superb. I'm going to lay claim that Hoffman's effort as the lead character is one of the very finest (Top 10 worthy) performances that I have ever witnessed. The awards he garnished are so well-deserved. And Catherine Keener's subtle yet strong portrayal as Harper Lee is flawless, as is the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The film itself is beautifully shot, and the script is likewise excellent. Really, can one truly find any fault with this motion picture? I dare say, not.<br /><br />Back to Hoffman - he dominates the film as much (or more) than another much more famous and identically-named actor (Dustin, whom I also have high regard for) ever could. I cannot emphasize how brilliant this accomplishment is - Hoffman truly brought Truman Capote to life for me.<br /><br />I plan next to order the 'Infamous' DVD and compare it to this film, though I am hesitant to do so until a few weeks have passed. Like 'Rob Roy' which flew under the radar due to the huge splash made by 'Braveheart', I'm hoping that 'Infamous' is another hidden gem.<br /><br />In the meantime, I will admire 'Capote' for the great film that it is - an easy 5 Star rating here.

Runnin' is my current favorite, but I'm sure that will change every day.  I have never heard Adam's lower register and it is just as amazing as his high register.  So sexy!
B00006ZUHY|5.0|After Houses of the Holy Led Zeppelin's sound did change, some fans hated everything after that, in my opinion its all wonderful its all superb and its all some of the best recordings in existence, this album is my favorite out of PG,Presence and that whole era, the keyboard work is really superb and the emotion and feeling behind every song. I especially love Hot Dog, plants ode to Elvis era music.

B007EC6FIS|5.0|I was skeptical after the last 2 efforts by Keane - after buying Hopes & Fears when it came out, I would consider myself a fan for life, that cd is just perfection from start to end, and so perhaps the bar was just set too high from the start.  It is certainly a band's prerogative to explore different styles and directions of music, but I was not crazy about the last 2 cds.  Of course I wanted another H&F, a cd I could listen to over and over (and still do).  I am happy to say that Strangeland is close cousin to H&F for me.  You have the clear plunky piano, you have the cavernous intuitive melodies, you have the emotional movement - all things I loved on H&F.  So if you were ever a Keane fan because of H&F, you will most likely enjoy this cd.  I was so very close to not buying it because of past disappointment, Strangeland does not disappoint. Definitely splurge and get the Deluxe version - the 4 extra songs are worth it. 4 stars for the music, plus 1 extra star for how happy I am to have a reason to be a Keane fan again.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|In the past, the install instructions were somewhat difficult. I was delighted to find that they have remedied that problem. The AWUS036NHR comes with a printed \\"quick-start\\" guide that is very easy to use. Six easy steps and you're done. Also, it includes a normal, full-size CD (instead of the mini-CD used in the past).<br /><br />This adapter speeds up computers (especially laptops) by 1) upgrading to class-N WiFi (802.11n) and 2) by amplifying the WiFi signal. The end result is more networks to connect to and faster speed than the built-in WiFi.<br /><br />On my Toshiba laptop, without CD drive, I had to copy the CD to a flash drive.<br /><br />1. Then I double-clicked on autorun.exe (not setup.exe as indicated in the instructions). This does invoke setup.exe, but I couldn't locate the exact setup.exe file and found that autorun.exe works just as well.<br /><br />2. The last step (#6) did not work correctly for me. It looks like they forgot to have you install the device driver, but I remembered how they did things in the earliest Alfa. Here's what I did . . .<br /><br />3. Right-Click on Computer and select Manage.<br />4. Left-Click on Device Manager.<br />5. Right-Click on the Network Adapter item with an exclamation point (Realtek RLT8188RU) and select \\"Update Driver Software\\".<br /><br />6. Select \\"Browse my computer for driver software\\".<br />7. Left-Click on the BROWSE button and navigate to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Realtek\11n USB Wireless LAN Utility.<br />8. Left Click on NEXT and the driver should install properly.<br /><br />9. Once done, refer back to Step 6, and double-click on the \\"REALTEK 11n USB Wireless LAN Utility\\" icon on your desktop.  Now select the \\"Available Network\\" tab. This is where you select the WiFi network you want to log into.<br /><br />10. Finally, click on the HOME tab (on the left) to view the signal strength & quality. At this point, you are online and can view the \\"Internet Access\\" icon on the taskbar (bottom right).<br /><br />I am so pleased that I purchased this adapter. Alfa has hit a home-run with this latest version. It's a dramatic update with new chip set and improved instructions. Also, it includes install instructions on the back of the Quick-Start Guide for MAC OS.<br /><br />Also, there is a full User Manual on the CD (which I haven't looked at yet) and this should be consulted for either Windows or Macintosh. This product also installs for Linux./>I am so pleased that I purchased this adapter. Alfa has hit a home-run with this latest version.

B005LAIGPU|2.0|Almost good, far from great, this was another movie aimed at the highschool demographic and with seductive movie trailers caught the adult interest too. Oops, guess I fell for that again -25$, 2 hours, retarded high school sex (thanks again for marketing that to our sons and daughters so deliberately, I mean sure we know, but its the whole image you create when you show \\"super-kids\\" going from looser to pimp with these illegitimate powers) scenes and an irremovable bad taste, but then Diablo 3 started working so I was able to recover quickly.
B007CW2FCA|4.0|I will confine my comments to the remastering.  I already owned these recordings on lp and CD.  I was hoping that the Decca reissue would improve the boxy claustrophobic ambience that plagues most of the sonata recordings (the Phillips set also contains the concertos with Colin Davis which are a sonic improvement over the sonatas).<br />  Many early stereo recordings have been issued from labels such as Sony and Supraphon using 20 or 24 bit DSD remastering.  Not here, however.  This sounds identical to the Phillips set.  If you own that set there is no reason to get this unless you really want the 1952 Diabelli.<br /><br />An addendum--after posting this review someone emailed me  to let me know the phillips set was already a 24 bit remastering.  I pulled out the box, and there is a sticker on the front of the box that clearly states this.  It goes to show that there is only so much that could be done with limited originals.  perhaps is Pristine Audio took a crack at it...<br />I will be listing the Decca set for resale.

B00338QENI|1.0|The author who writes about how Henrietta Lack's family was wrongfully denied financial benefit of the use of her cells, is a hypocrite!  She uses Henrietta's family to write this book, but does not herself, give them any money for their efforts.....  She speaks about a \\"fund\\" being put in place, but that is not compensation from her to them.  She has exploited them and it is a disgrace.  She could/should have given them part of her royalties or a fixed amount of money for their efforts.  Shame on her, and I personally will never read another book authored by her and put money in her pocket.<br /><br />Additionally, her writing style lacks in so many ways.
B007712XAU|5.0|Love this collection and that it includes the Christmas Special!  Hopefully the next season will be as good as these!
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I was predisposed to not like this book; I mean, come on now, a story told from a dog's point of view? Sure, I love my pets, I've always had a dog, (the current one is a seven year old, Miniature Schnauzer, and very smart) but I don't anthropomorphize them. At times. Enzo's POV is childlike and simplistic, and then it becomes wise and deeply philosophical. Pulleeeez, make up your mind! The story itself is corny and unbelievable. What man would hand his beloved wife over to her parents as she lay dying? Denny seems to lack cajones when dealing with anything but racing cars. That doesn't make him heroic in my mind. The redeeming factors are that the author writes cogent and literate sentences, paragraphs, chapters and book, and that he has mastered the elements of telling a (seriously flawed) story. This is a very light read of no literary significance, in my opinion.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|But it lasted for over a year until I lost it. I think the rope/string it is a little weak.
B00464F19Q|5.0|Pitt... \\" When this big thing happens, I'll be right next to you , so be sure to tell me, I wouldnt want to miss it \\"  Spacey.... \\" Oh dont worry, you wont, you wont miss a thing\\"<br /><br />Even upon repeated viewings this ending works. When the viewer knows whats coming it works just as well if not better than the first time. You're privy to the secret that the detectives arent. Almost makes it more chilling. The above quoted dialogue between Pitt and Spacey rarely fails to make the hairs on my neck stand on end
0671646788|5.0|This book really motivates u. I read it over and over again.its worth it. I urge u to buy it
0345803485|1.0|I read these out of curiosity over all the fuss...how hilarious! I will never be able to read the word \\"heady\\" or the phrase \\"We aim to please\\" again, not to mention the many other overused inane bits of babble with which this author incessantly pounds the reader. (See other reviews.) The story had possibilities had it been properly edited and developed. I actually found Christian's journey of redemption fascinating. It seemed this story is meant to be about the power of unconditional love and the capacity to overcome. But getting there in these books is torture due to the shockingly BAD WRITING. Honestly...buy a thesaurus!
B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book had so much hype behind it that I bought it thinking it would be a great read.  I was definitely left unfulfilled.  I will never understand how a supposed bad ass guy becomes a love struck begging puppy and why the girl takes the guy back after she's treated like crap.  I think this book is written more for YA crowd than an adult who has adult relationships.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|Liam Neeson's determined performance - one of his best - anchors THE GREY, one of this year's more memorable cinematic excursions to date. Viewers who might've missed director Joe Carnahan's film in theaters ought to check out the picture on video.<br /><br />Carnahan, who adapted a book by Ian McKenzie Jeffers with the author, has fashioned a gripping account of a disparate group of Alaskan oil drillers who crash in the frozen wilderness and are subsequently attacked by a pack of hungry wolves. It's essentially a frigid \\"Deliverance\\" but with some poetic passages as Neeson and his fellow survivors dig themselves out and try to stay alive, occasionally stopping to deliberate on the meaning of life, the existence of God and why in the world these starving hunters won't give them a break.<br /><br />Atmospherically shot in British Columbia and filled with memorable set-pieces, \\"The Grey\\" is exciting and well-executed on nearly every front, save for some occasionally spotty uses of CGI. Still, Neeson's gritty performance says it all: his John Ottway might have been dealt a few bad hands, but the character opts to go down fighting, and the film's spirituality adds depth to a picture that, even on just a pure surface level, ranks as one of the more compelling outdoor-adventure yarns in recent memory.<br /><br />Universal's Blu-Ray looks terrific with its 1080p transfer and sounds even better with a marvelously mixed DTS MA soundtrack layered with surround activity. Extra features aren't overwhelming - just some deleted scenes and a commentary by Carnahan - while a DVD and digital copy round out the release.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Loved it until it was updated,then I had nothing but trouble. I even had trouble using my mobile as it would try to load which took ages only to black out and leave my mobile unusable. I also tried unloading it and reloading but that didn't work either.  So disappointed!

0525478817|2.0|I had never read a John Green novel prior to reading this one. I wanted very much to like it and felt certain after reading some of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here that it would be an awesome and heartbreaking experience. I was ready and excited. I guess I could sum the experience up best by stating that it is unlikely I will read another book by this author, and if I do it will be sometime in the future when I forget how utterly disappointing I found this book to be.<br /><br />I had a lot of problems with this book. Overall, it felt very insincere and I was constantly distracted by how obviously everything was written with the goal of tugging on the reader's heart strings, rather than just letting things happen that were beautiful in spite of being sad. It felt like Mr. Green was screaming at me from the page 'ARE YOU SAD YET? YOU'RE SAD RIGHT? THIS IS SAD. YOU SHOULD FEEL ALL THE THINGS AND CRY ABOUT IT. I'M A GOOD WRITER. I WRITE FEELINGS. ARE YOU CRYING YET?' For a story about Human Beings, it doesn't feel very human at all. Instead everything feels very unnatural and self-conscious in the worst way.<br /><br />The biggest and most impossible thing for me to get around was I simply didn't believe the character of Augustus or his relationship with main character Hazel. As these concepts  are basically what the entire story hinges upon, I didn't believe in or care about anything else that happened either. Augustus came off completely pretentious and obnoxious, particularly in the way he insisted on speaking in a Diablo Cody nerd hipster sort of dialect that no one would ever use in the real world. (Some commenters here have said it's the way Mr. Green himself talks which, a.) way to be self-congratulatory, and b.) how does he not get punched in the face, like, ALL THE TIME?) His entire character felt contrived and I never once felt a connection with him. Too often it seemed like he was walking around like I AM SO CLEVER LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME, constantlyputting on a show so that nothing from him felt genuine or real. His whole fascination with ultimately meaningless metaphors felt condescending, like Mr. Green constantly squealing HEY GUYS, SEE WHAT I DID THERE? TAKE A SECOND, WRITE IT DOWN IF YOU NEED TO. YEAH, I'M DEEP. Augustus' one fault was sickness, but it was nothing that he could control. And that's just so... boring.<br /><br />But it wasn't just Augustus. The character of Hazel was somewhat likable, (despite Mr. Green's insistance on making her 'sound like a teenager' by formating every other statement she makes like it's a question? and tacking distracting 'or whatever's onto the end of random bits of dialogue BECAUSE THIS IS HOW TEENAGERS TALK RIGHT? I CAN TALK LIKE A TEENAGER, SEE? BECAUSE THEY SAY 'WHATEVER'. I'M A GOOD WRITER. ARE YOU FEELING THINGS YET?) but her relationship with Augustus felt completely and totally forced. There was never any real reason for them to fall in love with one another, and that is crossing dangerously close into Twilight territory. He was so convienient, so effortless for Hazel. I had to wonder, was it him or was it because he was there and ready and willing? It all fell flat and left so many places to take the stories and facets of their characters completely unexplored. Any opportunities to delve into hard questions and real answers were left untaken and exchanged for large passages (mainly in the **SPOLIER ALERT**: Amsterdam trip scenes) that had very little purpose outside of screaming LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME CHARMING BOY ISN'T HE SWEET LADIES? HE WILL PULL YOUR CHAIR OUT FOR YOU AND HE TALKS LIKE I DO. IT'S CHARMING, RIGHT? YOU ARE FEELING CHARMED. I'M A GOOD WRITER.<br /><br />Ultimately, it felt completely fake. I couldn't get lost in it, always fully aware of the fact that I was reading fiction and how irritating EVERYTHING about it was. I finished it, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars, but it was a true task. Truthfully, it pissed me off. I would have loved to love this book as much as everyone else and have a new favorite to hold dear to my heart. Now I'm just confused. Was my copy broken?

B005LLSNNE|4.0|Kurt Sutter is an amazing story Teller and has given dimension to some very distasteful characters.  The show themes have been compared to Hamlet - and indeed the heroes in the show all have tragic flaws, I would add the Scottish play to the comparison with both Gemma and Tara showing strong enough traits to stare down Lady Macbeth while remaining almost likeable.  The sexism and racism are indeed tragic and sometimes hard to watch but, unfortunately realistically reflective.  This series goes on my tops list along with Carnivale and Deadwood, Dayton Callie and Ray Mckinnon being alumni of the latter.  I hesitate to pick out specific actors.  Across the board this cast has shown a range of ability unprecedented.  The acting range of this cast is Juicy with deep enough plots to draw out rounded characters.  My only complaint is the lack of Closed Captioning on the Amazon Instant Video.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|It was definitely a page turner. It made you want to continue reading until the end.<br /><br />However, I have to agree. The one thing that Dashner does right from start to finish is barely provide enough information to answer the questions that form in the reader's mind. I think the quest for more knowledge kept you reading until the end but still didnt really answer any of my biggest questions.<br /><br />I am on the fence about reading the next book in the trilogy idk if it will be worth the 9.99 but to be honest idk if this one was worth the 9.99
B004EPZ07K|2.0|This was an ok movie strictly for kids. There were too many dark scenes where I couldn't even see what was going on. The villian was one of the silliest comic book villian concepts I've ever seen. Angela Bassett must have badly needed the money to take on the do nothing hardly say anything role that she played.
0439023521|5.0|I had to write a review because I loved this book so much! It's definitely a page turner and it gets so exciting that I literally had to keep calming myself down to be able to read it. I'm thrilled I bought it as I was a bit wary thinking it would be really gruesome but it was so good! The only negative I would say is that the main character has it quite easy considering the horrific situation she's placed in. If I was her I'd consider suicide, running away etc but she's so grown up with it and yet she's a child. I also feel that her win in the arena isn't well deserved. I feel that she didn't have to go through much to get there, especially since she only physically killed one person. The writer could of played with my emotions a lot more, but I still loved it.<br /><br />I'm recommending it to family and friends xx
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a must read!! I couldn't put it down! It is very erotic, but the story line is great! Love the charaters! Can't wait to read the third one.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|The movie was a little slow paced, but once the story line built my intrest was kept. The acting was very good, except the acting is a constant reminder of twlight. over all I would recommend this moive to people who enjoy theatrical era time lines.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Just beautiful. I don't know how else to describe this book.<br /><br />I cried practically the whole way through it, I'm exhausted emotionally but despite that I enjoyed every minute of this book - if that makes sense.<br /><br />I am not good at reviews, I just know how a book makes me feel and that's what I base my opinion on.<br /><br />With that in mind, this book is a definite 5 stars for evoking such emotion I am still crying while writing this and thinking back on it.<br /><br />This book hooked me from page one and I could not move until I got to 100%. I just couldn't leave Layken and Will and their families.<br /><br />From the synopsis I didn't think there would be enough romance for me is this book. How wrong was I?<br /><br />I aslo loved the Slam Poetry reference and urge you to have a look at the reading of The Lake poem on the authors website, it's amazing.<br /><br />Gee I just loved this book

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My children, 5th graders themselves, and I have been reading this as our \\"bedtime story\\" for the past few weeks. I cannot say enough good things about this book! R. J. Palacio has created a timeless story that kids and adults alike can enjoy. I've cried while reading and listening to my kids read this book. It has been, by far, our favorite read together to date. Thank you, Ms. Palacio, for creating such a wonderful, beautifully written story! It warms the heart! Makes you smile, laugh, cry, and go thru all the human emotions! Kudos.<br /><br />This book was timely for us because my children just switched schools due to a divorce and they are in the 5th grade. They were able to relate so much to Auggie even though they do not have physical deformities. I can't say enough wonderful things! READ THIS BOOK.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There has been so much speculation surrounding these books.  You're either going to love it or hate it.  I suppose I can understand both arguments.  On the one hand it centers around a dominent that was abused when he was younger.  If you can get past what happened to him and see how it shaped who he's become you start to understand him. Ana is a nieve young women looking for love in her first relationship.  I wasn't at all familiar with the dominent/sub lifestyle but it didn't disgust me like so many other readers either.  Once you got past the dominent/sub part in the first book, you start to see how they both want to make changes in their lives to accomodate the other because they are falling in love.  The love story that develops in the second and third books really makes the trilogy.  It's just a shame that some people are missing out because they can't get past the issues in the first book.  It's definitly worth the read and I will read them all again.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It does have a compelling side but is poorly written.  The characters do mimic twilight not in a good way.  Sadly unoriginal.

0345803485|2.0|This book was originally written as fanfiction on a Twilight site to explore Bella and Edward's sexual and emotional relationship.  So the feel of the story will be familiar if you've read the Twilght books.  The author changed the characters' names and took out the vampire elements.  What you have left is an under-developed character of a young girl with a crush on a 20-something guy with gray eyes and copper (?) hair.  The book sounds like it was written overnight with no character development or editing.  The sex is hot the first time it is described, but there is no depth, so basically you get to read the same scene over and over again.  It leaves you feeling bored and sad because you feel sorry for the characters.  Their lives are based solely on each other and their co-dependency.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />Christian was abused as a kid, and as a result, he *needs* to hurt women.  He *needs* the S&M.  Is this explored and explained?  No...  Let's look at it from 12 different angles and come up with nothing--that is basically what happens in the book one and book two.  There is no exploration into the depths of his pain beyond what you could reasonably assume.  The S&M portrayed is what you can guess based on it's definition.  You walk away from the books feeling like you could have written a better one---and you're not even into S&M at all.  An author needs to write what he/she knows, not what she makes up.  This author even sets the story in Washington State when she's never been there (she's in England).  Someone--anyone--could have written a better story.  And now this will be a trend, so there will be tons and tons of books on this topic to be published in the next six months.<br /><br />Nothing new is presented here.  The writing is weak and contrived.  You won't get anything out of this book beyond an initial cheap thrill, which will then turn into sadness because it's such a waste of time (for the characters and for you).  The way Christian'scharacter is written, he sounds like a woman instead of a man.  No guy is going to walk around saying \\"are you mad at me?\\", \\"are you still mad at me?\\", \\"Please don't be mad at me...\\" and apologizing all the time.  No man of his supposed sophistication will ever let himself say such weak things, I don't care how insecure he is.  There are better ways to establish his insecurities than to make him sound like a teenage girl.  Let him have is mystery and darkness like a man.  Let us feel his masculinity.  Show the reader, don't TELL the reader.  Parts of the book felt like walking through the grocery store and Ana telling us what she thought of the cans.  Painfully dull and simple.

I couldn't expect what happened in this movie and how he kept this girl.<br />I don't want to tell what the movie is about but I have to say that you will not regret watching this. It is a great movie and it may cause on you a conflict about why and how things happened... which I think is what makes it so good./<br /><br />Me encantan las películas de Almodóvar, son muy refrescantes y no comerciales. También me encanta Antonio Banderas quien hizo un gran trabajo en esta película. No pude esperar lo que pasó en esta película y cómo él mantuvo a la chica.<br />No quiero contar de qué trata la película pero lo que tengo que decir es que no te vas a arrepentir si la ves. Es una muy buena película y puede que te cause conflicto sobre el por qué y el cómo las cosas suceden... lo que considero la hace así de buena.
1423113462|4.0|First I must warn you, Do not be fooled, this may say it's book 1 of a series but it doesn't stand alone very well. It's the spin off of Percy Jackson and the Olympians and to properly understand the world our heroes live in I would high suggest reading PJO first. Mostly due to our first flaw: nothing is explained very well, because it was written for fans of PJO who already got the whole \\"the greek gods are real and alive\\" explanation. Now onto the review!<br />Despite any flaws that I will mention, I enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The Story:<br />A couple of months after Percy's showdown with the titan lord Kronos, three halfbloods turn up named the pretty and tomboyish Piper McLean, the comic relief with a tragic past Leo Valdez, and the leader of the trio Jason Grace. They each have their own problems, and through a quest they become closer, discover a new threat which wishes to destroy camp halfblood, and find out that our beloved Percy Jackson is missing. Yeah that's something that I didn't like about the book the characters that we grew to know and love aren't in it almost at all.<br /><br />The Characters:<br />Jason Grace wakes up one day on a school bus with no memory of who is he. Interesting but poorly executed, he's not very interesting or likeable. He's brave and loyal but little else, and I have no clue how I'm supposed to interpret his actions, why does he do what he does?<br />Piper McLean is the daughter of famous actor Tristan McLean. I like this character but I will address some flaws mentioned by other reviewers.<br />1. She doesn't have to work for anything- I don't agree, she does seem to have a little less struggle than the other two characters but she is brave and willing to do some pretty crazy stuff to help the one's she loves<br />2. She's whiny- I disagree, it is a little hard for your typical middle class teen to relate to someone who's the daughter of a celebrity and those issues but if you just knew her and talked to her you wouldn't be able to tell any of her issues because she DOESN'T complain about them, she doesn't like them but talking to her you wouldn't know it. Either way let's put you in her place. Presto Chango now you're a 15 year old girl who has a parent who's to busy to spend time with you almost ever and sends you away to a school for delinquents and Get's made fun of for her heritage<br />3. She pulls a knife and demands an unarmed tyrant to duel her or stand down- Uhhhhh...do you not understand the concept of duel? If the said tyrant agreed to duel they would set a time, go to an arena and bring weapons. Okay Piper was not just saying fight me unarmed, reading the book do you think her adversary would agree to the duel if she didn't have any prompting?<br />4. She doesn't have to make this huge choice at the end- Another \\"uuuuuhhhh...\\" one, what do you think should have happened? Betray her friends or betray her family? if she had to pick either one there would be always be somebody unhappy who thinks she's awful for her decision.<br />I think she's a intelligent, brave, and loyal girl who realizes that skin deep beauty is useless and does her best to stand apart from the crowd.<br /><br />Leo Valdez is by far the best character in this series so far. He is the cause of most of the humor but despite his light hearted personality he has had a hard life and I don't think I can say much to talk about him that hundreds before me haven't said. I seriously don't know anybody who dislikes Leo. There are those who HATE the entire PJO series but if nothing else love Leo as a character :)<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />There are many flaws in this book so just to go over a few<br /><br />1. Jason's backstory is really fanficy<br />2. None of the side characters are well developed<br />3. The tough situations they get into seem pretty rushed over. Not much detail and they aren't very well fleshed out<br /><br />There isn't much to say, if you liked PJO and the Kane chronicles I'm sure you'll like this too if not...why are you reading the sequel series to a series you didn't like to begin with?
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much it was fast paced and a great summer read.  I was disappointed by the ending.  I would recommend this book to all mystery lovers.
1423113454|3.0|I am fourteen and a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series, so I know Rick Riordan's strengths and I couldn't wait to read this especially after reading the description. I however was greatly disappointed in this.<br /> PJO feature's interesting likeable and reasonably realistic characters. This story is told from the point of view of Carter Kane and his younger sister Sadie, neither of which are interesting, likeable, or realistic. Carter is bland and just plain boring while his sister is OBNOXIOUS. I am not a member of the focus group that decided that being a smart-mouth makes for a strong female lead. The rest of the characters aren't much better most are either cartoonishly goofy or just as bland as Carter, with the exception of Zia. Also Bast is a lot of fun despite how over the top she is, and her frequent references to frisky's. I also like the concept behind Anubis but he's pretty bland.<br /> The story had so much potential but it was poorly executed. Mostly the two leads along with Bast and Zia travel around the world trying to find their father. They go somewhere, someone tells them they should go somewhere else, and repeat the process.<br /> Another of Rick Riordan's talents is humor, PJO was a witty story with a loveable goofy sense of humor. This has the same kind of humor but just isn't as funny. Sadie's smart alec remarks are supposed to be funny but only got a chuckle a few times.<br /> I think the concept has potential and if these same things bug you I'll let you know that the second book is much better, I even might have a place in my heart for Sadie. And though I haven't had a chance to read it yet my sister says the third and final book the Serpents Shadow is even better. I have hope for the story and I personally will at least try to finish the story.

1400052181|5.0|It's hard to review The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks because 1) it's non-fiction and 2) I really enjoyed it.  It's hard to write a review when there is so much to say but I am trying to prevent spoilers.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot tells how a Henrietta Lacks unintentional became one of the most important women in science by dying of cancer.  But that is just part of the story.  The real story is about the children that Henrietta left behind and their struggle to understand what happened to their mother and the secrecy surrounding her contribution to science.<br /><br />For a non-fiction book, I really connected with the people in it.  Normally with non-fiction (and history) the events have already happened and I consider myself more of a watcher.  I don't root for the individuals in the story.  But I found myself connecting with Henrietta's children, especially Deborah, and rooting for them. Hoping that they someone would finally give them the information that they wanted on their mother.<br /><br />For those that do not have a science background, do worry.  Skloot made all the science behind the Henrietta's story understandable.<br /><br />To finished this in two days and did not want to put it down.  Which is something that I don't often say about non-fiction books.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation:<br /><br />This is a must read.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't sure that this book was going to live up to the hype, but I loved the story.  The romance was on par with Bella and Edward and left me thinking about this book for several days after I was done.
0061992860|5.0|Great book with great info. Being ex military and going thru several servival schools this books has a lot of good info. If you do any kind of camping or building a BOB bag this book is a must have!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I would suggest it to a friend for sure. I wish it would have gone on longer to tell more of the boys story, but I think it's best that it stopped where it did, hopefully you can imagine a decent happy ending :)
B007R41E8O|4.0|pretty good. Just figuring out what to do exactly or where to go is the first little challenge. The special effects are a little low quality because although the Characters are 3D, their faces don't move when they speak. Despite that it is still a cool game if you like eerie puzzle games.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book.<br />Once you start reading the book you never want to put it down till your finished. You fall in love with the characters instantly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Needless to say, the \\"50 Shades\\" series is a phenomenon!  I have already read Books 1 and 2 and am now on book 3.  I love the story, and reading how their relationship is progressing.  Most of us who have read the book(s) will tell you that as you read, the sex sections become a little old - sometimes I find myself quickly skimming through them.  But, don't get me wrong!  I LOVE everything about these books and will be VERY sad when I'm done with the series.  My boyfriend will be sad too, as he probably benefits a bit from them!!!  :)
1592537251|5.0|Love this book! I have been looking at it for months and months trying to decide if I might like it and finally ordered it - I think of myself more as a nature sketcher. I am very glad I did. The wide variety of sketching/painting styles offers something for everyone. I find it a real inspiration to get out and experiment. There are some sketches with clean simple lines, some detailed and accurate, some very loose, colorful and interpretive. I wish that the text of the artists and their methods was in larger font (I am over 50) and that there was more of it, but it is just packed full of sketches. I find myself seeing new sketch subjects everywhere now (old buildings, constructions sites, local shops etc)and always have a sketchbook and art supplies with me. I can spend hours leafing through it or studying one sketch. A great find.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Very interesting movie well worth a look at. Robin Williams is excellent playing a Dr. Robert Denero plays a great part playing a person asleep yet awake.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading the glowing reviews of the book, I figured it might be interesting...Big mistake.  The writing style is awful, and in spite of it being some 500 pages long, the characters remain flat and we gain no real insight into their psychological makeup.  And since I had already bought the second and the third books, I read them, too, thinking that she might give more insight, the books might be better.  But alas, it was a waste of time.<br /><br />On of my pet peeves is that the author continually uses British expressions for American characters from the Pacific Northwest, which I find extremely irksome.  And what dialogue there is repeats over and over.<br /><br />Here, save yourself some time:<br /><br />Ana:  I'm so innocent, yet I'm attracted to Christian because he's HOT.  I don't know whether I can deal with his lifestyle.<br /><br />Christian:  I need to teach you how to be my sub, you need to be safe, and to do what I tell you or you'll get spanked.<br /><br />*insert random infraction by Anna, her worrying about how Christian will perceive it/react, followed by an extended sex scene with BDSM variations*<br /><br />REPEAT...ad infinitum.<br /><br />There you go:  you have now saved at least 15 hours of your life that you could otherwise spend doing something more profitable/entertaining/intellectual as opposed to wasting time on this badly-written drivel.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|I bought this flick at the recommendation of Amazon. I thought my mother who was born and raised in central Germany in 1936 would enjoy it as a belated Mother's Day gift. Having received it in the mail yesterday and after watching it twice, I'm not sure how much she will like it. I know she will enjoy the language, the setting, the landscapes, the old houses and the dress of the actors, but the storie-line leaves alot to be desired. After a big, suspenseful buildup throughout this 2 hour and 20 minute work, the film wraps-up in about 2 minutes and we are never given the answer to the mystery that is presented. I googled the location, Traeglitz, and I see where it takes place in the former East Germany, more so than in Northern Germany. So if mom doesnt like it, I'll blame it being an \\"Ossie\\" (Eastie) movie.  Apocalypto is a much better movie, I wish Mel Gibson would revisit this storie-line and direct his version.
B005ZUR724|4.0|very good until update time comes; mmos must update; problem here is that is says you must update it to log into the server; but the kindle says there isn't an update. so you must wait until. the kindle says there is an update; so you need alternatives when that happens. but apart from that- it is flawless; incredible; and the most perfect app for your kindle fire; it requires Internet access so unless you have 4g or 3g you must be at home or near a wifi outlet of friend or family. not something to be played on the go unless you had 4g and a very long 'go'  nonetheless; overall awesome app.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was excellent with a crazy twist at the end could not put this one down and I can fully recommend this read.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Paranormal Mystery at its best!<br /><br />Big Props to the author for turning this paranormal urban fantasy into one big ass tale-spin of a mystery. Like the Fae Characters in the story, Karen Marie Moning wove an illusion having the readers second guessing how the story was to unfold and what Mac truly was right up to the very end.<br /><br />Over all, the whole series kept the readers interest long enough to get them hook enough to get though each book to the end leaving a shocking cliff hanger and adding to a bigger plot. Was it the perfect series, Not really, I felt the author, though can write smoothly spent too much time keeping Mac in la la land as she reminisced about her past during important questions between her and Barrons which made parts of the story boring and the reader impatient causing me personally to skip through pages.<br /><br />But what made it interesting is the history behind the Seelie and UnSeelie Fae, about the creation of the book, about the creation of the species, and most importantly about the UnSeelie King and his beloved Concubine legends resulting in the future ends of our human earth which only Mac could solve.<br /><br />There were so many twist and turns in the story that once you thought you had it figured out something would happen and throw that theory out the window.<br /><br />There were a few shockers in the series that kept the story suspenseful and mysterious. The killing of Barrons to begin with had me reeling but later we learn he can't be killed and comes back to life. The beast Barron's really is with the three horns was amazing and made the story paranormal as he was able to shift from being to human. Then Lord Master gets taken out by a hunter. Christian turns into an UnSeelie Prince from eating Unseelie and preforming druid magic and is lost in the Silvers, Then the whole deal with V'lane and his deceit, the Unseelie King and his power, the Concubine still being alive, and Mac finally finding out what she really was in the end made for an mysteriously awesome story.<br /><br />All I can say is that this series totally gives a new take on the Fae giving a new meaning on the Seelie (Good) and UnSeelie (Evil). To top this off, there were several quotes in the book that speaks for the whole series and for life in general as we relate it to our own world. Here are a couple that stand out for me:<br /><br />\\"Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, then there are those remarkable rare addictive ones who just bring out the most, of everything.\\"<br /><br />\\"Most people are good and occasionally do something they know is bad. Some people are bad and struggle ever day to keep it under control. Others are corrupt to the core and don't give a damn, as long as they don't get caught. But evil is a completely different creature, Mac. Evil is bad that believes it's good.\\"<br /><br />My favorite characters from the story are definitely Barron's (totally hot), Dani (she was fearless and had me cracking up with her news papers and dont give a crap attitude) and then of course I like V'lane even though he ended evil in the end.<br /><br />Great read for a Young Adult age 13 and up.was in the end made for an mysteriously awesome story.<br /><br />All I can say is that this series totally gives a new take on the Fae giving a new meaning on the Seelie (Good) and UnSeelie (Evil).

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. For the comment about the bottom bar u have 2 go 2 options and it will appear.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book originally because of poor reviews.  However, since most of the ladies where I work were reading it I decided to just go ahead and start it.  I found that I couldn't put it down.  While some of the scenes are rather graphic, and the type of relationship Christian wants is not something that I agree with, you can't help but fall in love with Christian and Ana.  In fact, I feel like some of the negative reviews are because the book wasn't graphic enough?  I don't know, but you can wrap me up a Christian Grey and put him under my Christmas tree. ;)
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I am loving this new album! I already knew that Adam Lambert had a spectacular voice, but add the dance beats and the funk sound on several of these tracks and the result is a fantastic album.  The ballads are particularly personal and poignant, and I honestly think Underneath is the most beautiful ballad I've ever heard.  You WILL NOT be disappointed!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!  Wonderful character descriptions and interactions.  I love the email exchanges that Christian and Ana share.
0547569653|4.0|This is a great motivational book for runners, along the lines of other books written by ultrarunners.  Like others have said, this is not a how to book, but more of a story of the author's personal journey through life and running.  The author not only writes about his running and life experiences but discusses how eating a plant based diet has helped him.  In fact, in an each chapter, he includes a favorite vegan recipe.  As a runner, this book was an interesting and fast read (5 stars).  Non-runners may not find it as interesting as it is somewhat of a niche book (2 stars for non-runners).
B0073LWEXK|2.0|it is a point and click that is very easy to use and you just point and click like it says (only adding this on. because I need more words)
B003FBMS4W|4.0|Great Movie, classic John Wayne. The part where Ethan gets asked about Lucy after he found her body is JW's best moment.
1250000971|5.0|Mr. Archer does not need my praise in order to sell books!  I confess to being an unabashed, unapologetic, commited anglofile.  Archer's books are great adventures into English culture and recent history. His characters are so well developed as to make them your personal friends (or hated enemies!) as soon as they appear on the pages of his entertaining novels.  Archer is clearly in the top handful of fiction writers of this time and the Clifton Chronicles only continue his mastery of the literary scene.<br /><br />Kindle makes his books available at a reasonable price...and, if there was not such a thing as Kindle, I, for one, would gladly pay any price for the hours of entertainment Archer's books provide.<br /><br />Hope I am still around when the third book is published....next year????
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger games is great fun. Reading the Trilogy altogether makes it one seamless story. Like the movie, this Trilogy is great finger food for the mind...easy to read, simple to follow and enjoyable for what it is.  Get all 3 and you wont be disappointed. Take this story in with one large bite and your reading hunger will be satisfied.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app...now my Bible is always with me. Any version I want anytime....no wifi  or internet needed! I love the devotions too.
1451673442|5.0|In my opinion, THIS book is what \\"The Secret\\" was missing.  I understand \\"The Secret\\" focused primarily on the Law of Attraction thus it's subject matter, but many practitioners of that Law become disgruntled because they lack the attitude of gratitude.  I love Rhonda Byrne.  I am thankful for her, her supportive team, and her profound prolific ability to put this information out there in an easy-to-read and easy-to-digest format.  Broken down into 28 consecutive days, this book enables the reader with the power to deeply ingrain gratitude into the psyche from where it becomes habit, and habit promotes the reception of many good things in life through constant practice of this much-needed and oft-forgotten mindset.<br /><br />If your life is lacking, if you know there is something more that you just can't put your finger on, READ THIS BOOK.  You will thank me later.  ;-)
B001E45XT4|4.0|These headphones, about 25 dollars are definitely worth the price.  This only problem I have is it feels a little tight.  Its probably just my head though.  The sound quality is great and the wire is pretty long and durable.  The headphone isn't too heavy but it does look pretty wide.  Other than that, I really like this product and hope this will last me a while.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Really enjoy this CD, Lady Gaga probably the best duet partner on here suprisingly enough!  Will have to look at his other Duets CD now!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I've never written a review for any album. But Adam's new release is so amazing that I feel so compelled to write something. This album is absolutely mind blowing. There is so much depth to every song. His voice is breathtakingly beautiful. My favorite is Underneath and Out Laws of Love.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I don't know that I can accurately describe how I feel about this book and it's follow up POR, but I'll try! This story grabbed ahold of my heart strings and didn't just tug, it yanked! I cried, I laughed, I hoped and I held my breathe! It was such a wonderful tale that you wanted to be plopped right there with them in Michigan, close enough to see Lake kick the garden gnome and Will sneak over and steal it to prevent further incident! I love the characters in this book. I love the message, the way the story unfolds and the undying love between these two souls who were forced to grow up much too young! Kudos Colleen, you know I got mad love for you!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have listened to this cd already.  Each time I listen I have a new favorite.  I guess that just means I love them all and rightfully so.  Adam has really outdone himself.  Get the deluxe version, the bonus tracks are awesome!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|The first word grabbed me and I was spellbound til the last sentence! Jamie does such a fabulous job of drawing us into Travis and Abby's life that you don't ever want the story to end. Kudos Jamie McGuire...this is one I will definately return to, often!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved It. Saw Hunger Games and wanted to read Catching Fire before the movie came out. Wonderful series. Can't wait to see the next movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really don't like needing my Fire connected to wifi just to play a game.  I prefer games I can play anywhere. Otherwise it has the same fun addictive qualities I found in farmville, but has the Ice Age characters I love.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|First off I loved the movie, mind benders I've always liked but Its one thing to have a directors cut and whatnot and 99% of time its better then the theatrical release. The dvd version is the real ending. I hated the ended in the blu ray, what they needed to do with the blu ray if they were going to do thing a;t ending is have it randomly go to either ending and blu ray is capable of that. An infant strangling itself is not believable on any level and just ruined the entire movie. The original ending of breaking off any relation with Kailey at age 7  and showing some unknown connection to each other as they passed on the streets decades later was actually believable and the story made some kind of sense even with the dozen or so holes in the concept.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Great DVD for a great price. Bought it just for the film. If your looking for extras, I suggest the other versions that are available.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was very well written, but I can't say that I enjoyed it. The story line is intriguing, but I had to quit reading it before I tried to go to sleep because it caused anxiety! I read murder mysteries all the time, but having children of my own and experiencing the terrible tragedy that this family went through was just too much. I really hated that the mystery wasn't resolved at the end. My mother has been wanting this book and I told her to pass - I knew she wouldn't like it.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This movie is great! Heath Ledger's performance in this film is memorable. Everyone is great, except for poor Maggie Gylenhall. Aaron Eckhart is amazing as well. Not too many extra features but that is why I bought the single-disc version, no fuss.
0345803485|5.0|I'm sure this book is as pedantic and predictable and shallow and vapid and repetitive as many reviewers have previously mentioned.  I haven't read it and have no plans to read it.  But I encourage you to let your wife, girlfriend, partner, significant other, etc, read it if they so choose.  You will reap the reward(s) when the book is put down for the evening...  Cheers!
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|This sleeve fits the Kindle Touch perfectly.  Sturdy construction.  Soft interior to protect screen.  I should have bought this a long time ago.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|i love this game soooooooooo adicting i got it at 10pm qnd the  next time i looked at my clock it was 430
0345803485|4.0|Growing up I was hooked on romance novels, and to this day when I start them I go into some \\"zone\\" where I don't want to do anything but read the book.  Its like an obsession - until I get to the last page I zone everything else out.  This is what happened to my with these series - finished the first one in 24 hours, then the second, and just now the third.  Thank God I'm finished so I can go back to my life!<br /><br />This book has been getting alot of bad reviews from my friends who write sex blogs.  The thing is, when I'm reading a sexy romantic erotic book, I'm not looking at how well it is written (it is not written very well).  I am not looking at how real the characters are (they are never ever real.  they couldn't be - real life is just not like this).  I'm not even looking for a good plot (most romance novels, and this is no different, follow some basic patterns and plots).  I am reading these books because I want to be titillated, excited, turned on.  I want to fantasize about a different world where there are Christian Grays, and I of course could be Anastasia.  This book did this quite well.<br /><br />If you are on a beach, or a vacation with your husband/partner, this would be a great book to help with the \\"foreplay\\".  Not intended for serious reading and literature.<br /><br />-Debi Oulu<br /><br />p.s. - In regards to the BDSM part - I felt like it dealt very well with the basics and am glad to see a mainstream novel including it (and like the rest of the book - It too is not very realistic :-)
B002RI9L76|5.0|As a matter of fact, I love the story so much, that when a friend borrowed the paper version I had -only not to return it, I got it for my kindle. Have read the book at least 3 times already, look forward to enjoying the kindle version this very summer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Reviewers have called this \\"mommy-porn\\". I think it is just porn written from a woman's point of view.<br />\\"A rose by any other name...........\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it took me a while to finally get it but now that I do it is the best game on my kindle other than ice age village of course but u should consider getting it esspesialy since it is free
B0083GPDBO|1.0|Acting: C<br /><br />Action: B<br /><br />Plot: A<br /><br />Ending: C<br /><br />Sex Scenes: None<br /><br />Language: Moderate<br /><br />Violence: A<br /><br />Worth a rental or Purchase: D<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the movie. hate the fact that it is like watching someones home movie. The whole thing is filmed by a handicam. Movie had great potential but the low budget hadicam turned me off completely. I would not have rented if I knew this was how it was filmed.
0307959856|1.0|I have loved P. D. James previous books. They held my<br />attention all the way through. This one after two chapters<br />I am thinking, what on earth is this all about. The<br />narration is wooden; takes ages to get any real idea of who Darcy is and Elizabeth's wandering musings about all<br />the family made it boring very fast. As I stated it took me two chapters to know my interest was completely gone.<br />I am relieved I didnt pay full price for the book when it<br />was just out.
0670023329|5.0|This book is disturbing in its description of the brutal conditions inside one of the most repressive countries on the planet.  How this man managed to survive the camp as well as escape is astounding.  Based on my experience, the account rings true.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I've never been so fascinated by any artist until Adam Lambert. After listening to him, my ears are just got spoiled.  If anyone watched Adam Lambert on American Idol season 8,  seldomly can deny his amazing voice and the natural showmanship, but I was blown away by many of this pre-idol performances such as theatre work \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\" , \\"If Anybody Listening\\" and what he does in Wicked - LA production.  Since then I glued to him, see his ups and downs, follow his Glam Nation tour, and dream of the day that the whole wide world will recognize tihs one of a kind of talent like I see.  His first album For Your Entertainment was out in about 2 months during his IDOL tour, and barely has one or two TV promotions before it came out, this one, he got time on his hand, and he was patient!!!! He pushed the release date twice to perfect it. Some of our fans are becoming kind of impatient, inculding me, but we stay strong and waited, and waited, and wow, it didn't disappoint!!!  I love the concept of light and dark side: half of the songs (like Shady, Pop that Lock, Kick In and Trespassing) took you to dancing floor and forget all the troubles, and another half dig deep inside of your emotion (Underneath, Running....). My favorite track is Trespassing, Shadey, Pop that Lock, Broken English, Underneath, Running , Take Bake & Nirvana.... Oh, can I just say all of them:-)<br /><br />One critism that I've heard so far is the variety of style that Adam's album include... To me, it is why I love him, and why his Album or his live shows are interesting - not one song is the same, and even one song he will sing different almost each time.  If they're about the same, I will just buy single. In addition, it shows off his one of a kind of talent: he can sing like  broadway star, rock star or a pop star, and he got the look, style and personality made him just one complete package.  You can pick a lot of male pop start out there who has the complete package!!<br /><br />Anothercritism that I've heard is that it is not the ROCK album that they expected.  I get the disappointment for those we love Adam as a rock god, but you can't give it a ONE star review just because he didn't make a ROCK album. You should review it based on POP. It is clearly listed on iTunes & everywhere as POP album.  E.g., I don't go rate a ROCK album that it is not pop enough, or rate a country album not ROCK enough. Adam likes pop and rock. He always gives the songs some rock edge when he performs live, and you can look forward to that. Also he is performing with rock legend Queen's remaining band member Brian and Roger this summer in Europe, and one with Elton John. The rock Adam is still rocking, no doubt about it!!<br /><br />Ok, if none of what I said here or the snippets convinced you, please give it a listen at adamofficial.com for the entire album and decide!!
B007SSEGNO|5.0|The episode has all the earmarks of a classic Bones case. A high tech bad guy uses electronic data to take control of almost every aspect of Brennan's life, including fabricating evidence to frame her for murder. Special FBI agent Booth along with every member of the team chase every clue to exonerate Bones before she is to surrender to the authorities to answer the charges. Suspense, drama, action, it's all her and of course, it's also the first of a two or three (or more) part story. Like I said, classic Bones.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|This is the best CD that I have bought in 10 years!!!! Almost every song could be a single. Later
B0054JZC6E|5.0|tthsse are really fun games.. but the thing is is that you have to buy the games instead of just having them right there for you to play...
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was amazing!!! The first few chapters are kind of strange and it makes you want to put it down, but then you are intrigued so you pick it back up.  This book is a must read.  You will LOVE it I promise! I would pay $50 a book for these! So so so so so worth it!
0345803507|5.0|After getting through the shock of Book 1, I thoroughly enjoyed Books 2 & 3, and was truly addicted to the story.  I hope more books will come from this series..... So many unanswered questions..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!  The book is not the kind of book that I would pick on my own.  But I had a friend tell me that he loved it so I gave it a chance, and let me say that I'm glad that I did.  It started a little slow for me but then it picked right up and I couldn't put the book down.
038572179X|5.0|This authors is so well-published and widely read and respected. When I read this book some years ago, when it first came out, I knew I was reading great fiction. I went on to read some of his other works. A common theme is how a seemingly random group of events can co-occur and cause a profound, unexpected outcome. This occurs in this novel. This occurs in real life as well, and I think readers can identify with it and marvel, perhaps in horror, over it. This author is truly excellent, and there is not much more to say!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't believe the hype. Worst erotica/romance (if you can call it that) that I've read in many years. The female lead and her dopey \\"inner goddess\\" is truly stupid and irritating.  Boring repetitive sex scenes...ugh. I want my $10 dollars back.  Better erotica/romance novels out there.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Wow I love this album! So many amazing songs, that voice!!!! This is a must have!!!!!!! I am so happy! I cannot wait for the tour!
0553801473|5.0|Unlike many readers, I found A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons great fun and great reading.  It made me admire the writing of George R.R. Martin and I didn't worry about the lack of action.  Martin said that the two books were background story that came before the ending he was planning.  The books are essentially character development and I accept it as such.  In this book, two of my favorites are back, Daenerys and Tyrion.  Daenerys' story isn't as compelling this time.  She is ruling a free city name Mareen and has freed the slaves in the city.  To prevent the other free cities from invading and retaking the people as slaves when she leaves, she stays and plans to marry a wealthy man whose alliance would keep the city safe.  We have already seen what marrying for love has done to Rob, but what are the consequences and benefits to an arranged marriage without love or affection?  Tyrion has escaped King's Landing and has been sent by Varys to join with Daenerys in the free cities.  He runs into Jorah Mormont who captures him to give him as a hostage to Daenerys in order to please her.  They meet up with a dwarf woman named Penny whose brother was murdered in the search for Tyrion.  All three become slaves and perform as a sideshow for entertainment.  Queen Cersei is having her own problems when she plans for Queen Margery to be accused of adultery and treason and finds herself in the same spot.  Jamie, now a nicer guy is riding up North and chooses to go off with Brienne in search of the Stark girls instead of intervening in Cersei's behalf.  Jon Snow is fighting off more wildlings and trying hard to not become embroiled in the War of the Five Kings.  Stannis has taken over the Wall and is planning an attack on the South.  Of course his unlikable personality is a huge problem.  Meanwhile, Tywin's brother, Kevan seems capable of solidifying Tommen's reign into a kingdom people would actually want to live in.  Strange as it may be,  I liked A Feast for Crows a bit better because I really grew to like the Stark girls and found their stories to be very moving and compassionate.  Arya's story does continue in this book but Sansa's story was complete in the 4th book.  The most compelling stories for me in this book were Tyrion and Cersei.  Tyrion has had so much thrown at him all his life that life as a slave is tolerated with ease by him.  He is always secure in his own right and very kind to both Penny and Mormont, a sullen sad man, who is his worst enemy.  Cersei can also stand almost anything but seems to believe nothing will keep her down even when it appears evident that she is lost.  I really look forward to the next installment and will have to wait years like many other fans.  I enjoy the HBO series in the meantime.  Love the series.a bit better because I really grew to like the Stark girls and found their stories to be very moving and compassionate.

0345803485|4.0|There are a lot of reviews written about this book so mine will be brief. It's a sexy book about a handsome, worldly, rich guy who meets a not so worldly but cute undergrad, and the steamy attraction they have for each other. Okay, here's the thing, the writing was not that great, but it did improve (slightly)as you move through the book. I thought Ana was really silly and annoying most of the time but I liked her more than Bella Swan. And Christian...WOW!(He's dark & brooding but alas no Edward-though he does play a mean piano) Before reading FSOG, I didn't know anything about the Dom/Sub lifestyle. After finishing the book, I felt like I needed some Advil, a hot bath, a martini and possibly a Shrink. It was a fun read and I enjoy discussing the book with my girlfriends. Maybe Bravo or VH1 will make a a reality show called \\"The Real Fifty Shades Of Grey\\" and some of my favorite \\"Real Housewives\\" will guest star. I bet Housewife Ne Ne Leakes can snap a whip like nobody can--and I can just see Housewife Teresa Guidice skinny dipping in a tub filled with Skinny Italian Pasta Sauce w/ hubby Joe standing by with some olive oil and handcuffs-just sayin... ;)

B005HGK2FA|5.0|Came across this series by accident. Well-made and acted. If more series were like this, TV would be improved 200%. Don't try to watch more than one episode at a time. Too much to absorb to do it in a marathon (although I may do so once I have watched the entire series). Looking forward to the second season.
B007SGM084|5.0|I honestly could not put this book down.<br />Geez, i wanted the books so i paid for them. i don't understand all the complaining about the price. My rate is for the book. This trilogy took me three days to read considering i had to work two of those. i will give no details about specifics except this book is HOT!!!!

B008011XQQ|5.0|Shape Shifter is an instrumental masterpiece that will be enjoyed by most Santana aficionados and air guitar performers. The tracks capture the classic beat and sounds of the master doing what he does best. Now, if I can only convince my office building manager to switch the elevator music to play Shape Shifter, I might be glad for once that I work on the top floor.
B001KZI2WW|3.0|Well.. I bought this shoe as I'm big fan of Crocs. While it's very comfy just like the rest of their products, it didn't really look elegant, especially that I bought it for work. It's very light which is very good. Overall it's good but consider where would you like to wear it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like it because it's addicting and fun. U get to give your fingers a workout I think. But still, get the free version.
0061801313|2.0|I love the show. Well I loved the show but after a while it's kind of slowing down to me. Like the series is too stretched out. I got bored trying to figure out who A was so I stopped watching the show and gave the book a shot. The book moves way too slow for my liking. If you like the show though I'd say it's worth a shot.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Let me start out by saying I am a Canadian through and through. I currently reside in the USA. But we all fight for the same thing. This movie hit me in the heart when I saw it. Knowing that the \\"actors\\" were real SEALs and the situations were taken from real missions and the real deal playbook. If you have put your life on the line for everyone who enjoys freedom. Regardless of country, you have my utmost respect. I love my country as much as anyone. But I LOVE freedom more than anything else. This movie gives us mere mortals a glimpse into the warriors of today that fight and bleed and die for you and me. This movie truly honors them. No the \\"acting\\" isn't \\"Oscar\\" worthy (whatever that means!) but the movie will touch you more than you think it will if you believe as I do. Buy this movie. I know I am.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book...it took me back to how it felt to fall in love with someone...I could feel the electricity between the two...hot hot hot

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I'm sorry but I hate it when they do an artistic 'leave it to the imagination' ending.

GET REAL..make a real kind of ending you can hang on to.
B0081SRJSY|2.0|Unfortunately a really nice app is spoiled for me by some rather large errors in the scoring.<br /><br />I've been test-driving it and I'm glad that I did.  I've noticed what seemed like some odd end-game scoring, and the last time that I test drove it, I was able to confirm that there are some bugs.  Two of the computer players shared a castle worth 10 points - which displayed correctly - but one of the computer scores went up by 30.  Then I scored 18 on a field - again displayed correctly - but my score did not increase at all.  I had been tracking my score as it increased during the end-game scoring, so I know it didn't add it.<br /><br />Fix them and I'd be happy to buy the app.  Until then...
0345803485|5.0|*******Some Mild spoilers here!******Adult content as well!*******<br />Honestly I really enjoyed this. Could not put it down.<br />This is one of very few mainstream novels about the BDSM lifestyle. And she gets it mostly right. So the book is not for the sexually squeamish. However.....While there is a lot of steamy sex in the book there is almost none of the BDSM variety. There is a lot of referential discussion of it related to BDSM \\"contracts\\" and such but only minor scenes.<br />Christian Grey is very believable as a Dominant, and the main character Ana is well drawn as well. I have trouble however believing her going from virgin who has never even masturbated into a raging sex maniac who has multiple massive orgasms her first time out!<br />One of the better parts is the back and forth e-mail banter between the two main characters. Especially the subject lines and the way he signs his title.<br />So read those closely.<br /><br />But if you are uncomfortable with VERY explicit sex scenes better skip it. I found them well drawn and interesting. Not all that repetitive.

B007EC6FIS|4.0|If you liked the first 2 Keane albums then you will like this CD. They return to their roots with very listenable great sounding tunes. It is worth the purchase for the first 3 songs alone. Keane's original formula works well; it has already become one of my son's favorite albums. I like it quite a bit but can't quite give it 5 stars (e.g. Toad the Wet Sprocket's Dulcinea).
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have 6 mo old twins, so I am short on time and energy, as you can imagine. However, I knew I needed to start an exercising routine and this program is perfect. I didn't know anything about the trainer, but what sold me is how short the workout is. Well, it really is under 25 minutes, so in 30 minutes you can do both the workout and take a quick shower - perfect for me! I am really out of shape, so Level 1 is very challenging for me right now... I highly recommend this routine for new busy moms. This is the workout that you can actually fit into your day.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I've used this app for lengths of time and not had an issue with sound gaps as others have reported. This app is great though and well worth the money. Some of the sounds could be better. The clothes dryer has some noises that sound like they're made by the person recording it etc but overall, it rocks. It's cool that you can pick up to 3 sounds and mix the volume levels for each. You can create different sound profiles and save them! Some sounds seem arbitrary and weird, and I can't imagine them being of much use (loud as hell windshield wipers?!?). Also I've had this app for some years now and there have been no updates where they've added sounds. Ultimately, I'd love for them to add a sort of reverse sleep timer feature (there is a sleep timer feature!) where you can set it to turn on to wake you up! Buy it though! You WILL love it!
0553801473|1.0|Okay, you get a tiny bit of movement in this one, but most of that is accomplished by killing off characters gratuitously, particularly those who have behaved honorably. And that's it.  No wonder he writes so slowly! He's great at starting things off...and very bad at keeping them going. This book rehashes a lot of previous material, to the extent of copying whole paragraphs from Book 4. Frankly, I found myself frequently bored and finally frustrated. Having R.R. for middle initials is not enough to make one an author comparable to Tolkien.
1603429999|5.0|I have tons of knitting books but nothing like this. The pictures are beautiful  with instructions easy to follow. I have wanted to know how to turn flat patterns into circular ones so this is perfect!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I would counsel any good-hearted reader against beginning this series.<br />I will not deny that it starts brilliantly with compelling characters and a richly imagined setting to draw one in. Unhappily, you are doomed to disappointment--if not disgust.  Martin is unable to maintain the many plots he has set spinning atop those tall lances.  The writing deteriorates and becomes repetitive. There is a marked increase of soft porn degenerating into some pretty disgustingly graphic sadomasochism. He just can't write his way out of all the complications he has tried to weave in and so, at the end, he butchers several characters and just drops the others--looking like a failed and exhausted juggler among the shards of shattered plot lines.<br />I know, I know, he sold the beast to HBO!<br />And, frankly they may be able to wrap things up in a more satisfying fashion than Martin. For the sake of all the viewers it will attract I can only hope so.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I would have to say that this is easy one of the best books I've read in my life and I've read hundreds, maybe almost a thousand. The story is beautifully written, simple and sweet...you just cannot put it down until the end...I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoy it from beginning to end. It's a romance but not stupid sheepish romance kinda story, if you know what I mean...it 's a kind of story that makes you have that warm fuzzy feeling in your stomach like when you're in love! :) Recommended!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|when u try to invite friends using facebook it don't work well w kindle fire. this should be looked at. it is fun.
0345803485|1.0|I never write Amazon reviews but felt I must for this \\"bestselling\\" book.<br /><br />I do not understand why this book is popular. I did not want to read this one but it was picked for a book club I'm in so I figured I'd try it. I knew it was erotica, which I don't normally read, but I figured even that genre could be well written so why not. Well, that was not the case here. Not at all.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele meets the wealthy Christian Grey and they begin a crazy affair. But he's so mysterious. What's wrong with him, she wonders? Oh, he's into BDSM.<br /><br />This book is ridiculously long for a plot that should've only filled at most about 100 pages. And it's a trilogy! Christian and Ana keep arguing about the same thing over and over and over. Can she be his submissive? She doesn't really want to but he's soooo hot!! Although most of the book is just sex scene after sex scene.<br /><br />It was really hard to finish this book because it was obvious that this author was an amateur writer (I mean seriously, the writing is awful) and repeated many phrases and words to exhaustion. For example, get used to the phrase \\"my breath hitched\\" a lot because James uses it on almost every other page. Then these \\"characters\\" were nothing more than walking stereotypes. The Latino friend who uses Spanish phrases in every other sentence. The sexy roommate who can attract any man. The shy quiet main character who has no idea how attractive she is...<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but at a point it was just like reading through some woman's justification for staying in an abusive relationship and I found it really unsettling. I have not disliked a book this much in a long long long time. I would never recommend this to anyone.
1594744769|1.0|I hadn't planned on writing a review, but felt I had to side with the one and two star reviewers.  This story had an interesting start, but once it went down the time travel road it lost me.  I can't help picking the time travel premise apart because it is always full of holes.  The use of strange photos was clever but overdone.  I felt like he collected up a bunch of cool unusual photos and decided to build a story around them.
0439023513|1.0|Violence was always the subtext of HG and CF, and there was a reference in the earlier books to a Peacekeeper who exploited starving young women for sex. But Mockingjay ratchets this up to a new level, with descriptions of sexual slavery, and graphic portrayals of the messy deaths of characters we had come to like. (Legs blown off, bleeding to death as the bandages soak thru, etc.) I thought the first two books were edgy but acceptable reading for my 'tween and teen. Having read ahead in Mockingjay, and knowing what's coming, I find myself sorry that I allowed them to start this third book. Mockingjay is good reading, but it is by no means a kid-friendly book.
0345803485|3.0|Though this book is a page turner, there is alot more sex than there is plot. The story itself is mediocre and isn't that great. The book was okay but not what I was expecting. If you're looking for a book that's super sweet and easily lovable ( like twilight ) than this is probably not the book for you. I do like the characters in the book and wish they'd broaden their relationship outside of just sex alone. Though they claim to care and love each other all they do is constantly have repeated sex and frankly it gets old pretty fast.
0439023521|5.0|Blake Bechard<br />  Period 3<br />  5/18/12<br /><br />  Wow, this book is amazing! when I read in class and at home I never wanted to put it down. I had to wait a while to start to read this book because my brother was in love with the book, and he was always reading it. Finally I was able to read it and it was awesome. It amazes me that they would put 12 year old kids fighting against 18 year old teenagers. I also saw the movie it was kind of disturbing in some parts like when I found out that the little girl Rue was killed, and all the other young boys and girls. The dramatic life-or-death plot is incredibly compelling to me. It is exciting and disturbing at the same time.<br /><br />  The setting was is in a post-apocalyptic North America and goes by the name Panem. In district 12 were Katniss, Prim, and their mother. They are very poor after Katnisses dad died in the mine. So katniss has to risk her life by going in to an unknown place where she catches food for her mother and Prim. She also has the help of her good friend Gale that always brings her fresh loaves of bread. Then they find out it is reaping day, which is the day when kids get chosen for fighting in the Hunger Games. When Katniss gets home Prim and her mother are there waiting for her. Just when they get there, they get scanned and then stand there waiting in groups to wait for Effie Trinket to start to call the names.<br /><br />  Just when Katniss thought her and her sister Prim were safe Effie Trinket called Primrose Everdeen. All of sudden Prims face was blood shoot and as white as a ghost. she was walking up to the stage when Katniss screamed, I volunteer. Effie Trinket said WOW! That is are first volunteer in district 12. Next name was called Peeta. To survive this game you have to have the heart to give to the audience and believe in yourself. You have to be careful who you trust. Her and Peeta show the crowd that they love each other. But only one person can win the game so Katniss had tobe smart and use all of her brain to think of how to trust and how to play the game.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|Ridley Scott can flat out make movies.  They're gritty, compelling, violent, often grotesque, and they possess a rugged, material realism.  To see a table of food in a lord's hall teeming with rats engorging themselves while two men are engaged in conversation and oblivious to the vermin is Ridley Scott to the max.  And Scott's version of ROBIN HOOD is an adventuresome tale that focuses more on the political machinations that create ROBIN HOOD the outlaw; there's not much robbing from the rich to give to the poor (what's known nowadays as wealth redistribution)--instead, the story portrays a thwarted French invasion of England, along with a corrupt king's betrayal.  The ending--if one would care to call it that--lends itself to a sequel, perhaps giving us the story of ROBIN HOOD universally familiar to all.  And such a sequel would be eagerly welcomed by this reviewer.<br /><br />The cast is superb; Scott has a knack for getting Russell Crowe's \\"A\\" game, and this film is no exception.  Cate Blanchett is equally good as Marion Loxley, although her participation in the climactic battle scene requires far too much suspension of disbelief.  The supporting cast is stellar, which includes heavyweights William Hurt and Max von Sydow; other noteworthy performances are turned in by Mark Strong, Oscar Isaac, and Eileen Atkins.  But I especially enjoyed Robin's hearty band of misfits, including Kevin Durand (Little John), Mark Addy (Friar Tuck), Scott Grimes (Will Scarlett), and Alan Doyle (Allan A'Dayle).  These performers furnish the story's essential comic relief, and their chemistry is as fluid as it is believable.  Scott gives--as usual--stunning visuals and sweeping vistas; ROBIN HOOD is a rousing adventure and a whole lot of fun.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I was 12 when she performed in Central Park.  My parents saw the show on TV.  Listening to the Supremes and then solo Diana Ross songs on our summer road trips always made me happy.  As much as I love Beyonce, there would not be a Beyonce without Diana Ross.  I have watched her NYC concert over 5 times now.  When does an artist become an icon?  When they fully command 400,000 people and you can tell how amazing those 2 concerts were from her amazing performance and the audiences roaring approval.  I was so touched by her performing \\"Aint Not Mountain High Enough\\" on the first day when it was pouring massively.  That, my friends, is an icon!!!!!  My favorite quote from the day it poured rain was \\"It's taken me a lifetime to get here.  I'm not going anywhere!\\"  I can't stop watching the DVD it is full of love, fun and a little bith of naughtiness!!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|Have you ever really looked at an animal in a cage? Have you ever wondered what they are thinking?  For the people in the Nation of Panem they know the feeling of entrapment.  Panem is a nation located in what used to be called North America. It is made up of twelve districts that all surround their shining capital of corrupt power.  Each district is enslaved to do a certain task for the capitol providing the capital with supplies and power, while the people are left in severe poverty and treated like slaves. For Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen-year-old girl, life is not easy. She lives with her mother and little sister in district 12, the coal-mining district. Katniss is a strong and resourceful young woman who is brilliant with a bow and arrow and works outside the rules of the capital, as much as, she can get away with.<br /><br />The capital is always looking for ways to show off their power and control over the people in the districts. Their greatest display of power takes place during their ultimate reality game show, the Hunger Games. The rules are simple, but the price is dire, they must fight to the death until only one remains. Each district is forced to relinquish one boy and one girl ranging from the ages of twelve to eighteen to participate in the game.  This large display from the capital, treated like entertainment, is beyond cruel and inhumane.  Forcing children to kill one another on TV, shows how unequivocally ice cold and appalling the capital is.<br /><br />This book is not like any other novel out there right now; it is insightful and meaningful to the real world today.  It could be named my generations Fahrenheit 451 and 1984. Everyday our rights are changing and being more and more controlled by the people with power and money.  This book shows that idea in an accelerated way with a horrifying twist. However, some of the ideas are not that far fetched. Suzanne Collins had the concept for the book one night when she was flipping channels and was switching from reality TV shows and the news.  This book is a gripping and enticing read. You will not be able to put it down. So, make sure you have enough time to devote to reading and have the next book in the series on hand and ready in the wings.  Prepare yourself to follow Katniss on the twisty and horrific adventure of her lifetime.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed this series, even though I am in my 60's. Quick read and made me look forward to the next book.
1451627289|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King off and on since the 70's.  I really believe he's a writing genius.  I have to say that this book, 11/22/63, was not only his best book  (that I have read by him), but also one of my all time favorite books.  I couldn't wait to sit down and read, didn't want to put it down, and was very sad that it ended.  Very satisfying read. And if you think Stephen King is too scary, don't let that stop you.  This is not that kind of book.
B007S278QC|4.0|I figured for 9 bucks I would buy the kindle edition of this as I didn't feel up to spending over a hundred on a real copy.<br /><br />The book itself is very interesting, reminds me of Fantastic Planet.<br />But it's a bit frustrating on the Kindle (for PC in this case).  You can't zoom in or examine any pics more closely, and it looks like someone just slapped it down on a desktop scanner and scanned it in.<br /><br />It should have been a higher res copy with better editing.  You can see the wrinkles on pages where they didn't get it flat on the scanner.  C'mon folks, you buy a copy and tear it apart to make a good high res scan if you are going to do it this way.<br /><br />So 5 starts for the book itself, and I'd go a 2.5 on the quality of the Kindle edition.  I'm averaging that out to a 4 in this case.  It would only have taken a few more hours to really make a GREAT copy.<br /><br />I feel for 9 dollars it's worth it.  I still plan on buying a paper copy some day.

B000B5OD4I|1.0|I ordered the watch from Amazon, there was nothing on the listing about the watch being shipped from Asia. And now, due to a defect in the item and no fault of my own, I must pay the out of pocket expense to ship the defective watch back to Asia.<br /><br />The watch was defective on arrival. Despite being worn all day on the wrist, it would still die at random times. Only a firm shake would get it going again. I have several automatics as well as hand-wind watches and this is the first time I've had a problem with a mechanical watch. I am sure this is an anomaly given Seiko's reputation for bullet-proof reliability and high QC. I had ordered from Amazon because I like their hassle-free return process. In this case, however, since the watch is NOT sold directly by Amazon but by an affiliated third party in SINGAPORE, the return process is not so easy. The seller advised me I'd have to ship it back on my own dime, no pre-paid shipping return label, and they would only reimburse me up to $10 USD despite the fact that it will cost me upwards of 20 bucks when you include tracking and insurance. What a dissapointment. I should have ordered the item from another domestic retailer or a US based seller on that big auction site. Sure, I would have paid a small premium but the level of customer service would have been much better.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|excellent game! the world map controls could use a little more fine grained control.  Be sure to park your vehicles a little distance away from towns b/c it took me 53(!) times to try and enter my airship right next to the town.  however, the fact that I was willing to keep trying just showshow awesome this game is!

B000EGF0NW|4.0|It is possible to start reading Lucky by Alice Sebold under the misunderstanding that it is a novel. As the opening pages unfold with their description of a violent rape, it might be just another crime novel. The horror is tangible, the sensations evoked predictably nauseating. A few pages later, when the reality of the book's memoir becomes clear, however, the initial reaction seems to become one of embarrassed over-statement until, that is, the work's true and admirable complexity begins to emerge.<br /><br />Alice Sebold was eighteen years old when she became a rape victim. An academic father and an unpredictable mother had been perfectly good parents, despite their own failings or limitations. Similarly, it seems, Alice Sebold became a complex victim, on the one hand the completely innocent and wronged party who had been wantonly violated by a violent criminal, but yet on the other a person who somehow, via her own quite unremarkable behaviour and lifestyle, could not immediately endear herself, even via her victim status, to those who might offer sympathy or assistance.<br /><br />Perhaps sympathy could never have been enough to diminish the grim reality of Alice Sebold's experience. Only empathy might have helped, and that was largely impossible. But the subtlety of Alice Sebold's account of her experience of rape and its aftermath is precisely her ability to empathise with others who had similar experiences and who had, at one stage or another, fallen victim to one of the pitfalls on the way to justice.<br /><br />There is the subject of consent, of course, an issue that cannot really be judged when no-one else was present at the time. There is the issue of identification and having to be confronted again by the assailant. There is the issue of character and trustworthiness of the victim, qualities that inevitably are clued from lifestyle, attitude and deportment.<br /><br />And where does consideration of such things lead when the act of rape was not actually conducted at knife-point, when the victim cannot identify her assailant and when she openly begins to sleep around, use drugs and get drunk? Alice Sebold's Lucky deals with all these issues and deals with them with subtlety and interest. But overall the victim's involvement is paramount and it is this sense of sharing in the experience that is the book's greatest and perhaps enduring achievement. There is doubt and insecurity to be lived through, alongside the continuing pain, as well as revolting physical and mental horror. Lucky takes the reader frighteningly there in an engaging and compelling way. Sometimes life takes you where you do not want to go. We are not blessed by such experience, only by the ability, eventually, to cope with it.y conducted at knife-point, when the victim cannot identify her assailant and when she openly begins to sleep around, use drugs and get drunk?

B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|One must wait for this movie to be either a gift , or maybe pay a dollar . The only thing it did for me was to put me to sleep . Maybe Sominex sleeping pills can add this film to their product ; IF YOU BUY THE ECONOMY SIZE , YOU GET THIS FREE MOVIE ! I can see it at wallgreens pharmacy section now .
0307949508|5.0|I started with the first novel of the series, and had trouble getting in to the book, but when it did take hold for me, I couldn't get enough. This installment was no disappointment, just takes off at a fast pace, and the intrigue just keeps building to the end. I really liked it more, I think, for the fact that Lisbeth's life experiences are laid out, so you can see where she is coming from. She is such a mystery in the first book, and this one seems to answer the questions that I was asking in Dragon Tattoo. It leaves you with the question, of where she will go from here. So, going on to the Hornet's Nest is a must.  If you love fast paced mystery, and action, then I will highly recommend this book for you.
B007G5H2HQ|3.0|Everyone kept telling me how hysterical this film was. I waited until one night when I was by myself and wanted something cute and funny to watch. I should have picked something else. This wasn't very funny to me at all. Kids may really enjoy it but I was super bored.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this cover to cover - fantastic read and one of the best books I've stumbled across in a while.  Read it on my PC Kindle reader and Windows Phone - was great - worked flawlessly and always synced to last read page no matter device.  One of my first full ebooks - and loved the story, writing, and format.  Great writer - highly recommend this book.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|my partner is and we both really enjoyed this one. I also managed to learn quite a bit about baseball and now we watch the Cardinals together on MLB.tv via our PS3. I understand what is going on in the game a bit better because of watching this and now we have something we can watch together, nearly every day, that doesn't bore us both to tears.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put it down...very good read, interesting story line...I came wait for the movie, even though I know it won't be as good as the book!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|not much difficulty to the game...would be a good game to occupy the time of a child or an adult
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all three. Red them all twice already. I actually missed the characters when I was done reading and had to read it again.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is fun &amp; addicting.  But I have same problem with not being able to exit my kindle fire without shutting down. Also agree that parental controls don't work. But even with shutting down I play daily! I have been able to visit random friends but with restarting game which is annoying.  Would be 5 stars once these bugs are fixed.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|this app would really live up to its potential if it would add an eraser feature. PLEASE developers! !!! I hope that a soon to come update will remedy this. And there also needs to be a comma available on the keyboard- seriously.. why no comma!!?? But there are many features that make this truly great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hard to put down.  I am not normally a fan of these types of books, but this captured my interest in the very beginning and kept it throughout the triology.  I highly recommend all three books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great finale to a great series. I just do not like that Prim dies and Peeta and Katniss become fire mutts. Other than that it is a great book.
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|I saw this movie with my friend a few hours ago, and we had a blast. It was a hilarious good time. I watched a few of the original episodes to psych myself up and to understand the storyline, but I couldn't get into it. Soap operas aren't my thing. After seeing the movie, it makes me wanna try and watch them. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a boring melodramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice.<br /><br />In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Veronica Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to return the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!

B006GECE9Y|5.0|The Dolphin Browser is the best browser you'll find anywhere on the Android. I use it with my tablet all the time and I find it very useful. You can put it to desktop mode, Android mode, or just regular mobile mode. When using desktop mode the browser really looks like I'm using it from a computer. The best thing about it is that it can play flash unlike other browsers. So, you can watch any video online. It is the BEST!!!! The best app ever.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where to begin?  The prose is laughable, the main character highly annoying, and if she talks about her inner goddess one more time I'm going to scream.  This book had potential had the author developed a better main character as she did Grey (although for such an enigmatic bad-ass he is so sappy at times), had the book editied (refers to a subject line in an email as \\"Difficult Women\\" when it was supposed to be singular, \\"woman,\\" and stop with the \\"Holy Moses\\" lines from the main character.  I couldn't help thinking, this is a woman who is agreeing to be a submissive and the extent of her shock is reflected in one single phrase, \\"Holy Moses!\\"  The cheese factor was unbearable.  I simply cannot believe this is a NY Times best seller.  If this passes for excellent literature these days, our society is simply doomed.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this camera bag for my DSLR (Nikon D90) after purchasing some extra lenses. Currently the bag holds camera with lens, four extra lenses and Nikon flash. The front pockets of camera bag is big enough to carry a 13 inch laptop (Mac Air) and  Amazon Kindle. The bag is built with a high quality material and very modular depending on equipments you have. The best part of is that this bag is not branded with logos of camera manufacturers, which is key for not attracting attention from potential thieves.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|Comfort was the main reason why I bought this set of cans. A long time ago (2001) I got  a pair of Sony MDR-605 (discontinued) and were very comfortable for wearing them for hrs without feeling the usual pressure pain given by the pads of a smaller headphones like the (Fanny Wang FW-HEADPH-1001) which sound great using an android smart phone or perhaps an iPod; but, after a 3 or four hrs had to take a half hr break to let my ear's blood circulate to get rid of the discomfort from the pressure between my ears and the pads. The K-702s have big round foam pads covered with some velour cloth and fit fine around my ears (big) and put the contact of the pads on my skull but they are not pressured by the spring action of the arc over your head like the Fanny Wang's, this headphones rest their weight on top of your head by a padded (bumpy) arch which is not super soft but not uncomfortable either. Unfortunately because of this comfort feature if you nod/shake you head left and right you will feel the headphone's pads move along so they are not stable if you plan on doing sports where your head will do a lot of shaking and those pads will definitely get soaked with sweat. I use them only indoors and mostly sitting down at a computer and they are very comfortable for hrs. They do require good juice to appreciate the power of the drivers and something with a tiny amp such as a portable device (droid phone) will not suffice to do this.  As stated in other reviews they require a long break-in period and needless to say they sound great.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I think that it was a good app cuz it told me the weather. and I think that it is helpful because. when my mom says it is going to be 50&deg; fairenhite I say no write now it is 78&deg; so the highest weather it is going to be about 102&deg; so I put shorts on And a tant-top.
B0071WQ7WU|3.0|I own all of Shinedown's albums and was expecting another strong rock album. I was disappointed. This album is not by any means bad, it's just not up to par with their previous work. I really feel that \\"Bully\\" is just a top-40 inspired piece of pandering garbage put on the album because it fits the current \\"cause celeb\\". \\"Adrenaline\\" is probably the song most closely resembling any of Shinedown's previous work and even it feels like it is missing something. The whole album just feels like it was done by an American Idol winner - not Shinedown.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its a good game, and loved the fact that when the soccer stadium came, you could place bets. My only issue with it, is after spending money on the game, and getting alot of people, over 700, the next day I play it. It gave me an epidemic of disease that never had been taken care of by the hospital, fires that were never taken care of by the fire dept, and trash that was never picked up, despite having all set up for those issues.<br />So when I do the clean up, and mind you, I did this 3 times, I was cleaning up, even deleting things, the game would wind up freezing up, and music would stop. I tried doing this during the day, and the last time, towards the end of the day, I gave up, and wound up deleting Virtual City Playground out of my Fire for good.<br />Its a shame, I did enjoy playing it, and am disappointed how it froze up, and couldn't play it anymore. So I won't be paying for anymore G5 games in the future.
0316098329|3.0|I appreciate the author's efforts, but I had a hard time engaging with the book. I don't care for the child narrator. His use of language is very annoying. For the most part, the child is exposed only to his mother, and she speaks perfect English; she also reads to him, and he watches TV. He has very advanced vocabulary and comprehension skills for a five-year-old, so there's no plausible reason for him to speak as if English is his second language. It grows tiresome very quickly.<br /><br />At times, when the writer wants to get something across to the reader, she uses the child to say it, and it's often an idea that's far beyond the child's level of maturity. For me, this made the book very gimmicky and contrived. I found the characters very flat and under developed, and many of the scenarios were unbelievable.<br /><br />I kept pushing through the story hoping that at some point it would engage me, but it never did. If the author had used a different narrator or presented the story from a different POV, I probably would've been more engaged.
B0063GORYU|4.0|lots of fun and addicting as well.  this has taken the place of solataire on my pandigital.  wish i had more fun time in my day.
0743298039|5.0|A slow and somewhat uninteresting start, I was sure this was going to be a 3 star book at best. By a quarter ways through, I was positively hooked. I wish I could give it 6 stars for superb storytelling, complete closure, and a beautiful command of the language.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really good book also was a really easy read!!!! Great book .... Can't wait to get to the second book... Then third
0061170623|5.0|I listened to the audio book version, which was fabulous. If I had picked up the book, I'm not sure it would've held my attention. The Cockney accent and Nadsat vocabulary made the listening all the more pleasurable. It doesn't take long to understand the teenage vocabulary; most of it can be understood from context clues. Alex is an arogant, vicious, brutal, sadistic little bastard who thrives on the worst kind of offences toward others. He's a character you love to hate. I won't re-hash the plot, but my take away from the book is: If you take away a person's ability to choose, you take away their humanity. Humans must choose to do good, otherwise they become like a mechanical, wind-up toy, a clockwork orange.<br /><br />I've noticed since reading the book, I have an overwhelming desire to use the word \\"horror show\\" as an adverb, so in my best Cockney & Nadsat: Clockwork Orange is well horror show and a feast for me gulliver. So, my brothers, farewell, forever and ever, amen... and all that cal.

0307712508|4.0|I loved the book. I can't believe I'd not heard of Henrietta Lacks before now.<br /><br />For me, there were a few drawbacks with listening to the book on CD. Skloot herself doesn't read the book, but she makes it clear at the outset that she will use Black dialect whenever dialogue is happening, which is fine, but since the investment was made to hire an artist to read the book, it should've been one who could produce an authentic sound. All the Black characters were voiced the same - male, female, young old - didn't matter. They all sounded exactly the same and often bordered on buffoonish. It became tiresome very quickly.<br /><br />Also, with listening to the book rather than reading it, I missed being able to pull my eyes away from the page to absorb and make sense of the text, which would've been helpful on the science parts of the book, especially Gartler's contamination findings (which I'm still a bit fuzzy on).<br /><br />Another drawback, though not limited to the audio version, is Skloots need to give background information on almost ALL the characters. For instance, I really didn't care to hear the life history of the lab assistant and how she came to work in Gey's lab at Johns Hopkins. However, I was hesitant to FF through these extensive histories for fear of missing something important.<br /><br />In any event, none of these things were deal breakers for me, and I commend Skloot for taking on this gargantuan project. I've read many reviews of those who feel the telling of the Lacks family history was unnecessary, and that Skloot should've stuck to the details of the HeLa cells and their effects on medical research, which, to me, sounds very much like a textbook. I never would've picked up such a book.<br /><br />At the end of the audio, Skloot actually gives an interview that sheds light on how the Lacks family's story got woven into the book, and how the daughter Deborah became the central figure, neither of which had been Skloot's intention. I appreciated the story much more after hearing this interview.<br /><br />I know the sentiment has been raised that neither Henrietta Lacks nor her children deserve anything because Henrietta didn't DO anything. I think the greatest thing Mrs. Lacks did (other than exist) was seek medical attention instead of dying at home in her bed, which is exactly what many Blacks did back then. I also believe that her family should've been informed when researchers discovered the miraculous nature of the HeLa cells.<br /><br />In the Afterward of the book, Skloot does an excellent job of discussing where we are today in regards to the ethical and legal ramifications of cell research, patient consent, and patenting of one's cells or tissues if they will be used commercially. Turns out, people who have found that their tissues are marketable and profitable seek compensation, and there are those in research and law who agree that they should be compensated. Of course no such discussions existed in 1951, yet I think it's unfair to accuse the Lacks boys of simply being out to get money.<br /><br />I believe the Lacks children's reaction to the HeLa cells was a combination of their limited education, their inability to understand, from a research perspective, what was happening (they couldn't differentiate between their mother's cells and their mother herself), and mostly I believe they reacted the way they did because they are a part of a people who have historically been on the receiving end of abuse and exploitation. To leave the Lacks children in the dark was to deny them their family legacy of being able to say, \\"This is what our family has contributed to the world,\\" and what could be more incredible than that?<br /><br />4.5 Stars
1612130283|1.0|This story was not my cup of tea. There were a lot of things I didn't like but what bothered me the most was the dominan/submissive relationship between Christian and Ana. I don't like the way Christian was tracking her cell phone, showing up at her house uninvited, ordering her food for her, forcing her to eat, showing up at her job, making her sign a contract, buying her clothes and forcing her to wear them; this list goes on and on.<br /><br />I also think this is a bad example for young girls who read this. Ana starts to change Christian, but in real life I've seen a lot of girls get hurt thinking somehow they can change a man who has issues. A man that controlling and damaged is likely to abuse women or else having them working the corner calling him daddy.<br /><br />Growing up my role model was Lara Croft tomb raider so naturally I like my heroine with a lot more bite than Ana.<br /><br />The sex didn't get it for me either. Once again not my style.

I am not someone who plays a lot of games and thought I 'd at least get one game for my Kindle to try, and since it was free, I had nothing to lose. After playing one game of Solitaire, I got so hooked that everytime I have some free time to myself, I play a game or two... or more! I even play it in the middle of the night when I am plagued with insomnia! This is a great game really worth trying out. I truly recommend it to everyone.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I saw the movie, \\"Hunger Game,\\" before I read the three books. I<br />thought the movie did a good job, and followed the first books<br />well with, of course, a lack of depth.  As I was impressed with<br />the story in the movie, I decided to read the books.<br /><br />The one review I read spoiled a bit of the second book for me, so<br />I'll try not to do the same to you.<br /><br />The author hits you with many twists and turns.  Some sharp<br />corners. I love to predict, and I admit I did not do a good job<br />of predicting while reading these books; though I had a couple of<br />\\"right-on\\" guesses at the end. Still, I think those sharp corners<br />may catch you up and make you jerk. So, I give the series high<br />marks for keeping the story going. It makes you want to keep<br />reading.<br /><br />One of the things I found very interesting was the author's<br />absolute dedication to first person.  If Katniss doesn't know it<br />-- you don't know it.  If she's not there, neither are you.  You<br />are never let in on any side story or private conversations that<br />Katniss isn't told about or doesn't hear.  Though I can't say<br />that Katniss' view of what's going on is always right.  She<br />certainly works at it -- in her own paranoid way.<br /><br />The politics are interesting.  I enjoyed the interwoven politics.<br />Personally, I think the author takes a bit of literary license in<br />the contrived 13 districts.  I don't believe the politics could<br />exist. And there I fall into my own trap -- I want a little more<br />reality.  I love SciFi. I grant literary license in liberal<br />doses; but this... I don't know.  I couldn't accept the District<br />concept.  And, what happened to the rest of the world?  Unknown,<br />unmentioned -- not considered and not part of the story.  Why<br />should I even be concerned? I accept that.<br /><br />I like my SciFi science to blend.  The Capitol could do so many<br />things, and yet could not do others.Mutts!  I hated the larger<br />Mutts.  The wasps and birds were ok -- the story used them both<br />well. But the others? I couldn't reconcile them with the science.<br />Sure, they added some adventure; but, the extended science wasn't<br />there.  If the Capitol could handle genetics that well, they<br />should have been able to do so much more. The science wasn't<br />\\"blended.\\"  And... don't try and tell me this wasn't SciFi!<br /><br />As for Katniss' mental state (and other character's too), I just<br />can not accept that they would get so messed up.  I can't say too<br />much --it would spoil things; but come on!  Katniss was STRONG.<br />Then why so weak?  I loved her strength and hated her weakness.<br />Her strong side was a well painted and believable character.  But<br />her weak side (and others), as often as it appeared...<br />unacceptable (to me).<br /><br />So in the end, I only give it 3 stars out of 5.  I read it<br />straight through, took little time off.  Wanted to get back to<br />it.  Was thoroughly entertained.  Got my money's worth.  I'm even<br />looking forward to the continued movie series.  But it's not<br />going high on my list of books that I've read.  I think I'll keep<br />the Anne McCaffrays Dragons of Pern series in my head long after<br />I have forgotten The Hunger Games. Treat this trilogy as<br />entertainment -- for that is exactly what it is.  (All this hard<br />hitting social commentary stuff... nope!)

B007K87C4M|1.0|Waiting for something dramatic to happen but instead my ear drums  started corroding---consider that SW's GFD and OPETH's HERITAGE preceded this monstrosity of dullness--it was a real let down .  Needless to say sometimes the individual egos can't deliver the magic other band members bring to the music regardless if they are credited for the compositions or not---in PT the other boys supplement SW's compositions with a vigor not seen in their solo efforts--the magic of opeth is the chemistry between MA and his bandmates--his musical talent is mediocre without the band.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001OFM2A6 Worlds Within]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006UFHFWK Organic Instrumentals]]
B000069HZP|3.0|This movie is surely entertaining, from beginning to end. However this does not deserve a five-star rating for several reasons. I expected to see more explaining at the end of the movies. The character Christine said to Van Orton (Michael Douglas) that there is a \\"safety net\\" on every plot and scene in the game. But how the safety net was done is never known. It was as if the game has proceeded in a very precise path, without unexpected twists on Van Orton's part.<br /><br />My conclusion, however lacking of explanation this movie is at the ending, still this is an entertaining movie worth watching.

B0002O7XVI|5.0|While I agree with one comment that stated the DVD transfer does the movie an injustice, it still remains my most favorite.  It may help that Thomas Hardy is one of my all time favorite authors.  His use of the English language in written form is an art unto itself.<br /><br />It first came out for public purchase in VCR, two parts. The VCR was better.  Having to jump up to change the cassette wasn't.<br /><br />Roman Polanski did an incredible job visually.  From the opening scene of the fields to the end scene with Tess walking ahead of a police officer on horseback, every scene has a visual beauty to it.  A truly remarkable skill with his camera. He especially captured the complexities of the characters extremely well, in my view.  Tess isn't such a victim, even though we taut her as a victim.  She is passionate.  She has a strange sense of loyalty to unwritten social rules yet there is a sort of free spirit side to her personality.  D'urberville isn't such a cad and Angel isn't such a righteous man.  Angel came from a clerical family and was ready to prove that the trappings of religion could be cast aside without fear of loosing one's moral pinning. Angel, in righteous indignation, casts Tess aside and D'urberville is ready to make things right with her.<br /><br />Polanski captured on screen an essence of what Hardy depicted in words.
