B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Kick-Ass -> Hit-Girl = uses mainly a pair of  Heckler & Koch, double sided detachable blades, rope dart and a pair of balisong butterfly knives (we can't forget her using her sweet little girl looks to deceive the gangsters). Swears like a sailor, acrobatic movements, fast, precise, very professional, determined and deathly, she's a legend and a ghost in the crime world (at least for Damico's gangue) and can show some tenderness when the occasion allows for it. Body count 40 villains including a whore (could be 42). WTF factor = 20/10 (+10 she's a real super hero (like her dad) in a no super hero story, WTF(Dave's expression in Rasul's apartment)?). Fighting crime along with her dad also added her some extra weirdness.<br /><br />Kick-Ass 2 -> Hit-Girl = Uses mainly a nunchaku, double sided detachable blades, a Glock 17, knives and an adrenaline shot. Swears like a teenager,acrobatic movements, fast, precise, very professional, determined and deathly. She's a troubled teenager, bullied and is stuck under a promisse, she's changing into a woman and starts developing feelings for Dave, which she already showed some interest in KA. In the end she understands she is Hit-Girl and Mindy is only her persona. Body count 10. WTF factor = 15/10 still breath taking though softened up a bit and no Big Daddy this time (I guess I miss Nicholas Cage a lot, he should've done some cameo). Well I believe Mother Russia should be equivalent to ten men.<br /><br />Kick Ass 2 is great entertainment specially for those open minded viewers that long for something other than vampires, werewolves and Marvel and DC characters (not saying they're bad, they're great actually, just think they deserve some rest so other ideas can also have their chance on the big screen). A bit of a letdown for die hard fans of the First Kick-Ass (who miss the stylish direction of Matthew Vaughn) but nonetheless a great sequel for the most beloved original and if worked \\"properly\\" (if they listen to the fans) KA3 would be a great ending to the story.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />P.S.: The scene where Hit-Girl takes on Mother Russia after the adrenaline shot reminds me of AZUMI where there's a scene in a forest where she moves fast while the ninjas moves in slow motion just to show how faster she is. Also the corridor scene in Kick Ass (1) is similar to the end in AZUMI where she needs to fight about 200 men to get to the \\"BOSS\\" (Bijomaru). If Azumi had a little more camera work and editing would've been a much better movie. But still good.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|3 days...that's how long it took for me to read this book (which at least by my standards) means that it's a worthwhile read!!<br />Thank goodness I was reading this during the last few days which I had off from work...otherwise I'd be performing on very little sleep...lol.  The plot was fantastic - so much detail that allowed the characters to really develop fully & completely was very well done.  I think that in other books that I've read that included as many storylines, characters & so much detail...it can get confusing or overly repetitive.  In my opinion, this author does a great job at weaving the plot & the details together.  It's done in such a way that allows you to really become invested & to ultimately feel as though you are reading a book that is complex in a rewarding sort of way.  I'm already on the verge of purchasing another of this author's books, that's how much I enjoyed this!
B0092C2X7U|3.0|I mean, sure it's not an action heavy game. I wouldn't expect it to be. It's replay value isn't incredibly low, either, if you like ragdoll physics.
1447231171|5.0|I am hooked on these chronicles & am anxiously awaiting the next one.  It would make a great mini series.  The son isn't as clever or mature as his father was at his age but the situations created for him are fascinating.<br />NLL, Erie PA

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been playing this game for too long. my daughter loves it. It is fun without being time consuming and the graphics are really nice.
B00EQRPFGC|5.0|At first I thought it was a remake from Lady Sings the Blues but then I listenened to it and I had a spirtiual experience!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is just a great action movie overall.  It has some major fight scenes and you really can't go wrong with hot guys in uniform.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it :) its a great game! Its def recommended to play any age can play this game. Love it
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I used to watch Dr. Who as a child and loved it!  I am so excited that I am now able to catch up on the new series whenever I want.  Thank you so much for making this available to Prime members for Free!
0060555661|5.0|This is not a book you can read overnight. This is a book that is about finding out the value of a company.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Incredible history class. They uncovered one of the most important political assets  and shared their undying love of our country and the presidential office. Thank you.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My only regret in reading this is that I didn't read it sooner. It was a masterpiece of love, heart and human culpability. I never wanted it to end. Told in the narrating voice of Death, it was original and uncommonly insightful. You would be hard-pressed to discover a book as unique and as heartwrenching as The Book Thief.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a women's book, not just a career women's book. I also read Virginia Wolfe's &#34;A Room of One's Own&#34; recently, and was fascinated by the comparisons and parallels.
B001DF68MA|4.0|We love this little seat! It fits perfectly on my husband's bike. It's very small though, so I'm not sure how well it would fit taller/larger kids.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of the main reasons I wouldn't buy an iPhone - no SwiftKey. This latest version is phenomenal - the text predictions aren't just based on your history, but on current events and trending topics. Try it - you won't go back.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Quality, Quality, Quality<br /><br />Do not let the price scare you on any RAM Mount products, in my opinion every item I have purchased from Ram Mounts has been well engineered and produced.  I would recommend this item and other RAM items to everybody.  I have purchased many different RAM items and I am amazed that they do just what they are supposed to do. Some items are simple and I have said \\"Why didn't I think of that\\" others are complicated and my thought was \\"I never would have thought of that.<br /><br />Do not waste time or money, buy Ram Mounts the first time, I have never been disappointed
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|While I understand why it would need the permissions it is asking for, I just feel that there is too much potential for it to be abused.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this app a month ago and every time I make a survival world and play on it, the world turns in to creative. Now I can't make any survival worlds anymore and everything I built is lost! Please fix this!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I was extremely pleased with how this was done.  While I was a bit miffed that this made my HD Collection obsolete and disagree with how they handled the two releases (since this would have been better from the get go), I am extremely happy with this collection.  As a big MGS fan, it was wonderful to see the original two Metal Gear games, and then to get the full MGS series.  The artbook isn't anything too special though as all it is is the promotional ads for the games and not concept art or anything like that.  The discs work well and I've been able to enjoy my favorite video game series.
160774273X|5.0|This book will have you making bread like the big boys.  I have made lot of bread but was never happy that they did not turn out like the artisan breads with the big holes and nice chewy crust.  Follow Mr Forkish simple method and you will impress all of your friends and/or they will be questioning you where you really got the bread.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What makes a great read?<br />When it's very hard to put down.<br />Kept me laughing and on the edge of my chair.<br />Andy's technical detail was convincing enough for a techno illiterate, such as I, to<br />keep up without being overcome by too much consideration of its authenticity.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Still reading this book.  I guess I'm hooked now.  Can't wait to finish and start the next one.  Also really looking forward to the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting I love it. I can't stop playing it and I love how you get to tour around the world.
0316077046|4.0|Didn't read this as it was a gift. However, person that I gave this to did read it, really liked it.
B003TXSF5C|2.0|As usual, Professor Hawking explains the structure of the universe as a highly informed and extraordinarily intelligent person. He is, accordingly, an historical figure. He loses scientific stature, however, by imposing himself into existential questions outside of the realm of science. He appears to be so convinced of his authority that he offers opinions outside of his expertise and without a scientific basis. He has made other decisions lately regarding where he will visit, publicly available, which are purely political and inappropriate. His stature, for me, is diminished.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Awesome CD!! If you like one song you will like most of them on this CD! I dont know anyone that doesnt like their music ha ha ha
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Excellent DVD and excellent price.  Our granddaughters loved watching this.  The DVD was in excellent condition and played well. It was new.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I am using this light to light my doorway at night when coming in from the dark. I have it mounted in a protected area and it is working great.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This DVD is absolutely wonderful to teach your young child instruments and classical music pieces.  After our granddaughter saw this,  we saw a video on you tube where students played &#34;Waltz of the Flowers&#34; by Tchaikovsky.  Our granddaughter recognized the piece by name and said, &#34;I know this music!&#34;  She is only five, but recognized it being in Fantasia.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Really surprising look into prison life for women.  Very thought provoking.  Thought it would follow the show, but very different.  Highly recommend.
B000F8O35U|5.0|One of Disney's best.... music is fantastic!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Lots of twirling plot lines, sometimes hard to keep up with. Lots of unanswered questions that deliver us to the second book. I'm used to reading adult themes. This didn't have any sexual situations in it and still held my interest.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|We love this movie and were happy to get it at a good price.  The only problem we had was the previews had flaws in the DVD, but the actual movie was fine.  We could have returned it, however, we felt the movie was ok and decided just to keep it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have never played a game on my husbands ipad...until now.  My sister introduced this game to my 6 year old...and she was so excited about it--I decided to see what all the hubbub was about.  I started getting excited to see what breeds would come out next!  I decided to start my own dragon park--partly because as cute as my daughter's park is, my OCD brain wanted to keep straightening out her pathways.  I'm totally addicted (in a good way).<br /><br />Here are the pros and cons as I see them.<br /><br />PRO:<br /><br />--graphics are cute and colorful<br />--baby dragons are totally adorable and inventive, and as you feed them and they \\"grow\\" they change form; the designs of the myriad dragons are very well done and imaginative<br />--the game is designed rather brilliantly...you don't need to spend a dime if you are patient (although, I've probably spent about $15 total on gems...totally worth it though, esp getting started).  There is just enough instant gratification with the gold collecting combined with patient nurturing that makes you really want to take care of your dragons & park--the time needed/patience is just enough to make you truly enjoy it and want to cultivate<br />--decorations for your park are really fun--and the more time you put into the design, the more visitors you get; the more visitors, the more money, the more money the more dragons etc--pretty brilliant<br /><br />CONS:<br />--can be a major time suck!  It's addictive.  But it's a time suck in a good way...very relaxing to design your park the way you want to make your dragons thrive
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Totally addicted, have already ordered the next season. Good writing, good acting, and the fully-fleshed characters I look for in any series, especially those I'm buying for my permanent collections.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Enjoyed the characters and family stories that were interwoven with historical events. Can't wait for third book in the trilogy.
B00846REIS|5.0|This series was very good.  A little more real.  Still out there but very good.  I would recommend the whole series.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|This version of Wyatt Earp does not whitewash him.  As amazing a lawman as he was, he was certainly less than perfect, and could actually be quite surely.  His instincts about people were right on!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another great addition to,the series.  I would recommend the whole series.  The new book just came out.  I wonder if this is the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For everybody that has written a review for what the product is not, I wish to counter them with what the product is.  But let me first start by saying: no, it isn't a Roku.  If you are wanting a Roku, buy a Roku.  What Google claims the Chromcast does, it does well, especially for the price, and I can't wait to see what things it will do next.  I have tried all the features on it and I am pleasantly surprised that everything worked just fine.  Netflix, Youtube, Movies, and Music all worked just fine.<br /><br />Setting up the device was slick.  I used my Nexus Galaxy phone and it connected right up with our home network.  I haven't had one problem with connectivity on my phone, my wife's IPhone, or our IPad.<br /><br />Future apps look promising and it is only going to get better.  One app that I would love to support for but won't happen any time soon is Amazon VOD.<br /><br />Some people will say that you can get a Raspberry Pi for the same price or a Beagle Bone Black for $10 more and it will do everything this does and they are right.  But there is a learning curve associated with the process and it doesn't run as smooth as this does.  So unless you are a geek and don't tend to get frustrated when you can't figure something out with electronics, get the Chromecast.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I could not put the book down. The author writes with such clarity and intrigue that you actually feel as if you know the characters, that you are actually in the story as a third person observing. The twists and turns takes you on such a ride that you are not sure how the tale will end. And, when it does end, you are sad to come out of that world back into your own. The writing is exceptional.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|our grandson loves this truck. The 1/16 scale is great and the features are amazing. We bought two other Bruder items for our grandson and you should see his face when he opens the package. I just wish these were around when I was a young boy.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The old App was much better. I miss the old layout and the hourly weather info. Bring back the old style weather App.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|You should totally get this app it's lots of fun upgrading sharks and I haven't had any bugs. I would recommend touch though... -Ak
B0037QM8YA|4.0|I don't know how many times I felt the need to stand in front of my TV and kick the main character's mother in the face. Couldn't have been less than ten.
B0079T9HL8|5.0|The price may seem high when you consider ordering, but after using the system on a animal photo safari through a bamboo forest with challenging terrain it was absolutely essential. It allowed me to carry two canon bodies with heavy lenses without fatigue or neck strain for a 5 hour hike through steep terrain and mud. The systen keeps the camaras at your finger tips and closely restained to my chest and side so as not to be entrapped in brush on the trail.  I was always ready for quick photo snapping and got spectular shots.  My chest vest had a manufaturing defect and I called the company and they sent me an overnight repalcement immediately at no cost to me- Extraordinary customer service. The other accessores included in the kit (hand/wrist strps to attach to the camera bodies were excellent.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|While not as page-turningly interesting as the first two books of the series, this one definitely has its moments of brilliance.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game is amazing! A true \\"game\\" most games that come out now make you buy extra things like costumes, or even worse when they take things out of the game to sell to you later as DLC. Making you feel like you can't have the full experience without paying for more things. Not with Persona 4 Golden. It's a Vita remake for a PS2 game, but has a lot of added things even a new vacation scene. There are a lot of extras for after you beat the game. New characters. and the best part... a new ending that I have yet to see. ( no rush right won't be getting Persona 5 for a long while. )<br />If you have a vita ( I bought one for this game alone. ) Get it!
B006BAEQB2|2.0|My problem with this novel is that I absolutely disliked the main character, Anne Neville.  She irritated me no end with her utter devotion to the idea that she should be Queen of England, no matter how.<br /><br />Her father, the supposed kingmaker, was an absolute opportunist who turned his coat whenever it appeared his own power might be questioned in the English court.  Loyalty?  Honesty?  Integrity?  He had none of these attributes, and in the end neither did his daughter.<br /><br />My feeling after reading this novel was Anne Neville deserved all the unhappiness that haunted her in the end.<br /><br />And as for Richard III: I don't find him this misinterpreted figure in history, as is the modernist concept.  He too was an opportunist in the end.  He did have loyalty to his brother Edward IV.  But the minute Edward himself was gone, he was all over the possibility of making himself king instead of Edward's heirs.  And I do think he was responsible for killing the princes in the tower.  There will most likely never be any indisputable proof one way or the other, and yes Henry Tudor also had much to gain by the \\"getting out of the way\\" of the young York princes.  However, it was Richard who had them in close keeping, and the argument that they posed no threat to him after he had them declared bastards is ludicrous.  They would ALWAYS have posed a threat while alive, and I am more than certain that opportunist Richard was very aware of that.  So I do think he was the one who had them done away with, and that Henry Tudor knelt down and thanked God that his rival for the English throne had done him such a favor as to kill those boys.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I loved how the twists and turns left me with NO IDEA what was going to happen next. Lounging in bed reading this late into the night I had to stifle my urge to shout, \\"No way!\\" at the surprises in this story.  Very original.  Excellent writing. Thank you, Hugh Howey.  Keep the books coming!  I am a fan.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This is definitely the weakest book of the series thus far.  It's still a good read, but it does doesn't have the same flair.<br /><br />I have to admit I had zero interest in the Dorne stuff.  Sorry, but it was just boring.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great read and a great lesson for middle schoolers! Hopefully children will learn to be more compassionate and have more tolerance for those who are at a disadvantage.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I played the game and I found it very addictive! I also think the glow+sound effects go great with the game! :)
B004W1GCQO|5.0|The smoke breaks are the best!  Love it all: script, casting, direction, sets, costumes, lighting, pregnant pauses, history, and the incredible attention to detail.
B00CPWTRAA|4.0|For the past four or five decades, two tenors have dominated the operatic scene: the late Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. Pavarotti may have had the more thrilling voice, but Domingo had the richer, more versatile voice. It's always a pleasure when the man releases a new album.<br /><br />The back cover of Domingo's latest CD (2013), titled simply Verdi, explains that \\"for the first time the world-renowned tenor has released an album of baritone arias--an exceptional document of Domingo's discovery of opera character new to him, and a tribute to Verdi, who has played a crucial role in Domingo's career. `Verdi is a wellspring of great music, and every lyric singer is grateful to him. So for me this recording is a special celebration and an act of thanksgiving and love toward Giuseppe Verdi.'\\" What goes without mention here is that doing an album of baritone arias is also a nod to Domingo's age, as the man is now in his early seventies. Not that I believe he isn't still fully capable of doing tenor arias; just saying. Besides, he has already recorded every major tenor aria there is, so perhaps it's best to give him the benefit of doubt.<br /><br />Anyway, Domingo provides well over an hour of music on the album, eighteen tracks from nine different Verdi operas, starting with \\"Perfidi! All'anglo contro me v'unite!\\" from Macbeth. No, these aren't the most-common numbers for non-opera fans, and as I have less interest in opera than I should, I found most of them only vaguely familiar. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that Domingo has the talent for them.<br /><br />As always, the voice is still strong and flexible. The intonation remains remarkably accurate, and the tone smooth, mellow, and mellifluous. What's more, although these are baritone arias, Domingo's natural tenor continually manifests itself. Some minor tremolo creeps in at times, whether intentional or not. It's not distracting, and many listeners will welcome it.<br /><br />And so it goes through further selections from Rigoletto, Un ballo in maschera, La traviata, Simon Boccanegra, Ernani, Il Trovatore, Don Carlo, and La forza del destino. The voice remains relatively strong, and if anyone doubts the power, one has only to listen to \\"Si, la mia figlia!\\" to learn otherwise. The control is still there, the projection, the phrasing, the precise articulation and control, even at his age, if not always so exacting as in his prime.<br /><br />As important, the poetic qualities of Domingo's voice continue to manifest themselves. Listen to the lyric flow of \\"Di Provenza il mar, il suol\\" or \\"Il balen del suo sorriso,\\" and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Some good, reasonably realistic sound complements the issue.<br /><br />John J.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Ms. Moriarty has crafted a complex psychological thriller in the Husband's Secret!  I absolutely loved every plot twist and turn, and the ending took my breath away.  I can't recommend this book enough; if this book is your cup of tea, I also strongly recommend The Silent Wife.

0345530578|1.0|After reading almost every other Grisham book, I kind of question whether he actually wrote this.  Normally, the story is tight and the characters are interesting - multifaceted, quirky, and imperfect.  In The Racketeer, the characters lack depth, the plot is creative, but completely unbelievable, and since when does Grisham try to convince you to root for the bad side?  Sadly, this book comes off as another one of those teenage guy movies where the story is not as important as the \\"cool\\" stuff (money, drugs/alcohol, sex).  The insults to our government were also a bit much for me (someone who is not a blind patriot).  The biggest disappointment was that the writing itself just does not seem like Grisham - it is too light, easy to read.  The lack of research (effort) was glaring; usually there is a lot to learn.  I never thought I would feel like I wasted my time reading one of his novels...
B001NLL93W|5.0|City if Glass is even better than the 2 previous books. I am pleased by the direction of the storyline. I am invested in this series because the characters are incredible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My oldest girls at 7 & 9 love playing this game along with myself. It's entertainment on the small screen and I like changing up the characters !
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This watch fulfill all my expectations about a watch like thjis should be. I widely recommended for those who want to keep an eye of their training programs. The &#34;back to start&#34; feature is awesome whe your are running other cities or countries
B008IGP8RI|5.0|I love this kind of song to drive along roads crossing the country. It makes me forget the world. I certainly recommend it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I purchased this book because of the topic . I was prepared to be disapointed based on many of the reviews,but I found this novel very well written and informative. As a reader you need to realize the author in not bragging she is just telling her story the way she lived it. Also i found it sad that our system is not helping people to become better , they seem to be making them worse. The system needs to screen the guards better so we can start to get some that are not on an ego trip or just plain mentally ill . The few can give the rest a bad image. Don't we the tax payers pay for at least the human basic needs ,like decent food ,clothing,and shoes. Why is it the expense  is put on the familes of the prisoners to buy what we already pay for in taxes.Something is very wrong here,the money is going somewhere . The story did end leaving you hanging,but honestly I think thats where her story really ended, when she walked away from that horibble Chicago prison to return to her life............only in Chicago could thing be so messed up..............
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Awesome I can't put the game down. Would recommend to all ages the whole family can join in. They move the objects around each game making it a lot more fun
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  This novel is thought provoking.  The characters and their stories are well developed.  Some of the episodes are so sad.  The decisions some characters had to make to just survive are beyond imagining.  I was glad Pari located her brother in the end even though he was never to know.  It provided some hope for his daughter Pari to finally have knowledge and relationships with her real family.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|JJ Abrams has not ceased to impress me with star trek. What impressed me the most was the fact that Abrams was able to find the perfect actor that fits the nature of Khan. That Khan is intelligent, ruthless requires someone that has played a similar role. With Cumberbatch's role in \\"Sherlock\\" it completely fits the description to not only make Khan ruthless, but to make viewers sympathize with him as well. Great movie.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I did not know about these trains so it was very informative and kept my interest all the way through. I really cared about the characters so that is always a good sign for a book.
B0026772N8|5.0|I found this book excellent explanation about science and philosophy. And the rhetoric debate is great. It's a must read.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I expected more out of Flynn. It was like she thought of a mediocre ending and just settled with it. Disappointing.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I like the way how Tim explains some concepts on how to become top 5% on something you are learning. I haven't try the recepies though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love everything about this book. I fell in love with this author after Slammed & Point of Retreat... Hopeless definitely did not disappoint. Can't wait for her next release.
0156027321|5.0|I doubt there's much I can add here that hasn't already been said by other readers of this story. It took me a long time to get into the book, but I'm so glad I persevered with it as it was a truly wonderful story that I found to be intuitive, emotional and very enlightening. Mr Martel is one very gifted storyteller and deserves all accolades that come his way.
B00DD1X99C|5.0|I would like to begin by saying that I have been a Elvis fan/collector for over 40yrs. I also am a die hard vinyl record fan.<br />This two album set has to be the best sounding Elvis album I have ever heard. Side one of the first five original masters never sounded better to me. The other three sides are a great collection of alternate takes with no repeat songs. I feel that these selected tracks are a perfect fit and anything more would be too much. Even though I own all of the alternate tracks on cd, They just don't sound as good. It is nice to have these all together on one album. I looked at the three cd deluxe edition and there were just too many master tracks I own already. I decided to buy the vinyl album for the warm beautiful sound and lack of overkill on alternate takes. I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite Elvis albums! Kudos to RCA/Legacy on this release!<br />The only thing the vinyl version is missing is a booklet.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This is a fun movie that my son (2 1/2) adores.  We watch it daily.  Seriously!  I like this movie so much I find myself quoting it to co-workers and family.  It always makes me laugh.  It is certainly worth watching once and seeing for yourself.
0812550706|5.0|This weekend I sat down for a movie read. Ender's Game based off the popular novel by Orrison Scott Card, will be released on November 1 of this year. As I had not yet had a chance to read it, I knew it was time to see what this book was all about. So last Saturday evening, I sat down with my boyfriend and started to read to see just what this book was all about, and why there was all the hype. After all, nearly 5000 reviews on Amazon alone have been favorable.<br /><br />Ender's Game is a book set in a futuristic world. Mankind is still split into different factions, but those factions had to band together to repel an attack from Bugger's. In the Ender's Game version of Earth, family size is strictly regulated, much like in China where families are limited to one child, in the future; families are limited to two children. Anything more can be cause for shame, or embarrassment. In order to repel a Bugger attack, mankind has taken to gene manipulation in order to develop the perfect soldier to save humanity from the dreadful attack. The Wiggin's are a special case, when Peter is born; the government thinks it has found the perfect battle commander. In order to facilitate selection, each child is given a monitor that keeps track of their actions and the decisions they make. Consider it a spying device, that is ever-present and ever recording until taken off. Peter however is not chosen, and it's found that his personality is too...fiery, he has no compassion. So the IF (International Fleet) requests that the Wiggin's have a girl next. After all, perhaps she will get more compassion, thus Valentine is born, but she too loses her monitor, even earlier at the age of 3 (whereas Peter had lost his at 5). So the IF comes back again, requesting that the Wiggins have another child, a third. By and large, this is a taboo practice, however in hopes for the continuation of society, and the destruction of the Buggers, Ender (Andrew) is born. The monitor on Ender is active until he is 6. Not only has he beaten out both of his siblings, but also most of the other children, that on top of his stigma as a third child makes him a prime target for bullying.<br /><br />What follows in Ender's Game is a wild journey. Ender is selected for his compassion, yet ultimate willingness to get the job done. While Ender will seek to avoid conflict, at the end of the day, he will do whatever it takes to ensure that he is not attacked again, to make enough of a statement. Ender is 6 when he is taken to battle school. He does have a choice in going, and he ultimately decides to go because he wants to feel accepted, to feel wanted by someone more than his sister Valentine. Unfortunately, such is not to be. Upon arrival, he's immediately singled out, never given a chance to properly interact with his peers. The officers of the school are willing to do whatever it takes, including to rip away Ender's childhood and ultimately his happiness.<br /><br />Ender's Game is a book that makes you think. For anyone who felt on the outside looking in, Ender's Game is going to resonate. When I was growing up, I often felt similar to Ender; it was hard to relate to my peers. I was always the one that didn't get the joke, or didn't care to laugh. Despite the fact that Ender's Game was written for a teen audience, individuals of all ages will enjoy this book. It's witty, intelligent, and evocative. Card's words allow the readers to construct in their own imagination a whole new world with all the intricacies therein. You'll be able to enjoy the tale of Valentine and Peter when they create Locke and Demosthenes, a look at politics on future Earth. I could not put this book down; I started it in the evening and finished in the early morning. For this reason, I am giving Ender's Game 5 buggers out of 5 for a wonderful job at creating an immersive environment to escape into. Thank you Mr. Card, I cannot wait for the movie release and only hope it will live up to the world my imagination created.ation created.
0756688701|5.0|If you have a die hard Disney Cars fan at home, this book is a must!  Your no. 1 fan will feel as though you bought him/her all the cars they have always wanted.  And at the same time, they will read and learn all these names and keep educating you on the World of Disney Cars.  Just remember to check the book for any razor blade cuts before you pass it to your die hard fan.  Once the compartment with the car is opened, it's unreturnable...we learned the hard way.
B008K3N68M|5.0|This series featured excellant acting, had a great plot and great directing.  Not 100% accurate historically but hit some of the key historical events.  Had great story lines featuring revenge, betrayal, love, hate, everything that bring the audience into the series, then they end the series after 3 seasons.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Hitchcock would be proud.  Wonderful actors in a tight well done movie.  Entertainment at it's best. The story was rich and poiniant.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I would not have downloaded app if I knew it fir not work on original fire.  Why show the app in the store.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love Noah Wyle in this. The story line is great and it leaves me wanting more every episode.  Very suspenseful!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the program. All the characters have depth, it's exciting with something surprising around every corner. Rick is a human hero, flawed but doing the best he can.
B000FCKC4M|5.0|This is one of those books that I'd want with me on a deserted island. It holds so many life lessons. I found myself highlighting hundreds of passages, thinking each time how much meaning each one held. I'll be reading over and over again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I Love being able at a touch see what the temp is and also check on the weather in Kansas where I am from.  Also I can see how hot the future is going to be.
0679745653|5.0|So good!  If you loved the movie you will love the book more.  Holly Golighty is so much more in the book. A must read.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game it's addicting and fun to play I have no bad reviews accept more credits. Please adds more credits and more layouts of land.
1451695195|5.0|Loved the book.  It helps to reaffirm the faith I have of a future home in heaven. I have recommended it to others.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book.<br />It left me wondering if love can really move mountains. I guess I'll just have to keep reading.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Got a little hard but fun. I play right before bed and its great to wind down to. I would recommend it.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday present for my grandson. He turned 6 and has watched it over and over! I think he has it mesmerized my now.  Thanks!!!
159448385X|5.0|Again, I discovered Hosseini by accident and am very glad I did.  Good writing and understanding of language and having sentences that are more than 5 words long is refreshing.  I am on my last book of Hosseini's and hope he writes more.  It would be nice for him to venture into more diverse themes however.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is one of the best Megadeth albums ever released. It is the first one I bought from them decades. ago. This is a timeless classic. Highly recommend to all Metal Heads.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Dang this thing, it always treats me right! I have it for at east 6 years & still going strong. 5 stars because price/value ratio, for the price it works amazing!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album sounds a lot like early Sabbath. Some of the riffs sound similar to early Sabbath tunes that have been tweaked. I have been a Sabbath fan for 35 years and if this is the last one that they produce, it is a great ending to a long career for the band that opened the door to Heavy Metal.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Yeah what can I say that's new? This show is so funny I find myself laughing at Sheldon or penny even when I'm in public places! People look at me like I'm strange but I'm really just processing a joke or scene from this show. It's sick, funny, weird, abnormal & Sheldon freaking out of this world! Thank you thank you thank you..
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A great story and an interesting peek into the female USA prison system.  I loved the show and I love the book, each for different reasons.<br />Thanks Piper
1476734941|5.0|Very easy to read, informative, and helpful.  I learned more that I expected.  I suggest this book to everyone to read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is a nice mix of fun little games for anyone who likes fun little games.<br />Try it and you will see!
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I have never played Sudoku before, so I probably cannot provide a &#34;true&#34; review for people who are into Sudoku.  That said, here is what I think: I enjoyed it for awhile, but it is very repetitive.  I didn't have any issues with the technical aspects (no glitches, instructions were clear, display was clean and attractive, multiple choices for type of play).<br /><br />If you love Sudoku, this game will probably please you and provide hours of fun.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This is one of those necessary things you need and can't do without for particular functions. It's an Apple product, therefore priced on the high end, but guaranteed to work.
0812982622|5.0|I'm so glad I read the non-fiction &#34;Nothing to Envy&#34; while waiting for my library copy of &#34;Orphan Master.&#34; It gave me the perspective to understand and appreciate this terrific novel, as well as a slippery slope to finding this book less shocking and more interesting than squeam-producing. I was able to &#34;play the movie&#34; in my head while reading the novel without wanting to put it down and walk away. Would love to spend an hour with the author, discussing how an American can have written such an Oriental tale.
0380789035|4.0|Shadow has spent three years in prison, patiently doing his time.  Then, just two days before his scheduled release date, he finds himself in the warden's office, where his is told that his wife has been killed in an accident and that his is being released immediately so he can attend her funeral.  Suddenly, the quiet life Shadow had planned following his release has vanished.  As he travels home, he encounters a stranger who calls himself \\"Wednesday\\", who offers Shadow a job, though he is vague on the details of what that job might entail.<br /><br />After learning that his wife had been sleeping with his friend, who was also killed in the accident, and realizing that he no longer has any prospects for the future, he agrees to Wednesday's proposal.  Shadow then finds himself drawn into a shadowy, parallel world where gods and cultural icons are alive and a war appears to be imminent between the old gods and the newer gods (such as Technology, Media, and Celebrity).  As events unfold, Shadow struggles to understand what is happening around him, and eventually discovers deep truths about himself and is forced to take a stand.<br /><br />This is both an entertaining fantasy, in a contemporary setting, that explores the role of belief in society, and ponders the impact of changing beliefs upon the subjects of that belief.  This isn't the first book that I've read that posits that belief creates gods and gives them their power, but this book handles the idea with a great deal more subtlety, and suggests a much darker nexus between these beings and their need for people to believe in them.  This book poses many questions as it progresses, it does a pretty good job of wrapping up the loose ends by the end, though there is a pretty good twist near the end that I managed to not see coming.  Overall, I found this compelling and entertaining, while still leaving me with ideas to ponder.  This may have been my first Gaiman novel, but I'm sure it won't be my last.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|This movie starts off completely satisfying our need for a magic fix.  Quick, interesting stuff delivered by engaging and talented actors.  However, it all goes down the tube when our \\"four horsemen\\" meet in a run down apartment in New York City.  All of the subsequent \\"magic\\" is total nonsense delivered in a loud and over bearing manner.  Typical of the new Hollywood, CGI trumps style and content.  The plot line of the movie is so ridiculous you just want it to be over.  When the truth is revealed, it is even more ludicrous than nonsense that preceded it!  It makes you wonder if anyone actually watches the finished product.  Take my advice and pass on this dog!
B004XMMSZG|2.0|Perhaps it is a great product with the right use - but it did not work in a 2012 Audi A6 when plugged into the car's MMI system because it was not recognized as an input.  Cablejive tech support confirmed this.  Wish that info were on their website (or easier to find).<br /><br />Also tried it in an older Bose Soundock.  It did work to play iPhone music through the Bose, and control it through the iPhone.  BUT -- at low volumes, there was a &#34;radio interference&#34; type sound.  Asked Cablejive about it and got no answer.  So, returning it.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's darn tiny and easy to use - if it works for your application.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very entertaining game. The levels are challenging and well designed. I wish it had more levels, but over all I liked it very much.
1451695195|4.0|Proof of Heaven didn't exactly convince me of traditional notions of heaven, but it did speak volumes of the expansively awesome nature of consciousness, and the universe itself. This work beautifully \\"coalesced\\" the author's impressive knowledge of physiology with the mystical and explorative realms. He kept the story very interesting throughout; and he had a knack for the personal touch that made it endearing. I was urged to read this enlivening work and am glad that I did.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Can't afford Showtime so I have to wait for the DVD's to come out.  I have all of them now and will have to wait until next year to get the eighth and final season.  I will be sad to see the show end.
B003YWR88S|1.0|Shortened version marketed as full 6 hour miniseries. It's not even the same as the advertised short version. The show just stops as if the rest is on another disc. But the second disc is just the special features.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I had only heard one song of Emeli Sande;s so I wasn't sure I would like the whole album, but I do!  I will be following her success.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was a lucky one to get the chromecast early.  It's simple enough for a non-techie to plug in and play. A+ work Google, keep innovating!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book cans series conclusion<br />Great action great story great everything<br />The story can get a little slow but if you bare past the little parts like that you will be filled with great happiness
B001DJLCPO|5.0|...but it helps. This is one of those films I could take almost any still from and frame. The story is fine. The direction is fine. The performances are fine. But the visual component is amazing. And the music suits it too. Quirky, artsy, not too scary for a child, yet not without consequence. Every time I see this I want to paint again... or draw...or sculpt....
0694003611|5.0|Our son is 15 months old, and has been requesting this book daily for a few weeks now (we have had it since he was born).  He can point out many of the objects, but if it is bedtime he mostly just likes us to read it to him, without asking him too many questions.  Often when we finish he will ask to read it again (and again and again). I'm not sure what it is about this book that he loves so much, but it keeps his attention, and helps quiet him down at bedtime.
B0091WFNEG|4.0|The film is very good. The delivery of the film through Amazon was not good.<br />We could hardly hear the dialogue and turning up the volume on our LG set did not increase the volume. I called and spoke with a woman who was very helpful and she had me re-set some settings on my set that made the audio somewhat audible when I turned the volume on the set up to level 80. We usually keep it at 12 - 15. Something is still wrong and I don't think I'll be using Amazon to much to stream movies and TV shows. I never had this problem with Netflix or Verizon FIOS.<br />I wouldn't mind credit for this film or a call back that helped me further fix this problem. Your call.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie. Thanks.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love the chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic! Beckett is a homicide detective who is being followed around by Castle so he can write his &#34;Nikki Heat&#34; books. Beckett's job is a hard one which is made a little easier because Castle is there to help her. He makes her crazy at times but in the end they work together beautifully to solve the murders. He sometimes acts like a 12 year old but Beckett can be counted on to not let him get away with it. Add in Ryan & Esposito as the other half of the homicide team, Castle's mom, Martha & daughter Alexis and you have a cast that really makes &#34;Castle&#34; a fun show to watch.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun app to kill some time, quite persistent with the Facebook questions though. Expected with the price tag.
B005D0RDIE|1.0|This is the 2nd dvd I've purchased of the Rush Time Machine and the audio during the movie won't play.  Has anyone else had that problem?  The first one I waited too long to return, but I guess I'll return this one faster.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I love this game even as an adult but I wish it had more matching  accessories including gloves, shoes,  and jackets.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|The ridiculous ending was so weak and contrived that it destroyed any hope for a higher rating from our family.  With such a diverse and strong cast, we were surprised how much of a dud they created.
B00CUKTGNU|5.0|More rock than ever, probably his best album. The deluxe Edition have  two CD. The first is a fantastic rock album, better than ever, but the second , in live, is really great, for me better than the oficcial album. This album is a come back to the begining of the band.fresh and direct to the brain. A great album . Please buy de Deluxe Edition, is 100% better. Franz and the Ferndinand are like in the past, forget all his electronic games, is pure pop rock. I like it
B00DIMXTBO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Once I started reading this book I couldn't put this book down. Great way to end this book.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Completely compatible with the calculator required for the class. I have downloaded manual from Internet and it's a handy calculator!
B003M6EAXM|3.0|The storyline with the bad ex-boyfriend was really dumb. She is afraid of him and she is a federal agent and then later on kills the Parole officer by hand IN CTU. And what the hell is a parole officer doing across the country???? Also, too repetative with Jack being asked to come back, does his thing, gets in serious trouble with his own side and at the end has to go on the run. That got old by season 4 or so. These and other dumb things make this season mediocre at best.
0061124958|5.0|The book arrived on time and in &#34;like new&#34; condition. Couldn't wait to read it to my grandkids. I wanted a hard covered book so it would last through all the grandkids we have and will have in the future.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|the &quot;official game&quot; is just another version of temple run. the way it's titled and described, I thought I would actually be going through the story line somewhat... fun for about 5 minutes at a time.
0689835604|5.0|My son loves this book, all the books by Karen Katz he loves and this was no exception; it is a great book over all.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I bought this with a specific project in mind and am always hesitant to buy something with mixed reviews. I haven't used another product like this so I can't compare to what else is out there, but I was not disappointed with this product at all so don't feel like I need to search around. After a little time futzing around putting it together and figuring out exactly how it worked I got what I wanted on the first try! I watched a you tube video previously to trying to separate the bottle and I am glad I did! You don't need the \\"tapper\\" with this method the bottle just separates by itself. Boiling water along the score line (make sure it really is boiling ... the second time I used what was left in the tea kettle that had been sitting for a little while and I had to reheat it to boiling before it would work again)and then cold water along the score line while rotating the bottle. Once I had the boiling water at right temp. it took me exactly three passes each time. Once hot, once cold, and once hot again. I did it with the bottle laying in the sink so that when the top came off it wouldn't drop and break. I have only tried one kind of score ... I haven't done it on a difficult angle yet, but so far so good. Three keys to success: the cutter has to be at 90 degrees to the bottle surface, score only once and score lightly (you don't have to dig into the bottle for it to work!), follow the diagram in the direction on how to hold your hands or you will be pushing the device out of alignment somehow and get a score that is out of alignment. I was so excited about the results of this product I had to tell you all!
160094048X|5.0|Who would have know you can make such delicious cookies without eggs and butter!!  The New York Black and White cookies are to die for!!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Sean Patrick took a complicated man's biography and infused it with compassion, showing the true genius and basic goodness of a man who was betrayed over and over by the powerful (an not so powerful) men of the Gilded Age and beyond. Tesla's true genius was made uncomplicated by the style of Mr. Patrick's writing. This is a book I would (and will) recommend to every reader I know. Thank you, Sean Patrick!
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have been a fan of NCIS from the beginning.  I enjoy buying boxed sets not only to watch the episodes again, but to hear the commentary and view the special features. I've been satisfied with each season.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting and writing.  Have followed since show first started and recently found it on amazon and am rewatching past seasons - just as good second time around :)
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|My favorite since the Forever cd  with Stanley Clarke & Lenny White. I must admit  I had the bar set just a bit lower this time just because of the musicians he picked for this recording. Charles Altura, Hadrien Feraud, Marcus Gilmore & Pernell Saturnino do a wonderful job & so nice to hear my favorite bass player Stanley Clarke sit in on a track. If your going to do something dedicated to the Great Roy Haynes then Royalty is the way to do it.<br />Thanks once again to Chick for a great job.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book was short and a bit predictable. Our book club choose this book and some said that it was disturbing however I found it boring.
1569242739|5.0|The chocolate cupcakes are awesome!!  Looking forward to trying other recipes soon.  Great for vegans and people with allergies to eggs and dairy!!
0316666343|5.0|I just finished reading this great book in only a few days. It held my interest and was glad I picked up the hardcover edition to this. Truly thought provoking as well as a solid story. I felt that the novel is way better as a story than the movie. I also loved how the story spanned many years and how detailed the characters are. Truly a great work of art!! Will probably reread in a year or two.
0321934318|4.0|Scott Kelby's book on Lightroom 5 was excellent, as usual.  Many Pros; only one Con -- information about setting up direct email service uses Hotmail as an example.  Hotmail went away before this book was published. I would give this book 4 1/2 stars if I could.
0440237688|4.0|\\"Our people made that choice, the choice to go to Sameness. Before my time, before the previous time, back and back and back. We relinquished color when we relinquished sunshine and did away with difference. We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others.\\"<br /><br />This book reminds me of a short story I read in college called Ones who Walk Away From Omelas by Ursula LeGuin.  In the story there is a girl kept in a closet or small basement that basically is kept in pain, neglected and left in squalor so the rest of the society can be perfect.  This has sort of the same premise that one person carries all of the true memories of happiness, pain, suffering, love and every other emotion you can think of so that the society can be oblivious to how empty their lives are but think they are happy.<br /><br />This is a deep thinking book about society and choices.  Is it better to give up everything that makes people unique so that everyone is equal and everyone is treated the same or should people be given the memories of joy and pain to be able to choose for themselves.  No one in the community knows what true pain or happiness is.  They have worked it out in the community so that no one even sees color, everyone gets exactly the same provisions, kids get the same clothing, and everyone becomes a 2 or 7 or 12 at the same time during a ceremony no matter when they are born.  The  Giver is the only person in all of the community that has any true memories and he carries the burden for everyone.  Jonas becomes his apprentice as he is chosen to be the Receiver of all memories.<br /><br />\\"And here in this room, I re-experience the memories again and again it is how wisdom comes and how we shape our future.\\"<br /><br />While it doesn't go into the workings of how you can filter all true memories to one person, or make all the land look the same, or weed out the ability to see color it is an interesting concept.  I can see how this would be a great discussion book in a philosophy class or sociology.  It is all an interesting concept.  What happens when you truly know what emotions are, should you keep them all to yourself and be the chosen one to carry the burden for everyone else or should you walk away.<br /><br />Parts of the story are a little slow for a MG/YA book but the World Building was interesting and everything in the book makes you call into question how there society is working and should it continue on the same path or is Jonas powerful enough to bring change to the community.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone but it has a powerful message and would be great for a book club discussion group.  Definitely not a light read.book in a philosophy class or sociology.  It is all an interesting concept.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|The Author did a great job setting the scene (however there were moments it went on too long). I loved all the creative circus food and it really made me want to visit the circus in the book. Side note: I got the book on CD after already being half way through reading the book. I had a long road trip and thought it would be great to listen to it with my husband. He thought it was too descriptive and fell asleep often. I didn't like the reader in the CD wasn't the same at all. Reading it was way better.
B00AEBB8PQ|5.0|A friend recommended this to me as a rental.  I hadn't heard of the movie and it was a little older, so I didn't have high expectations.  It was a big surprise that both my teens and younger children enjoyed it.  So much so, that they asked to purchase it so they could watch it again and again.
B00DHHWY9I|3.0|If you can get past the soundtrack, it's not to bad. I couldn't, once was enough for me. To bad really; yes it's a remake, but it still had potential.
B001DJ7PQ4|2.0|I learned a lesson with this order. I mistakenly ordered this dvd set and ended up with two of them. I returned the duplicate set and received a fifty percent refund. I assume that Amazon thought I removed it from it's plastic wrap. This particular set did not come shrink wrapped. As a matter of fact, this dvd set looked like it had traveled around the world a few times. I doubt very much if Amazon sent me a brand new dvd set. It sure looked like it was a previously used item. Oh well, lesson learned.
1250007208|5.0|\\"Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.\\"<br /><br />I read this a little over a year ago and re-read/listened to it just a few days ago.  I remember now why I loved it so much. A Cyborg Cinderella story, you might think that it will be a little boring, or weird, or not really work but Marissa Meyer does a fantastic job on this retelling of a classic in a future world with whole new twists.<br /><br />\\"I'm sure I'll feel much more grateful when I find a guy who thinks complex wiring in a girl is a turn-on.\\"<br /><br />The story is set in Beijing China sometime in a distant future.  Cinder is a cyborg; she is basically a second class citizen and a slave to her stepmother.  Her only friend is a droid with a quirky personality chip named Iko.  Cinder works as a mechanic and while at her booth is approached by the very handsome Prince Kai to help him with a malfunctioning android that may have some important information.  Right away there is a type of chemistry between them that is extremely subtle.  But the story isn't just about Cinder and Kai no no no Meyer ups it a notch and there is so much more.  There is a plague that has been ravaging earth for over ten years, a Queen from the colony on the moon that is maneuvering to marry Kai and become Empress or go to war and a lost Lunar Princess that might be able to save Kai from a fate worse than death.<br /><br />\\"Imagine there was a cure, but finding it would cost you everything. It would completely ruin your life. What would you do?\\"<br /><br />Meyer built an interesting futuristic world with Cyborgs, Androids, hovercrafts and identity chips to track everyone.  Most of the story is set in Beijing China but there are references to other areas outside that I'm eager to see more of in future installments.  This is the first book in a four book series and I will say I am impressed.  Cinder is not a boring girl, she is fascinating and her story compelling.  Yes there is the evil stepmother and two step sisters but even that took a different twist from the original story.  I traveled along with Cinder and really connected to her character emotionally.<br /><br />This is a fun read for anyone who likes some lite sci-fi and fairy tales, you will not be disappointed.isters but even that took a different twist from the original story.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a really good movie. There was a lot of action and it kept my attention. I couldnt' find this movie on netflix or my paid for view channels. I was about to give up hope and then I decided to try amazon. I also know I can count on amazon for the things I want.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I never ever stop reading a book, this was chosen by my book club and everyone said that it got better however I never got into it and I have read a ton of different books. I thought it was very very boring.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this movie!  I got it for my mom, and it made her day to get it in the mail.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow  I could not put this book down.  Starting Shift.  This book not only entertains but makes you think. Every one should read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is fun but I would recommend the computer version it in actually worth27.00 this one is ok I would get it if you don't have the online on
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I purchased this Lego item because my three grandsons play it on their iPods all the time.  I was skeptical, when I opened the packaging to find such a small box that said it contained 480 pieces!These pieces are very small!  Not something you would want around a young child. It is definitely for the older child (the box says 10+ years).  My grandson and I spent 3 hours putting it together. The instruction booklet was sometimes hard to follow but we were able to figure it out. It was a fun activity and it gave us the opportunity to do something together.  I think those that are over 10 years of age and enjoy Minecraft would enjoy putting this together.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Original in style and form. Wonderful characters that you totally believe in, alternatively loving and hating them. time well spent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Click on items in the scene to search for clues. Clues lead to puzzles...puzzles lead you to a way to get on the elevator and escape. How hard is that to explain? Well, it would have helped on level 1. After that,really fun. Can't wait for more levels!
B006BOT28U|5.0|Just like all of Eli Goldratt's books, readers learn how to take TOC to the next level!!  I highly recommend it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was captured by the mystery and was compelled to keep reading as quickly as possible.  I was not prepared for the ending.  I recommend the book.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|For a developer to insert ads into a paid game after I have owned it for probably close to a year, is unforgivable.  I bought an ad free game, I expect it to stay that way.  I love the Rayman franchise games but I won't be buying any more of them.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Intrigue! Well written, enjoyed his style, his characters and story line. First novel by him that I have read and will co time to read more!
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|The graphics are ok. the game is jumpy and has trouble loading certain maps. But a few updates should fix that.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It was an enjoyable movie. Good comedy. I didn't think I would like it, but I ended up laughing and having fun.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|This is a great CD, I bought it a while ago and still have it. Enjoy it every time I listen!
B00DHQ208Y|4.0|Lonerism is a good listen if you are a listen to relax and journey with.  They left a little short of though in my opinion.  I found that the ep tame Impala had more of trip feel and that's really what I look for and expect from them much like what you would come to expect from say, Pink Floyd, Beatles Magic Mystery Tour or even Sargent Pepper.  Still I like it, just wanted a little more.
1401937268|5.0|These cards are similar to traditional tarot... yet very different! The cards make more sense & speak to me more gently and clearly than traditional tarot cards which would sometimes confuse me. I like her interpretaitions and the deck itself is very beautiful.
B007HACDLK|2.0|Did. Not get into this one.first novel by him that I have read, but did not really enjoy his style.
067101756X|2.0|The book is too little...the words are too little. The print is not good....the pictures are very bad & you can't read anything on them hardly. I got this for my husband and he is so disappointed.
B007L6VR12|4.0|It was a cute, goofy film.  That's all she wrote . . . I would not recommend for children 12 and under.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I bought this one for my mmo's and more than 6 buttons seemed complicated.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Very comfortable<br />Buttons are easy to access<br />Great customization software<br />Response time is great<br />Quality components except for the weights<br />Software has to be downloaded from the site (could be a con to someone else but I prefer that)<br /><br />Con's:<br />With all the weights in it still feels a little light<br />Weights looked rusted<br /><br />Overall a great mouse for the value, I took 1 star because of the weights issue I mentioned.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!

B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I gave it 5 stars simply because it fulfills its promise.  You can listen to music, while swimming, with no problems, no adjustments, hassle free.  Just follow its simple instructions.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I wanted a charging cord that would go near my couch to charge my Kindle and this one fit the bill perfectly. It was long enough and easy to use. Charging is fast and I can read on my Kindle while it is charging with this unit.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|This is a gift so I can't give 5 stars until the recipient opens it and knows it works correctly.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Movie kept me interested until the end and did not know who the master of the plot was until the end.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I wished I hadn't spent my time downloading this app.  Waste of time.  Didn't like it.  Would not recommend.  Instead of giving us a help guide for Kindle, why not give us THE ACTUAL CANDY CRUSH SAGA GAME!!!!!  Very disappointed.
B00338QENI|3.0|The topic of the immortal HeLa cells includes at least 4 important pillars; Class, Race, Ethics and Science. It should have been presented in half the number of pages, though.. Periodically far too slow, far too &#34;chatty&#34;.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This  game is a great way to relax and is so addictive, I play everyday!!. You don't need to spend real money just slot of  patience, enjoy!
B005FITIK0|5.0|So many bad reviews.  All short and disappointing.  People crying out because they had to see something that actually depicts a real character instead of a crafty and contrived version of a life that is palatable to them. They would probably rather watch the Kardashians.  I do wonder why they even felt they had to let people know how offended it made them feel without any sort of criticism other than the plot itself which is just a framework of a complex character study. It really just shows that many people cant handle anything that isnt sugar coated.  It feels as though i am walking through a cult of normalcy that is just seething with denial and blindness to lifes darker sides. There is a richness in this movie that makes it far more pleasurable and colorful than the formulaic developments of most comedies and brings a new twist to dark comedies.  There is a great lack of sympathy for the main character in those bad reviews.  But thats a just a personal dilemma.  Whether you can relate to the character or not does not constitute how good or bad a movie is. The criteria by which some people judge things is lacking in a broad range of experience.
B001E7EONC|5.0|I liked this film very much. Statham and co deliver a crime thriller with touch of british wit and it works well. It didn't win any oscars, but that was never likely to happen. An entertaining watch though.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!
B004GYY714|4.0|Well, I have only used this app once so far but it seems to be pretty good.  I like it.  Would recommend.
0312330537|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. Two years ago I was in India for sometime I had never heard of the novel Shantaram, until a guy on the street recommended that I buy the book so I read the first page and realised I could not not buy the book. I honestly struggled to put this book down, ceasing to read it at every given moment. This is an extremly well compelled novel ... Gregory David Roberts is a unique talent of our generation
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love everything about it closest thing to the  computer that not to expensive for someone all it need is a cool update and then u get addicted to it
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was very excited about the chromecast, it was certainly easy to install, but the delay, and buffering, i couldn't legitimately watch anything. With program updates, this will be a great item, and at a great price point
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Great Movie!  Even my boyfriend liked it & he is pretty hard to please on movie rentals.  Keeps you guessing till the end.  Would rent again & might even purchase the movie.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|wakes me up everyday. i've owned it for 9 months without any problems. also enjoy waking to my own music.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Addicting!<br />This game is so fun to play but easily time flies by. Play it every day for hours on end.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Just loved it! What an incredible story. I was enthralled throughout the entire book. I can't wait to start the next one. Larsson had such a gift of setting up characters and story line.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Some many things make sense to those who are introverted in this book. I think every instructor, professor, teacher, and manager should read this book. We have been beating up  and overlooking the 30% of the population that is introspected. These people are the ones who keep us safe and on track with our schools, inventions, and work places.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I did not go see this in the theater because I really just was not interested.  For some reason I decided to watch it on my Ipad & I was hooked.  Have watched it twice now & will probably do so again.  Great movie!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Great movie. So glad I bought it to watch completely vs watching the edited and shortened version on Tv. I'd definitely purchase again.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The second instalment of the mortal instruments series did not disappoint. In fact I think it was better than the first book. I am in love with this fictional earth and the characters that reside in it. I am looking forward to seeing Idris in book three.
B00B9366VO|5.0|What a great background story of the Neve console.  Some great artists and albums were made from this studio and it is great story for music history.  Really enjoyed all the interviews and old footage.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend is one of those Artists who you really can't compare anyone to in my opinion. His voice is very unique and his music is timeless. This album delivers music that could be played decades from now. It's very laid back and mellow, much like the Artist. I love when I can play an album all the way through and not have to skip a track. I would probably do that anyways because I'm partial to John Legend and his soulful voice. My favs from the album are The Beginning, Open Your Eyes, Who Do We Think We Are, Tomorrow, Angel, Asylum, Caught Up and So Gone (deluxe edition). I pretty much just listed the whole album so you get the point, lol. I read some of the other reviews and people were calling it boring but that's not true. You can't buy a John Legend album and expect to hear Raheem DeVaughn or any other artist. John's music is \\"totally different\\" *in my Tamar Braxton voice*. So I suggest you add this to your collection because this music is meant to be played for a lifetime!
B001PA0FFO|3.0|As a retired certified reading specialist I read and encourage others to read. This is somewhere in my house I guess.
0399255370|3.0|Most reviewers mentioned that both they and their children loved this book. I did not. It was a clever concept, but not a great follow through.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Purchased this game to have a simple game to distress with.  It helps with the stress but I don't want to put it down.  LOL
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Although Lady Gaga's music isn't the music I favor, this song is by far my favorite one yet.  I love it!!
1419701533|5.0|I recommend to friends to share this book. The pictures are so funny. Delivery time was correct. The price was a little bit high but, condition of book is like new one, so I like it. Especially, Adults who are tired and need clear mind should try it.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Wonderful movie. Father/daughter, boy/girl, ex-wife/father-son. Great music! Very touching moments. While it has some cheesy moments and the acting, the character building was wonderful. Very emotional form sensual to hilarious to tearful and heart ache. Great movie.
1568363931|5.0|I read Makiki Itoh's blogs and I like alll her Bento recipe. I bought this for my easy Bento fix when I'm working or for travel. I love Bento!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not much more to be said than I loved 'binge-watching' this series. I couldn't get enough and can't wait 'till the next season
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter begged me for this game and I finally downloaded it.  Now I think I play it more than she does.  LOL
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Rush at the very peak of their skills! This is what you can call &#34;The Concert&#34; for this Zillion Flight-Hours Rock Band! You can feel the knowledge, talent, experience and expertise of these great musicians onstage. Great sound and camera work! Geddy singing really well and playing with such elegance, opossed to Alex´ good humor, just to stir a dash of flavor into the mix, and of course Master Peart bringing the drummer to heights only seen when Gene  Krupa was kickin´ and hittin´ his own set!!! A really must-have for every Rush fan!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a really Fun game. I enjoy the goals and the story. I just wish there was  more energy and gems ...you definitely can play without buying anything but makes it harder
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Great song, upbeat, fun, and a classic summer hit. I found this album to be good but this song outshines a lot of the album. Maybe it's Pharrell but it has a great concept and a fun beat.
0739319175|3.0|I did not like this book as much as other Dan Brown works.  I found the ending to be quite boring and filled with too much blah, blah blah.
0553062182|5.0|Great quotes and clinical examples of highly sensitive people. This is a great book to understand yourself or others better, and how to manage your gift,and not look at it as a deficiency.
0062255657|4.0|It is difficult to know where to begin a discussion of this odd and aching fantasy. It opens in the murky \\"now\\" with a middle-aged man back in his hometown for a funeral. We never find out who has died, but it appears to be someone close to him. He stops in to see an old neighbor and recalls a troubling event from his childhood, a magical string of occurrences that begins with the accidental death of his kitten and ultimately leads to a tear in the fabric of the world.<br /><br />Helping the boy navigate this swiftly tilting reality is eleven-year-old Letti Hempstock, who lives with her mother and grandmother at the very end of the boy's lane, next to a pond that the Hempstocks call an ocean. Gaiman's characters have a dark, liquid quality. Imagine people you know, but as they appear in your dreams...skewed photographic negatives of themselves. The setting also adds to the sense of dread. We're in Sussex, England in an area with lots of farms and open space. Yet the atmosphere is heavy and claustrophobic. There's a storm lurking. You don't know from which direction it'll come, but THAT it will come is inevitable.<br /><br />I would have preferred a more resolved ending. The book begins and ends with the boy as a grown man, so we learn some details of his life--his profession, marital status, that he has children. What we don't know is whether he's been saved or lost. Did the right side triumph all those years ago?<br />Or is good and evil just a story we tell ourselves, a way to make sense of a random and impartial universe?<br /><br />THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is a moving book, but it isn't easy or straight forward. If you don't mind fiction that leaves you with almost as many questions as answers, it's is worth reading and pondering.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I think for the first time we see a very human artist really getting close with her audience, above moral criticism, local vocabulary restrictions, out-of-date traditions in what you can call &#34;good manners&#34;, well, we can enjoy a fresh breath of artistry with this ons-in-a-million artists called Adele! We can expect new directions in every interpretation of hersongs,andthis is no exception! You can have a different version spiced with a new melody note, arrangment or vocal texture as well. Nice work for the first (and I hope) many to come performances by the great British Singer! finally, to be in tune: You´re a $#%&/?! great composer and singer Adele! :) Enjoy this great dvd!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|This book tells why man started to write in the Middle East, why the native americans died from diseases brought in by the Europeans, but passed almost no diseases to them, that chicken and pork were domesticated in China, horses in Europe, why the Spanish king conquered the Inca Empire and not the opposite. Sometimes he explains too much, being a scientist, but this is an amazing book. Fun, informative, mind boggling, thought provoking. It won the Pullizer Prize in 1997 if I remember it correctly and National Geographic did a documentary about it, but the book is much better.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Hi Amazon<br />I love Camelot...But why are the making such beautiful movies in envelope size.<br />This movie should be shown in all its glory on a full size screen.<br />Thank you for having Camelot.<br />June Fry
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I like the plugin when using Outlook.com which makes Wunderlist. This plugin make Wunderlist a easy to use tasklist for Outlook.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|I was given this book by the author in return for an honest review<br /><br />What a truly heartbreaking but inspiring read!<br />This story follows Amanda and how she deals with guilt and a new found freedom and how she struggles to overcome her addictions and finally she finds love and happiness only for a cruel blow to be dealt to her!<br />This is an inspiring story of how one tragic accident can impact on a family in different ways and how it can be overcome.<br />You definitely need to keep the tissues handy for this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is hard to put down! I can't wait for more levels to come out! This one is totally addictive!
B0081336FO|5.0|5 stars!!!!!  I can barely wait for Season 3! The ending is phenomenal!  Benjamin Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are superb!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|IF YOU LIKE VAMPIRE MOVIES, THIS ONE IS FOR YOU BUT, WITH A FEW TWISTS AND TURNS. IT CAN BE SCARY AND FUNNY AT THE SAME TIME.
B00B19G01C|4.0|I had watched The Exorcist last night. The Possession, in my opinion, ranked right up there. I was just as spooked out! I will no doubt be thinking about this movie for some time. I will most likely watch it again, and recommend it to others. Kyra Sedgewick was the only downfall. For some reason, I didn't care for her part in this movie. You'll see when you watch... and you should! Thanks for reading. Enjoy the flick.
B000001FK3|5.0|I'm just replacing music I lost in Cedar Fire 03 in So. CA. Love J.J.Cale since the late 70&#34;s!! Still do Laura
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love everything about this series. The best zombie series in movies tha I have ever seen.  Series keeps you captivated while also getting to know the characters and how their lives entwine and changes they have endured in their live during this apocalyse.  I would compare this to the movie 'Dawn of the Dead' - only this series is so much awsome.  Can hardly wait for the four season - will get that DVD also when it comes out.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I rate 5 star on this book  , because it has a great adventure ,also action this talk about Greek gods.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I was hooked after the first episode. An amazing performance by Tatiana Maslany, or should I say performances, as she really embodies each of the characters.  Brilliant actress.  Waiting for Season Two will be a long wait.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is an amazing gaming pad, not just for games but also for everyday use. Though some people have complained about the size, my sister and I have significantly different-sized hands, but we both use it fine with no complaints. The software is easy to download and use. I recommend this to everyone.
B0001I562I|5.0|It's true, this movie was intended for kids, but I'm still a kid at heart, and I liked this.  I rate this movie &#34;A&#34; for 'all audiences'. No violence at all !! Just good clean entertainment. I'm 66 my girlfriend is 65 we both thought it was 'cute'. I think anyone who likes S/F and comedy will like this one.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Ben is cute enough.  He's a little slow to respond and you certainly have to have a sense of humor because his response to you often enough is &#34;blah, blah, blah&#34;
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|The game was fun the first and ONLY two times it let me play it. Then it said wont connect and it wanted my facebook. I would think twice about getting this game.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|If you're not so into Kings of Leon, you should give it a try. At least to this album! Great music, introspective sound for stereo listeners. You can feel joy! Vocals are in best shape.
0143124544|5.0|When I started the book, I was concerned it was another love story. Instead, it was a love story of a different kind. A unique story that showed tremendous strength of the human spirit. I stayed up till 2 a.m. because I couldn't possibly put this book down. It made me contemplate things I wouldn't necessarily have thought about.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loki is up to his antics again!  I must say one of my favorite scenes is when Thor grabs Loki out of the plane!!!
B00AQAA5TK|4.0|The storyline kept me thinking and guessing. I enjoy that. I did expect to see Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) in the film, so it surprised me when he wasn't; other than seeing only his name carved into a wood beam in a mountain cabin or only to see just a photo of him. I will say Jeremy Renner did a wonderful job as a lead actor in this film. In that way, it was different but good. I'd like to see Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner meet and work together at securing a normal life without the threat of being killed by hired assassins.  I would recommend this film if you enjoy action packed movies that are cleverly done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book!  I can't wait to see how this story ends.  Now, I need to get started on book two!
B000NQ19QA|5.0|A classic. Nothing much else to say here. The leather binding isn't premium, but its quite good, and the pages are definitely snug in there. Good gift for signing and such.
1426308469|5.0|This is excellent.  Came within two weeks.  Well worth the money and even has a little help with the pronouncing of their names.  Grandson can't stop looking at it.  This book out does the animal book.  I wouldn't get the animal book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Inspired & my husband is terrified I'll invite him to go with me :)  He'll be fine. He always is!
B007N8RULO|4.0|It's the classic spider solitaire game that used to come pre-loaded on all PCs. I like the options to personalize the appearance and the left-handed feature. Ads are expected when an app comes as no charge to the user, so I don't mind them.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I enjoyed this film as it set the pace for the others that follow. Good background information on how he got the job, makes you want to help him learn his past. Full of action, Matt Damon is a good actor and suits his role well.
B00008K7AM|5.0|This is a great comedy movie! Super funny!!!! I would recommend for this movie for a fun family movie night.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am absolutely loving this game!!! The games range from simple to complex and some text your memory others test your reflexes. very nice game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|good game everybody get it extremely fun five star rating its better than sub way surfed and temple run one and two
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a fun and challenging game! I absolutely love it!! It is a very simple concept but strategy is involved at higher levels. Great for all ages.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|The app is nice.  It comes in quite handy for keeping track of notes on my phone.  The web app does not keep the same formatting as the phone app though.  The text I type in shows up different on the web app.  I would love to see that part fixed.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My baby nephew seems to like this app. Every time she sees the app, it makes her go berserk for it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app. is very handy. Allows more than one alarm, the white noise feature is a plus. I enjoy seeing the weather in the corner.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Just a few years back the idea of tablet existed only in science fiction . Notebook & netbook were. The ultimate science fantasy coming to life . this app has changed all that by building a wireless umbilical chord between the past wonders & future of technology. It has truly raised the bar in this never ending race for the innovations bordering on fantasy.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Liked this one with great graphics but too short. Also more potential achievements would be great. This one does not easily direct you but not too difficult to figure out.  Wish it had more puzzles.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|It delivers what it promises with out going over board. Sounds great with my Blue tooth head phones. Get it now!
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|Music sounded better without it. I only wanted it to improve the lackluster sound on my Nexus 4 but it did not achieve that.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Pretty good pool game aside from a few flaws.  When you have the 8 ball left, you don't have to choose which pocket....lame....second flaw is when you scratch the Que ball with a 8 ball shot miss, you don't lost the game...these rules suck...also you can just bang the 8 ball into any pocket and win. And lastly, the most annoying thing is when the Que ball is close to the power stick, many times you,'ll lose your shot, cause it thinks your shooting when your still aiming...honestly I have a pool game app on my Mac that was free and destroys this game...aiming is better, less lucky shots, pick 8 ball pocket to win etc<br /><br />After playing in other pool rooms on this app, i realize the game has a beginners so to speak pool area ($25 and $100 games)....these are the games i speak of above....The $1000 and up, you do pick the pocket the 8 ball has to go into
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Has everything you want. It introduced me to mpoints. Not sire my opinion on that. The concept is cool. It just doesn't have any apps that I want to use.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I didn't eat to start reading this at first, my friend is the reason I started reading the books. I thought the Immortal Instrument series would be a little known series, then all my friends were reading, and they said I should too. I finished the first book in user a week, couldn't put it down! The drama, the humor, the love, the action, it all fit together so well. I believe with support from its fans, the immortal instruments can become as famous and loved as Harry Potter, or The Hunger Games.
B0050AV5MW|3.0|I enjoyed the first book, even with the boring chapters of certain characters. The next book was okay and it didn't improve in the third. By the fourth I really was just going through the motions and I have no interest in reading book 5. The overwhelming themes of rape-murder-pillage and repeat, just got inanely repetitive. The descriptions of absolutely every minute detail, while at first intriguing, by the later books slowed the flow and made the reading feel rather bogged down. I like the inspiration I can see behind the story, but too often it felt like most the character chapters were just treading water, waiting for something to happen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is hours of fun and a escape from the stresses of everyday life. The only thing that I would change is how expensive some things are. I do understand the game is free to download and thank you for that . All in all I love it though and recommend that you have some fun and download it yourself you will thank yourself for it later once you realize it was well worth it.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Better than the first one, but not by much! Would not want to spend money on this one - I did not!
B007G92QGO|3.0|Hard to review this book without giving away the ending which is the best part. The book is drawn out in parts and the characters lack credibility given there background. Will make a great movie.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It has a nice mix of HO and mini-games. Since I didn't spend anything originally for the game, I spent 99 cents on crystals & coins. No more after that. Like other reviewers, I just play in short sessions, and wait for the energy to renew for the next time. Hard to find HO in 3 minutes on my 7\\" tablet.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I love all the songs on this album. I can't stop listening to it over and over. Backstreet gets better every time!
0061733199|5.0|This book was everything i expected and more! There were even detailed pictures and color when necessary. It covers everything from food, fire, shelter, water & beyond.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|This was a gift for my 11-year-old son who is interested in architecture.  These are great blocks for kids of all ages!  Endless possibilities!
B0081I08CI|5.0|The perfect sequel to A Game of Thrones. No doubt this book was sold out in my local store. A great thrill, adventure, romance and fantasy story.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Have seen this flick many times and never seem to tire of it.  What more can be said about a movie that perpetuates that kind of entertainment?
B007SGM084|5.0|Third time I have read the trilogy.  Love it.  She writes very well.  Will wait for more of her work.  Very stimulating love story
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Most people suggest going for the 3570k if you want the best gaming performance, but in all reality all you need is the 3570 because it give you enough Juice at 3.4Ghz so you can render everygame in HD! It runs DayZ, BO2, BF3, and Crysis 3 maginificatly along with my Sapphire Radeon HD 7770!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|few films ever capture my sense of thought the unique way in which this film took me punching my lights out  the intricacy of all of the bobbing and weaving had me say wtf much before i should have but enough of that the actors themselves to the brilliance of this epic of a story that a writer assumed couldnt be explored in such magnitude as this  the production people did a masterful job at lacing the whole thing together  that was as they mind boggling in its scope alone so those who didnt get it dont try to consume the whole of its parts this will never work instead design for yourself a cheat sheet so you can follow along  having now seen the film  i have to say to score the film poorly is truly appalling to discredit what has been accomplished  if they dont get it dont discredit those who do a critic is just stab in the dark if on the other hand the critic holds to a prvios gripe he will more than likely keep it the film stands alone as a masterpiece
1592402690|5.0|I was the right age for The Beatles to define what music is to me.  Virtually everything I know musically is based on how it relates to or is modified in relation to some compositional or recording trick Lennon & McCartney employed in their career.  Geoff Emerick was there.  He actually did most of the hands-on grunt work running cables and connecting wires to create the unique sounds which subsequently defined decades of recorded music.  In many cases, he was THE GUY who was too young to know \\"what was supposed to be impossible,\\" and provided the creativity on the engineering side for what was often attributed to the compositional creativity of The Beatles.    What's it sound like to actually record through a speaker instead of a microphone?  Read the book, and you'll find out you already know.  Why does John's voice sound distorted so often?  Again, Geoff knows, and Geoff tells.  And on, and on.    Where did it all happen?  Check out:  [...] .    Sherwin Gooch
B0029ATTAQ|2.0|While the acting is very good for the most part, the bleakness and blunt reality of a future without hope, without passion or dreams except that which is portrayed by two souls who are the remnants of by-gone era, left me with a sense that life such as that described in this movie would be useless.
B00CO8TBR4|5.0|Would have bought the k version if it had the TSX, Im ok with saving $30 since I wasn't planning on overclocking.<br /><br />Onboard graphics are good enough for most tasks. I mainly use the onboard -&#62; hdmi to tv.<br /><br />Single threaded performance blew my AMD phenom II x4 940 out of the water.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A must see for the continuation of season 1. It just gets better and better.Best show on TV. Look forward to the next season.
B000I186FW|5.0|Probably one of my favorites of all time.  The message is timeless.  The acting is amazing.  You won't be dissapointed.
B003CFBQBW|4.0|The Twilight movies may be aimed mostly at teen girls and young women but they have appeal for others too. The music on this CD is the same way- don't know that I'd have heard of any of it without the movies but I like some of it.<br />1. It's loud but &#34;All Yours&#34; is pretty good<br />2. The first three Soundtracks have Muse selections on them- this one is the best of the three.<br />3. I kind of like this one.<br />4. It's OK<br />5. The music video is awful but the song isn't bad<br />6. Better than some<br />7&8 Didn't care for them<br />9. Has it's moments<br />10. I suspect the group's name, &#34;Vampire Weekend&#34; got them on the CD but not bad<br />11. Didn't care for it<br />12. Awful, and where'd the group get that name?<br />13. Country sounding if memory serves me<br />14. Don't know much about Cee Lo Green but I could listen to this one<br />15. As always on the soundtracks a score selection- I like this one.
B005ES0XQY|5.0|I usually wear a size 12 but if you read the reviews its wise to go a size smaller on this one.<br />The large and open tread grips well but allows dirt to not gum up the bottom.<br />I am very happy with these crocs.....
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Very informative.  I recommend as must-read for those who are willing to go beyond human limits.  Pick it up today.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I'm a little disappointed. This game goes an extra step by hiding objects BEHIND the scenery where only a little piece will be visible. That feels like cheating and forces me to use in-game tools, which are rare or available for purchase. I've played these games before and the items are hidden ways such as changing the color intensity, size, or orientation (rotation) of the item to hide it in the scenery, but the items are always fully visible, yet cleverly hidden. This game does all that, but also hides them behind things, so you never really know what you're looking for (color/size/orientation, and NOW adding in whether you'll just see a sliver of it or not).
159463176X|2.0|I still get emotional when I think of \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\"; so, I was really excited to read \\"And The Mountains Echoed.\\"  Too much was going on for me to enjoy reading this book.  The author skipped around too much for me.  As a result, and more importantly, unlike \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" I could never connect to the characters.  I feel like the only person who I might have connected with was Pari; however, she was in and out so much that I couldn't ever grab hold of her emotionally.  Although I recommend \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" over and over (with everyone loving it!!!), I do not think I will recommend this book.
B005LAIII0|2.0|I missed it in the theaters but wanted to see it, finally got a chance to see it on HBO- glad I didn't buy it! The camera work was great as was the use of color- the &#34;look&#34; of &#34;Pi&#34; was very good but I soon found myself so bored that if I hadn't been taping it for my brother I'd have switched channels.<br />No problem with the subject matter or the cast, I just didn't like the movie. I'd love to see some of it in 3-D and I'd love to watch the extras (most of the tiger scenes are computer generated) but I won't be buying this one.<br /><br />If you didn't read the book or see &#34;Life of Pi&#34; on screen I'd suggest borrowing a friend's copy instead of buying your own.
0452273331|5.0|I had grown up hearing lots of horrible things about Ayn Rand being long, boring, ridiculous, etc. I hadn't read the work because from all I had heard nothing really drew me to it. Then I started dating my boyfriend who loved it, and I started to hear about others who loved it. I was curious what about stirred up all these different feelings. I read about it the ideas online and they didn't seem bad, so I gave this book a try. I've always been interested in architecture and therefore thought this one in particular was the best first read for me. I loved it. It is a super long book, that felt really fast. Not many writers can pull that off. Yes it is descriptive but not annoyingly descriptive like classics that spend ten pages on the weather. It was descriptive in an interesting, engaging, and character building way. I felt like I could see it all. The characters were well developed and while there were some I loved, some I hated, and some I didn't feel one way or another for, all of them interested me. Whether you ultimately buy into the philosophy or not, there is so much insight into how humans are that is interesting to read. It has a really solid, well put together plot.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie!  We have watched this movie several times since we have purchased it.  Action packed!  Cannot wait for the next Bond film to be released!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Hey, this Bond movie is one of the best. Chilling, scary, and we don't want to give away the plot, but we almost lost a Bond! Anyway, you must buy it, sit down and grab a huge bucket of popcorn and a few liters of soda, cause you won't want to get up to use the bathroom, answer the phone, or open the door to your friends. You are locked in your seat the entire time.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was very funny!! I really enjoyed the characters!! Can't wait to see the sequel when it comes out on DVD.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Oh my God, I love Regina Spektor so much! I'm just elated that I know her music because it's some of the best music I've heard. I've heard mostly all of her songs from all her albums, but this is the first album of hers that I've purchased. I will purchase all the others because this artist is just that good. I want to have her in my collection along with all the other greats like Alanis Morissette, Fiona Apple, and Joss Stone, just to name a few. All the songs on this album are great. It's even better that I've been playing piano for over 10 years and I know how to play most of her piano-oriented songs on the piano. Being able to play her music just draws me closer to her in a way and let's me delve into her mindset a little bit more. My favorite songs on this album are Open, All the Rowboats, Small Town Moon, but all of them are great. I just urge those of you who are skeptical about this artist, to just give her a chance. I really believe that Regina Spektor is one of the most underrated artists ever! So called artists like Justin Beiber and Austin Mahone don't hold a candle to this girl, or any of the other artists I mentioned above.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM! BUY ALL OF HER ALBUMS!<br />Regina is going to be a cherished treasure in my CD collection!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just being able to stream Netflix and Google Play content (music, movies, etc) makes it worth the $35.  Once the device mirroring options get ironed out and it gets Plex support its going to be a steal at that price.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Proof of Heaven by Dr. Even Alexander.<br />I liked this very much.<br />It reconfirms a lot of what I already knew!
B0081336FO|5.0|BBC turns out yet another riveting and amazing show, if you like Dr. who and you enjoy a good thoughtful show, you will love Benedict's version of Sherlock (we love Watson too)
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I love the feel of this knife.  It is hefty and I can't wait to take it out and use it!!
B00B4RP0OO|5.0|I tried various Media Players on my Fire HD and had some kind of problems with all of them.  Either they were too difficult to operate, were not able to play my own videos, had problems with reproducing sound, etc.  When I almost gave up I came across VidOn.me and tried it.  First of all, I don't quite understand why it's free!  It worked right out of the gate, I didn't have to anything with downloading codecs, search for my files, etc.  It did it all and produced high quality videos with great sound and no hassle.  I would have liked to see more detailed documentation, but that's the only &#34;downside&#34; for me.  I love it!
B004SBULWE|3.0|This is not the best task killer app for the Kindle.  If you have a Kindle try the Quick Task Killer it works much better and takes all the guess work out of it.
140006922X|4.0|He seems to be finding new ideas to share with me as he reads. I'm so glad I bought it for him.
B00499NHLC|5.0|If you are looking for yet another great BBC show... this is it &#60;3 Absolutely wonderful show, makes you think, suspense is well done, love the new age spin on a classic
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great find!perfect level of challenge. Please create intervals a d more levels soon! More games like this one please! Loved that it was just tough enough to challenge without frustrating.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I was hoping I'd enjoy this book more than I did.  It's okay, but not much more than that. Oh, well.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Fun and thought provoking.  This game will provide hours of entertainment, it doesn't always save the game when you exit which is disappointing.
0316228532|3.0|I was less than impressed with this book.  It has so many characters that I got tired before I finished reading the book and gave up.  I loved the Harry Potter books, but thought she had too many different story lines going at once in this one.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|I know it's a mobile game and they aren't generally meant to be incredibly deep.  I just felt like a little more could be done to prolong the fun but it may also be that I just did not want it to end.  Buy this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game I have done other ones but would stop before I got finish because I would have trouble figuring them out but this one was fun to do
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|C'mon!  It's Jack... how could you go wrong?  24 was one of the most innovative shows of its time.  Although the technology is a tad dated today, it's still exciting to watch Jack get into and out of the most improbable situations and save the day time after time.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|very challenging. wouldn't mind a little extra time in the hidden object puzzles. but it does make a brain work.
B00ERP55NQ|1.0|TrustGo Security showed HIGH RISK associated with the ad network used in this app which modifies your home page to a search page, adds unwanted bookmarks & shortcuts, and pushes inappropriate ads to your device.<br /><br />This is the 2nd atlas app I've tried to install and the 2nd one my security app warned me to UNINSTALL (btw: these were the 1st high risk warnings I've received)!<br /><br />I'll just use worldatlas.com or mapsofworld.com both are really great web sites, and don't have intrusive adware installed!
B00E193TM2|5.0|LOVE IT!!! been waiting for a new album,  and it was worth the wait.  The collaborations and the vocals are great!
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|K+d+b is my favorite.  I have always liked their creation of sounds and then turning them into music. Two more words.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love BBT and always have.  I buy each season just as soon as the price drops to around $20, which is usually only a few months after it comes out.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great graphics and addicting. Purchased the full version and it was worth it. After I finished the forest still play in the tournament mode.
B009LDD54K|3.0|Let's face it, without the Gyp Rosetti character (portrayed by the terrific Bobby Cannavale), it would have been a bored walk through the third season.<br /><br />I recently watched the opening episode of the fourth season, and if things don't pick up (the writing is more lax than ever), the fourth season will be the last season. Or at least it will be for me.<br /><br />What a shame, with all the terrific actors and sets and costumes and lighting and period music. Writers, get with it!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The story line was incredible. It's still so captivating and I felt like I was in the book with a visual perspective of everything that was going on. I feel like Clary and Jace shouldn't be brother and sister. Still really hard to believe that they are.
1878424319|5.0|This book was an easy to read road map for life. I would have been spared a lot of pain if I had read it when I was between 18-25 . However it's lessons are timeless and easily adaptable.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|it is affordable and easy. im loving it. i have bought it from best.buy. its been two weeks now - it is pretty cool.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's not great, it's not bad. Nothing more to it. I dislike that I have to do a lot of things centered around Facebook.
B009FTAH3W|3.0|This book is high on thoughts, motivating, but  didn't like the way book progressed, I felt like two peoples conversation, frequent Q&A,finally i say its very good book to boosts oneself.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Honestly this film was a letdown for me.  I think that the premise sounded promising.  The plot wasn't well thought out, and the  characters were all shallow and underdeveloped.  The great character actors in this film weren't showcasing their talents, but just going through the motion.  The chemistry between the actors seemed forced.<br /><br />Watch it for the special effects and some magician show type trickery, but don't expect a movie with an intricate plot or characters with depth to them.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited to rent this and got the rental for free because to pay any money would have made me mad at wasting $4.00.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Though the author MAY have offered readers his perception of Jerusalem during the time of Jesus of Nazareth, he seems to give his clouded opinions more than incorporate actual research on the subject gleaned from other (and more worthy) authorities.I think he's more interested in selling books (to be controversial) than good solid scholarship.  If you only know a little about the topic this is Not the book for you!
0345529057|5.0|The books were in perfect condition when they arrived. I am currently enjoying reading them.I cannot wait until the new season starts.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|good game rovio hard but fun. can't seem to beat ham e'm high but still fun get the update (much more fun)  I love reds mighty feathers. makes me happy happy happy
B0028RFBSE|5.0|Once again, Manowar proves they are Metal Gods incarnate. Every track, blasts power, strength, and gives us the need to bang our heads. The title track just screams METAL!
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Finally decided to see if I can make it work with streamed music and after I kept trying, I discovered it was \\"just working\\". I have to change my original review and have replaced it with this.  Basically put, it's very sound and works exactly as described.  Not sure what is different this time around, but it works and I'm happy.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Hosseni's other books.  He is a gifted writer, and this book was filled with many beautifully worded passages, but I think his reach was too vast. He tried to incorporate too many characters over too many generations and too distant relations. Just as I was starting to know each person and enjoy their story, he dropped them and moved on to another character. This book had many things I liked, but overall, it is my least favorite of all of his books so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game! I love playing it its fun and easy and best part. Its free! I recommend this game for everybody.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|It is a little hard.but it doesn't always work first time you tap it! My daughter and I enjoy it together.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|So many people told me Dexter was great.  I kept think they were talking about the cartoon.  Turns out it is great and worth the money.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Easy to use. Basic functions. When adding a string of numbers, you can follow the list of numbers you are adding.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|DVD works like it should and its a good movie to watch and the price was good. Didn't have to go drive to the store and buy
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|What more to say that hasn't been said by Critics, Viewers and the Industry.  Don't miss this movie, it's as rare as hens teeth!
B007AL48UK|4.0|The game is fine....I jsut would rather play it on the computer.  I am hooked on it on the computer and like the larger version.
0399245030|5.0|The illustrations are lovely and the story quite sweet. My son let out a big, &#34;Awwwww&#34; at the end. Highly recommend.<br />I do wish, however, that they had it in paperback too since it's a bit pricey for the hardback.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|The Cd came on time and now we watch it over and over, took it with me so my family could watch it . Sincerely Charity Burton
B00EQRMAJW|4.0|this album its a nice album I think he tries to give you more of his debut album with evolver..John is always all over the place you never know what you gonna get from him I wish he would do a \\"once again part 2 \\" I like that lane for him hes all over the place sonically he confuses the s*** out of me..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The Best book i have read in a very long time i cant wait to read the second one !
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|Movie most have not seen, has a remarkable cast and a great story.  From Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Chris Walken, Dennis Hopper this movie is full of violence and comedy.
B00447L4JG|5.0|The nightmare before christmas cd arrived on time and packaged in perfect shape. We absolutely love the movie and have watched it several times and was so thankful for the cost. Sincerely Charity Burton
B000V63BWW|4.0|I like this album its stevie wonder what else do you expect...you get what you pay for it I love it though
B003VANOFY|5.0|the only problem with this headset is the software that logitech ships with it. Hard to get running on windows 8.
B0053O89JM|3.0|This is the final season of House, sorry to see it go, but with the talent that has left by season 8 the show couldn't go on further.
B00005JMXX|5.0|The movie came on time and we love it. Have watched it several times. She loves Robert Pattinson.  Sincerely, Charity Burton
B008XG1X18|5.0|finding  things I love and adding pictures  and names to them or other peoples pinning that in interest me each day
1932100660|4.0|The China Study is great scientific reading on how to make a radical change in your health.  This is great reading!
B00C2IPB66|4.0|great epic film about a former roman general turned gladiator by a corrupt ruler.  Intense fighting, memorable characters, and good soundtrack make this a must see.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another great read from Morton. It was a masterful puzzle that was fun to discover how it would unravel. Though I was able to guess the big secret early it was still interesting to see how it would unfold
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|I almost feel bad that I'm not going to really go into why this movie was so horrible but I'm already never getting back the time I wasted watching it.  It sucked.  It was rambling, in-cohesive and pathetic.  A total pile of slop.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a great joy to have my bible with wherever I go, right at my finger tips I read some every day now it is so convienent
B005XZR4NI|1.0|Absolutely not! Couldn't play it in an American DVD player. Waste of money! I am never buying from that distributer again! And amazon should be ashamed to allow such faulty and sneaky sellers.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|One of Homme's best.  This album is definitely a progression from some of the older stuff.  It shows alot of elements from the \\"Them Crooked Vultures\\" release. Wow.  I dig it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I originally ordered from Amazon with an unknown delivery date. I cancelled my Amazon order and ordered through Google and it delivered in a week. Know what you're getting here. Googlecast has limited functionality...at the moment. It only has apps for Google Play, Netflix and YouTube...plus anything you can play in the Chrome browser. They are working on plugins from HBOGo and Hulu at the moment and should expect a release soon. Also, I would expect some type of function to browse a local media server. Know that you're not getting everything right now and you're buying in at the ground floor, much like those of us who bought the Xoom before it had MicroSD capabilities. All of that said, what it does it does great and I will be cancelling all of my movie channels tomorrow. Netflix has a ton of movies and TV shows (plus 1 month free when you sign up), plenty for me anyway. Any others I can get somewhere else. Get it knowing it will get better in time and you won't be sorry.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Its one of the Best games I have on My phone.  Its very entertaining for me and the kids, makes church and meetings go by quick! :)
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|This action figure is good quality and has a resemblance to the actor who played the part. His cape in bendable rubber or vinyl can't tell which. His knees, elbows,wrists and head are bendable. He is great to pose and his colour is wonderful . The paint job on his face is well done as well. My son is enjoying him.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Over all the game is fun. BUT<br />1. after TWICE getting far in the game all progress was erased and i had to start over.<br />2. I hate the game controls and find them hard to use.<br />3. It completly makes fun of sharks and makes it look like they seek out human flesh and then  happily munch on them.<br />I was happy at first then got angry. If they fix the faults the game would be a huge hit. Sorry London but im sitting out this one.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This works really well, just like it says.  Provides a VERY bright light through your phone's camera flash, as well as the option to have colored light through the phone's screen.  Very cool, highly recommend.
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|The box and DVD were in excellent shape, but I really would not let a kid watch this movie. Way to stupid in it's suggestive manner of sexual exploitations. That's just my opinion.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|This watch has been wonderful...I have worn it every day since I got it and I Love it!!!  I highly recommend this watch...
B0052UYJDC|3.0|Inspirational book on how to lighten your life.  Although it does touch on how to include your better half, that may still be a challenge. The book does sell (if your not already thinking that way) the minimalist life with good examples of how to live.  I believe I'll have to follow her advice and be an example hoping others may follow.<br />I enjoyed this book and if your inclined to a less crowded life, you should too.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|With a touch of Billie Holiday in tone & manner, singing songs from several time periods with music from Hank Williams to Leonard Cohen, Madeleine comes out with a new musical mix in the 21 century. Some write that she is too much like Billie Holiday trying to be a near carbon copy, but I disagree, she fades in & out of that mode of expression & has a style all her own. I have been listening to Jazz LP's for the last couple of months & I am use to a certain openness, this 21st century recording CD is very poor. It's all center stage with no to little separation. Do I hear a \\"Hiss\\" or is it coming from the snare drum? Come on Helik Hadar the recording engineer, where is your technology, I got recordings from the 1950's that sound better then this.<br /><br />Overlooking these imperfections Iam going to add other Madeleine CD's to my collection. I don't see any LP's available.
0345535421|5.0|So loving this book, this series and I am so thrilled to know that the HBO series is holding to the books as closely as possible.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Comedians are able to move out of their usual schtick and explore different genres. Take Robin Williams, for example. When he performed in Good Will Hunting and One Hour Photo, it's almost fascinating to see someone like him in a drastically different environment. This is a fair indication that actors can do more than just the same role that they've been playing their entire lifetime. Jim Carrey succeeded in doing that as well with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br /><br />The movie is all about a man who wants to remove the memory of his former girlfriend, but during the process, he is having second thoughts because of all the fun times the two of them shared. Carrey fans are advised: this is NOT a slapstick comedy. This is a very imaginative and very spellbinding romantic comedy/drama. Director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman have created a marvel. It's an almost surreal experience due to the fantastical images and unorthodox storytelling. The entire cast give splendid performances. The chemistry between Carrey and Kate Winslet's character is almost spot-on: realistic, to be more precise.<br /><br />I can see why this movie has garnered a cult following. It's a great movie about the positive sides of life. Kudos to Kaufman, Gondry, Carrey, Winslet, and the others for this fine masterpiece.<br /><br />Grade: 9 out of 10
0062014536|2.0|What a stupid book.<br /><br />Where to start?<br /><br />I guess with the obvious, and often repeated: Authors, STOP ADDING VIEWPOINTS TO LATER BOOKS IN SERIES. I don't know how much I can say this. STOP. IT. If you choose first person to start your book, and first person works for the first two books (or three, Stephenie Meyer, or six, Kelley Armstrong), then make it work. This is a total cop out. And it almost always adds nothing to the book except my frustration.<br /><br />Okay, so I expected that downside from the beginning. It's been a year since I read the first two books and I remember enough to get into Requiem, but not enough to remember details. Was I think annoyed at everyone during those books, I wondered about 15 pages in when Alex (within the span of two pages) tells Lena he survived for her, but then, oh wait, he never loved her, and she only believed the second part. Believed and believed it until I wanted to beat her over the head since it didn't even make sense. I don't even think that's a spoiler, but sorry if I spoiled something for you.<br /><br />And I think there is my biggest complaint: Lena is stupid. She's an idiot. And not in the coming-of-age, can't-quite-make-up-my-mind way. In the emotionally incompetent delusional way. She has no sense about people. Maybe this is from growing up surround by people with the \\"cure,\\" but whatever it is, it got on my nerves.<br /><br />And I don't think I expected the story to take this path, and I don't think it was a smart one. Comparisons to the Uglies series are inevitable, and in my opinion, that series is FAR superior.<br /><br />The ending sucked, like Oliver sort of ran out of time and was like, yeah, this is nice. NO. I am okay with an open ending, a use your imagination to completely resolve everything ending, but COME ON.<br /><br />Ugh, I think the idea from Delirium had a lot of potential. I just wish it hadn't ended (can we even say it ended?) like this.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|Bought this CD for my daughter who loves Selena Gomez.  She enjoys listening to it over and over again.  She said it is a new sound for Selena and varies from her &#34;Disney days&#34;.  Definitely shows she is more grown up.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love the graphics and ease of use. Everything I need to know about the weather is right on my kindle. I would recommend it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Fantastic, complicated, complex yet simple and elegant. Beautiful language, great compassion for the human spirit. I look forward to her next story.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|I rented this movie to watch before purchase and was incredibly glad I did.<br />Totally disappointed in the creation. Terrible filming.<br />Only buy this if you want to watch more than an hour of action (I think) totally in the dark.<br />Couldn't see a thing that was happening plus couldn't understand the audio.<br />I've read a couple of the accounts of the taking of bin Laden and this movie didn't come close.<br />Please DON'T waste your money!
B00006RAKP|4.0|This is a great CD for hearing old hits.  It brings back memories of days ago.  I enjoy the mixture of songs on this CD and would recommend it for any Elton John fan of old.
B007AL48UK|5.0|It had been a while since I had played Mahjong. I had to start over one time or maybe it was twice.  But I finally found it very relaxing again. I can't believe it took me so long to play it again.  Join the fun!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The book didn't grab me until about half way, but then I could relate closely to her experience.  I was devastated by her choices, and it caught me off guard. It was a book I couldn't put down, and I felt like I'd been on a roller coaster when I finished.
B008NABUU8|3.0|It's okay but the graphics aren't great and the controls can be awkward. For example, once I zoom in, it seems like it gets stuck in a mode where moving your finger pans around instead of laying down material and its not obvious how to get out of that mode. I probably won't play this again.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Liked the suspense  Loved King and Maxwell and pictured them as seen on tv. My husband and I were reading at the same time so we kept trying to solve the mystery. It was fun and I loved the way it all came together.  Good fast read!
140006922X|4.0|This book is an unbiased look at Jesus the human being who lived in the 1st century Middle East under Roman occupation.  I agree with Reza, if you really want to know the real Jesus, you must go further than the pages of the gospels and look at his life as it existed in the culture and political times in which he lived.
0307887448|5.0|My son was required to read this book prior to entering his freshman year at a state university, and parents were highly encouraged to read it, too. I was expecting to be bored to tears reading some sort of milk toast sort of sci fi novel, but was immediately caught up in the first few pages with the characters and premise of the search for the futuristic &#34;golden ticket&#34;. The characters show great depth of emotion, moral challenges and evolution along the way. An added plus for grown ups: Having grown up (survived?) in the 70s and 80s - what fun it was to come across references page after page to some of my favorite movies, music and trivia along the way - it was the ultimate &#34;easter eggs for grown ups&#34; (if you read the book, you'll understand that reference). &#34;Ready Player One&#34; is a fast and easy read that spans the often difficult generation gap from ages 18 to 48 flawlessly. My son loved it too and we had some great conversations about it while we both read it - when was the last time THAT happened?
0399226907|5.0|This is such a cute little book and I am so happy we added it to our little boys collection. I loved it when I was growing up and I hope he will too.
1781162646|2.0|I almost finished this book for the pure duty of reading it and I honestly couldn't begin to tell you what it was about.  All I know is that it's about a kid working for an amusement park called Joyland over the summer.  I think he also pines for his ex girlfriend but I'm not totally certain on that.  I felt I needed to read it at the time and it was in my library's queue so I gave it a shot.  Plus it was a work by Stephen King and he generally writes well but all in all I was disappointed with this work of fiction.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Definitely the dogs used in this film were the stars.<br />The humans were the supporting cast.<br />I would have liked more development of Mr. Gere role.<br />Perhaps some scenes were tedious but, over all,<br />a good family entertainment.

B002S43V3Y|4.0|I liked the comedic aspects given to morbid subjects.<br />Harold is an unbelievable kid seeking or avoiding attention<br />with some sick, black humor depending on the occasion.<br />The character played by Ruth Gordon is delightfully superb.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Your first thought about this might be that, &#34;Oh, this is just for gamers.&#34; in theory, you are correct. however, the application of having programmable keys is astounding, especially right literally at your fingertips. it works well for games, yes. however, open your mind for a second for other applications; if you have a sound, video, or 3d space editing software, having twenty or so easily reachable keys at your fingertips is a blessing, because you can perform simple functions in a moment, instead of searching for the right keystrokes for over a minute. The Logitech G13 gameboard is a very handy tool.<br /><br />It arrived like it was supposed to, was in good condition, and functioned exactly like it was designed. I really like the Logitech company for their reliability in their products, and I trust them.<br /><br />There is only one drawback, and it might just be that my hands are bigger, but the palm rest doesn't rest so much for me. It does a good job, but fatigue still sets in. Not a horrible downer, it just ensures resting periods, and hand stretches.<br /><br />Well done Logitech.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Its a very fun tam to pass the time with the only problem is that it keeps crashing on me other than that its good
B003H4I4JU|4.0|If you enjoyed reading Enders Game, you will be a little disappointed because this book is not as fast paced as the first. This book explains a bit more about Ender and his quest. Fun to read.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Honestly I was waiting for this to come out as I did not make it to the theater.  I did not find it that good. Only thing i enjoyed was looking at Leo and that was all. Did not care for the story and it was just kinda weird...all I can really say.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was amazing it made me happy, sad, cry, go crazy and mad all through out the book!! Just amazing!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Well it may be that you don't have to think to much, but enjoy the silliness of the show. It makes me smile after a day in the office. No lines, just sounds of sheep and the rest of the characters. So... if you need to just unwind by your self or your kids, this is a good way to do it.
B00006AG5N|4.0|Very good listening if you like Elvis music.  Lots of songs to listen to and dance to.  Would recommend to anyone.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Not what I expected, my wife read it and pushed me to read it. At first glance I thought its a kids book, but really it is a book for all ages. Fun read, looking forward to seeing the movie. I will suggest that you read the book before you see the movie. I have started to read the next book.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen probably 3 of the Jan Eyre movies.  I found this one to be the best.  I enjoyed Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson and really felt they had great chemistry.  You loved Jane and wanted her to win because everyone thought she was so plain.  I thought she was so beautiful and graceful and outshined all the &#34;beautiful women&#34; of that era.  I believe Mr. Rochester fell in love the moment he saw her but he had to many dark secrets and pain to ever think he could win her.<br /><br />Great acting on both actors and would love to have seen more of them after they married.<br /><br />I am happy I purchased and have watched it more than a few times.  I always seem to see something I missed  the previous time.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great follow up to season 1, personalities of the group develop.  Struggle and lack of trust make for a exciting and unpredictable ending to this season.<br /><br />My favorite of the three seasons so far.  Can't wait for season 4!

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|*If you're already familiar with Breaking Bad and just want a review of this box set itself, scroll to the EDIT*<br /><br />To quote the lead actor Bryan Cranston, \\"the term 'breaking bad' is a southern colloquialism and it means when someone who has taken a turn off the path of the straight and narrow, when they've gone wrong. And that could be for that day or for a lifetime.\\" This show- well actually to call it a show would be a great understatement, I should say this masterpiece, follows the story of Walter White, and how he breaks bad. Walt is a high school chemistry teacher, and first portrayed as kind of a loser. He's emasculated by his family, disrespected by his students, and bullied by his boss. Forced to work two jobs to take care of his pregnant wife and disabled son, Walt soon finds out that he has terminal lung cancer, with only a few months to live. In order to save money for his family to live off of after he's dead, Walt teams up with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth.<br /><br />What follows is a roller coaster ride to Hell. Watching Walt's transformation into his drug lord alter ego, Heisenberg, is one of the most masterfully executed character arcs in television history. Through a series of subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, shifts, we see this previously sympathetic character become something mosnterous. Vince Gilligan has etched his mark forever in entertainment history with this series. When most people want to show a character turn dark, they tend to rush things, and show drastic changes in a short amount of time, sometimes only a season or two. Not here. It's piece by piece, that Walter White tears off the mask of the harmless family man, to reveal the beast lurking behind a visage of meek compliance. Bryan Cranston brings this character to life in shocking, amazing, and breathtaking ways. He is the one who knocks.<br /><br />This isn't to say that Walt is the whole show. Aaron Paul plays Walt's protege, Jesse Pinkman,a juggalo without the makeup whose dialogue consists mostly of the words \\"Yo,\\" and \\"Bitch.\\" Although while Jesse might start off as a bit of a clown, his character turns out to be so much more. Even though he's the one initially identified as a scumbag, Jesse without a doubt has one of the biggest hearts on the show. Between himself, Walt, and their many criminal associates, Jesse is often the only one portrayed as having a conscience.<br /><br />A constant and intriguing element of the show is also Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent Hank Schrader, portrayed by Dean Norris. Hank is a typical alpha male tough guy, sort of character, although he is also often brought in for comedic effect and is without a doubt a force of good. What makes the Hank element so truly marvelous though, is the fact that while he maintains a close friendship with Walt, he is constantly hunting his alter-ego, Heisenberg. Hank describes himself as Popeye Doyle, waving goodbye to Frog-One.<br /><br />Now I could sit here and go over every one of the amazing characters in Breaking Bad, from Walt's pain in the ass wife Skyler, to the ever so polite and refined drug kingpin, Gustavo Fring. But to do so would be to go beyond the scope of what this review is supposed to be. Breaking Bad is patient, it makes you wait for the payoff to come, and when it does come, it will blow your mind. For example, in some of the early episodes you see some tension between Walt and his old college friends over a company called Grey Matter, and it's not until season five that Walt explains the history there, in one of the most powerful scenes in the entire series. \\"I'm in the empire business.\\" The show also makes good use of symbolism, such as the fly and the pink teddy bear (you'll just have to watch and see). Every time you watch through the series, you gain something new from it. For example (spoiler ahead) if you look at the titles to all the episodes in season 2 that have a 'flash forward' to the finale, the titles form the sentence \\"737 down over ABQ.\\"<br /><br />As I'm writing this review, it's three episodes before the series finale. I will come back and edit this twice, first when the series is finished to give my final thoughts, and perhaps compose a more in depth review, and then again when the box set is actually released in November so I can give my thoughts on this product itself.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/9/2013:<br /><br />So they released some pictures of the box set. I have to say, it looks really cool. It's designed in the shape of one of the barrels that Walt buries his money in towards the end of the series. Although I suppose it could also be a chemical barrel or one of the ones that they use to dissolve dead bodies in if you use your imagination. It also comes with a commemorative coin designed by Vince Gilligan and (my personal favorite) a Los Pollos Hermanos apron.<br /><br />The special features include:<br />- No Half Measures, a documentary detailing the filming of the final 8 episodes.<br />- Bad memories, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul talk about the final episodes and their feelings and thoughts on the show.<br />- Scene Envy, the cat tells us which scenes they wish they could have been in.<br />- Shocking Moments, the cast reveals the moments that shocked them the most.<br />- From Walt to Heisenberg, A montage showing the transformation from Walter White to Heisenberg.<br />- How Will It End? Prerecorded predictions from the cast on how the series is going to end.<br />- Avenging Agent: Dean Norris as Hank Schrader.<br />- Scene Stealer: Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader.<br />- A Criminal Attorney: Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman.<br />- Jesse's Journey: Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman.<br />- Skyler Breaks Bad: Anna Gunn on Season Four.<br />- Growing Up in the White House: RJ Mitte on Walt Jr.<br />- The Ultimate Chess Match, a look back at the battle between Walt and Gus.<br />- Looking Back: A Season Four Retrospective, the best of season four.<br />- Ted'sWipeout, Christopher Cousins explains how Ted's head injury was filmed.<br />- The Truck Attack Storyboard Comparison, storyboards for the episode Bullet Points, and an in depth look at the attack on the Los Pollos Hermanos truck.<br />- Walt and the Challenger Storyboard Comparison, a look at the filming of Walt doing donuts in Walt Jr's car.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/9/2013:<br /><br />Here's some big news folks. The studio just announced that this set will include a 3 minute alternate ending! I'm sure there will be lots of speculation on what this could be, so i won't get into my own theories here. Can't wait to see what it is though!<br /><br />Vince Gilligan also personally confirmed that we will get to see some scripted scenes that were left out of the final seasons, one of them from the final episode itself where Walt confronts one of his former students at a gas station who recognizes him on his way back to town!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/26/2013:<br /><br />BOX SET IS IN HAND! I absolutely love this thing. You can tell just by holding it that it's made from high quality materials. When you open it up, the Breaking Bad logo on the inside is actually the companion booklet, with a personalized letter from Vince Gilligan inside. Each season is in these magnetized sea through plastic cases that look like coasters, and when you take out all the discs and put them together, they make a picture from the show! (flying pants, pink teddy bear, etc). When you open the top, there's an extra disc inside the disc with some backwards numbers (from the POV shot of Walt looking at his GPS). On the disc is a bunch of extras, including the never before seen 2 hour fifteen minute documentary of the making of Breaking Bad. Underneath that is an insert that makes it look like the barrel is filled with money. Inside of the insert is a full sized Los Pollos Hermanos apron. Also inside is a Breaking Bad challenge coin.<br /><br />This is by far the best box set I have ever seen, and not justbecause it contains the best show ever made. If you love Breaking Bad then this is a must own.

0312330537|1.0|I find that readers are never ambivalent about this book.  They either hate it or love it.  I was no exception.  What surprises is that I actually read all 944 pages of a book I didn't like!  I was a determined to dislike it for all 944 pages.<br />1. Gregory David Roberts (both the author and the narrator of the book) is amazingly narcissistic. In each narrative thread he is brave and loved and insightful.<br />2.  His female characters are extremely one dimensional (always saint or sinner- no rich depth of character from this author).  And in fact there are only two that play any major part in the story.  All the other women are \\"bit\\" players at best.<br />3.  His prose is redundant.  Every time Karla (the love interest of the narrator) moved into the story I was again told in great detail how green her eyes were.<br />4. He romanticized the slums- the slum dwellers were almost angelic in their goodness.  The suffering was presented as rather superficial.  And then the India mafia- drug dealers, money launderers, document forgers, prostitutes- the underbelly that is Bombay- were described in noble terms.  This might make for a good, though superficial reading experience, but it does not in any way honestly portray the reality of the life.<br />5. Almost every body dies- or almost dies- with violence splashed across page after page as if violence is somehow a \\"good\\" to be admired.  Of course the narrator does not die.  And sometimes the characters you thought had died didn't really die and showed up on later pages.<br />6.  I do believe this book was a long, long, long run-on Bollywood movie!  Let the music begin.  Call in the chorus girls.  Escape from the suffering in a world that is harsh and cruel.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|In this book, R.J Palico  perfectly captures the story of a middle school boy  who's face is... different . Aguast wouldn't have wanted me to say \\"deformed\\":  ) any way, great book. It's a must read. I hope you buy this book because the content is so rich. My favorite part is the end, which I can't tell you about cause you haven't read the book: ) I think this  book is good for ages 9-100? Any one over 9: ). Perfect book.

0316228583|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter series and purchased this solely on the strength of the former books excellence. I found the Casual Vacancy, however, to be crude in it's vocabulary, depressing and poorly written. None of the skill of story telling or descriptive writing or character development were evident.  I could not bring myself to finish the book. Regardless of this opinion of this book I remain a huge fan of Ms. Rowling's other works and consider her Potter series all time classics.
1442346949|4.0|For avid Apple fans who knew every detail of Jobs' career already, a common complaint seemed to be that this book was a little superficial. My interest in Apple and Jobs in particular has been fairly peripheral over the years, so I was satisfied with the depth and volume of information it provided. The bottom line is that I came away with a much greater appreciation for Jobs' sincerity, and also the products of Apple, which I have in the past viewed primarily as a case study in how to sell rather ordinary (and unavoidably disposable) computers, mp3 players and phones as status symbols or indicators of intelligence/good taste.

B00BE97ONM|5.0|Short, quick and to-the-point chapters kept this thriller moving at a fast pace. A blend of action, drama and emotion kept me reading until the last page, totally engrossed and very happy to have discovered this author. I highly recommend you read this book!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If you read books at bedtime, don't buy this one. Once I started reading (in bed) the hours were non stop. I had a really hard time putting it down. I recently saw the World War Z movie and it wasn't as good as the book. Just my opinion.
044024238X|5.0|One of my absolute favorites!  Kinsella never disappoints.  This novel is a great beach read or a wonderful way to escape a hectic day. Enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is  a fun game and I like how it makes me think. Good for getting the brain working. Would like to have a few free hints.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|It is a very interesting and constantly moving but confusing tale across many decades of time and very Coles characters.  The police characters continue across the Harry Hole adventures and this was my second one published before the first one I read, so I knew some names already.  Altogether a very compelling tale of madness and murders.
0767020308|4.0|Emma is one of my favorite movies but if I had seen this version first I would never have fallen in love with the story or Emma. The casting is bad, there is no character development, the direction is the worst ever. The charm of this story is the relationships between all these characters and this movie bounces around so much that you don't really get to know any of them. Kate Beckinsale is forgettable as Emma and Mr. Knightley is over-the-top mean so by the end of the movie I was hoping they didn't get together as I'm certain she would become an abused wife! Don't waste your money on this one. UPDATE. I've watched this movie several more times and it's actually becoming my favorite version, second only to BBC. I think the problem still lies in the casting as Mark Strong's portrayal of Mr. Knightley overpowered Kate's spoiled, childlike version of Emma. An actress with a stronger presence such as Keira Knightley would have helped this feel more like a romance that an afterthought.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|While this is an easy app to use, I expected more.  I'm not able to change fonts. Some of the 'abilities' such as sharpening, etc. don't make much of a change to the photo.  Writing on the photo needs a 'size' button... I would like to have a different thickness (other than my fat finger).  The effects are good &amp; given the pixels that this Kindle Fire HD has, changing up the original is a plus.  Overall, if you're looking for a simple app that doesn't break the bank, this is a good one.  But if you want one that has more bells &amp; whistles (and don't mind paying for it), don't bother with this one... your bells &amp; whistles app will be able to do what this one does.
B004G8P2M8|5.0|It's from a different era, and a different style of writing, but it's a very good book and an interesting look at a time gone by.
1400049628|4.0|My kiddo saw this book and wanted it.  She liked it alot and read it quickly.  It must have been a good one.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Everything in this movie is perfect. The music is amazing, the actors are perfect for their roles, the storyline is astonishing and surprising, and the movie itself is so visually stunning.<br /><br />In the year 2077, aliens attacked earth. They were defeated, but earth was completely destroyed. Rome, London, New York City; all lie beneath hundreds of feet of sand and rubble. The TET is collecting survivors for transport to one of Saturn's moons, Titan. Jack and Vicka remain below, handling logistics and repairing drones and hydro-reactors that are converting the earth's oceans into energy for the colony in Titan.<br /><br />That's all I can tell you; you have to watch the movie. It is so incredibly well put together. The storyline holds you in suspense and mystery for a very long time, and the climactic scene is simply epic. I cannot compliment this movie enough.<br /><br />However, the ending is a bit disappointing, so just stop the movie about 2 minutes before then.<br /><br />This is a must watch, a true epic, and possibly one of the best movies of 2013.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I normally wait until I have finished a game before I rate it. In this case I just couldn't wait. The longest gaming dryspell of my gaming experience has finally come to an end. This is the fun game that I have been searching for every day for weeks. For all those gamers who enjoy \\"Hidden Object Adventure\\" games, this is it. Thanks, Nancy Bettac Barton, grammacozy62<br /><br />I wrote this review before I knew the price of $4.99. While I was surprised by the high price, I still purchased the game. Although I am still not finished (the game lasts considerably longer than 5 mins.), the game is just as fun as when I wrote my earlier review. This is a great game and so far, worth the price. I still highly recommend it. Nancy Bettac Barton, grammacozy62
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game. It is so addicting and when you play it you just cant stop playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing great games.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I love Presto!  I only had this on cassette for years and practically wore it out from playing it so much.  Rush is the best group in the universe and this album has never been a disappointment!
B00DV3A84G|5.0|Bastille, which only recently debuted in America, is an excellent new band. Their music is somewhat haunting, but you can understand and connect to it, even though it's not straightforward. The lead singer has an very good voice, and the musicians themselves are very skilled.<br /><br />Definitely a good buy.
0345803485|5.0|The book was great and everything I expected. I absolutely love it. Great choice for anybody. I love this book.
B007AL48UK|1.0|This was not my favorite version of mahjong.  I was curious,  and wanted variety.  I think I'll stick with the version that I already have.
B008SBY7JI|5.0|I ordered this for my sister for her birthday.  She is the biggest No Doubt fan I know and she was extremely happy with this cd.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game takes you by surprise. You start by thinking it is just another hidden object games e, but it has other things to keep you on your toes. I am enjoying the challenges. Hope you like it as much as I do. One of the best games I have played.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|I always like Tunstall's lyrics, but her last album Tiger Suit, I felt was a little over produced, a little Phil Spector-ish.  The mix and production on this one really fit the songs. And don't get in the way of her voice. The music is more folk-rock than her more blues influenced, chorus driven past work.  The lyrics too are some of her best, apparently coming from some recent deep personal changes and tragedy in her life.
0525952926|5.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett great book.  This is the second book of the trilogy and I strongly recommend it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out.  I can't remember how many copies of this movie we have gone through but it is a family favorite!  The whole look of the movie and the characters is wonderful!  Who can resist Jareth?
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a pretty cool little game to pass the time and for the price haha (I got it for free) okay for it being free I definitely am liking it a lot...
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|My Kindle Fire's volume hasn't sounded loud enough the past year,  especially when listening to old time radio on Sirius XM. I tried all the preset EQ setting and absolutely live the metal setting. the voices are loud and rich,  making it a lot easier to hear.
0385486804|3.0|I bought this book as listed in &#34;used, very good&#34; condition. If you put those words together, it has indeed been &#34;used very good.&#34; The cover was peeling apart from the clear coat, pages are missing from the inside (thankfully only the map & the introduction pages) The story line seems very thorough and accurate. The author did a great job getting in touch with everyone Chris came into contact with & has managed to reproduce this story in excellent form.
0307346617|4.0|Another selection of my daughter's choice.  She really liked this and again read it fairly quickly.  I imagine it was a good book due to her interest and speed of completion.
B008469DGY|5.0|Flick Golf is fun and challenging the more you advance the harder the course. It has a great selection of golf courses that you will have too unlock, are you up FOUR the challenge.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|The director's cut, with its clips from the tell-all book, definitely makes more sense than the frustrating cooking version.  Also the remastered film is easier on the eye.  However there's still a considerable gap between the director's alleged  intentions and what we're given.  I didn't find the supporting material of the 2nd disc particularly revealing in any way.
6305692572|3.0|I bought this movie for work while working as a DUI instructor. In the state of CA you can only teach certain topics & MUST teach 2 parts to the program: Education & Group. Although all classes are held in a group setting, this is how the State has set the program up. During the Education portion, I was instructed to have clients watch a move then discuss how it affected them & or how they could relate to certain characters and what &#34;role&#34; the character played. Very dramatic, a few sexually explicit scenes, language & some violence.Not my personal favorite & I would never purchase this for my self.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Will not load articles... only headlines and photos. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times. No better. Works fine on my Android phone. On Kindle I can email articles to myself to read but that isn't satisfactory. Tried signing in in Kindle with my account from my phone but that was no better. Useless until they fix it.km
B00CNEVII4|4.0|I played this versions and it sounded okay.  If they're using the first generation tape why not advertize it like they used to when they used to use the first generation tape all the time?<br /><br />They claim it's the mastering that is more important but I think using the first generation tape like Mobile Fidelity  will always sound better
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book. It was all the things I want in a book. Romance, mystery, fueding,  and much much more.  Can not wait to see how it ends

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have a first edition kindle.  I could not get books ordered onto it.  When I found out it needed upgrading, I looked for my cable and couldn't find it. -- SO, on-line, I found the one I wanted, ordered it and got it very quickly.<br />Was able to do my upgrade on my old kindle, and am now happily reading books of my choice once again!<br /><br />Thanks for your terrific service.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|The  story is exceptional and the author does a great job of trying to understand what made this young man do what he did. he also makes comparisons of other adventuresome people who have also ventured out into other wild and remarkable experiences. He oes an exceptional job of winding the story together.
1577314808|5.0|This book is the best spiritual read I ever came across. Down to earth language on something that is infinitely deep and impossible to understand mentally alone. Try it.
0763660531|5.0|This gorgeous, wordless picture book was a perfect way to kick off the school year with my fifth graders!  Our theme topic to begin September was JOURNEY, so what better way to talk about what a journey is and what it can teach us than to live it through Becker's incredible adventure story.  In the beginning, a lonely girl can't find anyone in her busy family to spend time with her.  When she discovers a red crayon and draws a doorway on the wall, she is whisked away, along with the reader, into another world.  The watercolor illustrations are beautiful and intricate, and my students and I loved the girl's modes of transportation through her travels, eventually leading her to a grand act of kindness.  Stories within the story will keep you captivated, and many discussions will ensue.  This will remain one of my favorites in my classroom library.  I think it would make a great graduation or back-to-school gift, too!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this battery app for my Kindle Fire HD. It's great to know how much time I have for left for various functions!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|My Girlfriend got me the Kindle Fire and as far as I know from after she purchased this Facebook, I told her to delete it since I don't have a Facebook account.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I've really been enjoying this game. I've been playing it now for a few days. Since it saves where you left off, it's easy to come back to whenever I have time
B00006879E|5.0|This is such an amazing CD. Adam Levine has such an awesome voice, and I take this everywhere I go with me!
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|I like equalizers on my home stereo, so I thought one on my phone would be great. I have an HTC ONE. The app runs fine. The levels on the first screen go up and down fine. The app doesn't do anything other than that. It doesn't change the music at all. I thought it might be the Beats Audio, so I turned that off and this app still didn't do anything.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|My Girlfriend got me the Kindle Fire and as far as I know from after she purchased this viewer and downloader for it, it is just an icon, nothing more or less.
B001J8NQGW|2.0|I bought this a few years back during the launch of everything blu....blu ray, blu spec, blu toothe, and of course the blue pill! Doing a review today seems pointless. If the blu spec discs were any good, all labels would have adopted the technology. When compared with the regular CD, it renders a little more bass and hi. But the mids are just as gritty and unpleasant. Contrary to what and how it was hyped, it is nowhere near the vinyl.
6303020089|5.0|I love old movies. This one turned out Perfect. No problems with it at all.  I love the company that deals with you
B002C2XXJY|5.0|i love this cd and it came in very good condition! it was perfect and i love some of the songs i had never heard before!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|It's funny, I loved the upbeat, hyper songs on 'For Your Entertainment', but the slower, non-dance songs are the ones that truly stand apart on 'Trespassing'. I am not ashamed to admit the lyrics in 'Broken English' and 'Underneath' moved me to tears. There is so much honesty in his delivery, it's obvious he means the words he's singing. In a time when everything popular is mass produced, auto-tuned, and as real as spray cheese, Adam Lambert stands apart. I can't wait to see what comes next. I'm hoping for more of the honesty that makes this album stand apart.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Love this band
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I loved it cuz it was hard and it was an awesome game u should get it guess the emoji was the game for me
B000002GB4|5.0|Replaced older and well used copy of this.  Always good to listen to the &#34;old&#34; music.......from back when there were actual lyrics and decent  tunes  involved in music.  How long has it been since YOU listened to some STYX??

B0053O8AQE|5.0|I'm so happy when the price of this season went down because I wanted it so bad since I missed so many episodes after I got rid of cable and they removed the episodes from the website online. I love this show, I love the ambition of caroline and I relate to max a lot. So It's definitely something I enjoy having and I will be purchasing season 2.
B00005KK9M|5.0|Replaced older CD.  Fabulous music and worth listening to over and over again.  How long since YOU have heard it???
1439190275|5.0|Great product. This book has given me helpful tips to encourage my walk on a low-carb diabetic diet. It has some great ideas that I have already implemented. Thanks!

B004J4WLB4|5.0|The writer provided the most contemporary, yet literary, view of foster children. A heart breaker, but the piece on meanings of flowers kept the book soaring.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Loved it made u think. everything in the maybe had a meaning. I would recommend it to anyone. best movie we watched in a long time
1454901276|5.0|So good.  I never take the time to write reviews, but this book affected me.  More than just a great mystery/suspense, it rang true.  It unfolds and draws you in layer by layer, then there's a huge whallop at the end.  Don't want to be a spoiler, but people can literally forget--this happened to me in real life.  And people can do crazy things driven by their past.  There is evil and darkness out there, and sometimes we have to try to deal with it, to process it.  I had to wonder if there could be a backstory there with the lady caught between the two best friends . . . Definitely want to read more by this excellent writer!
B004PGAQMW|5.0|One of the best animated movies, along with the Despicable Me series, Monster's Inc and Univ, Up, Chicken Run, Etc.

B00EALI6IS|5.0|A great book! It was very interesting story about Nole childhood and his tennis startup. I will try his recipe for success!
B008MM9630|4.0|So far this is a pretty decent game to play. It takes some time to complete a lot of the missions but you can always go do other things and come back to the game.all in all a good game.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I am in love with this movie! It is so awesome! I love everything about it. This movie is simply amazing!
B008NEMPTO|4.0|I did have to send this movie back, only because it was a previously viewed set, & was missing the 3D version that I purchased it for.  I did return it easily because this was through Prime.  I bought the movie elsewhere for about the same price, must have not been popular.  The movie was very good I enjoyed it before in blue ray, I wanted the 3D.  The 3D made the movie viewing better, not fantastic as some are, no Avatar.  I'm still glad I bought the 3D in this.  So really a good movie, better in 3D.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Did I mention hooked? Well that's exactly what I was. It was as if Hugh knew how to keep me interested. Just when I thought I could guess what was to happen next, I found myself surprised and flipping through pages only to find more suspense. I gave up sleep to finish this series, and it was all worth it.
B001AFF25W|4.0|A clear and easy guide to rethinking how to approach your work and home life<br />I recommend this book to anyone in a career rut
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Richard Lester and the Beatles pioneered the music video.  This film features several imaginative musical sequences.  The Beatles music of course is terrific.<br /><br />Not much of a plot.  Not that it matters.  A fun musical romp in beautiful color!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I loved the movie and had it in DVD, I wanted to see if the 3D was good & being a great older movie I like to have it in the more durable and more vibrant BR for HD quality & longevity.  I was glad for the purchase.  The 3D was very good for an older release.  I thought the 3D made the BR even better.  Great movie, enjoyable even more in BR 3D!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love this alarm clock!  Easy to use and accurate.<br />It has choices for the alarm clock sound.  Can be programmed quickly and easily.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|I've seen this before but it makes me laugh every time. Will Ferrell is a fav and does not disappoint. Not a huge Ben Stiller fan but is a hoot in this film.
B004PGO25O|4.0|If you have set your life goals but still wondering why things are not working out, or giving up on some objectives, this book wiil not only help you to overcome procrastination but it wiil also make you understand why you hit walls in your journey! It's because You are after something great!  Change your thinking instead of quitting! Start before you are ready and keep on working!
B00026ZG10|5.0|I think that Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold made a great couple in this story. It kept your attention through the entire movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|It starts slow in the beginning few episodes but gets more intense, suspenseful and dramatic thereafter. It is a very addicting show.

0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg believes that not enough women are CEOs or close to it.  She is less concerned about what happens in the corporate world below that level.  Hanna Rosin, in \\"The End of Men and the Rise of Women\\" (2012), demonstrates how women now largely dominate middle-level management and also college graduate numbers.  So male college finishers and men occupying middle-level management positions are more and more scarce, while the industrial and hard labor jobs are also drying up.  This can lead to widespread dependency on women and a loss of self-respect for males within families.<br /><br />Both these books are extremely valuable, and they are complimentary, but you wouldn't know that from reading Sandberg's book.  She even manages to misspell Rosin's name in the end notes, and doesn't include her in the index.  It's unfortunate, because taken together, these two books give a broad picture of what's happening to the roles of men and women in the workplace.<br /><br />The primary purpose of Sandberg's book is to inspire, and she's very effective at this.  She urges women to aim high, be brave, insist on a place at the meeting table, and pay attention to the likeability factor, which can be summarized as: \\"If a woman is competent, she does not seem nice enough.  If a woman seems really nice, she is considered more nice than competent.\\"<br /><br />Here's how to get a job: a senior director of marketing at eBay came to visit Sandberg and told her, \\"I want to apply to work with you at Facebook, so I thought about calling you and telling you all of the things I'm good at and. . .like to do.  Then I figured that everyone was doing that.  So instead, I want to ask you: What is your biggest problem, and how can I solve it?\\"  Sandberg responded, \\"Recruiting is my biggest problem.  And, yes, you can solve it.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg gives excellent protocols for choosing an ideal mentor.  She believes that one should bring one's whole personality to work, and show emotion when that is appropriate.  Women, according to her, can help create a workplace where it's O.K. to hug, nurture, or even cry.  She recognizes the artificiality of having one personality at work and another at home.<br /><br />Sandberg urges parental leave for both men and women and even close parking places for pregnant women.  But she asks women to work as long as possible and to make plans for returning to work as soon as possible.  She sees many women lose promotions and more sophisticated work because they give up too early due to pregnancy or even the thought of one day having a baby.<br /><br />Sandberg asks that men and women really share the work in the home 50% - 50%.  \\"As women must be more empowered at work, men must be more empowered at home.  I have seen so many women inadvertently discourage their husbands from doing their share by being too controlling or critical.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg decries the myth of \\"having it all\\" or \\"doing it all.\\"  She no longer tries to work constant 12-hour days and sacrifices some opportunities so she can be with her children at important times.<br /><br />Sandberg says that sexist innuendoes such as being labeled a \\"feminist\\" should not be ignored, but faced boldly and dealt with immediately.  She exhorts women to work together toward equality, citing Betty Friedan's refusing to work with Gloria Steinem.<br /><br />Bursting with research and footnotes and replete with helpful anecdotal vignettes, Sandberg's book shines with her sparkling personality and should be read by both men and women.n that is appropriate.

I have seen so many women inadvertently discourage their husbands from doing their share by being too controlling or critical.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg decries the myth of \\"having it all\\" or \\"doing it all.\\"  She no longer tries to work constant 12-hour days and sacrifices some opportunities so she can be with her children at important times.<br /><br />Sandberg says that sexist innuendoes such as being labeled a \\"feminist\\" should not be ignored, but faced boldly and dealt with immediately.  She exhorts women to work together toward equality, citing Betty Friedan's refusing to work with Gloria Steinem.<br /><br />Bursting with research and footnotes and replete with helpful anecdotal vignettes, Sandberg's book shines with her sparkling personality and should be read by both men and women.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Unlike some puzzle games containing random, unrelated solution components, this one maintains a degree of logic, so the puzzles are solvable.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|game was really good in my opinion it is really fun and exitiing and the adventures is good good good
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book is very inspirational. I know others who are pursuing their careers and would  love to read this book for some motivation.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy playing this game on facebook. Now i can play it on the go and not need to be at the computer.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I have tried pool games but this is quite different. It more like a real game. I would recommend it.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|In my opinion it was difficult to get through because it was slow, didn't really keep my interest someone else may enjoy more than I did....
0060751967|4.0|its the beginning of (hopefully) a great series, lso enjoyed the different people that you meet and the nature of the main characters, Roman and Shanna, its funny, romantic, sometimes even a little sad but all in all it was a good book
0399159347|5.0|LOL is Laugh Out Loud so I titled my review GOL for Gasp Out Loud - because I did that at least five times while reading this book!!!  The characters and their lives were beautifully and intricately woven together.  The story managed to be fascinating AND believable.  And the suspense built to an amazing and satisfying conclusion.  I loved it!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is without a doubt the most I have ever gotten into a TV series. The casting/acting/shooting is top notch, you get to learn a little about the law and morality, then you also come to care about individual characters story lines. What's not to like?
B009NXV2RK|5.0|As usual Tom Clancy comes up with the goods and it is awesome to have all the familiar characters in the story!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|A worthy successor to Card's masterpiece.  Can't wait to get my hands on the next one.  A great piece of science fiction.
B00CXQL828|4.0|Good job guys. They sound like the blues version of bands like Mr Big. Sounds really really good. Definitely recommended!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  Can't wait to get home after work to watch all my recorded episodes (of course they are older reruns) but you get where I am coming from.  Love to watch them over and over.  Love to watch Gibbs and DiNozzo!!<br /><br />Keep up the Good Work!
B005SCSL56|5.0|this is the best fairy tale chapter book ever. i loved the humor and the satisfying dialogue. i lve it with all my heart. conner is my fave character.
B005DZMODI|5.0|The names Marsalis and Clapton have long polarized certain segments of their respective audiences. Both have long paid tribute to the musical forebears behind their own perspectives while being sometimes criticized for their stridency while at once breaking their own new ground on occasion. Here we have Clapton's guitar in a role he longed for back when he was a sideman with Delaney & Bonnie in the post Cream drama of the only Blind Faith tour. What differs is his decades long confident and versatile vocal skills allows his sideman tendencies to be less of a concern when surrounded by the evocative charts played by Marsalis' group of jazz experts. The fact that this is Clapton (and his long-time keyboard foil Chris Stainton) joining forces with a band of musicians who have largely played together for a while now adds the the programs tightness while the newness of the pairing keeps things full of energy and fire. What I was unprepared for was the choices of tunes, all chosen by Clapton specifically for the project, show off his depth of his musical knowledge and the expansive nature of his listening pleasure. A treat to hear EC's understated solos underscored by Marsalis and companies precision and New Orleans loose-but-tight forcefulness. Great songs, great musicians, great fun.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I discovered Lee Child's Jack Reacher Series quite by accident.  Our then Pastor was receiving books read by congregants and making them available to others.  A lend and read program.  Well I picked up a Jack Reacher and within 6 months found, purchased and read all 19 publications which Lee Child had then authored in the Jack Reacher Series.  I am anxiously awaiting the next book which come out in October 2013 I believe.
0062124293|2.0|Someone suggested this book for my book club but it was too raunchy for many of our group (ages 45-55). I thought some of the author's points about the complexity of women's role in the modern world were interesting but her ribald British humour was bordering on lewdness at times. One can pick it up and select certain chapters without reading the whole book but I wouldn't suggest it for a book club as over half of our group didn't get past the first few chapters and I only made it through by skimming the parts that didn't interest me.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|GREAT app. No frills ... no fuss. Clean and easy to use. Just does what it says it will effortlessly. I would like a couple other clock options.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|From his J.J. Cale covers to his choices of fairly obscure contemporary and revisionist chestnuts, this enjoyable record has few surprises but again provides a solid, enjoyable listen for folks not looking for guitar heroics. Clapton has progressively claimed the throne as the King of Good Taste from his stalwart choices of stellar sidemen to his love of a good song, his always soulful and soothing vocal range is used to being shown off by sublime ensemble play. The key to his success through the years has always been hinged to his impeccable dedication to the song itself. EC may be the face of the music but his embrace of the essence of the material he chooses is its soul.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Although there is much about Jack Reacher's character that I dislike, the judge, jury and executioner of his enemies approach to solving his problems, I admire his willingness to stick his neck out for the underdog.  The battle of good v. evil that rages within Jack Reacher is fascinating to view and one a reader can relate to his/her own daily battle of being human.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Easy read, good story, can't wait to see how the last one ends! Read this book in 2 days...loved it!
030758836X|5.0|Totally did not want to put this book away...working full time allowed me only night time reading or on weekends...sat on the couch one weekend...felt so lazy, but I HAD TO FINISH READING!!!<br /><br />Really makes your think...can not say anymore, or I will give the story away...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|We lost our dog in Jan. 2012. We always thought he was very smart and understood what was going on in our home. Just a comforting read.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|The funniest book I have EVER read in my life. I keep going back to it since I was first introduced to its greatness over 20 years ago.
0525423842|4.0|GRISHAM WRITES THIS THEODORE BOONE SERIES FOR YOUNG ADULTS BUT US OLDER ADULTS CAN ENJOY THEM TOO.  BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF RIDING OUR BIKES TO GET PLACES AND WHAT THAT &#34;AWKWARD AGE&#34; WAS ALL ABOUT.  LIGHT READING AND A SHORT BOOK BUT STILL ENJOYABLE.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|great special effects and the acting was top notch ! loved it! what a follow up to last year's movie.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|A very twisty-turny film that is extremely disturbing by the time the pieces of the puzzle are put in place.  I am not a Halle Berry fan at all, but she was great in this.  She was only out-done by Penelope Cruz who plays a patient in Dr. Miranda Grey's (Halle Berry) insane asylum.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Come on marvel guy flex some muscles watch the movie scene by scene before you market it out to the public. it all sucks iron patriot should have kept the war machine. Potts with the armor has the code name \\"rescue\\" that would have been a good addition to the story. all that armor without purpose but to destroy against weak opponents (tip they cant fly kill them from afar with your super advance targeting thing). mandarin now that was a joke where are the rings wheres Fing Fang Fung stop with the terrorist angle its been done over and over again and mandarin is oriental not middle eastern. Panic attack??? go with the drunk tony stark story line iron man....dead man. will forever be branded the action movie that lacks action. dont F*** Up age of ultron and the infinity gauntlet story line.No wonder RD jr. wants to quit.
159463176X|3.0|This book does not compare to his first two books.  I felt I didn't get enough information on some of the characters--example Pia's mother.
B00755MHXG|5.0|My 11 years old kid loved it so did we.  A story that will touch your heart. Don't miss this book.
B003VA3JUO|5.0|This is one of those rare, sleeping gems that grabs you right from the beginning.  However, if you're not into gruesome and shocking - this isn't for you.  It isn't a continuous stream of gore, but the beginning grabs you at the ankles in a pretty shocking way.  I loved the story and the acting as well.  Good ghost stories are rare...this is one of them in my opinion
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very addictive, I really like the levels and could spend hours playing it, I just have to wait a couple hours every now and then to refill the energy, which I don't mind, since I don't want to spend money!!! Great game!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After watching the movie before reading any of the trilogy, I was so disappointed I nearly didn't read them. I'm so glad I did. The last was the most difficult to read yet also the most difficult to put down. I had a feeling I knew how it ended but I was wrong. Completely wrong. Many others didn't like the ending but I thought it was perfect for the series. It also ended the way I'd hoped it would. Great job, author!
B000JIHP88|4.0|Our daughter loves this mobile!  The animals turn and the leaves wave up and down.  Even when she is being held anywhere near it, she will stare at it waiting for it to move.  I was apprehensive when I ordered this mobile due to some of the reviews I read about it not working for very long or not fitting on the crib.  As for the problem of not working for very long, we have had this mobile for over a month now and it is still going strong.  It is unfortunate that some people have had trouble with it in that aspect because it really is a beautiful and entertaining product for baby.  And in terms of it not fitting on the crib, I just have to say that right on the box it says that it won't fit all cribs (specifically convertible cribs).  I think maybe that is just a matter of people not paying attention to the product features or doing their research.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is that the plastic screw contraption that holds it onto the crib could possibly be a little sturdier.  I am confident that it is not going to break or come loose and fall on baby, but I think if they were going to focus on improving any part of the mobile, that would be it.<br /><br />Oh, and also:  the rainforest noises are great.  The classical music options:  not so great for anyone who is actually a fan of the beautiful sounds of classical.  My husband likes them just fine though so I suppose it is just a matter of personal taste.
B00EHAIHWM|4.0|I like that when I listen to this album I know I'm listening to Franz Ferdinand. I would have like more variation on their already awesome and unique sound, but over all it fits nicely with their other two albums. If you like the first two you'll enjoy this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ms. Day could write 50 books about these 2 and I would read them all!I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0078XFYDA|1.0|I was surprised by the level. Dawkins must have written the book for an audience with a very limited knowledge of science. Don't feel like I learned anything.
B003XDZN8A|3.0|Size 9 seems to be smaller than my old ones, in the older version of the same style. A half size bigger would be nice.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I had missed this episode when the show first aired. This episode cleared up a bunch of my questions I had.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Love being able to listen to music and watch videos and vevo combines the best of the two! Great app!
1491054484|1.0|I don't understand all the glowing reviews for this book.  It is riddled with spelling, grammar and substantive errors.  Seriously, there is literally a spelling error in the first sentence, and it doesn't get any better from there.  I have a hard time having any confidence in an author, a technical one no less, who doesn't bother to use a spell checker.  I don't think I've ever returned a book to Amazon because it's kind of a hassle, but I'm returning this one on principle.  Our expectations should be higher.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I saw Derek Trucks in Hawaii at a small venue and he is an outstanding musician, however, he was pretty young then, and didn't have much stage &#34;presence&#34;.  The CD's are great!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This is quality music. Between Ariana's incredible, soothing, Mariah Carey-like voice, and crisp, polished drum beats, Yours Truly truly kicks ass.
B00DU73T08|2.0|Movie was very long and drawn out, and the trailer had all the highlights. Wouldnt have paid the money had I known ahead of time!
0385486804|5.0|This book is the first I'd ever read that had a direct and permanent impact upon the way I view and think about life. The movie is great, too--very creative film-making at times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movies and love the inteactive game. its my favotite to play when I'm bored and I'm 21 years old
B002XMGGK6|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Twist and turn, has you rooting for the villain all the way.  Delivered as described
B002E2M3KM|4.0|I purchased News of the world to replace a $1.00 yard sale find. The yard sale original was badly warped and unplayable. What a bummer! I was determined to have this for my collection and when I saw it on Amazon I decided to order. I again was disappointed to discover the new 180 gram vinyl arrived warped!! It is playable however so I decided to keep it (not worth the hassle to return)
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day. It really works great on my Kindle Fire HD. Easy to use, has pre-sets and you can save your own adjustments. You can tweak the sound to your liking when using headphones, stand alone speaker or playing through the Kindle itself. Best free app in a long time.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I keep loosing my caps, so I needed this one for sure, I feel at ease keeping my lens protected.
B004X80QNG|4.0|The perfect way to keep all of your information in one place without having to carry a large organizer. This will allow me to keep track daily of what I need to do at work as well keep track of what needs to be done for the next day.
0761166173|5.0|This is a fun book.  Our daughter loved to sing the book with us, and we enjoyed how silly the book was (which made it much easier to sing).  It is still a go-to book for going to bed, because it's something fun to do before bedtime.<br /><br />There's not much more to say; it's certainly worth the small investment we paid for it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game. I am a big hidden object gamer and this does keep me occupied. Would recommend to friends.
1586638491|4.0|The No Fear Shakespeare are REALLY handy for inexperienced Shakespeare readers. Once you get more used to the language you don't have to read the translated side as much. And The Tempest was better than I thought it was going to be!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  As always, Robert Downey is great as Iron Man and the other Marvel characters are just as good.  Scarlet makes an excellent Black Widow, Chris Evans makes the transition from Johnny Storm to Captain America flawlessly, and Tom Hiddleston is perfect as Loki.
1439156816|4.0|I greatly enjoyed and benefited from the first edition of On Writing.  I found King's advice for creating characters to be very helpful and a good starting point for any creative writing I was doing.  The 10th anniversary edition has a number of changes, including the memoir portion.  As such, this book has two audiences, which may not be the same people: those who want to learn about writing, and those who want to learn about Stephen King.  I have enjoyed King's books in the past, and so I was in both camps.  However, others may not be; buyer beware.<br /><br />I bought this copy for a dear friend who wants to be a writer; she says that she has greatly enjoyed the writing advice, so that's two recommendations in one review.  Along with other writing guides (read Rex Stout's books, as well), this can be very helpful in beginning to write a good story.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl's story is one that anyone can relate to. It's encouraging to &#34;see&#34; someone overcome not only this mental challenge of regaining her life but also the physical challenge of hiking the trail.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter is true to form as a serial killer!!  Sad that the next season will be the final, but can't wait to see it.  Don't know what I am going to watch after it is gone.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|An excellent addition to the Oz universe.  The movie is visually appealing and the twist on the Oz story is entertaining.  It pays homage to the original Wizard of Oz while telling a story of it's own.
1451695195|4.0|I call this light reading, because the information flows so freely that I just finished the book in a day.  As a scientist, I enjoyed reading and understanding Dr. Alexander's logic in how he approached his experiences.  Throughout the book, he was candid about how he used to be and how he thought about near-death experiences.  The book is straight-forward and the writing is clear and enjoyable.  I will be keeping it on my shelf so that others can borrow it and learn about Dr. Alexander.
B00DTOZD4C|5.0|I enjoy reading historical fiction and Jonasson does a good job weaving a clever storyline with historical events. A new twist and adventure awaits readers in each chapter.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Easy reading. Chapters are short so you can start and stop easily. However the story flows so well that you will not want to put it down. Have read all his books and each one makes you think and discover things about yourself.
B008469DGY|3.0|It's a fun game and would have rated it much higher if it had more courses to play. If more courses were added Ill re-rate.
1569242739|5.0|We made some of these for my (vegan) daughters birthday and we ate them too and totally enjoyed. Then I snuck them in to a relatives as the dessert I was supposed to bring and they raved about them and never suspected anything different. . Delicious!!!
1250010403|5.0|I did not like finishing Best Kept Secret without any information about book # 4!!!!!<br />Iwould like to be given a date when book# 4 might be available.
0446571415|3.0|I am 3/4s of the way done with this book and to tell you the truth, I want to finish it because at this point it is the last book in the Camel Club series.  But I don't want to finish it because it is almost as bad as book 2.  This one is long and drawn out 200 pages could have been cut out.  The real person behind everything is so apparent as the book goes on that you just want it to end already.  It is a run on of similar situations throughout the book, and gets repetitive like I am right now LOL.  The New Head of CIS is an insecure version of Carter Gray.  It just infuriates me that I have to read this just to get to the end. I hope it gets better.  I will write a final review when I am finished.  Books 1 3 and 4 are great.  1 and 4 very quick reads and keeps you interested. 3 almost as good.  2 I would use as TP. 5 somewhere in between 3 and 2.  I am hoping that the next five books that I read are going to be better overall then these five books of Baldacci.<br /><br />I had finished the book and all that I can say I that it is not worth the read.  It is one Hell of a bad book to read.  Stay away.  The only critics (reading through kindle) that made any comments about the book were minor reviewers.  Never heard of reviewers. SAD.  The twists and turns of this book were so bad.  He had to make up for the 500+ pages the book is.  Soooooo he put in those twists and turns which were boring totally boredom of this book.  I could use it for TP
B00005T30L|4.0|I got a used copy of this and the cover was a little worn but it's not so bad. The dvd was not scratched at all so it works fine for me. :) I love this movie so I am happy.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|We tried to watch this movie, and I love Tom Hanks , but we gave up about an hour into it. I asked others their opinion and no one who saw it  seemed to enjoy the movie. Maybe it was just over our heads , but not impressed and never was able to watch the entire movie.
0316044695|5.0|The most heart wrenching account of what Our American soldiers especially SEALS do for our country and how the liberal media does to interfere and disrupt their missions. They are the true HEROES in our world not actors rock stars or sports stars!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Not as easy as you would think. You have to work to get to the next floor. Each one becomes harder
034580404X|4.0|Now would like to see the movie.  Story line needed more interaction.  Some of the covering was repetitious but still interesting.
160094048X|5.0|These cookies are as good or should I even say sometimes better than non vegan ones. Amazing book. Gotta go make some more....!!!
B001NY4X4G|5.0|Amazing perfomances in an unpredictable story.  Gere loves himself, but that's the point.  The story is one of ego over intellect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love  this game!It is absolutely AMAZING! I love despicable me the movie and this is a really really cool game! Must play!!!!!!!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Its a very good movie overall with the acting and cast. I like it also mainly because its different then your typical vampire movies
B0045EJY90|1.0|unfortunately, this recorder is extremely limited it what it can do, which is play back cds and record from a ipod, computer or storage device via USB  connection ONLY, in todays world there is a great need of a device which can multi task and be able to complete severe tasks needed, and this product does not.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is of the utmost quality as far as any fps need be concerned for the kindle fire. The controls take some getting used to but the action is all there the guns are fulfilling and the story is even somewhat compelling. I would compare this to that of a ps2 or Xbox fps easily and then probably better than a few. I think I paid $3.49 for this app. It has been well worth the price. With basically all the credits you need to upgrade with provided in game this is not a hook you in and make you pay type game like so many others. The graphics are smooth.<br />The only con is that loading times can be somewhat annoyingly long. Maybe 7-9 seconds. Not much of a problem for me, but worth mentioning.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I enjoy this show and have no problem streaming the episode's. The earlier shows seem to be written better and a little more humorous.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|I bought this CD, knowing most of the songs on it already. I didn't think I would like it as much as I do, but I really think it's underrated. The songs are all just so great and fun to sing along to.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|My daughter watched this a million times.  So cute and what a great message for young kids.  Wish they didn't wear such hoochie clothes though.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of fun and challenging!  I thought it was just another hidden object game, it keeps you with lots of challenges!
B00E8B1358|3.0|This movie was better the first time watched. The movie is a  good movie to use for falling asleep to if you have already seen it a few times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best thing ever ,food, great ideas ,great finds, holiday and party ideas, I say tell all your friends
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|Good acting by all, and an interesting location did not make up for the story, which was ridiculous and ultimately boring.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This movie streamed well and was a fun movie to watch. Sort of like Star gate before the Ori were added to the script.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|It plays ok but the controls are not the easiest to master. The only thing that I liked was the character and weapons.<br />Smotis
1603427244|4.0|While the information in this book is does not break new ground there is something of use for everyone especially new knitters.  For me it was worth getting to find the invisible cast on for round knitting.  Two versions!  - other material is very good for a refresher and to spur us to try other options for cast on/off instead of the tried and true.  worth having in your knitting arsenal.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|I love this cd. all of me is my favorite song on this cd. beautiful song open your eyes it reminds me of commons the light.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the holy bible it's changed my life from. I read one paragraph and loved it so I decided to change my life y&quot;all should totally purchase this Holy Bible
0465068367|5.0|The nature of the content made this a horrifying but necessary read. Iris Chang is to be praised for injecting emotion into this account. How can one write about such atrocities in a clinical manner? It was a painful read especially knowing that she had committed suicide not being able to escape from the haunting of this history that must not be forgotten and never repeated in China or anywhere else in the world.
B00881VLCE|4.0|beautiful puzzles but when kindle off have to start puzzle over. I sometimes almost complete. have to start over bummer otherwise I love it
B004X80QNG|5.0|Solid app for those who like to stay organized. Is it worth 10$? Not if you're in the newest version of andriod. Google calanders does nearly everything this does,but for free. Otherwise this is a great app and it comes with widgers and such for your home screen.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This old movie never goes out of fashion; when I watched the Goonies, it brought me back to my younger days in high school.  This is a movie that I could watch over and over and over and.............
0439813786|5.0|My daughter checked this book out over and over from the school library. (she's was 10) So for her birthday this year I bough it for her. It is a great book with a exciting story. The illustrations really pulls you in. She loves to read it to us and show us the photos.
B00CATSONE|5.0|You changed my life around I loved the book you did and amazing job keep up the good work I hope in the future you make more books if you do I would love to read them take care.
B008469DGY|4.0|What a great game. Even my three year old grandson loves playing this game. Simple and fun and I don't even play golf.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, a new twist to games like Angry Birds and its less than amazing clones out there. I did have an ad pop up once, I don't know if this happens very often, its only happened once to me and I'm not sure if it was just a fluke or if they actually have ads in a paid game. $3 is already a steep price. If they do have ads I'm shocked they'd expect to get good reviews.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Strap yourself into the cockpit and get ready for an adrenaline rush that still thrills after all these years.<br />Though action films may be splashier now, this one is tough to beat for all-round entertainment and<br />white-knuckle aerial combat scenes.  It will definitely give your home theater<br />system a workout!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I wish I had the funds in my budget to get the SB 600 However, it will do for now but a great entry level speed-light. Without a doubt better than the internal camera flash. Would recommend this for the DSLR beginner.
B006FE83U4|5.0|Slip back into yesteryear with this heart-warming tale of small-town life in the South during the 1930s.<br />Meet Atticus Finch, father to Scout and Jem, who goes against the tide when he decides to defend a<br />black man accused of raping a white woman.  A great character study that will make you realize they<br />don't make 'em like this anymore.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love it because unlike most hidden object games, the instructions are easy to find and follow. In fact, most of the G5 games have great instruction.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have never heard of Evanescence until I watched the<br />movie Dardevil. I loved the songs they did, and thought<br />the song, My Immortal was the best!
0345525558|5.0|When I received this book I wasn't so sure I would enjoy it simply because I had no idea what it was about. It is great, makes you think about a lot of things you might not want to think about. I love the way the flowers are used to send messages. It was simply a delight and I learned a lot.  I liked it so much, in fact,  I purchased another for a good &#34;flower&#34; friend.

140006922X|5.0|I could not put this book down-- Reza Aslan has succeeded in making history suspenseful. The scholarship is both impeccable and careful- he starts out clearly stating that the historical Jesus cannot be really known, that the best we can do is carefully examine the times, events, and places surrounding what only in retrospect became the extraordinary life of someone who, for all appearances at the time, was just one of a string of failed &#34;messiahs&#34; from a backwater hotbed called Galilee. This book, an attempt to address the identity of the historical Jesus in clear distinction from the Christ his followers subsequently shaped him into being, is a great jumping-off point for anyone interested in knowing Jesus the historical man, with extensive notes to guide further investigation. Warning: After reading this, you undoubtedly WILL want to keep learning. As with all useful knowledge, it opens more questions than it answers.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold Fry is a great character.  His challenges along the way touch the heart and soul. The reader feels every emotion from happiness to sadness to fear and courage.  An amazing book
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun quest like game and if you are patient, requires no money.  It has really cool graphics.
B000BW7I52|5.0|Totally charming story of romance in the air and on the sea. Mesmerizing characters, and everything beautifully presented. Zero flaws. And the airplanes are cool... enough technical tidbits to keep the airplane lover happy. This is the kind of stuff Disney SHOULD be producing rather than their formulaic crap. And Porco Rosso speaks for me when he says: A pig's gotta fly, kiddo.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love this movie so much and I have seen it probably 5 times and that is why I had to have this collection.  It is super and more then I ever thought it would be.  I highly recommend this product.
B000FC130E|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman. This book didn't disappoint. It a good story that is easy to follow. Entertaining and fun.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|I really enjoyed the story of this documentary.  The story and entertainment level would be 5 stars, however....<br /><br />To me, this gets 3 stars because when I watch a movie or tv, I want to sit back and not have to touch the remote.  Unfortunately, I had to keep my hand on the volume level the entire time and would have to adjust the volume at least every minute.  The sound on this was very uneven, with the music between voice overs blaring and some of the dialogue being almost inaudible if I don't want my eardrums blown out seconds later.<br /><br />Such an easy thing to fix and a very big thing to overlook, especially in regards to what the documentary is about, a recording studio.....AUDIO!!!  As an audio production student for sound on film, this made me cringe!  Had this doc not been in the nature of what I am studying, I would have turned this off.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works great for presentation on LCD, LED tv for office, wireless so i dont use more cables on my presentations
B008JFUO36|3.0|This film started out great and it looks great. If it only had a plot or gave some hint of why a big triangle rock in space would want to kill all the humans on planet Earth. Why would Morgan Freeman and a band of rebels dress up like the Predator? Because the space rock in the sky sent out droids to kill humans and Scavs. Why wear the sweaty helmet? The clone thing was odd. So, Jack and his copilot on the space mission let the passengers escape when they flew into the big space rock. They must have been the only ones ever to make it because the space rock cloned them. Then sent them out to find downed droids on planet Earth. This movie is pretty to look at but, it left me with a lot of questions. If one clone gets blown up am I really happy another clone comes back? Jack loses his copilot/dispatcher for droid repair but finds his wife from his Earth life. He moves on rather quickly. Then she returns the favor by going through the original Jack, one clone, and another clone at the end. Kinda crazy.

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|......and always has been, rather lackluster.<br /><br />I have, oddly, yet to meet anyone who read and liked the book.<br /><br />Friends and family of mine, have spoken about this movie in conjunction with the disappointment they felt after having to read it for English Class in H.S.<br /><br />Back in the day, for many of us stuck reading THE GREAT GATSBY by school requirement, we all wondered how F Scott Fitzgerald could  write a book with such a simple plot and one that contained no real moral to it, or at least some striking revelation about people/life, and still manage to win this very ordinary book much hype and acclaim.<br /><br />If he had written this book today, I think he would not have been published.<br /><br />There really is nothing outstanding about the story.<br /><br />In any case, for some reason, his book stood out to those who read it, and he got published.<br /><br />Eventually the book took off like wildfire.<br /><br />BACK TO THE MOVIE:  Dicaprio, who I do like a lot as an actor, is miscast here, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I kept waiting for him to comfortably slip into character, but something is amiss and I kept seeing Leonardo Dicaprio dressed up in  Roaring 20's attire and not some figure named Jay Gatsby.<br /><br /> His constant use of the phrasing,\\" Old Chap\\" is beyond annoying and seems unbelievable, coming from his mouth.<br /><br />Tobey Maguire ends up really being the best and most interesting character in the movie.<br /><br />I also feel he stole the movie from everyone as Nick Carraway- the one who narrates the story in the book.<br /><br />  The spotlight shines on the incredible wealth of the times and people depicted here, and it glows specifically on this particular place on the coast of the Long Island Sound.<br /><br />While given a bogus name in the story, Fitzgerald was referring in general, to the location of Nassau County's North Shore of Long Island- which is still deemed THE GOLD COAST even today, as it does have many breathtaking old mansions that still exist.<br /><br />The cinematography is fantastic and I felt it was worth renting it just to see how this movie was filmed.<br /><br />The music is current music- which throws the film off kilter a bit.<br /><br /> Why this artistic license was taken, I am unsure.<br /><br />You see the art deco decor and the timely fashions of the 20's, but throwing in modern music left me- and others- a bit puzzled.<br /><br /> But, I will say, that when you see the party scenes and hear today's music, the director definitely managed to pull it off.  This might have been done to appeal to the younger generation of viewers.<br /><br />I am sure some of the  older segment of viewers will think the director should have stayed with a truer approach to that  era's music.<br /><br />There are some minor additions to the story-mainly the beginning and ending, that were not in the book. However, they do not affect the integrity of the original story.<br /><br />All the actors did a great job with the role they were given, but Dicaprio just can't seem to pull off the role of a mature, mystery man of money.<br />It is not that he wasn't trying. I just don't think this role was meant for him.<br /><br />With now 3 versions of THE GREAT GATSBY on film( ALAN LADD- ROBERT REDFORD & NOW LEONARDO DICAPRIO), I don't think we will see another version anytime soon.<br /><br />I saw the coming attractions for this movie and I thought maybe, with a great all star cast and the very enticing visuals, it might- MIGHT- change my mind about the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, no.<br /><br /> Even awesome cinematography cannot save a basic story.<br /><br />This movies definitely pads it out with looks, but in the end you are still left with the book you read in High School.<br /><br />I will say, when it comes to the first opening scene of a party in progress, you are wonderfully bombarded by incredible imagery- and you DO soak it all in!<br /><br />VISUALLY GORGEOUS IS WHAT THE MOVIE IS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SAVES IT FROM BEING A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.Y GORGEOUS IS WHAT THE MOVIE IS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SAVES IT FROM BEING A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|If you or a loved one has been affected by addiction in your life, this is a must see film.  Denzel Washington was perfect as the failing, yet proud, addict who will just not stop drinking as his life gets stripped away from him. It was very entertaining, and I couldn't wait to see what happened next through to the very end. Supporting actors like Jonh Goodman and Don Cheadle added comic relief  to their scenes. It was a very inspirational film; I would recommend it definitely. It is a film that I would like my 16 year old son to see, as he faced with choices about drinking and addiction.
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|This book is a little anti climatic. Mostly a sorry about a German fighter pilot.  I recommend it to those that want to learn about the German Air Force.
B009O07NMA|5.0|One of the best CD's I've purchased over the past few years!  Great songs!  My wife and daughter love these tracks!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its fun to sit and play in your free time. it makes you use your brain.I recommend it to everyone
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|I couldn't wait to get this DVD as the actual movie only ran in my local theater for 2 weeks.  While Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors, and I would see ANY movie he starred in... this was a colossal disappointment.  While there were moments in the movie where true DiCaprio charm showed, the script and actual story just wasn't for him.  This was the first movie I saw with Tobey McGuire... and hopefully the last.  The guy just can't act.  His words were like he was just reading the script, no emotion, no facial expression.  Maybe that's what his character was supposed to be.  He just seemed so very out of place in this glitzy movie.  The final word I have is that the soundtrack could have been SO MUCH BETTER without the rap music!  I kind of expected old Hollywood, roaring 20's kind of music and the wrap was just way off base.  Most of the other non-rap songs were good and fit the scenes quite well, but I cannot get past all the unnecessary rap.  Sorry, this director was just off base and the movie could have been so much better.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|ALTHOUGH A BIT LENGTHY, STILL ENJOYABLE!!!<br />This is my second read from Sparks and I'm loo forward to starting another title.
B00CBT04LI|5.0|You can pop this movie in, watch it all the way through and instantly play the one with Kurt Russel and have a seamless experience. Only downside is they use CGI in place of old school effects.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It seemed the free version worked better! I had no problems with it until I downloaded the PAID version. The very first night I set up the paid version of the clock it did not work. Yet, it has worked since then!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|For fans of the genre I would suggest this movie. This movie seems to only piss off super die hard fans of the originals. I love the originals, however I am open to seeing more. So if you like the originals and would like to see more than go ahead and enjoy this movie.
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved how the book was like the actual thing. It was almost like I was actually in the scene with the characters
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book. The author did a really great job of continuing the story in a way that made sense without being predictable or some sappy tween remake. Great book, almost finished the next one in the series.

Kudos!<br /><br />I use the product to profile my two SAMSUNG monitors, my EPSON projector, and my EPSON 3880 printer, as well as create profiles for Canson/Hahnemuhle fine art papers.<br /><br />The product is very intuitive, the accompanying disk of instructional video is a good addition.  If you are new to color management, I suggest you read Eddie Tapp's page here:  [...]<br /><br />He also conducted a color class on Creative Live in December of 2012 - a decent watch for 39.00.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love it!! Great game!<br />So addicting! Can't ever stop playing!<br />I would certainly recommend this game to others!<br />At first I thought it wasn't going to be fun and I really just wanted to find something to do to keep me from being bored, but it actually is entertaining.

B001EJGQTU|5.0|This is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen. Don't expect an abundance of newsreel footage, although there are many photographs taken throughout McNamar's life. The film focuses on McNamara's face and body language. The interviewer is off-camera and his questions are tossed out as if at a news conference. This is a starling psychological portrait--partly candid, partly spin. It's hard to tell which is which.
159420411X|3.0|I was surprised and disappointed to find that so much of this book was derivative of subjects that have already been heavily covered.  I, for one, did not need yet another summary of 'Moneyball\\" or the efficient markets theory.  Certainly parts of it were interesting, and Silver does have some good points. But, it was too long, and some of the points were almost contradictory.  Net net: I'm glad I read it, but I can't highly recommend it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I like it. Very well done.<br />Exactly what I was looking for in this category.<br />Thank you for the work.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|The 5 star reviews can only be coming from people that watch mainstream daytime soap operas.  That's the mold this is in, pure drama, 1% something actually happening.  Nudity and cursing are the only differences to daytime soap operas.  Way way too much character personalization issues.  And why does the main agent character have to have mental issues ?  I guess because they know how boring the show is otherwise. Definitely could have been done much better.  **Update** 9/19/13-above review written after watching 2/3 of shows.  I have updated from 2 stars to 1 after watching the whole season.  Spoiler alert up next - you have to be kidding me that the 2 hour season finale was mainly about her mental issues and breakdown - who...cares!  And now it turns out both were converted to terrorists and now he'll be running for congress in the next season ?!  No thanks.  This show turned out to be more about personal life issues on all sides than a show about real Homeland Security issues and investigation.
0062255657|5.0|`The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is a beautiful and haunting short story which reminded me a lot of `A Wrinkle in Time'. Admittedly, I haven't read much of Mr. Gaiman's work, but when I do I am always impressed. A lonely little boy, who is not well-liked or understood by his own family, meets a little girl named Lettie Hempstock on the day a man commits suicide in his father's car. Lettie and her family are unusual to say the least, as well as quite powerful, and struck me as the Triple Goddess (Maiden, Mother, and Crone). The little boy is drawn into a fight against an ancient evil who escapes its' bonds, comforted by Lettie's promise to keep him safe. As he and Lettie try to combat the evil presence, it will take more than any of them imagined to come through their battles unscathed. `The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is not a children's fairy tale by any stretch of the imagination, but it will captivate you and make you think back on strange events in your own childhood which you may have long forgotten. Mr. Gaiman has a poetic way with words and the ability to draw readers in for an epic adventure. `The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is a book I will definitely treasure and take pleasure in reading many times over.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I love almost all the songs on this soundtrack and like that I can picture the scene the song is from when I listen to it. Great songs!

0345803485|5.0|I started reading this book and found myself not wanting to put it down. It started out kinda slow but in no time it got to the good stuff. The ending caught me off guard and I can't wait to get the second one in the mail so I can find out what happens next.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. Plays fine on my Note 2. A great time killer... Too good...! Only suggestion would be to offer a game with more 15 x 15 grids and fewer (or no) 5 x 5s. Thanks!

0544104404|5.0|In \\"How Children Succeed\\", Paul Tough takes a nuanced approach to evaluate different characteristics that influence short and long-term success in children.  Where some authors focus more on the question of intelligence and whether that characteristic can be improved, Tough looks at intelligence, parenting factors, personal characteristics, and teaching approach to understand how to close the achievement gap among children.<br /><br />As an example on parental  / personal history, the ACE Study showed the correlation of adverse childhood experiences and negative adult outcomes.  Other researchers evaluated the effect of those adverse childhood experiences in creating a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (chemical signals due to stress) reaction that impacts children.  The author examines intervention techniques that can help reduce the impact of that childhood trauma.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of research studies, practical applications of those studies, and anecdotal stories.  The evaluation on how character traits impact a child's ability to succeed in and past high school is a fascinating approach.  A great read for anyone interested in child development, educational techniques, or characteristics that can impact success for children and adults alike.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|Season six is a hilarious continuation of a series that I love. I always wait for the full season to go on sale, rather than watch each episode on television, this way I can power through them without stopping. It's impressive that Big Bang Theory has had a six year run and they're showing no signs of slowing down. If you're a fan of the show, you're going to love this season as much as seasons past.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I think my copy is worned because I have watched the movie too often.  Seems like I see more new things each time I watch the movie.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This BluRay DVD pack is great. The on disk special features are awesome as long as your player can handle them.<br /><br />As for the movie, this one goes on my list of favorites. It's got a great story, good character development and is very fun.
B004XN3FHA|1.0|Here is the direct quote from the Fenix web site Support page:    \\"2) Dealers will be responsible for customers. Customers should contact the dealers or distributors from whom they bought Fenix lights for warranty support with Fenixlight Limited's 'Warranty Card' and either a trade invoice or receipt. Fenix will provide our authorized dealers with the technology and parts to service our lights.\\"    Outdoor Gear doesn't do that, and seems to be in violation of the above Fenix dealer policy.    I submitted a return request via Amazon (with an explanation of the defect in a three-month old flashlight), who forwarded it to Outdoor Gear.    It took Outdoor Gear about 90 seconds to close / deny my request.  Apparently, they are happy to take your money, but not to fulfill their dealership role.    I notice that, as of today, Amazon is not sourcing this product through Outdoor Gear.  Good!  Buy from more reputable dealers -- maybe it will pay off in the end.    And make sure to ask the seller if they SUPPORT the product, as required, before you buy.    EDIT / UPDATE - 11/09/14: Just to be clear: it is a very good light. The problem I had was the batteries died.  Since I use the more expensive and powerful lithium batteries, and it was just a few months, I didn't think of this.     TIP: It turns out that, if you're going to store this flashlight for long periods, turn on the light and then unscrew the base a few turns until it goes out.  This completely disconnects the batteries.  I read elsewhere that this light draws a slight current while unused.  The irony? The current is a battery-monitoring function!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie showing how a child grieves for his father's premature death to a voilent act.  It also shows how even a really wonderful parent grieves and the relationship with a child during the healing process.  It highlights relationships of grandparents and strangers who can play an important role in the healing process.  A sad story that could help others understand their emotions during a similar loss.  We watched it twice the same day.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My 12 year old says this is awesome.  He likes the great 3D images of the dinosaurs and enjoys playing it.
0307460444|4.0|I bought this book because I absolutely love making cupcakes. And I love to see the decoration ideas and techniques. And I had never made a Martha Stewart recipe so it was awesome. I had read in other cake recipes that you should beat eggs and sugar over simmering water and never tried it but I couldn't resist making Tiramisu cupcakes. And I did. And I disobeyed about adding all the marsala-coffee syrup on the tops. But they were worth making. The frosting was so light and fresh!!!! And the pictures!!! I think you should also be an experimented baker to try some of the recipes because they need some skills and patience!
1451675046|5.0|I think Dawkins has done a great job with this book, it covers everything science related in a way that everyone can relate to, I don't know of any other book that has even attempted to do what he's done, I was going to just buy it and give it to some young cousins of mine, instead, I'm reading it for myself then handing it on when I'm done. I'm surprised to find that even at my age, with a broad understanding of science, I've still learnt things from this book that just never presented themselves at such a simplistic level, I seem to have skipped some of these fundamental points and moved straight on to the big questions, without ever really stopping and asking how and why we know it.
1475143389|5.0|Mike Matthews makes it very simple to understand what you need to do and how to make a plan to get healthy. Being almost 50 I never thought this was possible and followed many misguided plans (a latest trend follower was my mistake). I have been using Mike's Shredded Chef cookbook and Cardio sucks to already drop a whopping 43lbs! I have also increased my strength followign Mike's guidance so I know I am not just losing muscle. I am excited to take this to the next level with the exact weight lifting plan he advises as so far everything else has worked. I have learned to make bettter foods for myself and am loving the tastes of these healthier dishes, I fell younger, stronger and more motivated than I have in over 15 years! I am so glad I stumbled across Mike.<br />Some comment that portions of his book are repetitive of each other...well of course they are!<br />He is trying to tell you this is how it is, this is how it works so the core message should be the same and each book is focusing more in depth on particaulr parts of the plan (food, exercise, supplements, etc). If you follow someone who write vastly varying books on diet and exercise they msut not have a clue themselves and thye are guessing or they just want to sell books so they have to keep making up new material.<br />Mike - I love that you stick to your same message in every book. Not only does it show true focus om the one direction, but it helps to reinforce these simple facts in my mind each time I read them in a different book of yours and even though I may have read the same things multiple times, each time I find something in the information that did not stick in my head the first time I read it.<br /><br />So if you want to find the reight way to get healthy, then read Mike's books.<br />If you just want to be enterained with new material, then go follow some other clown who changes his mind about fitness with every book published.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie.  Fun and fast paced with some surprises at the end.  I was very disappointed the free trailer had a major spoiler in it !  If you want to see this movie DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER.  It will ruin one of the plots.

0071373586|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read on branding and marketing.  The information contained in it are timeless.  Glad to have dusted it off and read it again.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George I am DYING for the next book! Please please please get this series finished, it's incredible! I highly recommend the Game of Thrones series.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A great take on a perplexing condition that afflicts more people than is commonly recognized. Bipolar disorder can only be fully understood by those that have it. I believe it can happen to anyone at anytime in their lives. The chemical balance that keeps us sane is so delicate. For those not afflicted, this film provides some insight into those that are. To watch the characters come to meet and then help each deal with their issues was heartwarming and inspiring.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This was a fantastic read. I loved the character development, the story line, the existential crises and the flow. Anne Rice is an incredible author. I highly recommend this and the rest of her series.
B0051T47NQ|3.0|Excellent film if you read the subtitles.  The English dubbing is amateurish and nearly spoils an otherwise well written dialogue.  First rate creature effects.
B00AHJL7BK|2.0|The game has some strange way of keeping score that is not clear.  If score is what you care about,  you must use a separate app.  There is no way to keep progression results or any other kind of statistic without the added app.  It would be nice to know how many unique puzzles I have done, but after 10 they blend together and I don't feel sure there are new.  Good gameplay, zoom needs alot of work.  The board always jumps to put the selected tile a s low on the screen as possible, even when there are lower tiles.
B0073COMUW|5.0|This bulb is perfect for use in smaller rooms like a kitchen, or a hallway, etc. Doesn't put out light sideways, but that's no issue in a small room. Bright white light, with a tinge of bluishness, but  not too much. Looks a lot like natural daylight, and definitely as bright as a 60 watt incandescent, though it's not really a 'warm' light like traditional white incandescents.<br /><br />Not recommended for use in ceiling fans since it puts out light at about 180 degrees dispersal, as do almost all LED light bulbs currently available, so it would be too directional for use in a three or four bulb fan light fixture. But like I said, great for small rooms where only one bulb is needed in a ceiling fixture. For large rooms with one-bulb fixtures, wait for more omnidirectional-output LED bulbs to become available.

B000002UAX|5.0|As most of you know, since the unity of the band was declining, this turned out to be a 3 and 1/2 circuit solo album. Ringo temporarily left the Beatles in the middle of the sessions (Paul took his place on drums on \\"Back in the USSR\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\"). He explained the situation to both John and Paul, \\"You 3 seem so close and I feel out of it.\\" Since they too felt out of it, they replied \\"I thought it was you 3, Ringo!\\" Needless to say, Ringo came back and the 4 finished the White Album (though often, all 4 Beatles were still not present on each song).<br /><br />That said, I'll review each Beatles' efforts starting with John's (when I originally wrote this, it was John's birthday, approximately one month away from this review's revision). Many of his songs have to deal with the Beatles' trip to India. \\"Prudence\\" is about Mia Farrow's reclusive sister. \\"I'm So Tired\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" (John's most rocking track) deal with some of the difficulties John experienced there. I just learned from a DJ while recording \\"Yer Blues,\\" the Beatles were going a little overboard with the experiments with a sarcastic rebuke \\"Next thing, you'll want to record yourself singing in the closet!\\" And John thought that was a great idea! \\"Me and My Monkey\\" recollects much of the Maharishi's philosophy and \\"Sexy Sadie\\" deals with John's final disappointment, confronting him about... \\"If you're so cosmic, you'll understand!\\" John pokes fun at those who take the Beatles' myth too seriously on \\"Glass Onion\\", can't make up his mind for or against destruction on \\"Revolution 1\\" (different from the single with \\"shoobedoowhop\\" harmonies), questions violence in the tounge-in-cheek singalong \\"Bungalow Bill\\" (with a solo from Yoko, only one line, thankfully!), more wry humour on the folky \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" (with Paul cryptically closing the song singing \\"Take me back\\"), proclaims his love for Yoko on the 1950's style \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun.\\" If you can endure 8 minutes of sound effects on \\"Revolution9,\\" you're a true Beatles fan (though interesting, Yoko's audible suggestion at the end spooks me a bit!). Last but not least, John pays homage to his late mother on the beautiful \\"Julia.\\"<br /><br />Paul chooses a variety of musical styles: Beach Boy harmonies on \\"USSR\\" (with the sound of jets flying throughout the song), reggae on \\"Ob-La-Di...\\", classical on \\"Martha My Dear.\\" heavy metal influence on \\"Helter Skelter\\" (the take used lasted nearly 30 minutes, with Ringo screaming \\"I've got blisters on my fingers!\\" Note: this is a song about an amusement park slide as you can plainly hear in the intro), good old rock and roll on \\"Birthday,\\" honkeytonk on \\"...Do It in the Road,\\" and 1920's vaudeville on \\"Honey Pie,\\" with a great solo by John. Fortunately, \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" is under a minute. He uses folk style on \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" the tongue-in-cheek \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", \\"Blackbird\\" (lyrically, an ode to the Civil Rights movement, with bird chirping), \\"I Will\\" (Ringo's percussion sounds like a horse and carriage).<br /><br />George was improving as a writer here and it shows, even though he was only allowed 4 songs. He brings in Eric Clapton on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (allegedly about Paul's \\"Don't play it that way\\" attitude), satirizes the social class on \\"Piggies\\" (with strings and a harpsicord), jokingly warns Clapton not to eat too many sweets on \\"Savoy Truffle\\" (the saxes are a nice touch!) and seeks his Maker on the mystical \\"Long, Long, Long\\" (one note on the organ by Paul caused a bottle atop to vibrate at the coda and they liked it so much they added it in!).<br /><br />Ringo writes his 1st song- the country and western \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\" John's lush lullaby to Julian is given to Ringo to sing, closing the album peacefully, a nice relief after 8 minutes of chaos by the preceding track.<br /><br />That's a lot of music to review, but Paul's defense to those who complained about it was \\"Whaddya mean? It's great, it sold, it's the bloody Beatles' whitealbum- shut up!\\" Enough said.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Very good in keeping with the original show and adding something new from the movie. Nice spin on an old idea. They should consider more of the old series. There's a lot of good material they can use. Sense this is a new spin on the old show, they can use as much of the original episodes as they want just put a slight spin to make it somewhat orriginal.

B008JFUN6E|2.0|Enormous Flaws in Underlying Assumption - plot giveaway alert!  Do not read beyond this if you do not want to spoil your viewing of this movie.<br />For a billionaire's space-borne redoubt, the titular space station Elysium appears to have the level of security of your street corner 7-11 Store ! How is this even possible?  Not only is there no onboard anti-meteorite laser canons on Elysium, there appear to be also no on-board anti-intrusion air defence or anti-missile system.  The movie would have you believe that Billionaires would knowingly entrust their personal lives on a space station without any weapon systems whatsoever, their ONLY defence dependant on a half-crazed mercenary ''Mr Kruger'' who has to use shoulder-fired missiles to stop incoming landing crafts!  And to tolerate this in an world where ground-to-orbit spacecrafts can be operated by your smalltime streetgangs! How does Elysium prevent puncturing by incoming space debris or meteors? I am usually not a quibbler, but this is baaaaad. Appalling!!  The Director claims to be a sci-fi fan boy, but it is clear to me he does not read Arthur C Clarke or Isaac Asimov or even Greg Bear.

B00000J2SO|4.0|If you are not familiar with this group, Rainbow was the British hard rock band created by Ritchie Blackmore, former guitarist and founding member of Deep Purple. Just as with Deep Purple, Rainbow also had its' share of personnel changes over the years. The line up for this, their 5th release, was Ritchie Blackmore(guitars), Cozy Powell(drums), Roger Glover(Bass), Don Airey(Keyboards), and Graham Bonnet(vocals). Roger Glover also produced this 1979 release.<br /> Although the packaging suggests that this CD release is a remaster, there are no bonus tracks and no liner notes to speak of, just production credits and thank you notes. The single page booklet does have some photos of the band members on the inside. There are a total of 8 tracks on this CD most of them running between 3 & 1/2 and 5 minutes in length except for track number 2, \\"Eyes Of The World\\", which clocks in at over 6 & 1/2 minutes long. Two of the 8 track stand up to repeated listenings, \\"All Night Long\\", which is the opening track, and the Russ Ballard penned \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", which is track 5. The other tracks on this album are several levels better than \\"filler\\", just not as good as these two.<br /> If you like the music of Deep Purple or Whitesnake, then you will probably also like the music of Rainbow and this CD. After all, 2 of the 5 members (of this version) of Rainbow were former members of Deep Purple.
0739341243|4.0|Quiet definitely captures the life of an introvert in the extroverted world we live in. For those who have never learned about the difference it will be irreplaceable. For those who already have some knowledge, its still worth the read, but will repeat many things you already know. Quiet can sometimes place introverts in too much of a box, and not explore the different types of introverts. Overall however, this book is a great read for introverts and extroverts who want to be understand why introverts do the things they do and why.

0061150142|5.0|For a college term paper I once wrote about the causes of teenage suicide.  At the time, I thought it would be an interesting topic; but what started as an energizing quest for knowledge turned out to be a gut-wrenching project that often had me in tears.  At no point during my research or writing, however, did I regret choosing this subject matter, because as upsetting as it was, it was too compelling to let go.  While fictional, The Pact had the same effect on me.<br /><br />Like many real-life suicide victims, Emily Gold, seemed to have everything to live for.  That's what makes these cases so difficult to see on the surface or to grasp even if someone should care to look beneath the images we chose to see.  I did not understand Emily; however, I did feel her pain.  I wouldn't have been able to justify her actions, or that of her boyfriend Chris, but that didn't make their torment or predicament any less real.<br /><br />Unlike a real suicide, however, this one was exciting to read about.  The revelation of how the events really played out that night was enough to keep turning the pages, and while suicide usually leaves more unanswered questions than conclusions, the ending of this book managed to offer a sweet remembrance.

1490313370|4.0|This book has a very good message but I feel that it could have been written in less than 274 pages.<br /><br />The message is that corporate America sucks and you better get your act together real soon before you become a victim.  We have been hearing this for quite some time now; some have even felt it personally. Altucher is very convincing with this message and how he chose himself in life and in business.<br /><br />It does take a while getting used to this message since the writing style is very much in your face like it is in his successful blogs that he writes giving similar advice.  If you can get past this style he does have a very compelling message backed up by his own example and others famou and not so famous ones.<br /><br />This book will get you to think if you approach it with an open mind and get used to Altucher's style of writing and repetition.  I think he keeps repeating this theme since he wants us to internalize the need today to choose yourself.  My only criticism of this book is that it is little too long and could have been cut down to 200 pages.<br /><br />If you need a little kick in a butt (which we all do occasionally) to get going then certainly read this book.  It is a fast read and you may come away with a tip or two that may change your life.  For that it is worth the investment.

B0045HCJ9E|5.0|North By Northwest 5★<br /><br />*some spoilers*<br /><br />I watched this on Turner Classic's television channel (TCM). All their movies aired yesterday (Sunday) was all Hitchcock. And then Robert Osborne would comment about each movie before and after it's shown on their show. Like the interesting fact that Hitchcock was working on films since the 1920's. I didn't know that. He's also helped changed suspense movies from all being a B-movie to a Must-See movie. That seems about right.<br /><br />I've seen only snip-its of this movie before watching it straight through. Like the famous scenes of the crop-duster airplane trying to kill Grant, as well as the very popular scene on the Mount Rushmore Monument. Seeing this entirely, I found it to be a really good spy suspense movie. The acting was really well done. And there was a lot of plot twists. So I felt - like Thornhill (Cary Grant), that there wasn't that many people to trust. There was of course some scenes where I wanted to throttle Grant - like taking a knife out of a dead guy's back at the U.N. building with loads of witnesses to see him do that. I would definitely call him a murderer before learning of his innocence because that's just plain stupid to take the knife. There was some new scenes that I really liked. The scene where Grant drives drunk down Long Island (which I learned was actually by the Californian coast and in Griffith Park - according to Wikipedia). The camera lense being obscured just so to make two things: 1) a night time illusion, and 2) a perspective look at what Thornhill saw while driving intoxicated. And the ending! This suspense building and then bam! Grant and Eva are on the train. That was nice to see their happy ending, but I think it could've been a better transfer between the two scenes.<br /><br />So after the movie was over on Turner Classic channel, Robert Osborne began telling some fun facts about the movie. The first fun fact was that Hitchcock was at first thinking of having Jimmy Stewart play Roger Thornhill. But then changed his mind and chose Cary Grant. Grant then tried to persuade Hitchcock to cast Sophia Loren as Eve Kendall. But Hitchcock chose Eva Marie Saint instead because he wanted a blond.ing Jimmy Stewart play Roger Thornhill.

B008JFUPPI|2.0|When I saw the trailer of this movie in the theatre, I thought it was humorous. How wrong I was!<br /><br />It was boring...boring...and boring.<br /><br />I thought it's an action comedy film and it failed on both aspects.<br /><br />The idea of a dead cop coming back to life and hunting devils was new to me. I liked it. However, there were very few funny jokes to make it interesting. The scene where Ryan Reynolds found out what he looked like as an undead cop was hilarious. Jeff Bridges delivered a couple of funny scenes too. Ryan could not make the movie funny or exciting.<br /><br />In terms of action, nothing was special. The actions scenes looked more humorous than serious. I accepted that because it was an action comedy. The problem was the action scenes looked comical. All the demons looked like cartoon creatures. They looked fake and funny rather than realistic and scary.<br />The first 60 minutes were boring with three or four short-lived funny jokes and bad action scenes. Then things got more action packed till the end. However, they looked comical as I said above.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below were the financial figures of this picture:<br /><br />Release Date: July 19, 2013<br />Production Budget: $130 million<br />Domestic:  $33,283,000<br />+ Foreign:  $33,300,000<br />= Worldwide:  $66,583,000<br /><br />So, it's a big flop worldwide. It lost about 53 million dollars. That's a gigantic amount.<br />In short, it's not worth it.

0545128285|4.0|This book is a compilation of \\"nursery rhymes\\" for the wizard family children.  Just like our nursery rhymes, they tend to be changed from generation to generation to fit the family traditions or beliefs.  It consisted of five tales- each consisting of a commentary at the end, by none other than the infamous Albus Dumbledorf.  Furthermore, there is a book created by Pottermore ( a website) within the footnotes of the commentary called:  \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them,\\" that can be purchased for the kindle.<br /><br />Each tale illustrated a connection of how the magic was used within the Harry Potter series, and the most common thread is that death cannot be conquered through the use of magic.  In other words, you simply cannot bring back the dead through the use of magic without undesirable effects to yourself- self torment or the cause of driving yourself to suicide.  But when love gets in the way, our judgement tends to be clouded.  This was illustrated most in the Tale of the Warlock's Hairy Heart, and my most favorite- The Tale of the Three Brothers.<br /><br />The Tale of the Three Brothers consisted of \\"Death,\\" three brothers and their magic, as well as their dilemma in getting across a large ravine.  So through the use of magic, they created a bridge, and each of them were gifted with one thing from \\"Death.\\"  The first brother chose the Elder wand.  The second brother chose the Stone of Resurrection, and the third and wisest brother chose the Cloak of Invisibility.  See how they use their gifts, and see how all three of those gifts together, in the right hands can be powerful- that is if you don't already know by having watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows II, or Reading that book.  In fact, this was a story that Dumbledorf had the pleasure of sharing with Harry Potter- knowing that Potter had a challenge ahead of him in the battle against Voldemort.<br /><br />So if you are looking for something to pass the time away, and want something else to add to your Harry Potter collection, this book is a fast read.  It wasn't my best choice, but nonetheless it was good and explained in further detail some of the tales told within the Harry Potter series, therefore giving me a broader perspective of what the tales really meant to the wizarding world.se to add to your Harry Potter collection, this book is a fast read.

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|This app has a set of very bad (invasive) permissions and the service in general has a disregard for privacy. On the one hand, they advertise Evernote as a way to &#34;Remember everything.&#34; And the question has been asked repeatedly: &#34;Everything? Really?&#34; Look through the user forums and you will see that whenever that question is asked, a very vocal group of &#34;evangelists&#34; rise up and bat down privacy concerns as &#34;paranoid&#34; and &#34;unfounded&#34;. Often, after that a few of them begin moaning about how badly the &#34;evangelists&#34; are treated.<br /><br />If you were to store sensitive information in Evernote (such as credit card receipts, tax returns, medical data including prescription medications, et cetera), you might as well just scan it and post the data on the internet for all to see.<br /><br />Further, by installing this app, you give Evernote permission to access your contacts (why would they need that?), to access and modify any of your data, and generally carte blanche access to your phone or tablet. There is no earthly reason that they need that level of access.<br /><br />Evernote management has dismissed any privacy concerns, stating that they are not a priority, and their rabid userbase can and will attack you for daring to question this choice. The company is more interested in serving ads than serving their users. I even saw a post on their forum once from an &#34;experienced&#34; user who asked &#34;Where did the ads go in the latest version? I miss them.&#34; I have never seen such a bizarre statement. It's like Stockholm Syndrome.<br /><br />I highly recommend avoiding this app like the plague.

Unfortunately, as this book illustrates, they are misused at times by our leaders.<br />The prose is poorly written and allows for as much independent thinking as a Fox News diatribe.<br />If there was one thing this book did for me was it made me extremely thankful that I am no longer a part of a group fearful of ever questioning the actions of our leaders. Adam Brown was a great patriot and he paid the ultimate sacrifice fighting for good. Unfortunately ten years from now I doubt Afghanistan will be much different than it is today.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If you're missing \\"smart\\" features on your TV with an HDMI input, the chromecast is an option that I recommend for the price. When a controlling device, such as a smartphone or tablet, is connected to the same network, each supported app will have an additional option to \\"cast\\" the content. When a content is selected, the chromecast will request and receive the stream from the associated server and play the file. The downside to this is that local content playback is not supported at this time (unless you play a movie file on Google Chrome and cast the tab to Chromecast).<br /><br />Currently, the only \\"apps\\" supported are Netflix, Youtube, Chrome Tab Casting, & Google Play/Music.<br />The apps for Netflix, Youtube, & Google Play acts a controller & content lookup/queue management agent which is convenient considering only 1 \\"remote\\" is needed.<br /><br />As for the Chrome Tab Casting extension on Google Chrome, you are able to screenshare what you're viewing on your PC (connected within the same network). The quality is dependent on the strength of your wi-fi signal but there are workarounds if the buffering is severe, such as lowering the quality of the packets that are sent from PC to Chromecast.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good purchase at $35 based on the current apps that support the device. For my purposes, it accomplishes 80% of what a smartphone-based streaming ecosystem should be, but others may be disappointed in the lack of app support. I was able to purchase 3 units for TVs both with and without \\"smart apps\\" capabilities so that I could somewhat unify the systems within the house (since you can control which content can be viewed on certain TVs).<br /><br />With proper support from Google, I believe this will be a great investment for the future to somewhat resolve the \\"fragmentation\\" issues of Android OS & Electronic Manufacturers.

B001DF68MA|4.0|My sister bought this first and uses it with her HUGE toddler - he's 99th percentile. She likes having him up front so they can talk while they cruise around the neighborhood. My husband saw a photo of her biking with her son and immediately wanted to buy one to use with our little girl, who is NOT huge. She's a teeny thing. So right there, it works for toddlers at both ends of the size spectrum. My husband likes being able to see our daughter while they ride and also likes that he can hear her exclaim over things better. And she does this because she can see more instead of riding at the back of the bike. The only downside is that you have to ride with your knees splayed out a bit - so this is probably not for massive bike rides but more for touring closer to home. This is our go-to if our daughter is having an unending tantrum...instant mood changer.

This will pretty much have every single movie that Arnold has appeared and it will sell for a low, low, low price of $9,999 dollars! I will buy two of em since I need one for myself and for my dad when I put him in a retirement home after he starts to poop in his pants and the Arnold Collection will be the only thing he needs to live out the remaining years of his life happily ever after.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|My little brother got this for Xmas and he couldn't be happier! I watched most of this with him and loved every minute!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the story but wasn't happy with the ending. Maybe a part 2? Just kind of ended and I expected more.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I didn't want to put it down, there was nothing bad about it.It was awesome.I gave this a five star rating because I like mythological books.
1423113497|2.0|The books came quickly but they were supposed to be &#34;new&#34;.  They were definitely not new. There was no cover and the pages were already dog eared. But we have them now I guess.  :(
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Gave me a feel for life in another culture.  Actually made me feel blowing sand in my teeth, kept me thirsty.
034580404X|2.0|This book was written with no other point than to titillate.  And it doesn't even accomplish THAT well.<br />A total waste of money
B00CFA227C|5.0|Hello,  This is a very good family movie.  The story is excellent and the acting is wonderful.  I wish Hollywood would make more of these.  Just my opinion.  Thanks.
0345525558|5.0|Its an amazing  story.  Once you start reading it is very difficult to put the book down.  I loved how the characters came to life.  I felt like I was sitting on the sideline watching as the story evolved. Our book-clubs favorite book so far this year.
B00CSV7AOI|5.0|One of the best albums of the year by far. If you're a fan of the Fleet Foxes you'll be a fan of these guys.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|Similar to jewels  but uses a more creative idea to add a new twist to a older game concept. Holds my interest using increasingly challenging puzzles.  Great for all ages.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Generally, I'm not a scifi fan, although this was an exception.  The plot kept you wondering, which kept had me very involved.  Also, the video and audio quality is top notch which enhances the enjoyment of this movie.  Both Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman were very good but IMO, it's wasn't their best work but the movie was still excellent on all levels.  You don't have to be a scifi fan to enjoy this movie because of the storyline.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Like love it so much it's fun to play I play it 8 times a day after I get from school
B00CL0J99K|1.0|as with all the superhero blu-rays, the special features are great, too bad this movie makes me want to swim in a shark tank with a meat suit. worst movie of 2013.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This game is so perfect awesome fun and more I love the beats like boom snap boom<br />Clap I love beats slot
1423136802|5.0|Thank you I really appreciate it. Hope to buy more books if more do come out. It was also well packed
B009AY04A8|4.0|Actually enjoyed both the game and adventure!  Having reached retirement age, some times I just feel like relaxing and killing a few hours rather than worrying about what needs attention on the farm.  This game exercises your brain by making you think.<br /><br />hlo
B00CH87HF4|5.0|totally worth it<br /><br />id pay a few dollars for this hands down<br /><br />thank you gameloft<br /><br />get this,  why dose it say I need more words still.........
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Since my type of games are mahjong, solitaire, and jewels, this one is not for me.  I do not like timed games at all, too much pressure.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I agree with most of the reviewers about the characters and plot.  I had never heard about the novels, so I didn't have a character in mind when I saw it.  It played well, even if I had known about the novel's Jack.  However, what really annoyed me was the use of an M-14 as the sniper's weapon.  There are a lot of rifles out there that could have been used.  The M-14 was a slightly smaller and more efficient M-1.  It could be lethal at 500 yards; at that range I got 6 out of 10 body \\"hits.\\"  Not great, but adequate. It was not a sniper's weapon.  The older M-1 was heavier, and more stable, and it used the larger 30 caliber round. It was the weapon of choice for snipers, and could be far more accurate, especially when a scope was used.  Nobody was trained as a sniper with the M-14.
B00CBFPO12|4.0|I thought that The Land of Stories: The Enchantress Returns, was an excellent book. I REALLY enjoy it. However, I enjoyed the first book a LITTLE BIT more. I thought part of the appeal from the last book was lost in this book. However, Chris Colfer delivered, as always.
B004MPR80E|5.0|Great book for anyone with an interest in cancer. Really well researched and it makes what could be a very scientific subject interesting by dealing with the social and personal aspects of the fight against cancer
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game.  Better than Candy Crush.  Please make more.  Highly recommend for adults and kids.  Non violent too! Great fun.
B004LDLI0S|2.0|This is a tough read. I understand it was dictated by Adolf Hitler and later edited but the opening chapters still come across as a rant. It lightens up a bit as it moves on but it is still difficult to understand how someone with such narrow and badly thought ideas could have enthralled a cultured and progressive people.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is close to an exact replica of Minecraft!!! Defiantly buy its worth EVERY penny!!! I LUV IT!!! SHOULD BUY!!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|A new gadget which we probably thought and hoped too much of. Let's see what happens with it in the near future.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|It was not as real as I thought it would be and they used the F word so much that I thought it took away from the story. I realize that most people use this word to express themselves, but BiPolar is a very real disorder and I would have liked or my 13 old to see it, since his dad has BiPolar, but that will not happen. I was expecting a little more reality of the consequences and pain but there had to be a story as well. i did like the ending.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a really cool and fun game for kids that everyone will love and enjoy. I'm a horse person and love it a lot .
B0089BSM70|5.0|loved the movie...Halloween II is one of my fav movies from the series...that said the Halloween series has suffered from horrible remakes & sequels...one more thing John Carpentar is a much better director than Rob Zombie...I have yet to see a Rob Zombie movie that I actually liked and can remember while I have seen most of John Carpentars movies and have enjoyed them all...If there ever is another Halloween remake/reboot than John Carpentar is only one who can do it properly...ok...I'm done ranting and I think my review has exceeded the 20 word requirement...Awesome!!!
B001AMWTAG|5.0|This is a fun album, lots of very hard riffs and drums laced with a kind of rockabilly vibe; the result is it feels like there are different styles, some experimentation and definitely originality, but still there isn't a weak spot on here.  If you came here wondering if this is as good as Guitar Gangsters & Cadillac Blood, my answer is yes...it may sound a bit different but you won't be disappointed.
0399159347|4.0|The Husband's Secret is a book about three women whose lives are knitted together by secrets and hot cross buns in suburban Australia. The story starts out with a bang, with one woman accidently finding a secret note from her husband:<br /><br />\\"For my wife, [insert your name]<br />To be opened only in the event of my death\\"<br /><br />(For the record, if I found a note like that, we wouldn't have to write a book about it, I'd open it right away!)<br /><br />As Cecilia decides whether or not to read this letter while her husband is away on business, we meet two other characters: Tess, who's husband admits he's in love with her cousin and best friend, and Rachael who still suffers a deep depression 20+ years after the death of one of her children. We get to know their friends and family and how they know each other, and as the story unfolds, Moriarty gives us romance, mystery, and suspense.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, could not stop until I had read it all in one afternoon. The way the characters lives intertwined was fascinating and I could so relate to Rachel, Janie`s mom.I  am going to recommend  this book to all my friends!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this game for my toddler and she loves it!  It's easy to use and there are many things that she can do to/with their hair.  I've even had fun playing around with it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app. Works great.we have app on all three of our kindled. gives you a good idea how much time you have left to work play.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|product came quickly I use it on every golf hole seems accurate and my game has improved shot a 69 my best score ever and I am 71
B007JRTSVE|5.0|I love it this film, and my grandchildren love it also!!! Has a great message about being different.  It's really a great watch for the entire family.
0446699616|3.0|The Sand Pit<br /><br /> The Panther is my fourth Nelson DeMille book and my third in the John Corey series. The story centers on Corey and wife, Kate, both special agents in the New York FBI office, being posted to Yemen, the sandpit of the Middle East. They were sent, ostensibly, to terminate the al Qaeda jihadist, al-Darwish, aka, The Panther, who masterminded the attack on the USS Cole in Aden harbor.<br /> The story is drawn out and lacks intrigue and excitement until the very end. By cutting some of John Corey's over abundance of smart alec wise cracks that early on became repetitious and annoying, the story could easily have been tightened and cut by 25 percent. I got the feeling DeMille was intentionally stretching it out.<br /> On the plus side, it was obvious DeMille had performed extensive research of the area and the mission. I found interesting the inclusion of Predator drones equipped with cameras and Hellfire missiles.<br /> The Panther doesn't come close to DeMille's Night Fall or The Lion's Game. A rating of 3 is the best I can give to The Panther.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|savana has always loved the wizard of oz.. we have watched it many times with her..we have bought her toys and special movies of it for her... she really liked the little china doll , in this movie.. if you have a child , who loves the wizard of oz.. they will like this movie...
B000LXQVA4|5.0|this product is rated very well, and I love the brightness and the design I think it will keep  him busy for awhile.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I've had this for a few months and it was perfect until there was an update. After that, the program I have protecting my Kindle Fire HD, has said more than once that it now contains adware. This hasn't just happened on my Kindle and I trust the program I have. So Buyer Beware!<br /><br />I'm still using this clock, but I have no idea if it's giving out personal info or what. I wish the programmers would update and fix this problem, or at least explain. But I wanted to at least warn ppl about this.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|with the really great actors in this it makes it a lot of fun.  Nice twist at the end too.  I think I want to grow up to be Helen Mirren.  It is a believable story line, and you find out what happened to all of those super agents after they retire...now you'll know.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|My mom and I watched this movie this afternoon. It was ok. My friend recommended thus and she said this was good. I would not recommend this at all.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|While this cd delivers what it says #one hits it is hard not to feel disappointed some other songs weren't included. It wouldn't be what the title implies though. Michael has so many good songs that never made it to # one.  So this is definately an artist that you may want to have additional cd's of. This one is definately a good place to start for a musician that I feel was never appreciated enough for the talent he had. One of the all time greats. If your looking to add Mr. Jackson to your collection then this is a great cd to start out with.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It made me laugh and cry.  It also really got me thinking how hard things must have been, not so very long ago.<br />Some of my favorite movies: Pretty Woman, Steel Magnolias, Spirit... all do the same, make you cry and laugh as well.<br />It is a great movie, and very well done.  I bought the book as well and really enjoyed it.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I nearly forgot how many great songs Phil has. The only thing someone could really want is maybe for some later hits to be included. It is a Phil Collins cd however and not a Genesis one. I feel this is a good value and nice for lonesome commutes to and from work.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|`Beautiful gentle music - reminds very much of maori singers from New Zealand. It really relaxes me and puts me in holiday mode.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This cd set is excellent. It has so many hits spanning so many years. If you like Elton buy this set it will not disappoint.  Earlier songs like Crocadile Rock through more recent hits like Circle of Life. This cd set is great, great, great! Did I mention it was great?
B005NFJAT4|4.0|Low budget, but an all around good movie about the battle.  I enjoy the showcases of certain key characters, and the perspective from both sides
B000002L68|4.0|I purchased this cd because I had the cassette when it came out in the 80's. The price was good and it has some really good songs like When Doves Cry, Purple Rain, and Let's Go Crazy. There are also some others decent lesser known songs like Baby I'm a Star and so on. Overall an excellent cd. Its not a greatest hits cd but that's not what your paying for either. Hard to go wrong for about $4.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|The first 2/3 of the book was kind of draggy and predictable. Too much time was spent on extreme descriptive words and not enough on the story line. I found myself skimming through all the descriptive words looking for more story. Then, in the last 1/3, the book takes off and goes in many unpredictable directions, all finally intertwining. I would recommend this book to friends, but warn them to stay patient during the first 2/3.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I absolutely love to watch this show ~ it has twists & turns just like most soap operas do, but are tastefully done with English humor & drama. Can't wait for season #4!! I will be watching seasons 1-3 again while I wait!!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have been using the Kindle app on my Velocity Cruz tablet for a few years now without issue. I absolutely loved the portability of the app and how it would sync to my other devices seamlessly. Last week however, I began to experience an issue with the app. All my books were facing horizontally, despite the orientation that I was holding the tablet at. The kindle home screen would auto-rotate with orientation, but not once a book was opened. This made it very difficult because I use my kindle most when I am breastfeeding and only have one hand to hold and read my books. After several failed attempts at restarting the tablet, I chose to uninstall with the intent of reinstalling the app. However, when I went to reinstall the app, Amazon informed me that it was no longer compatible with my device. If I had known that I wouldn't be able to reinstall, I would have left the app alone and continued using it horizontally. I was very disapointed that a previously supported device is no longer supported.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book shows us the true humility it takes when a system fails. It is about accepting your mistakes, asking for forgiveness, and being ale to trust others/ yourself.<br /><br />This is a heart wrenching story that leads the reader through Victoria's life at age 10, at her emancipated age, her homelessness, her calling to flowers, her first love, her first child, and her first steps towards a true family. This gives a great reminder that we do not need to run but take one step at a time. Also that we need to let others into our lives even as hard as that maybe - when everyone for our past has failed us.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
0316077046|3.0|Welcome back to Gatlin ! Beautiful Darkness is the second book in Castor Chronicles. As much as I loved this series for being unique and original, a refreshing change from your usual Vamprie / Werewolf delima,  I do feel that book two was a bit of a let down compared to book one. It sufferd from what I like to call Book-Two-Itis<br /><br />In a Nut Shell<br /><br />In Beautiful Darkness we return to Gatlin, which to me is one of my favorite bookish towns. I wish so bad that I could visit to see and meet the awesome quirky people that call Gatlin home! We start with Macons funeral and Lena is just not handleing things well. Having never recovered from everything that went down at the end of book one, she pushes Ethan away. She starts hanging around with mysterious bad boy John Breed and Ridley, and pulls further and furter way from Ethan. Olivia \\"Liv\\" is a newbie in town, working as a keeper in training. Liv, Ethan and Link go on the hunt to find Lena, to keep her from going dark before the 17th moon. To top it all off, Ethan is still getting visions and flash backs, and all along getting maybe a little to close for comfort to Liv.<br /><br />It's hard for me to tell you how I feel about this book without giving too much of it away.<br />I really enjoyed Ethan Liv and Link's search for Lena in the Castor tunnels. I love novels that have tunnels or labyrinths ( sorry no explination, just love it ). Maybe its the fact that you never know where a tunnel will take you, either way I think these Castor tunnels made this book very exciting. I have always had an issue with Lena, even in my review for Beautiful Creatures I thought she was always pushing Ethan away. Ethan is a great guy, he might actually be the best bookish boyfriend! He is always so persistant on his relationship with Lena, even thought they can't have a physical one. Lena is always so sad and alway finding a reason to not be happy about being with him.That really is the main reason I can't give this book 5 stars, I just don't like Lena as a character. Anyways So many other great charcters that I can't wait to see what is in store for them, especially with the new school year comming up, and the not so human students attending it. I will for sure continue to read this series. I give it 3 1/2 stars .stars, I just don't like Lena as a character. Anyways So many other great charcters that I can't wait to see what is in store for them, especially with the new school year comming up, and the not so human students attending it.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|was not expecting this movie to be what it was at all.  wont do any spoilers here but its definitely a strange little sci fi flick, worth watching.
B00AO686MY|5.0|A classic movie in a beautiful hi-def format! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body...
B0034G4P80|4.0|this is a fun movie but don't expect a complicated plotline in this movie. it's pretty much your typical super hero movie in those terms but it a lot of fun to watch.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Great product!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Normally I hate it when movie series bring in a new character to focus on, but in this case it works. I like how the timeline of this movie is interwoven with the previous 3 movies, and yet it doesn't overlap so much that it's annoying. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz do a great job and this is a fast paced action packed movie. I really enoyed it a lot.
B00CHMBQ0C|5.0|Story sounds a bit cliche, movie is actually anything but.  Tense and suspenseful, it was a pleasant surprise.  Aaron Eckhart has shown time and time again that hes a truly worthy leading man.  I hope at some point hell finally gain the respect and stature he deserves.  This guy truly deserves to be a leading man a lot more than he gets to thus far.
140006922X|3.0|This book will be troubling for people of faith.  The author presents a specific set of facts and determines that they are the truth of Jesus.  There is no Jesus without faith.  Without faith it is just historian's facts.  Some of those facts are just as ancient as the writers of the gospels.  It then becomes who you chose to believe.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Great music!!!!  Have this cd on repeat!!!  A must have!!  This is my first JT cd and I'm glad I made the purchase
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game! Fun for the family. If you always wanted to learn how to play this is the game for you.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Luv this game I could sit and play it for hours. Can't wait  to try out Lep's world 2 . Controls are good n not to hard
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie is a classic!  From the old couple to the young boy as well as Doug, the dog, it warms your heart and proves that families come in all varieties!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Very heavy, angry, thrash metal. pretty awesome. Not for kids, songs vastly about killing.  Definitely gave me a new perspective on thrash.
B005M0X078|5.0|This was without a doubt the best Phantom of the Opera on the market.  Ramin Karimloo nailed it!  The quality is fantastic and the 5 phantoms at the end was extraordinary!!!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|If you're looking for a great little filler game, look no farther than Love Letter. It's easy to learn, plays fast, and stays fun over many plays. I've had success with family, friends, and gamers alike.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Sorry to say, i enjoy more light hearted readings. This book was a mans journey not of faith or hope, but to remember his past and all the memories of how his mother left him at 13, how his father was an alcoholic who didn't like him, how he fell in love with his wife and how after having a child of his own he didn't show his love. These were his mistakes and how he tried not to be noticed and in so doing didn't leave much of an imprint on anyone. This was his last ditch effort to show how he cared for a woman named Qeenie Hennesy who was his friend. Harold thought he could help Queenie live by traveling 500 miles to the hospice she was being cared for. This was a book of self reflections. It was very sad. Could only give it 3 stars.
B002KREVCO|5.0|I always love hearing songs from my favorite band that I have never heard before! A good tribute to a great band, one for the ages!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its one of the best games I have but the only thing about I is it doesn't give instructions on how to play the game.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|What can anyone say knowing this is almost the last Harry Potter film there will be.  The whole series was terrific.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have been using this mouse for a week now and I have to admit I really like it. At first it was a little awkward, switching from a different mouse and getting used to the new mouse takes a little time.<br /><br />- The overall feel of the mouse is great, my hand rests comfortably. The scroll wheel is somewhat firm, delivering the satisfying scrolls, it is not to rough and not too soft. It gives out very distinguished, but soft scrolls as you turn the wheel forward or backwards. It also has a nice sharp click when you press it.<br /><br />- The weight of the mouse is just right, although I did not try it without the weights, but I do not see a reason to take them out.<br /><br />- The cord of the mouse is great. It is embedded in some soft of a material,  not just simple plastic. This gives out class and quality.<br /><br />- One thing I found uncomfortable is the location of the button number 4, which is the furthest button on the left side of the mouse. But it is not the design flaw, I assume my hands are medium sized and Anker can not match the hands of all 7.108 billion people on the planet Earth.<br /><br />- Drivers are easy to find and download. One thing I would love to see in Ver. 1.1.2 is the option to where to install the drivers, instead of the generic /Program Files. I am sure there are people like me, who like to install programs to different folders on their HDDs to have their own software hierarchy.<br /><br />- I spent about an hour configuring my first Profile for the mouse. I would say it can get a little confusing at first, but after the right combination of sensitivity options found it can be modified to 4 DPI settings and 2 profiles, which will give you a total of 8 possible sensitivity options to choose from.<br /><br />- What really strikes me as WOW, is Anker's customer support, their visibility on the net, active replies and 18 months return policy. I had a mouse went double-clicking on me after 6 months of use. When I contacted their support, the answer I got was: \\"Well, 30 days have past, you can not return it.\\" With all due respect, what kind of mouse will start double click in 30 days? If I ever need a second mouse, I know where to come.<br /><br />My overall satisfaction is 10/10, even with the far away button number 4.<br /><br />max.ort, the answer I got was: \\"Well, 30 days have past, you can not return it.\\" With all due respect, what kind of mouse will start double click in 30 days?

6305161879|4.0|A somewhat zany film but many really great actors.  Hard to go wrong with so many cast members of Monty Python.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is a fun game to play and relax a bit at home with your kids or your self. Great for little people!
B000W746GK|5.0|What a great movie.  The actors, the sets and the story are just tops.  A film that adults can enjoy as much as children.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Cool for another version of Sherlock Holmes.  But could have more action, I think. The guy that plays Sherlock is too pale.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Purchased as a gift for teenagers.  Really know nothing about the film except it was wildly popular, but I never watched it
B00CJGP116|5.0|Love his music! Finally after so long, he made a new CD!<br />Great voice! Great sound! Really like Marc's voice!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I think it is one of Errol Flynn's best portrayals.  Who can ever forget the sword fight between Flynn and Basil Rathbone?  That alone is worth watching the movie
0345529057|5.0|I read &#34;book club&#34; type books usually so this series is not what I would normally pick up. But, I started reading the first book a year or so ago and could not stop. I love this series.
630469654X|5.0|Beautiful fantasy film.  Enjoyed all the performers and the sets.  Semi-tragic but like all love stories everything is ok in the end.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|The strengths of family throughout dramatic changes in Afganistan are expolred in this novel. Whilst Hosseini did not try and neatly tie up every loose end as with his first novel, &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, I felt there were too many characters introduced within this classic story of siblings separated.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|So sad to reach the end of the Harry Potters films.  It was great watching the actors &#34;grow up&#34; over the course of the films.  Enjoyed every one of them
B005M0R4X4|5.0|I Love Downton Abby. I am looking forward to watching season 3. I will be ordering third season very soon.

B000VDDDVO|3.0|Purchased for my husband as it is one of his favorite films.  Not one of my favorites even though it is a Christmas classic.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|If u like magic and think bank robber Robin Hood type playa's are some what entertaining, well I do. This movie is for u. Call me gullible.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|I'm glad I got this free ebay app. It works great on the Kindle Fire. It's easier to navigate ebay with the app than it was with the silk browser.  It's also easier to look at the pictures in the listings. I prefer to use a desktop when creating a listing but this is a good app for buying and checking to see if I have sold something.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I think it is a good alarm app, but I wish I didn't have to pay for extra features or upgrades.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|It's small and effective. It's modular so you can pick how you play with it. I really like it and it looks like there's another couple coming out soon. Couple weird things going on in this design but overall it's really nice.

B0088ETCHW|5.0|Helped me to review all miss-concepts I used to have. What I most liked in this book was the explanation of all most commons flaws. Ex: there are 12 flaws related to a bad body position on the water, i.e., there is no magic tip for improving your hydrodynamic.  Another positive point of this books is that it encourages you to share your training time into 3 great areas: technique, cardio and open water skills. Awesome!
B00E5BQ9SW|3.0|In Body Double, director Brian DePalma pays homage to the Alfred Hitchcock movies Vertigo and Rear Window, adding a few grotesque touches all his own. Craig Wasson plays Jake, a struggling actor who keeps losing jobs because of his claustrophobia. To make matters worse, his girlfriend has walked out on him, so he has no place to sleep. His pal offers him the use of his apartment for the evening. The apartment happens to be equipped with a huge picture window and telescope, enabling him to spy on his beautiful neighbor Gloria (Deborah Shelton) while she undresses. Jake then meets a porn star (Melanie Griffith) who is enmeshed in the unfolding mystery.<br /><br />Body Double is a great &#34;Peeping Tom&#34; film starring Craig Wasson (Nightmare on Elm Street 3). There is roughly an hour of bonus content (almost all from the DVD release). However, there are no audio commentaries or deleted scenes. The only new extra here is the isolated score by Pino Donaggio. An eight-page booklet is also included. This is the limited edition Blu-ray (3000 units) that is now out of print. It is pricey at $50 (though it has sold for up to $100) so I must rate the film 4 stars but this package only 3 stars. Despite no remastering being performed, this Blu-ray is the best Body Double has ever looked or sounded although neither the picture or audio quality is superb.<br /><br />Twilight Time 2013 Press Release: &#34;Sony's technical services and mastering department have informed us that the stunning new transfer of Brian De Palma's BODY DOUBLE (1984) has been completed, and has been personally supervised by veteran cinematographer Stephen H. Burum. However, Mr. Burum has apparently revisited the color timing of certain scenes, so sections of the film may look different to previous home-video incarnations.&#34;<br /><br />Video Codec: MPEG-4 AVC/1080p   Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0<br />Subtitles: English SDH<br />Special Features: &#34;The Seduction&#34; featurette, &#34;The Setup&#34; featurette, &#34;The Mystery&#34; featurette, &#34;The Controversy&#34; featurette, Isolated Scorel Features: &#34;The Seduction&#34; featurette, &#34;The Setup&#34; featurette, &#34;The Mystery&#34; featurette, &#34;The Controversy&#34; featurette, Isolated Score
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|It is really nice to read about a company that brakes all &#34;enterprise paradigms&#34; and is still profitable.<br />I loved the chapter about workaholics, because they are a plague in almost every internet startup. (By the way, stop using startup word, as teaches the book)
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like working these puzzles and especially like the wide variety of pictures available.  It's nice to be able to easily isolate edge pieces.  I wish I could turn off the music.  Guess I can just turn the volumn way down.  Good also to be able to choose number of pieces so you can limit or extend the time it takes to work a puzzle.  Overall I'd say this was one of my favorite jigsaw puzzles.  Works great on my KIndle.
B000JMLDCS|5.0|At some point along the way I got the impression that GK Chesterton's Orthodoxy was a collection a quotable statements, perhaps proverbs and one-liners. That's understandable considering the fact that Chesterton is so widely quoted and Orthodoxy is his most well known work. But this book is far from a collection of quotes. Instead it is a defense of the Christian faith against modern worldviews. But that doesn't quite explain it either. This is not an apologetic work, at least not in the sense you would expect if I called it that. It is more like a jolly celebration of the wisdom of Christianity that exposes the folly of other 'faiths' - whether pantheistic or materialistic. Yet he does this with such joy and kindness that you would expect that his opponents would not take offense.<br /><br />In short, Orthodoxy is about how Chesterton came to understand the world and his surprise when he found that the view that made the most sense of the world - was orthodoxy.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|An excellent movie that I have watched many times and I never get tired of it.  I love the humor of this movie, and the acting is also good by all.
B004SI8WX2|5.0|This book is definitely an eye opener.  If you are looking for something spiritual (and educational), this book is great.  Fast read.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Three stories intertwine in this post-modern meditation on time, zen, human frailty and quantum (as well as meta) physics. If that makes the book sound boring, heavy or difficult, let me be clear: it's wonderful. But it's not an easy book to describe.<br /><br />Sixteen year old Nao (pronounced \\"Now\\") is having an extremely rough time as the book opens. She's keeping a secret diary detailing her very bumpy transition back into Japanese life. Her father had moved their family to California in the 1990's to work at a prestigious start-up. Now he's lost his job and their savings in the dot.com meltdown of 2000. The family is forced back to Tokyo, her father is suicidal, and American-style Nao has become the target of vicious bullying.<br /><br />Years later, a well-wrapped package washes up on the shore of an island in Canada. A Japanese-American novelist named Ruth salvages it, and her husband Oliver searches the contents. Inside they find a Hello Kitty lunchbox holding some hand written letters, Nao's diary, and an antique wristwatch.<br /><br />Ruth decides to read the diary \\"in real time,\\" and by so doing, begins to become a part of its story. Ruth dreams about an elderly Buddhist nun; could she somehow be Nao's beloved great-grandmother? Who did the watch belong to? Is Nao for real? Ruth can find nothing about Nao on the internet; when she stumbles over tantalizing clues, they seem to suddenly disappear.<br /><br />The third strand of the story details the sufferings of a young kamikaze pilot enduring the brutalities of WWII. Taken from letters written by Nao's great uncle (letters that were never sent) there's another mystery: How did they end up in the Hello Kitty lunchbox? For that matter, who launched the package, and when? Does it have something to do with the tsunami of 2011?<br /><br />This book holds paradoxes (who is Ruth, by the way?), ghosts, zen superpowers, dreams, storms, a magical crow and more. The answers are here, and they're always surprising.<br /><br />One minor quibble: Footnotes -- and they're absolutely essential to the story -- remain touchy and problematic on Kindle, so be prepared.<br /><br />Whatever: Read this book.
B0078XFYDA|3.0|Geared for a broad audience.  Great kids book and makes light of some basic science most of us take for granted.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|It is a very nice mouse by all means. It's really worth more than it is price.

B00EMQK8TQ|5.0|Underworld Awakening in 3-D, I love this film so much, always had thing for werewolves and vampires. To see this on a big screen 3-D tv  of mime is so cool and so much action, it just rock me so cool. Kate Beckinsale one beautiful lady and she can act as good as she looks. Good story telling here in book and right good as it gets film. I own the hold set of the underworld series. Just great film, 5 stars.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Of course I was excited when I found out Kick Ass 2 was being made. I am a huge fan of the first movie and I couldn't wait to see the next one. Kick Ass 2 is pretty much like the first Kick Ass movie. A lot of action mixed with violence and goofy humor. There is more characters in this film and the action is just as good. Acting wise a few people steal the show from the stars of the first movie. Jim Carrey plays Colonel Stars and Stripes a former Mob hemchman turned masked super hero/born again christian. Now we all know that Jim didn't want to promote this picture b/c of the violence and don't get me started on that and I feel that might have hurt the movies box office performance here in America but I still think he steals every scene he is in. The down point on that is that there is very few scenes with him. Another new character this time on the bad side called Mother Russia is just great. The way she hunts and kills anything that gets in her way truly had the audience at the theater on the edge of their seats. You will leave the theater quoting lines from her and thinking that you wished she was in the movie a lot more. The leads like Kick Ass and Hit Girl are still great in this movie and Hit Girl really gets a lot of character development in this which is a good thing. I have to say I did miss seeing Nic Cage as Big Daddy in this film. I think he really helped the first movie rise to that epic level when he gets killed off leaving his daughter alone and out for revenge,<br />So as I do not think it is as good as the first movie I think it came very close to it. I hope to see a 3rd and final movie to this series which is hinted as the death of Kick Ass. But who knows. So if you still have a chance to see it in the movie theater then please go if not buy this when it comes out.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What an amazing story but tragic as to how this hero left us so soon!  Very rare insight into their world.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I don't usually write bad reviews and I was on board and loving the Chromecast at first.<br /><br />I can't get this piece of trash to connect to my wifi. It connects and I watch movies and I enjoy having it and then out of the blue randomly once a week the damn thing stops connecting. I factory reset and reset my modem and unplug and replug it in and then it works...for like 3 days. I don't want to spend 2 hours fixing something that I want to use for an hour every few days. This is simply stupid. I was try to be supportive of Google and using their products because I figured they were a good company but forget this I am going to go back to running Microsoft everything.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The only app that I have used is the YouTube app and it works seamlessly. The mirroring of the Chrome tabs needs work given that the audio doesn't sync when watching videos. If simply viewing web pages there is a lag in what you're doing and what is cast to the TV and the mouse isn't visible on the TV. I think one fix is to reduce the resolution from 1080 or 780 to 480p (not pretty) but out of the box it isn't the best. So, if the apps are going to be what works best, hopefully Google is working on some more. Especially those with a video component. Given the price I would recommend the product, however I would temper your immediate expectations. This is a new product that needs work but i'm sure there will be upgrades in the future.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this truck! The only problems we have had with it so far is he put sand in the back of the truck, which the directions clearly say NOT to do, and it partially jammed the mechanism for the compact gate that pulls &#34;trash&#34; into the back compartment.I put mineral oil in the suggested locations, after trying to rinse the sand away with water, which worked great. A few days later though we noticed that the sticker that displays the position of the gate had come off, and jammed the gate mechanism. I pulled the sticker out with a pair of needle nose pliers and everything is working great.<br /><br />Don't be dismayed by the cost of the truck, the parts and construction are of the highest quality that I have seen so far in a child's toy. I am no longer going to buy my son toy trucks from other brands, Bruder is the best. The 5 or 6 trucks that I would have bought from the brand names that I grew up with, which probably would have failed after some light use, pale in comparison to this toy.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I am so glad that NIN could not stay retired for too long.  This album is their best album out of the last few in my opinion.  The deluxe edition includes 3 additional remix tracks.  The book contains the NIN artwork you'd expect, dark and creepy, yet fitting.  Although nothing will ever compare to The Downward Spiral, this album is a must have for any fan.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The app will take picture but if you  try to take a video the app crashes!! I would not recommend this app if you are wanting a video feature.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Although I wasn't impressed by the book's prose, the story of Shin's experiences kept me interested. I skipped the author's ramblings about statistics on North Korea. I wasn't interested in elaborate history or research findings. I only bought the book to learn about Shin. I really admire the man's strength, and this book can serve as a great motivation for anyone who despises or are ungrateful of their lives. Shin's story will make you thank God for what you have.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|Previously I used the STAX SR-Lambda electrostatic headphones. These headphones are incredible. I recall freaking out the first time I tried them because I thought someone dropped something in the room behind me when I was alone. After closer inspection, it turned out to be the sound of someone dropping their purse during the recording in a concert hall (presumably behind the microphone). Even though I had heard this recording many times before, I had never notice that sound and with the STAX it sounded like I was right there. These headphones eventually developed a random crackling noise and needed to be replaced.<br /><br />I tried the AKG K702 headphones and was happily surprised. First they are large enough for my full grown male head, they fit snugly and the cushions are sufficient to actually isolate my ears. They are a tad less comfortable for hours of listening compared to the STAX, but more comfortable than any others I've tried.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent. Everything is well defined and accurate. Perhaps another reviewer is right and the drivers need a little time to settle in, they are noticeably less precise compared to the STAX right out of the box. Also the energy to drive them is increased compared to some lower end headphones. Plugging them into the same source I need to turn up the volume to get the same amount of sound compared to Sony headphones. Once the volume is up the AKG sound better, however it is worth noting. These headphones deserve some amplification.<br /><br />Bottom line, out of the box the AKG are in the same class as the STAX and one of the best headphones I've ever experienced. Considering the STAX retail for around $1400 and the AKG are $250ish with shipping, this is my new top choice for price / performance and they may even get a little better with time.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Outstanding book!  As a 23 year military veteran, I can understand and appreciate the value of selfless service, honor,  loyalty, brotherhood, and camaraderie.  This book encapsulates everything the military Special Operation forces are about.  Thank you for you service Marcus!
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|This series is really well written and the storylines are anything but predictable.<br />It's science fiction, action adventure, paranormal and romance all rolled into one, there's something for everyone.<br />The premise is that a plane from Sydney to Los Angeles breaks apart and part of the body crashes onto a south pacific island.<br />From then on the story goes at a breakneck pace, with occasional back stories of the individual characters.<br />The characters are very well written and acted, all the actors are believable and give excellent performances.<br />I recommend that you watch a season at a time and in sequence, you can not dip in and out of this story without missing important information.<br />There's been internet gossip about a possible reunion season which would be wonderful for fans of this cult classic.

B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I got this CD after having purchased and listened to the second volume for months. I loved &#34;Fade Into You&#34; from the TV show, which was supposed to be on this Volume 1, but due to licensing issues, they couldn't get the song on this first CD. That's one reason why the second one CD is so much better than the first. But this one is still pretty good, just sort of country &#34;twangy&#34; and feels like a lot of of &#34;filler songs&#34;. Except, and I especially love, the signature &#34;Wrong Song&#34;. And, of course, Maisy and Lennon Stella singing in harmony is always a treat. I wish they'd do a whole album of their own, they're so wonderful!

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Following Greta from pre-WWII Bratislava through Carlsbad through Aschaffenburg and ultimately to post-war Frankfurt is a well-written journey.  Fischer's The Luck of the Weissensteiners had me hooked into the journey, turning pages and asking the same question Greta stumbles upon frequently, “Where were friends or enemies?”<br /><br />The novel is a historically sound piece dealing with loyalty, stigma, love, loneliness and oppression set against a backdrop of  Eastern Europe's turmoil.  The characters' lives were confounded at so many intersections by the results of a powerful anti-Semetic propaganda campaign.  They don't go to an Auschwitz or Buchenwald, but you quickly see that avoiding the camps was not freedom for the articulately drawn and likeable characters.  You want to see what happens next to them and can feel the tension Fischer relays so well.<br /><br />Chapters 3, 10 and 13 capture Greta's emotion, tragedies and near-misses so intensely I bookmarked and went back for a welcome re-read. The book accomplishes a lot in covering more than a decade and a half without making a reader feeling rushed or missing something in the timeline.  It's paced that well … and the Epilogue cleanly tied together the themes and characters of the entire novel as a great exhibit of Fischer's talent.

B00DHHWY9I|4.0|The 2013 movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby scores four gold stars for contemporary music, touching acting, and a surprise ending. In the story, we learn about the glamorous lives of New York City's Long Islanders from newcomer Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire. Nick narrates an epic love affair between his cousin Daisy Buchannan, played by Carey Mulligan, and millionaire Jay Gatsby, Leonardo DiCaprio. The story of The Great Gatsby is original and heartwarming. With characters motivated by love, jealousy, and curiosity, the viewer gets swept up in the strong driving emotions of the story.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, Nick moves in next to the mysterious Gatsby mansion. Every weekend, Gatsby throws outlandish parties complete with endless alcohol, energetic dancing, and six-foot-tall champagne bottles that spray confetti into the crowd. Everyone is invited, and the whole of New York City piles into convertibles for the drive out to the island. Curious, Nick joins the merriment one night by a formal invitation from Gatsby himself. He learns that Gatsby and Daisy used to be in love five years before. However, Gatsby was sent to war, and Daisy married another man. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange tea for the old lovers to catch up. As Gatsby and Daisy rekindle their romance, the viewer learns that Daisy's husband Tom is also having an affair.<br /><br />By far, the best part of the movie is the couple's reunion. Gatsby brings scores of gaudy bouquets of flowers and two cakes popping with bright pinks and blues, squeezing them into Nick's quaint living room. When Daisy arrives, Gatsby gets so nervous that he runs out into the rain, changing his mind about seeing Daisy again. A few minutes later, he returns, bashful and soaking wet. The two talk for hours.<br /><br />Although the reunion is the best scene, the viewer is entertained throughout the movie by the 1920s women's flapper costumes and sharp men's suits that are showcased as the highlight of the movie. The updated Jay-Z rap songs and Lana Del Ray ballads contemporize an older story and engage a younger audience with an older story.<br /><br />For all of the movie's accomplishments, the story plods along like an old horse at the beginning. Before Gatsby and Daisy reunite, the viewer isn't quite sure what the point of the story is. The purpose of the movie could be made clearer at the beginning with a flash forward or some foreshadowing. Daisy's character acts selfishly for the entirety of the film, and the viewer ends up disliking her as a result.  If she poured out more of her thoughts and feelings, the viewer could understand her motivations better.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is reminiscent of Moulin Rouge (2001) and Marie Antoinette (2006) because all three movies are untraditional love stories where emotions run high and the endings are unexpected. They all are set in historically great cities: New York City, Paris, and Versailles. And in each film, contemporary music is paired with an older story. Anyone who enjoyed one of the three will enjoy the others.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a story about crazy love, crazy parties, and crazy people. The drama draws in the viewers, and the strong emotions hold them until the end. The viewer pities Gatsby for losing Daisy to her husband, and the ending only drives home that immense sympathy. Gatsby is the underdog, and so we hope he will get the love of his life.
B004132HZS|5.0|I like the modern day format. I would have truly liked to see how these two actors would have done playing it from a victorian age setting. I do not like the three show season format currently being used but.... It is what it is.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|None of the movies capture the true story of love, grace, and forgiveness like Victor Hugo penned it. What an amazing read. Highly recommend it! However, brush up on your French history first to help get through some more of the political aspects of the book!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I think Americans should be the ones buying and reading this book, and for educational purposes. Once in a while, one ought to see one's world through a different cultural lens. That's exactly what this story does. If you're a Nigeria to America immigrant like the protagonist, you will relate and find yourself laughing out loud at some observations. If you're a non-immigrant American, read it to enjoy a new perspective. Every story Miss Adichie touches turns to gold. This one is no exception. Nwa nne m jisie ike, biko (That's igbo for 'My sister, please keep it up').

B007ZXK08C|5.0|Dont read reviews about a poor ending! The ending rocks!!!!<br />The characters, the susspense and the mystery all rock!!!<br />Just get the book and read it!!!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Excelent album, great songs and i just wanna say &#34;Newsted is a great band. I hope this guys play here in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia&#34;
0756686970|5.0|Purchased this for a present for 6 year old.  Great.  Also comes with a lego character in the front of the book.  Great price...and ideal for the Star Wars collector!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The worst part of a PERSONS LIFE CAN SOMETIMES be their childhood which they have very little control over.  This book is the story of two people and there struggle to survive just that.  One women much older and a teenager.  The book was very touching and moving.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|I loved this movie!  i wasnt sure just by the name but then my hubby read the description to me and i said YES!  and am i glad i did this was a great movie, the kid actors are fantastic and what a cast.  Reece looks fabulous and who doesnt LOVE Mathew?  seriously.  great love story happy ending and everything you like to see in a family movie/date night movie.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|The cutter does a good job- it was hard for me to score the glass evenly but when I did, the glass was cut evenly.
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|I like it because it tells the story of a very productive and successful woman who shares her story in order to make us open our eyes and mind in order to succeed.
B00AFQC4QC|4.0|I think this is a wonderful story. The life and trials of Greta and her family are very heartbreaking and joyful. This story tells you what some of the people may have went through during the Holocaust and after. Greta's story was very fascinating and heartbreaking. The people that she loved and was deceived by. The people who would do all that they could to help her and her family. The things that she was willing to do for her children to keep them safe. She was an amazing character who met some amazing people in her journey. She tended to be very naïve at times and sometimes trusted people who only meant her harm but that was part of her charm. Although I do have to say I was disappointed in her father. It is very disturbing to read what people may have went through during that awful time but it is heartening to think that things may have turned out alright for a lot of them in the end. I did shed a few happy tears at the end of this book! I would definitely recommend this book. Christoph Fischer is a new Author to me and I definitely look forward to reading more of his books!

B00D8HNR2K|2.0|This album is like a love letter to 'Pretty Hate Machine' from the Farewell Cottage retirement home.  It has a few moments of brilliance, but so do most people shortly before their vindictive children shove them into an assisted living facility.  There is a lot of boring ambient noises and repetition, and some of the lyrics and vocals just seem mediocre.  I might like this one after a few more listens, but right now I just want to send this album away with a nurse to a room with a curtain wall.
1451608659|3.0|I don't tend to start a book and not finish it but this one was the exception.  I'm an avid reader and have always loved the sport of gymnastics and have followed Dominique's career so I was sure that I would love this book.  I found it difficult to read because it wasn't written in a manner that was very easy to follow or made the story as interesting as when I heard her speak about it in the interviews leading up to the release of the book.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Great season as are all 5 lots of twist and turns. great job on the new stuff, really enjoyed the show
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So well written! I was shocked, scared, amused and charmed. An absolutely amazing story that is expertly written and thoroughly enjoyed!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Many times we wonder what happens when we die, this gave a true and positive description, making me think wow!
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|I don't usually write reviews.  But this book was so compelling I felt I had to. The author did an excellent job of weaving the whole story together.  I gave this  book 5 stars. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book.
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 45 year old son's birthday because it is his all time favorite.  I remember it as one of Robert Redford's best movies.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I caught these guys on Palladia a few weeks ago and have been hooked ever since.  If Zeppelin had a baby with Lynard Skynard and that child was raised by David Allen Coe and Hank Williams, you would have BBS.  Buy this now!!!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book feels as though it was written for the gradeschool audiance. I normally love fantasy and science fiction books but the was not all that entertaining...I was a little disappointed. It has one slightly adult sceen that isn't really graphic in nature. Depending on how you about the implication of sex, this may be suitable for your younger (pre-teen) readers.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW.. THIS SEASON WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE MONEY BUYING THE HD BECAUSE ITS NOT HD AT ALL..  BUY THE CHEAPER VERSION WHICH ALSO OFFERS SUBTITLES AND PERSONALLY I THINK LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME
B007V4530A|5.0|The author makes his every word count. This is a very short book, which is long on well thought out advice. He does his readers a real service by conveying to us his very insightful analysis of what makes an outstanding TED talk outstanding. Of course, few of us will be delivering aTED talk in our life-time, but what makes for a successful TED talk obtains for any public presentation.<br /><br />Reading this volume is an excellent investment of time for anyone wanting to improve their speaking delivery.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Great movie excellent actors. Wasn't sure what to expect but it was entertaining and engaging and witty. A good view!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very interesting game. You have to have brain power. The 10th floor had me. Ready for more floors.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|There is so much going on in the film having it in HD greatly helps one to see what is actually happening.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|This movie has it all...a star-studded cast, a gripping story and heart-pounding pacing!  It's one of those movies that I watch from beginning to end every time I see that it's on cable.  A new virus is threatening global annihilation of a significant percentage of our population.  This movie shows the manner in which an outbreak is handled by our government, the politics behind producing and distributing a vaccine, the breakdown of society under its effects, the best of society under the same conditions and many more aspects of such a scenario.  There is great acting by Gwyneth Paltrow, Bryan Cranston, Marion Colltiard, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Kate Winslet and others.  It is fast-paced and intriguing!  Great movie!
B00AEFYGJW|5.0|Much better than I expected. The action was constant and just kept flowing. I enjoyed it much more than the second Lara Croft
B00CATONCA|5.0|Love it, when i first seen a review on youtube i was a bit disappointed by the LED lights on it, but now i have it i take that back, i guess they could be a little brighter like in the stock photo but nonetheless they still look good and are bright enough. I filled mine wit water and it does add to the effect once the lights are on because you can see the water line in the tanks and that makes a big difference when its lit up.<br /><br />The Blu-rays themselves are a little tight to get in and out but that's no biggie,and also i read about people having problems with the screw for the batteries, well i had no problems whatsoever, maybe they had the wrong size screwdriver to begin with.<br /><br />Overall i'm very happy with it, but it think they could of supplied batteries..... that's my only gripe.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I loved the original Thing[1950's version and I really loved the 1980's version from John Carpenter. This version was just ok mostly because it just repeated much of the 1980's version, There was not enough new info or suspense to recommed it any higher.
B0026PW67W|4.0|This map is really big and sturdy. Suitable to give kids as gifts. The details on the map are good (except for the repeating locations).
B000TDGGRY|5.0|This is the best so far of all action-adventure books i have ever come across. Adrenalin filled adventure moments right from the start to the ultimate end criss-crossing countries such as Venice, USA, Turkey, Syria and Cambodia. Rollins writing style impeccably teleports you into the very heart of the gut crunching adventure moments. Sometimes you feel the stress of death as if you are the protaganist and at other times you become like the cold, ruthless and calculative villain of the Guild<br /><br />The novel runs simultaneously on two parallel threads. One is the historic thread which has Marco Polo's ancient journey as the backdrop where he has placed clues around the world which wraps the nature of the plague as we progress and also leads to the source and cure to the abhorent and vitriolic disease. The second parallel runs on the scientific thread with the modern outbreak of the plague and its after effects on the population and the race to find its cause and effects on scientific level. Both the parallels are filled with severe suspense and amazing gut wrenching action.<br /><br />Towards the close of the book we will get to understand the hidden intricacies of our DNA rooted in mysticism, of how zombies are medically possible, myriad medical composition of pathogens in our body and how gift of angelic language and interpretation of angelic language is scientifically possible.<br /><br />A total stunner. I can put up a challenge that if anyone doesnt like this book I will pay them the money back. Way to go JAMES ROLLINS
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We saw a clip of this movie and it looked like something worth getting.  The kids loved the movie and so did the husband and I.
B007THA4FI|4.0|While considerably different in subject matter and content, the Casual Vacancy exhibits many of Rowling's traits, both strong and weak, familiar to readers of the Harry Potter series. (And face it, you probably are thinking of buying this because you know Rowling from that series.)<br /><br />The story features a large cast of characters, overlapping in a variety of ways, with multiple kinds of sub-plots developing in parallel. While some of these characters are sympathetic, and some fill the role of &#34;bad guys,&#34; they all have at least a little of each characteristic, and Rowling takes pains to make them all understandable, if not likable.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of sex, some of it quite explicit, and none of it romanticized. The depiction of the sexuality of the teenage boys is quite effective--somewhat oddly, the sexuality of the teenage girls is treated with more distance. There is also a throwaway lesbian adult character who seems like she might be there to check off a box.<br /><br />Pacing is a bit of an issue. The book takes a long time to introduce all the characters, and while it's doing that, it moves slowly. It then develops a nice pace, but suffers a bit from Rowling's habit of rushing to wrap everything up at the very end.<br /><br />Overall, a decent read; it would be entertaining even if you didn't know who the author was.
B00BP0P3DI|4.0|wonderful book extremely informative  a must read.. this book should be read by everyone. It informs and educates while entertaining
B001IF277K|1.0|It worked great for like 1 week and now it dies faster than the original battery I got with the phone. .Going to buy a new one, but not from this company.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series!  The author writes very believable characters and its easy to get involved in their lives.  The plot is not predictable and takes twists and turns along the way.  Great read
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like it, but don't like all the permission access it requires, and I don't like how bulky it is.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love watching Downton Abbey-I have been following it since the beginning and love<br />the house, the acting, the stories, & the costumes. I love the relationship between Matthew<br />& Lady Mary. I look forward to the next season.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The story picks up right from the end of the previous book. The world of Westeros is expanding with more exposure to the lands across the the sea...Arya's trip to Bravos.
B002VX3RCW|2.0|It arrived in the mail after a VERY long wait. Once it finally arrived, I was so excited I opened it right up to find the toy shoved into the plastic evelope with NO tags on it or anything that would show it was new. Small pieces of stuffing/fibers were sticking out of it all over. It smelled like the plastic envelop it was shipped in and overall was very disappointing.<br /><br />It was just not the quality I expected and feel I received on my other Lamaze toys (which we love - the Octopus and Peacock).
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Excellent movie. Hsve seen itany times and will no doubt watch it agsin sometime. If you haven't seen it you are missing out on one of Hitchcock's best movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Really love this game. My 6 year old grandson is hooked. He loves feeding the dragons. Really a great app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a game I dont have to play everyday just to have fun on it. Does have a few bugs but nothing to bad.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|I'll be brief. The Walking Dead on Vita is the exact same content as on the console versions. There is a new touch based control scheme, but I stayed with device control. Graphics are just as they were on the console, and their are strange pauses, or loading breaks, when scenes change or you make a big decision and the game has to load the next story strand. Loading may be slightly longer on the Vita than on consoles. I may be wrong on this, but that's how it seemed.<br /><br />Should you buy it? You can play one of the best games of the last few years and get the bonus episode 400 Days along with it for $25 (on retail copy) or $20 for the PSN download. However, if you've already beaten the game on console, there's no need to get it here. It's hard for me to find time at home and play a game like this that's violent and has strong language with my son around, so the mobile version better suits my needs. I plan on picking up Season 2 for Vita when that releases.
0679805273|4.0|We bought this book for our grandson as he was entering college his first year. Very appropriate and a great gift.
0141345659|5.0|My daughter couldn't put the book down. She even cried and she isn't a crier.  The book arrived as promised and in new condition.  Loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have 5 horses of my own and I have to say the game could be better but it's the best one so far. Even Tango and the ponies like it! ;D
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this story (twice) when I was a child.  I still love it.  Who wouldn't love a story that involves finding a secret garden?  I could actually see the roses, the robins, and the beautiful green trees.  Then this secret garden has the power to change two spoil brats into somewhat decent children.  The only downfall is that this book reminds me how horrible our English language is getting.  It does say this book is okay for children nine and older  but to be honest I think the average nine year old might have some problems with reading this book.
B008Q08EV8|4.0|Action thru the entire movie. It sure survives its era of its kind, Roman Empire. Must watch, drama, suspense, action
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever I love it. it's totally worth  $6.99. if I could I would buy it all over again : )  &lt;3 &lt;3
B008JFUO36|3.0|The special effects are good but the story is not great! Its disappointing since Tom Cruise is a good actor.
B0061P2L5U|4.0|A great strength of this book is its carefully assembled facts and comprehensive research.  It contains a full inventory of stories and a very thorough annotated bibliography.  It is hard to come away from this compelling barrage of facts without being convinced of the author's primary premise - that our elimination of early life pathogens and parasites has deprived our immune system of essential training, absent which, it turns on our own bodies creating a growing epidemic of allergies and autoimmune disease.<br /><br />It fails on the task of integration - what lessons should we take from each of these essentially self complete examples/stories.  After about the half way point I wanted to scream &#34;OK, I got it, lets move on&#34;.  The conclusion offers little clarity or relief, perhaps not wanting to take the risk of practicing medicine without a Licence? However, an opinion from such an informed researcher would have been interesting.  On timing: is it parental epigenomics/immunology; fetal transfer; early life; later life; exposure that matters most?  On agents: is it worms (helminths), virus, bacteria; is it special individuals within one of these groups?  Of course, the true answer is that no one really knows yet, but some more muscular integrative hypotheses would be a big help.<br /><br />In spite of all that, this is a field largely dominated by quack and fad medicine, and this book stays well away from all that nonsense.  Net, an important and useful study of the field of the super-organism, ie humans and our parasites.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Seeing this series was really what made me make the leap to Blu-Ray and a hi-def TV. Because this footage is simply astounding. Beautifully paced, well narated and beyond gorgeous to watch.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|easily downloaded app and then the book I wanted to read. Had no problems and has worked well so far.
0553212753|5.0|Alcott's semi-autobiographical classic, set in Boston during and just after the Civil War, follows the four March sisters as they struggle to overcome poverty and grow into proper young ladies. Meg, the oldest, is pretty but swayed by material temptations; Jo is a good-hearted tomboy and writer; Beth is a shy, sweet music lover; and Amy, the youngest, is a little selfish but very social and elegant. Even as the girls bicker like all siblings, they keep their loving home together as they wait for their father to return from the war. LITTLE WOMEN's appeal is its vivid depiction of its 19th-century time period. Though the writing style can be didactic, even contemporary girls who can't imagine wearing silk dresses or being too ladylike to run will identify with the March sisters' strong bonds and earnest efforts to overcome their faults. Jo, who romps with her best friend (a boy) and cuts her hair short, remains an enduring character who defied the era's gender conventions.<br />At nearly 800 pages (for some editions), the book might work better as a read-aloud so parents can skip the occasionally lengthy, boring passages of description, long letters, or the girls' plays. Young readers may struggle with the sometimes archaic language and unfamiliar references. Potential uses for the book in a classroom:<br />Explore, discuss, enjoy.<br /><br />How are opportunities and expectations different/similar for women today?<br /> Would kids have liked living during the 1860s and '70s? Why or why not?<br /> The type of clothes and objects the girls desire are different than today, but can kids see similarities in their own lives? What lessons about consumerism do the girls learn?<br /> The writing style is more didactic than most literature written for children today. The author also breaks in with first-person comments. What do readers think of this style? How does it compare to contemporary novels?
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this movie.  Its very cute and one that I enjoy watching with her. The movie is based very close to book.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I thought the acting was terrific and the expressions on their faces when the other one was talking was fantastic.  Good story line.  Many people saw themselves in Meryl's situation.  Great fun!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A must read! The story is great and in the last book you will notice how much of a great bond you will have with the characters. This story is not about a flawless main character. Katniss imperfections as a human being are what makes the story so good. This trilogy deserves the highest of ratings and really hope that the movies follows its success!!  This trilogy is a must buy.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Kids (and adults) love it. It is worth having a copy for road trips and movie night. Our kids cannot wait for the second movie to come out on DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So addicted to this game! Everyone should download this. Though it has a big size (as a file), it's worth it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the characters and plot... I can not wait till they make a movie of this series! This series is a must have... I will be reading it for years to come. Hope more are written!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I am an engineer and my wife bought me one of these as part of my bday present, needless to say I was quite fascinated with the construction and design.  Then began my addiction.

Not for impatient ppl.  You will not beat this without cheating.  But maybe you will........
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works great , all accessaries you may need are included which would cost you much if you bought them separately , all back up software are available and free for all devices, and the price is very affordable , I told my friends and many are buying it.<br />the only thing that is not good about it is that you wait for months until it is being shipped , I'm sure its because of the big demand .

B00DY951RQ|5.0|Well no need to go into a lengthy review, as almost everyone who has written one has written a novel about this box set and Dylan. Yada, yada, yada I will spare you the masses. I've listened to this 4 cd set 3 times already this weekend. A Truly enjoyable listening experience. Truthly the 1969-1970 Dylan had alot of creative fire power within him. Evidenced by listening to the demos in this box set. Some demos could have been used on the final edit of the original Self Portrait. Dylan is one music artist who could release old demos as a new release and it is considered great stuff, says alot about Dylans talent. The thing that got me was after spending a $100:00 for this latest round of bootlegs, the gall of sony legacy as I opened up this box only to find literature that columbia is releasing a complete Dylan albums collection this fall 2013, for in the imortal words of Brian wilson, 'God only knows' this box will cost another $300:00 or more. There will be 14 albums in this upcoming box set that will be remastered for the first time. Cha Ching Cha Ching!!! When does it end? Sony thinks every Dylan fan is some rich person who has money to burn. I enjoy all these great deluxe releases,I know they have the cheaper versions but as a fan you always want the deluxe edition and all it offers. These prices for the deluxe versions are like brokers fees... insanity!!!! I enjoy new Dylan releases believe me I do, I'm glad he still performing and writing. After hearing this  bootleg release and hearing how smooth Dylans voice was I can't help and say with todays medical technology, \\"I know Dylans voice was never great, truth is the man should have his voice fixed as alot of singers have done. He's making alot of money with touring and new albums at least give your fans a decent voice to listen to, not some grovel that is unbearable to listen to. I enjoy Dylan believe me I do with grovely voice and all. \\"Hey Bob we know your a legend with an ego, but your not above getting your voice overhauled as many singers have, the medical technolgy is there, we the fans don't need a young voice just a clearer easy listening one. Anyway enjoy the smooth 1969-1970 Dylan voice on Another expensive Deluxe Another Self Portrait box set. Please fans don't forget that columbia is releasing the complete Dylan recordings box set coming this fall for a measely $300:00 or more dollars. Yes it will be a great fall 2013 with all these great music box sets coming out, but remember music fans it's only enjoyable for those who could afford the fare.......

1572704756|5.0|It is no wonder that Death on the Nile is one of Agatha Christie's most memorable mysteries, since it is this book that best showcases her skills as a writer.  It is a \\"closed room\\" mystery -- one of her most common formulas -- taking place on a cruise boat on the Nile River.  Lynette Ridgeway-Doyle has it all -- beauty, brains, fame and fabulous wealth.  Not even 21, life has always gone her way and she has always gotten what she wanted, including her new husband Simon Doyle.  But her idyllic life is abruptly brought to an end when she is shot to death while on the above-mentioned cruise boat on her honeymoon.  Her murder is followed within 24 hours by two more.<br /><br />But Hercule Poirot is also on the same cruise boat and puts his prodigious skills immediately to work.  Colonel Race is also on the boat, looking for an international terrorist suspect, and he assists Poirot in the murder investigation.  As things proceeds it seems that almost every passenger has something to hide -- alcoholism, kleptomania, jewel thievery, embezzlement.  But in spite of all this Poirot remains fixed on solving the three murders and of course quickly figures it out.<br /><br />In this book Agatha Christie was truly at the top of her form.  Her set-up of the story was flawless, and the plot was also perfect.  When the murder is solved the logic and reasons behind it were not only believable but among the most sinister of any of Agatha Christie's constructed motives for murder.<br /><br />But Death on the Nile is anything but sinister.  Like all of Agatha Christie's books it is infused with a lightness that makes it almost whimsical in places.  There are the quirky and interesting characters.  And in Agatha Christie's books everyone takes murder in stride, even with some nonchalance, with never even the hint of shock.  In Death on the Nile the daughter of one of the victims receives and accepts a proposal of marriage just hours after her mother has been murdered (in fact, there were three proposals of marriage on the boat, all on the same day as the murders).<br /><br />This one is a must-read for all Agatha Christie fans, and is the perfect place to start for those who are new to her works.e three proposals of marriage on the boat, all on the same day as the murders).<br /><br />This one is a must-read for all Agatha Christie fans, and is the perfect place to start for those who are new to her works.

B004LWZW2E|4.0|Quick arrival, but no artwork booklet with the bluray. However over all I was satisfied and would buy from this user again.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|It was a compelling story years ago and still is today. We all need a little understanding of what it meant to be in service when there was nothing else for one to do but go into service. Yes even in America...

B006LSZECO|5.0|I did not get this item.  I ended up ordering it through my ipad.  So i can't rate this seller.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Written with such detail it was  like watching a movie, yet not too detailed in description the story gets lost.  A fun read!
B008AYA7WE|3.0|ads pop up while playing, and often i can't get rid of them before the tile hits the bottom, sometimes they all hit the bottom before i can get the ad to let go of the game. Fix that and it'll be 5 stars
1439152810|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author, and if it is indicative of the standard of her writing I will be going back for more.  I loved the way the story jumped through various time periods.  I found the characters well-written and with sufficient flaws to be very human.<br />I did eventually realise where the twist in the tale was going to be before it was spelled out but it didn't detract from enjoying the complete story and having all the loose ends neatly tied up.<br />An extremely satisfying read.
B00EV4EUT8|5.0|When I heard about \\"The Butler,\\" I rolled my eyes. Another film about African Americans serving...who needs that? More who wants that? No one. Luckily, the filmmakers behind the project agreed. Sure, it's about a White House butler, but it's about so much more than that. It's about American history through the lens of not only a White House Butler, but also a black family. It's insightful, gives you a look into what the domestic life of American Presidents and most of all it's heartfelt.<br /><br />We can spend all day arguing about how facts of the \\"The Butler\\" and it is in my opinion that most of this film is true, but exaggeration. I am sure that Danny Strong (Yup that Danny Strong from Buffy) did a lot of research and got as much of the events as close to possible, but this is not a documentary. More, the exact facts are not always cinematic. So, please I do not want to hear about how this was wrong and that was not quite right. It's a movie and it's fiction. Intelligent people should know not to believe every word of it. Movies are for entertainment and movie makers are in the business of making money, not telling facts.<br /><br />That being said...this film is the MOST realistic and honest retelling of the Civil Rights movement I have ever seen. I cried. I cried a lot. What makes \\"The Butler\\" so good is that this film is not a civil rights film. It's a film about family, change and America. It's a look at our history during some of the most trying times. And honestly, what is more trying than the civil rights movement. A time when our country was divided by racism and hate. We get to really see what it meant to be a freedom rider...well as close as we can from sitting in a movie theater. We see what those kids went through. Being attacked and cursed, while politely and nonviolently sitting in a restaurant, because yes you have every right to be there.<br /><br />There were moments during the sit in that I just felt myself collapse. Felt such pride in the Americans who came before me, because yes, I am really pleased to say that there were white people on the right side of equality during that time. It's amazing and heartbreaking and scary. Lee Daniels, did an amazing job of bringing it to life. It's not that we did not understand the sacrifice these young people made. I definitely did, but seeing it in living color, even if it was just acted out, was devastating.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|I like this movie better than I thought I would since Jason Bourne was not in it.  It was well made and the acting was great.  I do recommend this movie.
B003QSLW0K|4.0|My 3 year old daughter enjoyed the film and it is very cute. She especially enjoyed the hula dancing and swimming scenes.
B002U3CB5M|5.0|The book is extremely well written!  I loved every minute and could not put the book down!  I will definitely read all his books!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Really not much to say here, I'm just glad I finally got around to purchasing this.  It actually did more than I expected it to do.  Very easy installation.  The wizard takes you through the steps and your pretty much complete in 15 minutes.  Colors looked great, more accurate, contrast just right.  I've since done some lab prints and am very pleased.  What I wasn't expecting is this software monitors your ambient light and changes the blacklight/brightness accordingly.  Very nice touch.
