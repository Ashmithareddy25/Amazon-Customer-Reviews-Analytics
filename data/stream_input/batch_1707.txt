B00866H7SS|5.0|Amazing. Simple.<br />Better than 50 Shades, plot is slightly unrealistic haha.<br />fight, screw, fight, screw, fight, screw' but hey! It made me giggle in places too.<br />Good read.
B008COD5OO|3.0|some humor, somewhat boring at parts, a little over the top with the partying, not bad over all. is not must see, but good weekend flick.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|never in my wildest dreams would i expect a movie like prometheus to be this good,and this movie reveals a hidden secret.i would highly recomend this movie to anyone whos a sci-fi movie buff!
B008H6GH8I|4.0|I didn't like so much the first movie, RE:Denegeneration. (see the other review)<br /><br />But this movie redemeed that.<br /><br />The plot is simple, but yet it fits in R.Evil universe. As a matter of fact, I prefer Svetlana than Saddler or Salazar (REvil 4). She does not that \\"let's capture and make a mortal and complex device to kill to Batman\\"... I mean Leon!<br /><br />(She is very much straighforward: just kill him! Although her soldiers are very much incompetente and could not manage to hit a single bullet in Leon.)<br /><br />For boys, you will be pleased by two hot strong female characters in a \\"cat fight\\": the knife fight is better than Leon and Krauser.<br /><br />If you are a girl - like me - you would be delighted to see Leon like he should be. Not a robot, but a human being with even a streak of sense of humour. Oh, and a scene that is meant for fangirls to fantasy about having him in their hands.<br /><br />The mocap (motion capture) is really awesome. In Degeneration, only Claire was decently worked out - the rest, including Leon, seemed like Barbie dolls!<br /><br />But now, the characters eyes are looking at the right plaece. Sometimes, I forgot they are virtual, not real people.<br /><br />Even though, it is not perfect. But I guess it was an important experiment in order to make an even better mocap for the new game R.Evil 6.
B000FS9FCG|3.0|Engaging movie but I wouldn't want to watch it again also giving it 3 stars because of the violence which I am 100% again.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This 1st Hayao Miyazaki - Ghibli Study movie is a classic. Even after so long time, everybody can relate to Nausicaa and cheer for her.<br /><br />Nausica is the princess of Valley of the Wind. But unlike the princesses one is used to, she is like the kings of the old, when kings would fight alongside its folk. She even do repairs in machinery in her kingdom.<br /><br />But she unlike princess Kushana, Nausicaa does not crave for war. Her fight is for life, and not for death.<br /><br />The world they live is trying to purge away all poison that humankind poured upon Earth. It is pictured by Sea of Decay, a deadly ocean of death, where nobody - humans, convencional animals and plants - can live.<br /><br />There are few no-poisoned lands. And in there, humans fight agains each other, as well fight against Sea of Decay.<br /><br />Nausicaa in the other hand is not a fighter. She is most likely a scientist, as she loves even that mortal ecosystem. She does not hates even if that world have sickened her father, she tries to understand in order to find a cure for him.<br /><br />And like scientists, her fight is even harder than anybody else, because she fights with no weapons. Only knowledge and love.<br /><br />I known no person who can not be moved to tears at the final scenes, in her struggle to save her people, to save Nature, and even save her enemies.<br /><br />The beauty of her heart, and the beauty of the songs - unlike disney princesses, she will not sing for you - are overhelming and powerful.<br /><br />Just check at youtube any Joe Hisaishi 25 years concert in Budokan and say if you can stay with no goosebumps.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|simple and good.  Works fine, no problems. I would not buy the paid app (if there is any...).  This app is good enough and does whatever you expect from a clock app.
B004RZGUBM|4.0|I purchased this about a month ago and, of course, I've had time to read only a small portion of it.  But at 99 cents for the Complete Works of Dickens, how could it not be a worthwhile purchase?  I bought this particular edition because other reviewers noted the comprehensive table of contents with chapter-level linking (essential in a collection like this) and the reproductions of the Victorian-era illustrations, which enhance Dickens' already vivid writing.  While I haven't yet completed reading a full book, the experience has been very satisfactory. As for the content, what's not to like?  It's Dickens, one of the best writers in the English language!
B009CGYO0K|3.0|I enjoy many of the oatmeal's comics  online. That being said, this book was about 80%of the material that you can find on the website. Maybe it was the subject of the book? I've nearly choked on various food items while reading some of his other coming. This one was just ok...
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app for my Galaxy3!  Works well. Good features.  Great for on the go editing. I think it is a good investment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun, very addictive, great way to spend 10-15 minutes!Hard to get the \\"right\\" prize in the \\"right\\" color to advance, but that is part of the challenge!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have purchased over 100 apps on my device but this was the one that caught my eye. It looked fun and so I downloaded it. It is the best app I have played yet. There is a lot of action in this game.  I promise you will be happy with this amazing game. Whovever came up with this game was genious. I have not voted many apps 5 stars but this app deserved it. I &hearts; SUBWAY SURFERS!!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|if you are a fan of Mumford and Sons you will probably love the Lumineers.  they've got a little more of the laid back sound, but great quality music
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I was very happy with this latest installment from Muse. The album has a different feel from the rest of their others, continuing their pattern of changing things up a bit on every album. A lot of effort was put in to the vocals this time around, and it shows. The songs here have great build ups and each has its own mood. The mood swings are actually quite large on this album. You might even think that they receive some influence from Queen this time around, and that's a great thing!
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|I'm an independent who is somewhat put out by Michael Moore's phony poor-man pandering, and us-against-them mentality, yet there are definitely good and interesting features to \\"Sicko.\\"  It is informative and thought-provoking.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|kept me playing for hours. I like the story, also the options of difficultly.  the search scenes are well done and the story scenes are great.
1439102430|2.0|In anticipation of the release of Bones are Forever, I prepared by re-reading all fourteen previous novels in the Temperance Brennan series, and enjoyed every word once again (Clearly, I am a fan).<br /><br />The opening paragraph of Bones are Forever, grabbed me by the throat and promised a rollicking good Reichs read. Andrew Ryan was back (a much anticipated return) and early reviews alluded to a previous dalliance with a Mountie, Reichs was nailing it once again...or so I thought.<br /><br />Andrew Ryan barely figured in the story and I couldn't really believe Tempe would have ever tolerated Ollie the Mountie, let alone dally with him. He lacked substance - never mind allure, even bad boy Cotton Dallimore (Flash and Bones) was a more likely candidate for Tempe. Top heavy with characters but lacking the forensic anthropology mystery solving of previous stories, Bones are Forever was a light read, lacking Reichs' previous commitment to her stories. I will of course look forward to the next installment and hope my investment with Reichs' characters pays a dividend.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|It works right away on my kindle fire HD. I am impressed. I can find both photos and videos under my Photos and Personal Videos. Very easy to use. Thank you!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this calculator a lot, it is easy to use and very accurate every time. However, I purchased this app to help with my advanced math homework. I was doing the Pythagorean Thereom and I needed to find the square root of several numbers. There was not a &quot;square root&quot; button, and that frustrated me. I also needed to square a few numbers, and there was no button for that, either. It took me forever to type in each number and multiply it by itself, then find a calculator on the Internet that had a square root button. Overall, the quality of the app is amazing, but there should definitely be &quot;square&quot; and &quot;square root&quot; buttons.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was such a fun read.  I enjoyed all of the characters and the setting was great (an old and rather odd bookstore).  I would love to read more by this author!
0061992860|5.0|I bought this for my husband-he loves it and carries it in his backpack when we go hiking. It is small enough to fit in his pocket, but is pretty thick :) It has been helpful to him.
B005NAE04E|4.0|I would very much recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little unconventional comedic fantasy. It was an original read with a compelling story and some colourful and enjoyable characters. Blah blah etc etc buy it
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game I did this because it asked me to you should also try other teamlava games . so yeahits fun
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I love the way these sound. If price was not a factor, I would take these over any Bose or Beats headphones I've heard. Very detailed and natural sounding.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved it. couldn't hardly put it down. i am actually reading this book again. highly recommend this book.
1475143389|5.0|I've been trying to get in to shape for the last seven years and always felt like i was on a road to nowhere. Mike's book just makes sense and the instruction is given in a simple but really informative way. When you read it you feel that it is possible and that the journey is worth it. I've gone from squats with just the bar to 180 lbs. in just 8 weeks!!!! This program works plain and simple, and if you have any questions mike will answer his emails quickly with useful advice to push you forward. I want to thank Mike Mathews for such a great line of books and leading me to results and continuous motivation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved it. couldn't hardly put it down. i am actually reading this book again. highly recommend this book. I Have ended up buying the whole series.
B0088EDMMS|3.0|This movie is strictly for Halloween lovers only.<br />Gorgeously photographed by Hiro Narita (DP on \\"The Rocketeer\\" and \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\"), and directed with a deliberately light touch by Kenny Ortega, this is a solid Halloween entertainment for the whole family.  The images are nicely evocative of the holiday.  Any scares are more  of the bumbling, silly kind (youngsters may get a jolt here and there; nothing too traumatic).  The makeup FX are not particularly graphic either (even a zombie is seen as more as a Wizard of Oz-type scarecrow sort, rather than a flesh-eating mindless monster).  This movie is harmless fun, on the order of \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" (though not nearly as memorable).  On the negative side, the three witches' over-the-top shtick (particularly Bette Midler's wild overacting) are positively headache inducing, but younger kids will probably find it entertaining.<br /><br />I was initially going to buy this one on DVD, as it's really a once-a-year kind of movie; but when I found that the original DVD release was not enhanced for widescreen TVs, I searched Amazon and found that Disney was releasing it on bluray in it's proper aspect ratio.  And the blu ray looks good enough, but the movie is almost 20 years old, so don't expect \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Avengers\\" quality here; it's serviceable, not a gold standard.  Also comes with a DVD copy as well (perfect for playback in the car's DVD player for long trips).  A lack of bonus features was a bit disappointing, but I suppose this is the kind of movie one shouldn't really analyze to death anyway.  It's a lighthearted Halloween romp for the whole family, and if you watch it in that vein?  It works very well indeed...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game is truly amazing but its gotta update quicker. because the Pc minecraft is where its at and you would probably fey more buyers
B000SW2EYA|5.0|This is the best show on TV.  Great mix of suspense and humor.  Michael C. Hall's performance is amazing.  This first season explains Dexter's origins while the Miami Police Department is hunting the Ice Truck Killer.
B0098460O4|5.0|This is a very powerful and soulful CD. I am overwhelmed by the talent of these two young people. Thank You Jonathan and Charlotte for giving me peace through your songs. I would recommend this CD to anyone who seeks inner peace.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|The combination of Hugh Laurie who acted in the TV series House and Stephen Fry as Jeeves is a  fabulous combination of comedy. Jeeves the valet to Bertie Wooster, keeps the young man from harms way with old Aunts, women who are seeking husbands and some friends with crazy ideas that include Bertie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books.  I was never much of a Fiction reader, more of a self help kinda reader, however these have to be read.  I just cant put them donw...
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Special effects take first place in this movie, and they are wonderful. But the characters are really just caricatures. So for a couple of hours of rather mindless entertainment, this movie hits the spot. The 3D, by the way, is very well done.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I really love all of Tim Burton's and Johnny Depp's movies, this one is not exception. I love the tragedy, the dark comedy, the picture itself! I streamed it because wanted to see if it was worth for me to buy it and I realized I defenitely want this one in my collection..
B008RZF1UO|5.0|I was very concerned about the future of Kamelot with Roy Kahn's departure. The switching of vocalists is always a scary time for any fan of a band. I can assure you though, Tommy Karevik does an excellent job, and brings many strengths to the table, and keeps Kamelot in the game!<br /><br />The packaging for the Limited Edition is very high quality, consisting of two \\"books\\" of sorts, the poster, and the bonus disc containing instrumental versions and a bonus track. My only complaint is that the discs are in sleeves and could slide out easily if you transporting just the discs rather than the whole package. All the materials feel durable, and look exquisite. The album art is very detailed, and gives a very dark feeling for this album's dark content.<br /><br />The music itself is very clean, and while a new turn for the band, is very much at home in the Kamelot catalog of music. If you've enjoyed the band in the past, this is certainly an album to pick up. If you're new to Kamelot, this is an accessible entry, so go for it!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I love stupid comedy movies and this one is one of my favorite ones! What a cop duo, they are a match made in heaven when it comes to be a not so sharp police men! They are so funny to watch. Watched it on streaming but will buy a bluray copy. A great movie to have a good laugh!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Monster is a very good album , and i think , is better than sonic boom , the tracks 1 to 6 and 8 is like a caterpillar , the others tracks are also good , this line up is solid and play fine , i know Tommy is not Ace ( my guitar hero at teenager time ) but co-write almost all monster songs , like vinnie vincent in lick it up album , he write more good guitar riff , eric is not peter but the drumming is fine and he play the drums better than peter at this time. I hope to kiss add in your concert list 5 songs of Monster album.  Good bass Simmons sound and write 3 great song DEVILS IS ME ,WALL OF SOUND , BACK TO THE STONE AGE , Stanley song SHOUT MERCY AND LONG WAY DOWN , FREAK and HOH Rocks !!!! The album production of Stanley 7 . I wait the new Kiss tour in Italy.........

B00081U6EG|5.0|Hi, this is a great video!  Watched it many times and have showed my friends, they all like it too, something for every taste.  I recomend buying the Blu-ray version of this Music video to get the best sound quality.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Something about this series keeps me interested. Laughed, sighed and flustered...can't wait for the 3rd novel to see how the 2 characters end up as well as a couple others
B009MF56GC|5.0|I went and saw this with my dad shortly after it hit the theater and we loved it!  I very much enjoyed the first Expendables movie, but I would have to say that I enjoyed this one even a little bit better.  I was a bit sad to see Jet Li leave the group, but oh well...it was still an awesome movie!  Haha, and Chuck Norris!  Very cool to see him back in action again!  He even cracks one of his own Chuck Norris jokes in the movie!  LoL!<br /><br />Here's what it boils down to:  If you're seeking a good solid plot in a movie, this movie may not exactly have what you're looking for...much like the first one.  However, if you're looking for a heavy hitting action extravaganza with lots of of shooting and explosions, with a bit of good humor thrown in, then look no further!  These movies are for the die hard action fans, and if you're one of those types, then you'll simply love this movie!<br /><br />In closing, I do have to say that I was not really a big fan of the Asian chick they threw into the movie...I feel the movie would have faired just fine without her.  At the very least, they could have found someone better for the role I think, because I'm sorry to say, the one they added into it just wasn't that great of an actress I felt.  That's just my own personal opinion though.  However, her roles aren't very big in it and it's not enough of a matter to really take away from the enjoyment of this movie for me.  Totally awesome!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|with this app, you can not only download videos from youtube, but you can also download songs! when you download songs, it doesn't give you an album cover picture when it saves to your music, but you can make the title, artist, and album name to which it will save as which is my favorite feature of the app! most all of the youtube download apps that ibhave tried have notbhad that feature. you will most definately love tubemate!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|this deserves 6 stars, it was amazing, close to or better than dark knight rises and certainly better than any of their solo movies. i loved it my friends ( to protect their identities i will not name ) recommended it and we are gonna watch it on my pc in art tommorrow and it will be epic then too. so to sum it up im probabbly spend my hole weekend tommorrow to monday watching up my digital copy of of the avengers untill i am forced to leave. great movie.
B008O037RG|5.0|This album is a great follow up.  It was a bonus to get the free download of the digitized vinyl sound as well.
0399157565|3.0|Patricia Cornwell's twentieth novel in the Kay Scarpetta series opens with the viewing of an online video clip.  This jpg.com clip is difficult to see but appears to be a depiction of the bone bed where the Red Willow and Wapiti Rivers meet in Alberta, Canada.  The video taken from a jet boat also shows a shadowy depiction of what may or may not be a severed human ear.<br />Thus begins THE BONE BED.  A paleontologist named Emma Shubert has disappeared while digging for fossils in the afore-mentioned bone bed.  This bone bed does not appear to have changed much since the cretaceous period and is a big draw for fossil hunters world-wide. The question is why Emma Shubert's disappearance would have any bearing on Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta and her work with the Cambridge Forensic Center in Boston, MA.<br />The video clip in question was e-mailed --- possibly by accident --- to Scarpetta's office.  Kay is already preparing to testify in another trial of a potentially missing woman named Mildred Lott.  Lott's husband, Channing Lott, is the lead suspect in the alleged foul play that may have befallen his wife and Scarpetta's testimony could be crucial.<br />Complicating matters is the discovery of another body --- this one found floating in Boston harbor.  Closer inspection shows the body to be of a mature woman who was apparently tortured and tied down.  Additionally, the body was found tangled to the body of a huge and near-extinct breed of turtle.  Scarpetta and her forensic team must not only extricate the body of the nameless female from the turtle but also deal with the larger ecological and environmental issues they are faced with by the animal activists who are there to defend the still living turtle.<br />The case of the floating Jane Doe makes Scarpetta late for her testimony in the Mildred Lott case.  As it turns out, the evidence she is starting to reveal of the newly discovered body in Boston Harbor may be inextricably tied to both the Mildred Lott disappearance and even the mysterious video clip sent from Canada.  The testimony does not go well as the defense attorney and judge combine to grill Scarpetta on the stand in ways she had never before seen.<br /><br />Patricia Cornwell takes this opportunity to not only make a statement about ecology and animal rights but also directly targets the controversial Melendez-Diaz ruling.  That ruling, which took place in Massachusetts in 2009 claimed it was a violation of Sixth Amendment rights for a prosecutor to submit a chemical drug report without the testimony of the person performing the test.  This ruling impacted forensic specialists nation-wide and fictionally effects Kay Scarpetta's ability to represent her findings (or lack thereof) in the Lott case.<br />As Scarpetta and team, in league with the FBI team led by her husband Benton Wesley, dig deeper into the body of the woman found in Boston Harbor they identify her as a Peggy Stanton.  Further investigation shows that Peggy Stanton and the video clip from Canada both were tied to a fake Twitter Page called `Pretty Please'.  What makes things even more odd is the fact that Scarpetta's long-time friend, Detective Peter Marino, may be tied to Peggy Stanton via an on-line dating site and now has become a potential suspect of the FBI in her murder.<br />Kay Scarpetta must pull out all stops, personally and forensically, to solve all of the mysteries and hopefully clear the name of Marino in the process.  This is not as easy as it seems as she meets resistance at every turn and it looks like the FBI want Marino to take the fall.  What THE BONE BED does best is put the reader directly in the center of an intense forensic investigation that pulls no punches.  Cornwell does this better than any other `forensic' author and somehow continues to keep her characters interesting without having them become a distraction to the mystery or plot-line.  THE BONE BED proves that, even after twenty novels, Scarpetta and company can still deliver a solid page-turner of a thriller.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader
B0087HT36U|4.0|Cool graphics, touch sensitivity is pretty good.  Fun &amp; challenging enough to make me want to get a &quot;perfect&quot; score on each level.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This is a very enjoyable point and click adventure game. great puzzles, almost all of which can be solved without cheating. features an innovative hint system where you collect hidden moths which can be exchanged for one clue per puzzle. if that isn't enough there is a link to the walk through and even a skip puzzle button! i used it to avoid a sliding tile puzzle which i hate. the walk through has too many spoilers, try not to use it.
0316228532|2.0|I was so disappointed.I plodded through boring stuff waiting for something to happen.<br />It finally did in the last chapter.<br />Evan then it wasn't worth waitng for.<br />Did not give me the pleasure I was hoping for<br />I was expecting too much maybe having seen an interview with the author.<br />The interviewer said it made her cry.Well it didn't come close with me<br />.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|It took me a little while to figure out how to organize my information but when I got going it was great.  I have 4 notebooks now, each with a specific title.  One notebook is favorote authors and books.  One notebook has pages with a yr on each page and the important dates and events of that yr ( one is personal and one is for the ranch). I am using it to write the pieces of information that goes on sticky notes.  I have another idea for another Notebook, and I have to go now.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I had several of Barbra's CDs before I bought this one.  It is just as wonderful as all the rest.  She has such an outstanding singing voice that I never get tired of listenging to her songs.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I was pleased that this was unique from the show though, I'm pretty sure this was written before the show came out.<br /><br />This takes it's own path and defines the Dexter character differently. Almost darker. It's a good read. I'm very pleased with it.<br /><br />99% of the time, I'd say a book is better then the show. In this case, I'd say the show and book are on equal footing. Both are wonderful and both have kept me engaged. This is a bow to the TV producers and writers more than it is a knock against the book or its' author.  I expected the book to be good, but not have the show on it's tail.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i kept getting pop ups for this game while playing other games on my kindle. finally i decided to see what all the hype was about and i fell in love. my friend says that the concept  is stupid but i really enjoy the game and its a great way to pass time. fyi i never had to pay for the game or coins. if u dont have skills or patience maybe this isnt the game for you :)
B0068LYEHA|5.0|A reminder why all women should proudly say they are feminists.  Laughed at loud.  I Sent to all my friends.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I delight in Kate Morton's style of writing.  Her character development is intriguing.  The story line from present to past  moves without losing you.<br />When I was notified by Amazon of the publication, the order was immediate.  Upon arrival(Kindle) I commenced to read and finished the next afternoon.  Given a few important activities like sleeping and eating, nothing pertinent was accomplished.  Read this book!  You will enjoy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game on both my ipod touch and my kindle. Breeding rare types is sometimes frustrating but its all part of the game. if it was easy it wouldn't be a challenge. :)

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have always had the KJV and downloaded the free KJV from Amazon on my tablet, but I also wanted to read the Catholic Bible. This is a great one to change up with. Plain English and additional books I am looking forward to studying. God's Word is beautiful, no matter which version you read...
B009ZQBZZE|5.0|I love this series. It's interesting to see the hero go thru his growing pains..i eggink the plot is developing and each character is becoming more dimensional. It's not cheesy and has a serious undertone. however the hero is just a little to batmanesque in personality, all in all i think it's a good solid series and hope there will be more than one season for our hero
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Nice graphics, but no options. I'm a beginner and need options to help me to learn how. I still try, but I'm not sure of what I am doing!
B0062P3392|4.0|When his friend and mentor (Robert De Niro) is caught trying to skip out on a job, ex-mercenary Danny (Jason Statham) is lured out of retirement to take on the task of taking out three ex-SAS mercenaries who assassinated a Sheikh's three sons, so that the Sheikh can regain control of the oil lines he use to own. But with other connected parties all throwing their own agendas into the mix, Danny has more than three tough-as-nails SAS soldiers to worry about.<br /><br />`Killer Elite' is a great, edgy, action-thriller to sit through and delivers a pretty good story with it. Granted, sometimes it relies on coincidences to get characters into a fight and people just `discover' things for our characters to get the plot moving, not to mention, people keep carrying out their plans despite knowing they're being watched, but there's really a lot going on here with the different groups, and characters, all having their own motives for helping or hindering the mission, and so it adds a lot of unexpected twists and tension into the story.<br /><br />The action is largely enjoyable and it's great to see that they tried to keep it all as grounded as they could, this being based on a supposedly true story, there was nothing really over-the-top; just simple, straight-forward, smack-bang action that kept with the realistic, gritty tone of the film.<br /><br />The performances were really good and believable, all the characters felt like they belonged in this dark world; Jason Statham channels...well...Jason Statham into Danny. Clive Owen is appropriately menacing and scary as Spike, Danny's counterpart and Robert De Niro pulls off a role that he can probably do sleeping. Dominic Purcell, Aden Young, Ben Mendelsohn and the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski all capably support the main cast.<br /><br />I only saw the deleted scenes, most I can understand why director Gary McKendry left out, but there were others that, if they had been kept in, would've really helped to explain a few thingsand fleshed out some of the characters a bit more. It was great to see them included here, though.
B00533O0UU|5.0|Fun for the whole family! The game is so addicting and simple, yet different every time you play it! So much fun for any age level!

B005PK553C|5.0|American Horror Story Season 1 is a fantastic series!! I would highly recommend it to appropriate viewing audiences.  The opening tune stuck in my head for weeks.  It was creepy cool.  The actors in season one deserve grand accolades for their performances, especially Jessica Lange.  What a story!
1451695195|5.0|It took Louis Pasteur a lifetime to convince the world of medicine that microscopic invisible things caused disease. My father was a scientist. And I am not only a skeptic, I was a scoffer at all things psychic until I started seeing the future, sometimes. I don't care if you believe it. I have to live with it and explain the unexplained to myself. I started this quest many years ago and am still embarrassed to talk about this kind of stuff.<br /><br />If you are a deeply scientific skeptic, this book will help you a lot. And Alexander's theory of Consciousness is fascinating and a leap forward in understanding so much that science refuses to explain or ignores.<br /><br />If you have any interest at in the world of psychic phenomena, this is a uniquely observed, scientific view of the afterlife. Don't miss this book. It's a must read for anyone who is seriously looking into the paranormal.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|I loved the movie, so after watching it a ton of times, I really wanted to get the soundtrack.  They've done a wonderful job with the music in this by taking ABBA's songs and putting them together and arranging them into one awesome cd.  The only thing I missed on this cd is the song \\"Waterloo\\" that they have on the movie after the credits.  I was looking forward to having that on the cd, but it wasn't there.  Not a huge deal as all the other songs are gold.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the book<br />If u make another one I'm buying it. This book will be great book in the world
0151003084|5.0|The book came in very protective packaging, was brand new and had never been opened. This was a gift for a friend at her baby shower and she adored it.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|I'm not a P!NK fan but this has more than a few listenable tracks.<br /><br />I think [[ASIN:B001I8A76A Funhouse (Explicit)]] was better.
B007Y1JGOY|3.0|I have been following Delain since their release of Lucidity, and somehow, I think my expectations were a bit high. Most people seem to like this album from Delain, but when I really take it apart, it doesn't offer much. When I look at complex bands like Diabulus in Musica, Epica or Amberian Dawn, this CD feels too \\"pop\\" for my taste. In recent metal reviews, it has even been dubbed pop metal. I suppose that fits the bill and meanwhile, I'm not against pop music, I just don't see the evolution of the band either.<br /><br />So, what made this a downfall for me? The songs for one. They don't grab your attention, they are not in your face and after listening to them twice, they just sort of plummet. Epica manages to hold your attention and forces you to listen to each CD over and over again. Delain doesn't do that. In a way, they are too accessible, not ethereal and don't take advantage of vocal talent. They have been trying to market as symphonic metal, but all that's missing are the symphonic elements.<br /><br />Charlotte's vocals are a hit and miss. I think she is talented, has a great voice and clearly has been trained. However, she never wanders out of her comfort zone and doesn't do anything exceptional. Sharon from Within Temptation manages to go from a soprano goddess to a mere devilish vixen in a few seconds. Charlotte just doesn't really get there. It's good, but it could've been great. The absence of a permanent male vocalist also causes this CD to suffer. Delain could really benefit from male vocals, may they be growling (hopefully not) or just singing. Marco Hietala does an excellent job in Nightwish and I feel that Delain could really evolve using a male vocalist.<br /><br />The songs seem to blend together. They are different of course, but after listening to the CD, it just sort of seems I may as well have listened to any number of tracks. If you liked one song on the CD, you could like any of the other ones as well. Sadly, there are no killer riffs, no awesome vocal moments and Delain doesn't set the atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good effort, but it won't make Delain a very exciting band. In order to beat the competition and gain a widespread following, I really feel they need to bring something extra to the table in terms of symphonic metal. Lucidity was epic, April Rain was okay and We Are The Others is tolerable. They are still worth a listen, but I think this CD may get old too fast to remain on my permanent playlist.no awesome vocal moments and Delain doesn't set the atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good effort, but it won't make Delain a very exciting band.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|Pure Brian Wilson genius. It is great to finally hear a studio quality recording of this masterpiece after years of listening to the many poor quality bootlegs floating around. Nothing else to say. Buy it to complete the 60's Rock and Roll journey from 3 chord Fenders to pure brilliance.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|takes a while for the prides to come up. also long time for the coins to refill. relaxing game though.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|glad I downloaded it. lets me know what state my battery is in at all times. also has a history of what your battery's charge has been.
1449410243|3.0|I had totally forgotten I pre-ordered this book a while back, so seeing it in my front porch a few weeks ago simply made my day. Unfortunately, after going through all the pages (finished it in 2 days) I got more and more disappointed. I understand this book is about all cats (unlike The Oatmeal's first book, which covered different topics), but there's only so much about them that you can make fun of before making it repetitive. I'll continue buying books and stuff from The Oatmeal, I just hope he adds more variety to it.<br /><br />Regarding the book itself, the paper is made of a thick high-quality material, with a matte texture. Graphics are good, as you would expect from the Oatmeal. Considering its price, I'd still recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is fun kinda a challenge but fun great follow up to the Oregon trail game I enjoyed as a kid. if ur looking for a way to kill time this is it. the only complaint I have its only ur guy doing stuff the other townsfolk. just stand there giving u tasks

B003EV6DBM|1.0|The individual DVD holders in the box set came apart on first opening the package. The set of DVDs were in reverse order (the first episode DVD was last, the last was first). Two of the discs are unreadable by either my DVD player or my computer. The DVDs are seen as region-free by my computer software, which I find curious. Also, on disc 3, episode 5 is titled \\"Flesh and Sone\\" rather than the correct \\"Flesh and Stone.\\" I put in an inquiry to the shipper (BBM) via Amazon's link and am awaiting a response.

B00992CF6W|5.0|not bad for this early version of minecraft. I play the PC version all the time. I gotta say the game runs smooth on my kindle fire!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|When you're reading somebody's 25th novel -- the 31st of all the books he's written -- you'd be right to expect that he'd gotten the hang of writing. Especially if the guy had already sold more than a quarter of a billion copies of his work. And so it is with John Grisham's fiendishly clever new novel, The Racketeer. It's another winner from a man who's been turning them out for more than two decades.<br /><br />One aspect of Grisham's fiendishness is his capacity to surprise, not just with twists and turns of plot -- he's great at that -- but also by switching gears emotionally. For example, his most recent crime story before The Racketeer was The Litigators. That was a very funny book. The Racketeer isn't (unless you have a tendency to cackle whenever a crook outsmarts the FBI). Grisham's spare, no-nonsense style varies little, but he has a rare gift to make the most improbable characters both credible and likable. But no matter how sly and underhanded, his  leading characters are almost always guys (or gals) in white hats.<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister is Grisham's protagonist here. Bannister is a hapless small-town attorney in Virginia who seems to have lost his white hat. He's about halfway through an unjustified ten-year sentence in the Federal pen for violating the RICO act -- yet another brilliant example of the FBI's manipulation of that misbegotten law. He is 43, a former Marine, African-American, and wicked smart. Oh, and has he got a yen to get even with the FBI!<br /><br />Suffice it to say that, at the outset, this book's title is ironic. By the end it's anything but ironic. And all the fun lies in how Bannister gets there. If you can guess how he does it before the plot fully unfolds, you're a better person than me.<br /><br />By the way, another of Grisham's tendencies is to show off his liberal, reformist side, and The Racketeer is no different in that respect. Here, he takes on the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Prepare to be horrified.
B008OOYALE|5.0|great app I was dissapointed when I found out that dragonvale wasn't on the amazon appstore but then I found this app and its just like it and all of the dragons can be received through breeding unlike in dragonvale

B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie was not the best I've seen but it was scary and thrilling.<br />I would give this a pretty good rating and I would tell other movie watchers to<br />see this one.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its fun and I would recommend this game it for everyone. one of the better city building games on the kindle
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Am a late bloomer, didn't know of Leonard until I heard \\"I'm Your Man\\" that was sung in a movie. Was attracted to his voice immediately. Saw him on PBS, Live in London, so ordered CD through Amazon. I listened to him when he was younger but like fine wine in aging his voice is better than ever. Like most of the songs but some lyrics I could do without. Wanting Stalin back, no.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Saw the movie with my 5 year old gran daughter, we both loved it.  She asked for the movie and I bought it

B0053O89XI|5.0|We've been watching the Big Bang Theory since the 1st episode. The humor ranges from silly to slapstick to cerebral -  often in each episode. The Blu-ray collections are a good way to share the fun with your \\"un-initiated\\" family and friends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Compared to \\"50 Shades\\" trilogy, this book series is far superior.  Much better writing and the books are hard to put down.  I recommend these books very highly.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I don't read fiction or science fiction all that often, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was especially enjoying all the 80s pop culture references at first and then I started to think \\"ok enough already\\", but after I thought about it more it made sense to keep hammering away at the pop culture references because the characters were steeped in that culture and in knowing and learning everything they could about that time period.  The hunt simply demanded that you knew your 80s culture and so that's what made the story work.  I was pretty excited that I figured out the second key location on my own and for better or worse, I'm encouraged to play a bunch of video games I haven't seen or played in ages!  Can't wait for the movie! :)
0345803485|3.0|Well I heard the talk about this book... so I bought it... sadly I had read the story before.... it was on fanfiction.net and was a twilight fanfiction... Still decent. just not really original...

0425263908|5.0|Ok so I've read the fifty shades of hray trilogy and the first two books of the cross fire trilogy. and I must say I love crossfire more than gray.<br /><br />a lot of people will bash me for it but go ahead. here is why.... first off FSOG is a fan fiction!!! i don't care what anyone says!!! I found it when I was prego and loved it. it was Edward and Bella in a new light! all the publishing company did was change the names. second FSOG has no real character development!! who would need it?? it was a fanfiction, everyone who read the twilight books knew how the characters grew.<br /><br />now as for why I love the cross fire series.... its simple. its a masterpiece! the characters grow and learn and the story keeps you guessing. sure I see the resemblence between the two... but Ms.Day's book is wonderful and I would recommend the crossfire series before fifty shades. because this should have been the book to captivated the world.<br /><br />I'm not going to say anything else.... but if you liked fifty shades... read the crossfire books (with an open mind and heart) you will love it... and I hope you'll see what I see.
0786868694|3.0|I decided to buy this book after watching the show (also called nigella bites) which showed delicious recipes. I think not all of the recipes from the show are here because i have watched several episodes and they're not here. Anyways some recipes are quite good and delicious, the pictures from the book are ok( not as wonderful as bill granger's or jamie oliver's) if you plan on buying this book i recommend you to better watch the show and have a notepad and pen with you so you can write down the recipes.
1407586890|5.0|To coincide with the Blu Ray release of \\"The Lion King\\" Disney released this wonderful hardcover book based on the movie. The story tells the story of how Simba became the Lion King after the tragic death of his father whom he loved more than anything in the world.<br /><br /> The story, like the film, was really the first animated movie to address the death of a loved one from the child's perspective and it is heart warming, heart felt and touching.<br /><br /> The pictures are taken from film stills from the movie.<br /><br /> An A+ book and not just for children but for all who enjoy this timeless classic.
0062127241|5.0|I always thought Townshend was an interesting character. This book describes growing up in a \\"shell-shocked\\" Britain and its affect the next generation of youth and their music. Not unlike the experiences of Keith Richards, whose autobiography I read a few months earlier.
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|\\"Halloween 5\\" was released in 1989 on a budget of $3,000,000 and eventually made close to $12,000,000 at the North American box office. Still most fans and critics hated \\"Halloween 5\\" as the horror genre of the 1980's began to wane as people were getting tired of the same stories being featured in \\"Halloween\\", \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" and \\"Friday the 13th's\\" franchises. By 1989 the horror and good writing fell to the wayside as studios simply wanted to draw in the box office crowd to make money.<br /><br /> In this outing Michael Myers, again, returns to town to do some killing. Not much is new here in terms of plot, but the death sequences are mind-blowing and the finale original.
0199601348|1.0|While this book certainly has alot of information, it is a pain to read.  The author takes the approach of describing ancient Greece with each chapter being devoted to a specific city (polis). That approach makes sense, but the whole thing reads too much like a text book rather than a simple, short introduction to the topic.  For me, I want a 'Very Short Introduction' to be a pleasant, easy reading experience to give me a high-level understanding of the topic- and then I can decide if I want to delve deeper.  The author just seems to try to cram too much into this.

B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Excellent film, with great acting by Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain. Their performances are so real and believable, you feel like you are in the presence of real people, not actors. This movie is basically a study of the onset of paranoid schizophrenia, but it is much more than that. It is a film about acceptance, love, and family support in the face of the most devastating mental illness. The ending has a lot of viewers confused, angry, and frustrated. The negative reviews reflect a lack of understanding of how the mentally ill view the world, and the ending makes total sense to me. Without giving it away, let me just say that it involves acceptance of what is real to the main character. Great movie, highly recommended.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|From start to finish I couldn't put this book down. The way the story unfolds keeps you wanting to read.
B008M721MS|5.0|this serves is rally great. I love talking to family and friends on it. Its great when i am out of town for work and dont get to see family.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I truly loved The Name of the Wind, the first volume of this series.  It was engaging and extremely well written.  The connectedness was outstanding, and loose ends were tied up nicely.  About 1/4 into The Wise Man's Fear, I started to notice some sloppiness.  Some of this was editor/copywriter sloppiness, but some of it was author sloppiness.  I feel like this book was not as well composed.  It was still engaging as heck--I raced through it in a week, and I can say that it was a good read.  But it was also frustrating to notice the flaws, especially considering the carefully crafted nature of book 1.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|It isn't often that I can go and listen to an entire album without at least somewhat wanting to skip songs. This is a collection that I listen to over and over again and somehow still am not tired of. (Okay, there are a few songs getting overplayed on the radio, but they're still good.)<br />It's very much a positive, feel-good album which everyone could use once in a while.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This series from the beginning is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ! It's raw, imaginative, look back at a time in history filled with all passion, blood, sex and intense human emotions. Its filled with action, exotic sexuality and villians....
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I didn't expect to laugh nearly as much as I did. The short stories integrated into the base comic were fantastic, particularly Bob Cats.
0385366752|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I looked forward to every session listening to it (the audiobook). Smart, sharp writing. I will definitely look for more from this author! I had it for a book group and all (mostly) enjoyed it!

B0083P1QUM|2.0|A little disappointing!  Similar to last book - too much \\"pick on Scarpetta\\" and not enough forensic story. Always look forward to new Scarpetta books, but not anymore.  Enjoyed the first few books more.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Was an exciting book and hard to stop reading after starting. Makes you anxious for the next in the series to be released.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book that I literally did not want to put down.  Well, the streak is over, thanks to Wool by Hugh Howey. (The edition I read is subtitled Omnibus because it was originally a collection of self-published stories that have been put together.)<br /><br />Case in point: doing the elliptical for 30 minutes at the gym is usually a half-hour of boredom made bearable only by the selection of music on my mp3 player.  But I forgot my earphones yesterday, so decided to continue reading \\"Wool\\" instead.<br /><br />Normally I have a hard time staying focused on reading material when I'm exercising...but not only did I stay focused, the 30 minutes evaporated in no time!<br /><br />\\"Wool\\" is the kind of book for which you really need to set aside some uninterrupted time...else you'll be staying up way past your bedtime.<br /><br />So what it's about?<br /><br />An entire city of people (I don't think Howey ever specifies just how many) lives in an underground silo that reaches some 140 floors down into the earth.<br /><br />They carry on their lives--schools, jobs, religion, marriage, childbirth, entertainment--in this shelter.  Their only knowledge of the outside world is that breathing its toxic air would destroy them.<br /><br />Talking about the outside, even speculating about it, is a punishable offense.  The worst offenders are sent to \\"cleaning\\"-basically, their death.  (I'll let you find out about that for yourself.)<br /><br />But when a curious IT tech finds some secret information about the history of the silo, it sets off a chain of events that kick this engrossing tale into high gear really quick.  In fact, the first page had me hooked.<br /><br />The stairs<br /><br />With life taking place on so many floors--the \\"uptop,\\" the \\"mids\\" and the \\"down deep\\"--the stairway becomes a focal point of the story.  A trek from the top to the bottom could take quite a while, could even require an overnight stay at a halfway point.<br /><br />I have to admit that I had to wonder, with silo life so perfectly planned and regulated, why whoever designed the silo didn't provide for elevators!<br /><br />But I think another blogger, Janyaa, expresses her thoughts about the stairs perfectly:<br /><br />\\"I love how Howey incorporates the stairs into the story. They become a test of will, a graceful arc of hope, or potential for despair. Not only is it the tie that connects the levels together, but it's also the gravity that keeps them apart. A barrier and a link. The very DNA of the silo's civilization.\\"<br /><br />The characters<br /><br />While life in the silo--and the speculation about what is really outside it--are fascinating, it's the characters that really make the story.<br /><br />My favorite is Juliette, who has all the attributes of a good heroine--courage, integrity, and feistiness.

B008966SLM|5.0|Robert Cray and the band continue to make the blues sound as good as ever. There is even some social messages via Big Old House which does not go overboard. The live version of You Belong to Me shows how tight the band are with Jim Pugh giving the Hammond organ an almighty rip. Bravo
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The second in the trilogy is just as good as the first.  Now the characters are so vivid I think I know them...I want to know them personally.  Now there are some sections which are a little bulky to get through but overall it was excellent.  Can't wait for the final book!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the first I play every night- and the last I play before going to sleep.  At first I thought it was kind of boring but I got hooked. It is just like the carnival penny game but this game is a lot less exspensive!!!  LOL
B004FUZLYG|5.0|I agree completely with the enthusiastic reviews here - this is a terrific recording.  I love Scott Ross's and Christophe Rousset's recordings on the harpsichord and, after a long search, I am delighted finally to have found a performance of Scarlatti on the piano which I really like.<br /><br />These pieces form a small selection from Scarlatti's huge output of well over 500 keyboard sonatas.  They are very well chosen to give an excellent variety, from the energetically vigorous to the deeply contemplative and the programme as a whole is very rewarding.  It is Tharaud's playing, though, which makes this disc something special.  He uses the piano's expressive ability to bring out all the depth and nuance in the music with just enough rubato and dynamic variation to show exactly what Scarlatti means in each sonata without using over-emotional gestures which obscure the music and overlay it with misplaced romanticism.  His ornamentation is similarly beautifully judged.<br /><br />This is, I think, exemplary playing of Baroque music on a modern piano.  With lovely recorded sound, good notes and attractive presentation this is an excellent disc all round.  It has been a revelation to me and has become a firm favourite.  Very warmly recommended.
0307895475|5.0|I enjoy using this game guide but I think It might be even better if there were a kindle version. I have to have this sitting on my lap as I play and it gets awkward at times.
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|I bought this solely because it was ad-free, hoping it would be similar to the free version I had been using.  On my Kindle Fire, 1st generation, it was very hard to see, thus making it unenjoyable to play.  Uninstalled after an hour or two.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I am a Taylor Swift fan and I have all of her CDs.  This new CD is good but it ISN'T country by any means.  At least her other CDs sounded country but Red is Pop music all the way.  I am a little disappointed but other than that it is a good CD.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is fun and you will be a pro in no time at all! I hope everyone enjoys this app as much as I do.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Very good read . I saw the movie and wanted a little more. The book satisfied my curiosity about what the characters were thinking and feeling.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|my grand kids loved this movie and have watched it several times in last few days..movie was well put together
B009AJD5E0|2.0|It wasn't that good. I expected a lot more than i got. Kind of boring and suspense that led to nothing. Pretty much made a new alien movie, but a bad one.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|forgot what a great movie this is, classic in my book, sit back and enjoy this one  again and again, Love the fact this is based a true story, your mind really is a beautiful thing

B0063IH60K|4.0|I would give 5 stars but hate the ads. Good app though, enjoy the play. Easy choices for play options.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing!  There is so many plot twists and it keeps you on your feet. I read this in less than two days because it was so great
B008GOAEW6|5.0|This is one of my first Analog Productions / Quality Record Pressings releases and it is actually worth the $50.  The quality of the vinyl they use is just leaps and bounds over some of the other supposed \\"Audiophile\\" 180g/200g LPs.  I have been purchasing a fair amount of new vinyl lately and I was really surprise how many albums come out of the sleeve with surface scratches and little bits of paper and dust from the sleeve.  Not here, they use a nice static free and scratch resistant sleeve and the record was clean as could be.<br /><br />The Analog Productions remastering of this album is just awesome.  I have heard this on digital and I have to say the analog version is just so much more realistic.  A+ all around and I will be buying more albums from this remastering/pressing duo.
0061122416|5.0|I first read this book several years ago, and have read it again at least once a year ever since.  It continues to enlighten me, reminding me of what I learnt in previous readings, and finding something new every time I read it.  I always keep spare copies as I often give them to friends and people I meet who are struggling to find their path in life.  I find it inspirational and helps me focus on what is really important in life.
0385535147|2.0|I've read all Grisham's books - and look forward to the next.  Racketeer, was not worth waiting for.  It reads like a \\"Mission Impossible\\" plot.  I'm disappointed.  It's not up to his usual standards.
B00992CF6W|5.0|All it needs more before I will be totally obsessed with it are pistons, minecarts, boats, pressure plates, and servers for multiplayer.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This movie is now a beautiful part of my movie collection, and I only collect movies I can never stop watching. I watched this movie 10 times the first day I got it!
B000002VSN|4.0|This cd was like new. In the original case. I was impressed & with the shipment time Thanks Tlove :]
B0077SGMXM|5.0|If I see a game by Noodlecake studios I am assured that it is a fun game and well worth checking out.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Do do do do I love this app so dang much. It has monsters. I think its creative. Very fun.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|a lot of puzzles with a variety of difficulty. hidden objects were great. thoroughly enjoyed this game. well worth the money
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use and many great features make this a must have app.  I highly recommend it.  There are so many options to customize how you wake up.  I especially like the feature that resets the alarm automatically but allows you to select what days of the week it plays.  All in all, an excellent app.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game and the first one. some puzzles were easy and some were difficult it was a thoroughly engaging game. worth the money
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. My only complaint is the way it ended...leaves me hanging,and waiting for the next one!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you can remember the 80's, love gaming, music and the internet, this is the book for you.  Order a copy today, you wont be disappointed!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really love this game but when I try to get into the store it forces a close :( It was 5stars until this happened :(
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast read.....I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.  I loved every minute of it
B006ICOK00|1.0|I bought this camera for a very specific mission.<br />We were building a house in another city and I wanted to set this up to remotely take pictures of the house as it was being built.  I built a weather proof enclosure for it with a Lexan front lens and set it up at the right distance, configured the camera with no problems.  It took pictures for about 10 days and then as evidenced by its own capture the lens just slowly starts to move and over the course of about 2 hours just falls off the camera.<br />The wide angle lens snaps to the camera with a cheap trinket style magnetic ring and the magnetic ring is only attached to the camera lens by some even cheaper glue and apparently the glue after 10 days just decided to slip loose form the camera lens.  I read a similar comment in a review before I bought this camera but I ignored it.  Big mistake.  If you decide to ignore my reviews please only use it for close images where the wide angle lens is not needed or only if you can check on it frequently.<br />I was not able to due to the distance so I lost the first 4 weeks of the construction which was the most dramatic in terms of the building coming up out of the ground.  I can never go back and get that so I am extremely unhappy with this product.  If I could still return it and get my money back I would definitely do so.<br />Unfortunately if you are looking there are not really many other cameras that will run user controlled time lapse unattended for long periods of time.  Camera quality in High Res mode is only 1240 x 780 and should be a lot higher.  I also bought the 32 GB SD card which really wasn't necessary because four weeks of capture every 10 minutes only occupied about 137 MB.<br />I would of appreciated a much better user guide too to give me some guidelines on settings.  The guide leave a lot to be desired for example you can choose AVI frame rate but they give no hints as to the impact it has to storage needs or final movie quality.
B005KELW26|5.0|Works well with the kindle fire, good looking for either gender,  love the color and texture, would recommend it to all
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book and I cannot wait to read the next one. It was hard to put it down and disappointing when it was over because I just wanted to keep finding out what was going to happen with these characters.
0061733199|5.0|Borrowed this book and will go back and get the paperback. Excellent information on survival that everyone can learn from. I just put a copy into our disaster survival kit.[...]
0345803485|2.0|I had heard so much about these books...so downloaded it to my Kindle.<br />Just wow...I mean...how many times is she going to talk about Anna is biting her lip...and her inner Goddess....and she was a Virgin...but comes at the drop of a hat?<br />And the story lines??  Come on...at the ripe old age at 22...she has every man after her...people trying to kill her...all while having orgasm after orgasm with her billionaire bf.<br />I was so sick of hearing how she was soooo mad at him for spending money on her...and how shy and easily she blushes...and how every woman wants her man...I could go on and on.<br />Good on her for writing a best seller...I'm just trying to figure out how it happened with those 3 books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it its easy and fun buy it if you don't your super dumb.its easyer than eating a tiny cake or cupcake
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Great movie, Johnny Depp did it again. Laughs for everyone in the family. Dark Shadows was a great favorite in my family years ago, so I hope there's more to see.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|It worked for only a few days and then started a \\"stop and move/on and off\\" mode. Even I hold it on my hand and shake it, it may not be moving. To me, it is not Seiko's quality supposed to be. I am going to return it.
B0082A3HTQ|4.0|After reading the book, I could visualize this soundtrack and where it is played in the movie. Can't wait for the movie to be released in America.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the best version of majong in the appstore yet.  Majong Deluxe hd free is the same thing as the paid one!
B00979CS50|5.0|So the Neil Young catalog could fill a record store and I end up buying them all but some of them lately have had that meandering quality of a great artist cruising through the motions so Crazy Horse is back in the Neil Young saddle again and has it been that long?  I suppose it has and then I buy this one and about choke.  A 27 minute song to start the album called Driftin' Back. Geez.  Am I effing senile or what?  Did he stumble over an old Tull album in his attic?  And there another one is!  16 minutes!  Yep!  I'm senile. (My head starts playing Prairie Wind and thinking about the riff dragging out for almost a half hour.  I have been hit by car in down in the 5th level of hell. Yep, and when that song is over, guess what?  It starts playing again!!<br /><br />Ha.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a beautiful work of guitar nirvana that belongs right at the top of his thousand or so albums.  I managed to listen to it twice in one day.  Every song.  (I don't do such a thing anymore.  Of the last ten albums I've downloaded there are about four songs on each one of them I haven't even heard yet.  I've only heard 3 on the David Byrne Weird chick album so far..It's the state of shuffling music into irrelevancy I suppose...)<br /><br />I can't think of a better song the great Mr. Young has written than Walk like a Giant.  It's has a grungy bludgeoning rhythm to it that ranks as one of his best riffs ever and interweaves whistling over it.  Lord, it is the most incredible 16 minute song ever.  And even the last four minutes are perfect as it sounds like for 12 minutes the pile has been driven deep into the earth and the ending is the odd compelling sound of trying to pound its way back out.<br />I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Only Neil Young when I think about it could write a relevant 27 minute song that keeps you listening for 27 minutes. Driftin' Back is almost as brilliant as Walk like a Giant.  Together these two songs are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The rest of the album is not filler but quality Crazy Horse and Neil jamming out quality tunes as good as anything they have ever done.  If not better.<br /><br />To survive what he's survived and have such an influence every decade and produce this pill?  Genius.  Pure and simple.<br /><br />(I have no clue what file format he's pushing that makes MP3s sound like plastic toy instruments from a dime store, but I'll bet he's right...)the price of admission.<br /><br />The rest of the album is not filler but quality Crazy Horse and Neil jamming out quality tunes as good as anything they have ever done.

B007FG9LIE|2.0|A good easy to read book but a bit dissapointing in content.  A bit too unbeleivable.  I was expecting a different story after I read the sample.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Great graphics but slow loading of the individual puzzles. I don't like the slide menus as it ruins the flow of the game.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was the best.  My husband and I laughed and laughed at some of the scenes.  Many of the actors we truly loved and the plot for the movie was priceless.  We were recommended to see it by a cousin and we are so glad that we did and we truly recommend it to others.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like \\"Fifty shades\\" you will like \\"Bared to you\\" and \\"Reflected in you\\" too.<br />It is better written than \\"Fifty shades\\", and i look forward to the last book.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game is fun but it might be more interesting if there were some definitions and explanation of how to get enough points to level ul.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|awesome series, lots of suspense and great acting.  definitely worth watching both the past and current seasons.  it really shows the nature of the terrorist threat
B002VRZEYM|5.0|It really is pretty simple, this is not in any way to say the many decisions we all make every day, and all the factors that bring that meal to your table is simple, but at it's heart the question why we eat what we eat and why is it that way. The next step we must take to evolve as global community makes this film is an excellent education to go in that direction, thank you \\"Food INC\\" for this film.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|I only read JG he seems to research every book and if he continues to write them just like this one and the others I will always read them as long as Mr Grisham keeps up the intrigue and the don't want to put it down factor thank you very much JG
B000065KIA|2.0|This is a great movie, although I am only giving it two stars because this particular DVD had captioning. When I placed the order it did not say there would be captioning the whole entire movie. I got used to it as the movie went on, but it was still very annoying. I checked the settings on the dvd player and it wasn't the player. Please note I bought this as a used DVD and it was so cheap I didn't bother complaining or returning it. I guess if I watch it again I'll have to get used to the captioning again.
B005XI4WFS|5.0|What can I say? I am totally in love with American Horror Story! Very suspenseful show with incredible actors. The new season is great also!!

B008QE9XD2|2.0|I waited for a long time to see this movie and finally rented it on Halloween, even though I had a copy being mailed to me. If you are waiting for this movie to relate to the old t.v. series, you will be highly disappointed. This movie, unfortunately, follows the same route as the remake of \\"The Stepford Wives.\\" It takes a horror classic and makes it into over the camp comedy movie. Now the original Dark Shadows did have unintentional humor in it but the actors all took their roles seriously. In this movie, this is not the case. The best peroformances do come from Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer. Eva Green makes a good Angelique. Helena Bonham Carter looks like Grayson Hall but that is it. She acts nothing like Grayson Hall, but in all fairness, who can. The relationship between Barnabas and Dr. Hoffman from the series is nonexisting here. The actress, who plays Carolyn, looks like a child than the spoiled pre-Paris Hilton bitch, that Nancy Barrett played her years ago. Other disappointments, Maggie Evans, Victoria Winters and Josette are all one person. Also, the cameo scene with Jonathan Frid, his last performance before he died, he really did this time,LOL, David Selby, Lara Parker and Kathryn Leigh Scott is so fast that you can miss them with a blink of an eye. The Roger Collins character should have just been left out of the movie because it was wasted. Any Johnny Depp's acting is always good but this will be a heartbreak to people, who want it to be like the original series. I wouldn't have bought this movie, if knew it was going to be this bad.

B009Z8HPYM|4.0|I was lucky enough to catch Neil Young and Crazy Horse at the Austin City Limits Music Festival this year, where I saw him perform many of these songs live.  I had kind of written off Neil Young in recent years.  His last album with Crazy Horse, \\"Greendale\\", wasn't very good.  His solo albums after that were a mixed bag.  I didn't even bother to listen to \\"Americana\\" since I had heard such negative things about it, and the 90 second samples didn't impress me at all.<br /><br />But then...I caught that ACL gig and was totally blown away.  This was the very first time I had heard any of the new songs from \\"Psychedelic Pill.\\"  These songs rocked.  With a music festival featuring over a hundred bands, Neil was the loudest, hardest-rocking band that I heard that whole weekend.  After hearing \\"Walk Like a Giant\\", with what seemed like and endless amount of feedback at the end, was a revelation!  Neil Young and Crazy Horse are the only band I know that can turn feedback into an art form.  After that set at ACL, I told myself \\"Okay..I have got to get this album.\\"<br /><br />For the most part, it lived up to my expectations.  The opening two songs, \\"Driftin' Back\\" and \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" (which make up the first 31 minutes) are classic NY&CR.  Even \\"Driftin' Back\\", with lyrics that attack MP3's by saying that \\"you only get 5%\\" still rocks in its MP3 form.  Unfortunately, this is the way most of us listen to music now.<br /><br />\\"Ramada Inn\\" and especially \\"Born in Ontario\\", in my opinion, are the weakest songs on the album.  \\"Ramada\\" sounds like an outtake from \\"Greendale\\" and \\"Born in Ontario\\" sounds like a throwaway track.<br /><br />\\"Walk Like a Giant\\" is the highlight of the album and can easily fit alongside other great NY war-horses like \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" \\"Down by the River,\\" and \\"Like a Hurricane.\\"<br /><br />Overall, a great return-to-form for Neil and Crazy Horse.  Be sure to get out see them live while you still have a chance.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|A lot of shows have the same concept, but not this one. I am completely hooked on this series! Love it!

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a Reacher fan and was alarmed by the huge number of negative reviews. Since I was expeting the worst I found that the book  was not that bad.  It's a bit slow and it lacks some action, but I just love the character.<br />Please, Mr. Child, get Reacher to Virginia already!
1402760663|5.0|I thought I knew more than a little bit of early american history and the western expansion, but I had no idea of the systematic lies, deceit, trickery and outright theft from the American government. A fabulous read of events from the continously broken treatys, to the brutalizion and starvation of the native peoples. The fact that any survived is a true testement of their strength and willpower and I, as an american am embarressed and saddened of our governments treatment of these culturally rich and proud people.

0062127241|3.0|A definitive history of The Who has yet to be written and Townshend's book is not it. That is not a slam against this rock icon and The Who's creative force, but merely a recognition that this book is by Pete Townshend and it is about Pete Townshend. As such, The Who is largely the backdrop against which much of the drama of Pete's life unfolds.  But fans looking for insight into the personalities that made up the four distinct members of the band or the dynamics that drove it will be somewhat disappointed with this book. That said, fans familiar with The Who will find much here to flesh out their understanding of the its turbulent history: Pete obviously kept extensive journals during much of his tenure with The Who and is able to give deep insight into his thoughts and motives at crucial times during the band's creative arc. But stories about the other three members are decidedly minimal. Most surprising, given their public squabbles over the years, is Pete's obvious and genuine respect and love for Roger Daltrey. Keith Moon wanders into the narrative from time to time, usually amid the smoke and rubble of serious mayhem (of his own making, of course). John Entwhistle, however, is largely a fading ghost hovering in the shadows at the far end of the sitting room.<br />  All of that duly noted, any rock fan will enjoy Who I Am: Townshend is an astute observer and unsparing when it comes to relating his own shortcomings and failings. There are lots of funny stories, and compelling memories from someone who was lucky enough to be at absolute ground zero at the height of Swinging London: Townshend -- literally - had front-row seats and watched  with a discerning eye as a cavalcade of rock icons learned their chops, developed as artists and went on to super-stardom. The Beatles, The Stones, Clapton, Page and Hendrix are all here -- and one gets the sense that even as a teenager Townshend sensed that he was in the presence of greatness and understood the eventual historical import of the acts and events he was witnessing. On top of that, Townshend's personal narrative is compelling: His journey from tortured childhood to aspiring artist to conflicted pop star to drunken rock super-star makes for a story is nothing short of astounding at times.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Good app.  Reader works very well and is easy to use.  Plenty of titles to chose from including many free ones.  I am very satisfied.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Rugged, stylish, and more than adequate for the task at hand. I like the fact that it isn't black.I also like the elastic strap that keeps it closed. In my opinion, it is well worth the price for its functionality.

B000069AUI|1.0|I have trouble listening to this album. It is so boring. I chuckle every time I hear someone call this the greatest album of all time. Really the only decent track is \\"Clocks.\\"<br /><br />If you are trying to choose an album from Coldplay to buy, go straight to X&Y, then Viva, then Parachutes or Mylo. Avoid this dud.
0425263916|5.0|After reading the first book,I couldn't wait for the sequel due to the ending. I was a big fan of Eva and her roommate Cary.I know fans will not be happy when I say in book one,Bare To You the alpha male Gideon Cross did not interest me much. After reading Reflected In You that changed. There was so many plot turns and twists that I didn't realize that I was wrong about this man and his relationship to Eva and her friend. The end really blew me away and once again wanting more! Please rush the next book to print!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Unlike every other Mission Impossible other than the first, Ghost Protocol just works, The mixture of spectacle, drama and humour works perfectly. Simon Pegg was a good choice as comic relief and Tom Cruise playing the straight man to him works wonderfully. The addition of Jeremy Renner added to the mix and how he plays off Pegg and Cruise works really good as well, his annalist way of questioning and critiquing everything Cruise does really helps the plot along, and the last piece of the puzzle Paula Patton rounds out the cast really well.<br /><br />It is a fun popcorn action flick that you won't be able to help yourself from watching again and again.
B008VNIA32|1.0|I compared the blu-rays I received today to Kultur's DVD issue from last year. There is a tiny improvement in the video resolution that is insignificant, at least on the upconverting Oppo bdp-93. I could hear no difference in the audio, at least not in the stereo track. I have a very revealing high-end stereo setup. There was also no difference in the audio when heard through a Benchmark DAC1 PRE and Sennheiser 600's.<br /><br />The initial Kultur DVD issue had a defect in the stereo track of most of act III of Siegfried, which Kultur later corrected. The Siegfried blu-ray seems to have a different kind of problem in the act III stereo track. The Siegfried blu-ray stereo audio track in acts I and II is significantly lower level than the other operas. In act III the volume goes suddenly up so much that you cannot go on listening with the same volume as in acts II and I; you have to turn the volume down significantly. In other words, acts II and I are too quiet and act III too loud. In addition the act III stereo track sounds different even after correcting levels. There is more reverb, the sound is much more forward and the overall timbre is different and more aggressive and unpleasant than acts II and I. It's clear that the act III stereo track is from a different source than the other two acts and is of a lower quality. When I compared the Siegfried blu-ray stereo audio track with the Siegfried DVD, the replacement DVD Kultur sent me for act III of Siegfried has a stereo track that is the same level as the other two acts, but all three acts on the DVD sound more like the lower quality audio on the act III of the blu-ray, but not quite as strident.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />Update:I wrote Kultur about this issue, and this is the response I got on 11/13/12:<br /><br />Dear Mr. Eitan,<br /><br />We received your e-mail regarding the stereo audio on Act III of the Siegfried disc from the Wagner Blu-ray set.<br /><br />When we released this on standard DVD, there was a problem in the master tape where partially through Act III the audio changed from stereo to mono.<br />It was corrected by using the audio track from Warner's original DVD released years ago.<br /><br />And to avoid the same problem for the Blu-ray, the same audio track was used.  So yes, it was from a different source.<br />The volume level can obviously be changed by the viewer, but as far as the other things you mentioned such as reverb, or being more \\"forward\\", the only way that could be changed is if it were re-mixed somehow.  Unfortunately, we don't have any access to the multiple track audio to do that.<br /><br />I also wanted to let you know that there are no problems with the two surround sound tracks in Dolby 5.1 or in DTS if you have the ability to listen to it that way.<br /><br />Should you want a refund, you may contact...released this on standard DVD, there was a problem in the master tape where partially through Act III the audio changed from stereo to mono.<br />It was corrected by using the audio track from Warner's original DVD released years ago.<br /><br />And to avoid the same problem for the Blu-ray, the same audio track was used.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I liked this, it moved along, but there was just something lacking.  It was worth reading since I love the characters, but wasn't as good as past awesome novels....
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it!!! my pinterest on the go! i cant remember  anything negative about the app. keep up the good work guys!!
B00866H7SS|4.0|Sylvia Day&#60;----- Excellent arthor. Bared to you is extremely well written with realistic characters that make you fall in love. This book is sophisticated, provacative and very erotic ;) If you liked fifty shades of grey ( which i did) then you will love bared to you ! The two main charcters- Eva is so strong with a difficult past. She stand for what she believes and isnt one to back down. She is a smart and sassy character with a jealous side=)<br />Gideon Cross is an adonis. He is swoon worthy. He is billionaire who when he sees something he wants he goes for it. But of course Cross is battling his own demons from his past. His emotional angst is so compelling and heart wretching. These two characters are so passionate and create such scorching love scenes. This sexually charged book will keep you hooked from page one. Once you start reading this book you wont be able to put it down. You have been forwarned. I highly recommend it =)
B008OOYALE|4.0|The visual graphics are quite good, and I enjoy the variety in dragons. However, on my kindle fire,  for a long time I couldn't access the goals.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I'm obsessed with this one now! love it! great game options! another great game from team lava! thanks for creating this game. have fun playing!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|thank yo uso much for the movie! fast shipping! excellent packaging. I really appreciate fast service and<br />I got in time for the weekend.. I want to catch up so i can see all of the twilight movies
1603427244|3.0|It was something I already knew but revisited....will give to someone as gift.  I should have ordered basic knitting steps....so will do so in future.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book seemed to have more substance in the story-line than the first. I enjoyed that it was steamy and yet not as over-kill as the first one seemed to me, at times.<br />In this part of the trilogy, I was on the edge of my seat more often!<br />Good read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just love it and It also has audio if I am busy I can listen, so There is no excuse not to have the bible in my life every day.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|You know how you buy a game with great reviews and it's lame? This is NOT that game. Visually beautiful and so fun! It has 40 levels plus a few bonuses. I wondered before I bought it. They are short, so it might be a pretty short game (depending on how difficult it gets). The only thing I'd change is that one music track that sounds like chipmunks yodeling--terrible!! but just hit the restart button and you get other music. Otherwise pretty perfect. :)
B001LF347E|5.0|I absolutely love this show and has watched seasons 1-4 several times already. I can't get enough of the well-rounded characters, the storyline of King Arthur, Merlin, Genevieve, and Camelot. I mean this show has it all, Knights of the round table, sorcery, black magic, flying dragons, and many other creatures that goes bump in the night. The writing is awesome, and the show never fails to draw me in week after week dying to know what happened next. I cannot say this about very many shows today. Merlin is now going into it's fifth (5th) season and it still has me wanting to see more of it, hoping that it won't ever end. I was never really into Harry Potter, Legend of the Seeker, or Games of Thrones (which is pretty good)but Merlin is in a league all by itself and I'm loving every minute of it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is a good way to pass by time and it is sooo much fun to play
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Different movie from my normal fare. I liked the location and concept of older people wanting more in their lives. Of course great actors along with their acting made this enjoyable.
B0047VSW30|2.0|Apparently, the point of this movie was to warn against the dangers of unfettered religious fanaticism and not to convey an historically accurate tale of the philosopher Hypatia.  The setting is in the early years following the edict of Milan that would eventually lead to the acceptance of Christianity as the Roman state religion.  However, the Christian bishops of this movie are not portrayed as the neo-Platonic philosophers they tended to be but as something more akin to modern Fundamentalist extremists.  Such anachronisms are expected from the movie business but then to build subtle error into outright inaccuracy, the script writers decided to pin the blame for burning the great library at Alexandria on these same proto-Charismatics.  Never mind that at the time of the movie setting the library had already been burned centuries before by Roman armies.  No, once again there seems to be an underlying agenda that must force the past to fit the modern bias toward faith as opposed to enlightened and morally superior reason and science.  History has many examples of injustice on the part of Christians (or any group for that matter).  But perpetuating the anti-faith myths such as the Hypatia incident and Galileo without an honest treatment of the historical context is becoming a modern film clich&eacute;.  It is unfortunate because the cinematography is original in recreating ancient Alexandria in the context of the entire world.  But average acting supported by original cinematography are not enough to cover the underlying prejudices implied in the story.
B002GHHHL0|4.0|Deep Blue Sea, 1999 film<br /><br />The story begins with two couples on a boat. There is a noise from something hitting the boat! Two fall into the water but are saved from a great white shark. They say 200,000 people suffer from Alzheimer's Disease each year. What if it could be cured by one pill? A man goes swimming with a shark and survives. There are other sharks there. We see how sharks are fed. There is a birthday celebration at night. Can they increase the brains of sharks? Does that violate International Standards? Sharks don't get cancer. [You can't smoke underwater.] The weather report tells of gale force winds coming. What are those sharks doing? They lose the picture from the TV monitor. Carter brings a shark in for a medical exam. \\"Bad dream?\\" They take a test sample. The results are good.<br /><br />One man approaches too near for shocking action! They call the paramedics for aerial evacuation during the storm. Something goes wrong and the helicopter crashes into Aquatica! But the lights work. They see an object hit the glass and it begins to crack until the sea pours in! [Poor design and construction?] Are they trapped in there? Carter has a plan to get topside. A door bursts open and water floods in! This is repeated at another room. Did a shark ram through a steel door? \\"They are after us!\\" We learn how the sharks got smarter. We see people try to escape from water and the sharks. There is anger and conflict among the people. They are told to cooperate to survive. But there is a sudden interruption! OMG! Too much water pressure will crumble the structure. They open an escape hatch and being to climb up a ladder.<br /><br />The water level rises, and a shark swims around. \\"Are you all that made it?\\" Two men search for an escape. One man makes a statement to a video recorder. They start a machine. Will another shark show up for another victim? \\"Where's Suzy?\\" An electric cable fends off a shark attack. Three survivors reach comparative safety. They plan to float upwards in a flooded compartment to reach the open sea. Is there another shark? Bait? [These scenes are amazing and unbelievable!] There is a blast of blood from an explosion! There is a happy ending for the survivors. They see a boat arriving for them.<br /><br />You can see echoes from other movies (like \\"Jaws\\") in this drama. It starts off slowly, and the story seems implausible in parts (who paid for that floating laboratory that is far our in the ocean?). Like some other movies it warns against poorly-designed experiments with natural forces. You probably won't want to watch this movie before you go swimming in the ocean. Watching this during \\"Hurricane Sandy\\" was an ironic coincidence. The `Special Features' explain how the movie was put together using computer generated editing. This allows doing what would be either impossible or at a much higher cost. Those sharks were all robotic models that were remote controlled by computers. There is no lack of gory scenes and terrifying surprises.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|It's very nice looking. If you can't get enough off the Bejeweled-type games, you'll like this. Personally, I think it's a tired old formula, and mind-numbingly boring. It's the same thing over and over.
B009K0OPQQ|2.0|I didn't like this show. I gave it a chance by watching season one but for me something still was missing from the story line that didn't quite satisfy me. I like the concept of Fairy Tale characters living in two worlds but the writing was lacking and didn't pull me in. On top of that the evil Queen was way over the top with her role, making the supporting cast invisible. I wasn't interested in season two, one was enough.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really enjoy this app. its great to keep track of expenses st the grocery store or even for quick calculations. overall worth downloading
0345535421|5.0|I am currently reading the book, almost finished, enjoying it very much. I read the first in the series after watching the HBO show. I bought all the books in the series and will be looking for more of George R.R. Martins books.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have Avast on my home computer so thought it would be a good idea for my Kindle Fire.  It's working really well as I haven't had any probems with it and it doesn't seem to interfer with any of my applications.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very good book that chronicles WWII history through the eyes of several families as they live through the war.  Recommend read for anyone interested in history
B008XG1X18|5.0|its wonderful, and easy..I have ppl looking over my shoulder to see what I'm doing..even my daughter gets on it
B005XN31LY|2.0|After watching season 1 of \\"Once Upon a Time\\" I realize one thing for sure, I didn't like it. But I wanted too. I kept waiting for something to happen, something, anything that would give a spark to the show. The only characters that were interesting were the Queen and Rumpelstiltken. Don't get me wrong, I like the concept of Fairy tale characters living in modern times; which is why I kept watching, (though I fast forward the last three episodes) but the writing did nothing that would make me want to watch this show again.
030758836X|3.0|I couldn't put this book down, but not because I loved it, because I was just dumbfounded at the style of writing and what was happening with these characters.  To me it was more sci-fi than reality.  I must say, that I have read all 3 of Gillian Flynn's novels and she absolutely does have a different style of writing - one that I don't care for.  The first review I read of this book said that if you liked \\"real characters\\" and a story that's believable, you would love this book.  Seriously???!!!! Does anyone out there really know people like these characters?  I can't imagine.  To me the book was not believable and I personally don't recommend it if you are looking for a true mystery with bad guy being caught in the end.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I'd compare this game to a mini Diablo it's fast fun and quick to play when you only have a few minutes and fun enough to play for an hour at a Time
B002VHI8J0|3.0|Slow start, picked up pace and interest and ultimately disappointed! Interesting idea, but somehow tried to punch above it's weight...
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Very good book not as long as most of her books or maybe i just read real fast. i love all her books.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is definitely one of the best free games available to the Kindle.  High quality game design and unique gameplay with plenty of achievements to be had will keep you coming back for more.
B004GYY714|3.0|when I do not wanna continue lesson to it anymore it countiues how do you stop it ??!?!?!?!!? it could be better
B004VMVTNU|5.0|It works. The alarm rises slowly, so you're not jolted out of deep sleep in a rude way. Very configurable, and good UI.
1451629192|5.0|This was a fantastic read! I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good book . It shipped fast and I was able to enjoy it quickly.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|So breaking out of the childhood groove is not an easy task. A little light on the ending as he gets set up and heads to Florida to get away from it all
B002RD55KI|5.0|I love this movie, great insight into how Woodstock came about.  Never knew all these facts, and movie does it in an entertaining way.  Would recommend to anyone who has an interest in Woodstock at all.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a really great game. The graphics are really good. I do not get bored at all. I am hooked.
B009AMAKJU|5.0|This movie was so well done. I have read the book and I feel they did a great job staying true to it. Yes they are some differences but it doesn't lose the \\"feel\\" of the book. Logan Lerman was amazing as Charlie as well as Emma as Sam and Ezra as Patrick. Perfect casting. This film stays with you long after you leave the theater. I can't wait for it to come to DVD!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Loved this one as much as the ones before! Action, adventure, suspense and humor.<br />Looking forward to the next book.
B009QW7HMC|4.0|This episode sets up another great season: more great character moments and, of course, action.<br /><br />The quality was good, though I wish Amazon would make the show available as soon as it is purchased (or at the same time it is aired). The show airs on Sunday, and I can't watch it until later on Monday, which is frustrating.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a delight to read.  Brilliant and refreshing and original.  Can't wait to see the movie now.  Great.
1423140605|5.0|In The Mark of Athena, the eagerly awaited next book in Rick Riordan's Heroes of Olympus series, the seven demigods of the prophecy embark on the beginning of their quest to Rome. Told in the perspectives of Leo, Piper, Percy, and Annabeth, the heroes are met with many challenges, between each other, and during their journey.<br />I really, really liked this book. The overall idea of the plot was similar to the previous books (saving something before a deadline while following a prophecy), but the author managed to make it seem very different and exciting, with unexpected twists and turns.<br />Now that the characters have been established, I liked how Riordan expanded on the characters more than ever, making them even more three dimensional. He gave more insight into their hopes, their history, and their fears. I thought he wrote their interactions very well, giving them inside jokes from previous books and a good dose of social tension, though not so much that I got fed up with them. In Mark of Athena, Riordan proved that there can be a book with realistic interactions between teenagers that doesn't include cursing every few lines or getting drunk. The conflict between the Greeks and the Romans became especially important, and it was exciting to see the events unfold.<br />I think this book was one of the funniest yet; it made me burst out laughing every few minutes. I also loved that while the book is funny, it also manages to deal with more serious topics (such as losing someone you love) without making the events feel out of place or awkward.<br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the enormous cliffhanger at the end. It has created the perfect setup for the next book, and I wish I could know what happens already. With something that big, it's unfair to make us wait until next fall to learn the outcome.<br /> I think both children and adults would enjoy this book for its characters, its plot, and its way of weaving mythology in a contemporary time.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the series, and anyone who loves a book with humor, fantasy, interesting characters, and has an interests in Greek or Roman mythology.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Anything johnny makes is good, this was a very funny movie, I am a Dark Shadows Fan, watch it from first day it started, then have watch it many times on DVD and Scfi...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I play it every day several times a day.  I'm totally addicted. I love all the updates and bonuses. also its funny thanks for an awesome games.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've bought every book John Grisham has written as soon as they come out. I enjoyed The Racketeer more than any novel to date. It had just enough suspense to make it impossible to put it down.<br /><br />Thanks Mr Grisham and I'll look forward to your next novel.
B002HLM4E0|4.0|It was a fun movie to watch! I didn't give it 5 stars because it was it's not my favorite of the series, but still a good movie.
B0092MKFIY|2.0|Not sure if it's supposed to sound like that or not, but I'm noticing that nearly the whole album sounds \\"fuzzy\\" or \\"muffled?\\"<br /><br />I really like the beats in these tracks and I like the lead singer's voice, but the instrumentation all sounds kinda crap.  On the first track \\"Radioactive\\" I thought it was just the style of the song, that bubbly distortion, but on the later tracks I noticed that it just sounds uneven and compressed sounding.<br /><br />I know it's not my listening equipment, either, because the rest of the music in my collection doesn't sound like that.  Until someone can correct me for convince me otherwise, I'm going to blame this on bad production/bad recording.  I really want to like this band, but everything sounds off.  I was excited to buy this album from listening to the samples.<br /><br />If I'm wrong, why would a band choose to make \\"muffled\\" their music style?
B008XG1X18|5.0|I started using this on Facebook. I got the app on my phone. Now I have it on my Kindle, too! I love this app. The site has so much to see and do. Trust me, you will get addicted.
B00884GR0W|1.0|who are the other people. you can barpy do any thing. the mobs never die . don't wast money or room.buy minecraft instead.
B0092G1O8A|2.0|The ACTING is GOOD TO SUFFICIENT, at best. The SUBJECT MATTER is SOPHOMORIC. I am, obviously, in the minority , but GEEZ. AND the BRUTALITY?????? What's the appeal?????? How much different is it than the WWWF????????<br />I think Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone), Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson are, ALL, really good actors (among my favorites, actually) and they all were good in this movie. That's the best I can say. The story line and script are so poor, Good is all that can be expected. The special effects are not special--they are poor, also. This was highly recommended to me. I would HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND IT!!<br />THE BOOK WOULD HAVE TO BE BETTER. HOW COULD IT NOT BE?
0375869026|5.0|I purchased the book after reading about it in a blog from a parent whose child has the same anomalies as August.<br />I have a toddler, so I cant read it to her yet, but this story is so emotionally powerful and touching, that I cant imagine not sharing it with her when she is older. I was moved to tears several times. It is well written and captures the different points of views of various characters. The author does an amazing job with stream of consciousness, and the story flows very smoothly. I would recommend this book to anyone, not just for young adults, or parents of young adults or kids with disabilities. The main message: to be nicer than necessary is a wonderful message that everyone today can appreciate and take to heart. I loved the book and look forward to reading other works by RJ Palacio
B007MU85D0|5.0|I agree with the other reviews regarding this album, you should listen to it a couple times to get the feel of it. I loooooovee the whole album except maybe one song. Overall such a great buy. I listen to them constantly now :)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I loved this game. for about a week. then the problems started. go to store and kicked out of the game. re start hardware now it has no daily bonus. no store. no power ups in the game. just bad.
B0098VXE50|5.0|It's a different telling of the famous Snow White story. I like the change, the darkness of it and also the actors. They did a really good job in this movie. Happy to have it as part of my collection.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|So what if it takews Rod Stewart many many years before he releases a Christmas album? It was worth the wait!  Saw him perform in Las vegas a few times, and I love this performer and his music....Rock, oldies or Christmas!  Keep it coming, Rod!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've had this headset for 2months now and i've really enjoyed them, they difinetly were not a let down. They sound great, fell comfy can were there for hours and hours. I'll keep these short and have a quick overview of cons + pro's.  Cons: 1. It won't last a full day of Gaming like 18hours(like a rainy day or something) =( 2. Sometimes after wearing for 10+ hours if you get warm, your ears might get a little warm but nothing noticable. 3. People say of hearing a buzzing noise. Yes this does exist however this is when its recharging and its on your head =). So if you have some music playing or alot of noise while playing a game you won't notice it. If the USB cable isn't plugged it there is no noise. 4. Some people have said about the plastics bits breaking. I haven't had any of this. 5. Some microwave ovens will kill the connection when used(if you are close to it), So you can't microwave that pie and still listen to music or talk. But once the microwave stops it usually kicks back in(no repairing) 6. Sucks you can use it for ps3 i hear =(  Pros: 1. The 8-10 hours is about right, works great. Just enough time to play games after work and before bed. 2. The USB connection fits and stays in while recharging and playing games at the same time. However it sticks around 2 inches out from the bottom. So if you have a jumper on or thick clothes it can knock the connection and eventually make it loose over time. 3. The G keys are amazing use this link to edit them =) ( I use it to control Music pause and Next song + Push to talk in games. So i can still chat to people if i've left the room. [...] 4. Can get about 30+ feet and the connection is still solid.(through a few normal walls)   EDIT: 3-4Years onwards Update. They still work, i've had my issues with them though. I definitely got my money's worth atleast, but there is surely alot of room for logitech to improve on.  Pro's;  1. It still works 2. Battery life still lasts 6-8hours, so a decent days gaming session 3. TheCups or Hinges around them all still work. 4. Relatively long Cable  Con's;  1. Microphone attachment broke. Pulling down from the end of mircophone puts to much pressure and it broke. It snapped were just the bracket which holds the screw in place. With some hot glue, and pulling close to headset you can avoid the issue. 2. The USB charger sticks out from the bottom of the EAR cup onto your shoulder. If you have a hooded jumper on, alot of times this will catch and get annoying. 3. Wireless mode, randomly turns off when it had no sounds, so if you stop music for a bit or read a forum. It just turns off very Annoying. 4. Turning It off and on is tiresome, you need to hold it down for 4seconds. Quite annoying if you don't get the right pressure push and it doesn't turn on at all. 5. The fake Leather stuff started peeling after 2 years on the ear cups, you should seek replacement earcups. 6. Logitech software if a POS, i had to uninstall it. Several times i reinstalled, but consistently it would always have issues. I had a better experience with it removed.  Overall Product rating 7.5/10, it loses a few extra points for being so expansive and cheap feeling build quality.

B007X4ECMI|5.0|This movie is awesome. the action in this movie is amazinng and i love the plot. i wonder if sometime in the future we might have a maxium secruity prison in space like that. i loved guy pearce's character reminded me a little bit of deadpool. he might make a good deadpool. and the the maine actress was pretty good to. they had good chemistry it was fun to watch those two bicker with each other while getting chased by physchopaths. i also thought that the actors who played the two maine bad guys were good two. the younger brother was creepy i would not want to meet him. all in all this was just a fun film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B008NW67E0|5.0|This was the first CD that I bought of m&s and I love it. It is a great CD to just listen to.

Plus it shouted super fast and arrived sooner then expected!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie that both children and parents will enjoy. It does get a little rough, so younger kids should definitely watch it with a parent. Still, worth the watch, even if you don't have kids!

0307352145|5.0|I'm so glad that this book came out. It makes me understand myself more, and more importantly, accept me for being me, an introvert. Only wish this book had come out when I was younger.
1577314808|5.0|I owned this book twice, then gave it to friends. Now I bought ebook again and is worth buying still many times.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|So far a great read, has made me more conscious. I love how simple yet profound the information is. I am succeeding already, every law God has set into motion since creating the universe is here to help us succeed & the author taps into that. If you are tired of struggling & failing, read this book. If you're a Christian, I suggest being aware that all these can also be found in the bible but this breaks it down into understandable English terms.
1439152802|5.0|The Secret Keeper proves once again that Kate Morton is a storyteller like no other. I loved all her other books and was so excited to read this one...and it FAR exceeded my expectations. This is now my favourite book of hers. I just finished it and thanks to the final twist at the end, I am going to re-read it immediately with \\"different\\" eyes! The characters were so vivid, the mystery so artfully revealed--layer by delicious layer--I can't wait for the next book. I hope it comes along soon :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has daily verses, web access to many versions, ability to download good versions like KJV, NKJ, the Message, etc. I copy verses for study and to  text my daughter, and the Bible plans are encouraging me to get in God's word more consistantly. You can hear scripture read, too. Even though I had KJV with Strongs and NKJ purchased from Olive Tree this is better for my smart phone which only has a small amount of memory. Awesome, awrsome, awesome app!

B001QFZADA|5.0|I had heard so much about this book from my pastor & friends. I love how this book reads so easily. Real life stories & applications. No matter who you are or hat relationship you're in, you need this book in your life. Wonderful principles, it will help you in how you relate in every relationship, work, school, home, general. This book is for everyone who wants to be better understood & understanding.
1469984202|4.0|I loved this book! It had a truly original plot with great characters with whom you could relate. Even the villian had a motive that was understandable. I loved the characters and felt tortured when they appeared to be failing. These issues are, for me at least, what makes a great story!<br /><br />I could not <quite> give the story a 5 star rating however. I had a couple of issues that really bugged me. First, the murder of the very popular mayor was pretty much written off and ignored as though no one really cared anyway; I thought its handling was quite weak. The other thing that really bugged me was the diving sequence in the latter part of the book. This was so impossible in so many ways! It was clear the author knew nothing about the subject.<br /><br />Having stated my problems I must return to the fact that this is a really good book! I will definitely be reading more by him in the future!

0345803485|1.0|I read this thinking it would be good based on its popularity.  I'm sorry I did.  I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what people liked about it. Pretty much a book about how many ways one could have non-traditional sex.  No real plot. I was bored and looking forward to the end.  I won't be reading the next two books in the trilogy.
B005CA4SL0|5.0|The movie arrive quickly and in excellent shape. Though its an old movie, WOW, Deniro give a performance as spooky and warped as I have seen. I've seen a lot of Deniro films. His performance in 'Awakenings' has always been what I considered his best. This performance is a tie!

B000IZ7YK6|5.0|As a screenwriter this is one of the best screenplays ever written and one of my favorite movies.  The script is an excellent example of the three act screenplay and often referenced in screenwriting text books, e.g. Syd Field's, \\"Fundamentals of Screenwriting.\\"  As a story it has it all: sex, violence, mystery, suspense and conflict. The acting is excellent. It's a young Jack at his best. Lastly, lt's Polanski's best directed movie.  The film has it all and there's something here for everyone whether you just want to watch an engaging, entertaining movie or you want to see how to write a screenplay. BTW, it's based on a true story.

B006PTZNSY|5.0|It's time to open your eyes and see the talent that is Nicki Minaj. She's truly a talented artist, because she does it all. In this album you will hear Rap, Pop, R&B, Dance, and one Reggae track. I truly believe she's the hottest artist out now and no doubt the greatest female MC ever. Now she's going to put out \\"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded \\"the Re-up\\" 11-19-12 it's available for Pre-order now. She's doing this for us 'the Fans' how can you hate that. I mean where's kim and why did it take 5 years for us to hear from eve and missy, and now one is buying their new singles anyways. I want Nicki, the world wants Nicki.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I give this product 5 stars in 3D mode.  The graphics in 3D felt like you were right in the middle of the action.  I haven't watched it in standard, non-3D mode, and I'm not sure how I would grade it without 3D.  However, it's ending, basically tying into the \\"Alien\\" collection was a great shock and surprise.  I sincerely hope Mr. Scott has a sequel in mind, or that he come up with one.  This was one of my best purchases through Amazon.  Well Done.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have to say that what I've read so far is quite powerful. The premise is simple: in order to lose excess weight, we need to avoid foods that the body was never meant to derive energy from. I'm on the bit discussing the body's biochemical processes: hormones, insulin, etc.<br />Whilst the reading gives one the sense the author(s) know their stuff, the proof is in the pudding: everyone I know who has followed through has regained their ideal level of health and have been able to maintain it. It's not a diet: it's a way of thinking about food.<br />A very healthy way!

B0092MKFIY|5.0|Okay, it's not all happy, but a lot of it is, and it moves my body and it moves my soul. I fell in love with them when I heard them open for AWOLNATION and they were amazing, and the crowd was body to body to see them! And everybody knew all the words to every song (except me! That won't happen again!) I hope they don't end up an overplayed cliche and keep churning out great uplifting, imaginative music for a long time!

0446547573|5.0|When I heard that Safe Haven was being made into a movie, I hurried to buy the book.  I read it in one day.<br />Nicholas is an excellent author.  I have enjoyed every book he has written and loved to see them made into movies.<br />I won't spoil it for you, so all I will say is Safe Haven is a story that hits home with me.<br />Keep them coming Nicholas.  I look forward to the next one.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The Move started out slow and a little Iffy, I though that this was going to be a good move tell the Alien ship part (Mainly the Nest); You could 100% see the drawing of a Aline Queen and all you pods.  At the End of the move is what closed the hole \\"This is a Aliens prequel!\\" for me.<br /><br />I short the move was good in some ways and Bad in a lot of others. Buy if you have to have it, but I say you should rent then make up your mind.

B0076NKNLA|5.0|I give this 5 Stars!  A very detailed look into the life of Marilyn Monroe. What happened when the cameras stopped rolling. Michelle Williams does an Oscar worthy performance from beginning to end, along with an all star cast of Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Watson, Julia Ormond and Judi Dench make this a must see movie.
0545425115|4.0|I'm often the reader that's late to the game when it comes to the books and series that blow up and cause a sort of pandemonium - for the most part at least. I didn't read HARRY POTTER until the first four books were in paperback. I didn't read TWILIGHT until the fourth book was just released. I only recently read THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF OZ a few years ago. I have yet to finish THE LORD OF THE RINGS or PERCY JACKSON or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. So despite the fact that THE HUNGER GAMES became the talk of the book world when it released in 2008, I brushed it aside and thought nothing of it. The recent emergence of a website devoted to the Games (due, in large part, to the the film release coming up) sparked my curiosity and so I read.<br /><br />Though the beginning felt a bit slow, the tale of Katniss Everdeen quickly became thrilling and heart-stopping. In a post-apocalyptic world, a government known as the Capitol rules over 12 districts (formerly 13). As a reminder to those citizens who may want to rebel against them, the Capitol holds an annual \\"event\\" known as The Hunger Games, during which one boy and one girl from each district is forced to fight to survive in front of cameras that broadcast the games live to everyone. The goal of the Games? To be the last one standing. For the 74th annual games, 16-year-old Katniss is the girl sent from District 12 when she jumps in to take the place of her younger sister; with her goes Peeta Mallark. The two of them join the other tributes - some ruthless, some stealthy, and some secretive - in a fight to the death for survival.<br /><br />One of the reasons I ended up liking this book were Suzanne Collins' characters. Katniss, while not perfect, is strong, smart, clever, and determined - traits that are often hard to find in novels for young adults, though they are becoming more popular. In a world (both before and during the games) where survival is key, she is willing to do anything to stay alive. Does it always translate well as a character? No, I don't believe so, but I do believe that her downfalls are merely due to her need to move forward. Peeta has many layers, not all of which are revealed from the beginning, though Collins manages to reveal this character's depth in a way that is not annoying and manages to keep readers interested. For me personally, there was a lot of flip-flopping between liking him and distrusting him, which makes me believe that he's as real as they come. After all, what girl isn't confused by boys? Supporting characters are briefly showcased but spotlighted well. Rae is a character that will make people sit up and take notice, Haymitch is confusing at his best, Madge is somewhat forgettable but leaves a lasting impression for her gift to Katniss.<br /><br />Though the dystopian setting is popular right now (especially since it's been more than a few years since THE HUNGER GAMES released), Collins' story is riveting and full of twists and turns that left me breathless and wondering about who was good, who was bad, and what was true. The premise is reminiscent of THE LOTTERY by Shirley Jackson but Collins weaves such intricate moments from Katniss' perspective that I can almost forgive the writing style. Collins writes in choppy sentences, no doubt a mimic of a teenager's racing mind and thoughts that jump from one topic to the next; I wasn't a fan but the story was intriguing enough that I continued reading.<br /><br />The ending is a clear introduction to the following book, CATCHING FIRE, which is, in a way, unnecessary. With the majority of the trials and tribulations coming to a close by the book's end, I believe Collins could have written an ending that was more concise and closed. While I enjoy trilogies, I like books that can stand alone in its own way. That is, I don't mind having to read more but I like to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. I look forward to reading the 2nd book in this trilogy but I wish I didn't have to, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is a great and entertaining book but it's also a look into the psyche of humans and an opening of questions regarding governments and reality television, of all things. If you haven't picked this book up (for whatever reason), do yourself a favor - put it on your \\"to read\\" list.<br /><br />-- originally reviewed for Ordinary People, Extraordinary Works --y sense.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is a great and entertaining book but it's also a look into the psyche of humans and an opening of questions regarding governments and reality television, of all things.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my wife to protect her new iPhone 4. She liked the color obviously and really liked how slim it was. Not bulky like my otterbox. Easy to install and we did the little water test like they suggested. So far no problems and it has worked great. My wife works at a cupcakery and likes to keep her phone close. So that runs the risk of getting all sorts of stuff on the phone. With the case we don't have to worry how messy she gets.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|it was amazing<br /><br />\\"She saw the dead baby, gray and waxen, like a shrunken doll, promptly hidden behind a dirty sheet.\\"<br /><br />Did that sentence make your eyes widen? Did it you cringe or gasp? Did it cause your heart to clench?<br /><br />If it did, be prepared for many more of those emotions to come forth while reading SARAH'S KEY by Tatiana de Rosnay.<br /><br />As someone who has been interested in the events surrounding and occurring as a part of the Holocaust, I have to wonder why it took so long for me to read this particular title. Though France was a country that was often looked over when learning about the Holocaust, I knew of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup only because of a class I took in high school where students were required to do research on a particular country's involvement with the Holocaust.<br /><br />Yes, SARAH'S KEY is a piece of fiction but more importantly, it is based on the true stories of French policemen rounding up Jewish families in Paris, France. With beautiful prose and heart-wrenching accounts, SARAH'S KEY revolves around two female characters - Sarah Starzynski, a 10-year-old child taken from her home in 1942, and Julia Jarmond, a journalist in the present day who is unraveling what seems to be the mystery of Vel' d'Hiv. In her research, Julia realizes just how closely her life is tied to young Sarah.<br /><br />For the first half of the book, the story is told in first person from Julia and a harrowing narrative of what happens to Sarah. Though a bit jarring upon the initial read, the story begins to flow into each other after a few chapters. Unfortunately for me, I cared more for Julia's research and story of a marriage slowly being broken, and wished the discoveries regarding Sarah were told completely from Julia's perspective. In that vein, I was very content once the second half of the book began and Sarah's story was told through conversations in present time.<br /><br />Though de Rosnay is a beautiful storyteller, there is nothing shocking in terms of the Holocaust portions of the book. There is no challenge for the reader but, in this case, it works. No new revelations need to be made with a story as chilling and poignant as this.is nothing shocking in terms of the Holocaust portions of the book.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna's albums in the 00's were, no disrespect, somewhat uninspired. As a big fan, obviously i loved each one of them, but they lacked the luster of an 80's or 90's Madge. She is an artistic genius, and quite frankly her work has not been reflecting that. MDNA, however, is exactly what we Madonna fans needed. An entire album of stunning tracks, none requiring a skip. She starts off strong with \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", but it really should be called \\"Girl With A Focus\\", because this album is exactly what she needed to jump start her career in the 2010's and with a new label. Not only was the album itself astounding, but I am so happy with it's delivery. I ordered the cheapest used Deluxe version of MDNA, sold by \\"brouhaha_inc\\" and received a brand new, factory sealed copy, in less than a week. When I open the mail I was shocked, not only by the speed, but that they would send me a new copy! Overall, almost thirty years into her career, Madonna is often imitated, never - ever - duplicated. She is a superstar and an icon, and will remain that way forever!
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Excellent if you are a Schwarzenegger fan. Understandbly he is a bit of a polarizing figure but even if you do not like him, his story is still interesting.
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|I grew up on REM and bought this on a whim given the great memories I tie to so many great REM songs. The problem is that this slum isn't great. I am not even sure it's good. Because its REM I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt. The reality is I very rarely choose to listen to this. It usual comes up again when I Amy playing random songs.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. Yes, the plot was straight forward and there was no twist, but the fight scenes were top notch and rather impressive. I personally prefer a action movie with a happy ending, than a slow, deep plot, with moral delimas, and emotionally wrenching deaths, that leave you unsure at the end. I feel its under rated at anything under 4 stars. By the way, this movie is too violent for kids!!!
0345803485|1.0|A sad commentary on readers' lack of appreciation for quality writing. These books are not a \\"guilty pleasure\\" or a \\"fun light read\\" or \\"escapist fantasy. \\" They are just boring, trite, garbage.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book, I felt was much better than the first book. I realize that the first book was meant to let the readers get to know the characters and to set up the second and thrid books, but I thought it was boring. I almost didn't read the second book but a friend prompted me to and I caved. I am so happy that I did. I really liked it.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|The BK2 is overall a really nice knife for the mid level survival blade. Not too big and certainly not too small. I will only list the things that I don't like or need improvement but keep in mind that I gave this knife fours stars.<br /><br />- first and foremost the sheath is awful! Had I paid full list price I would have sent it back for this reason alone.<br />- Does not arrive very sharp. Had to put a convex edge on it myself. So far it's held an edge pretty well but no long term testing to back that up.<br />- no clean metal on back of blade to use with a firesteel. So I have to either grind the paint off or use paint remover. Neither option sounds good. I'm assuming Becker either didn't consider it or assumed I would use the sharp edge. Using the sharp edge is a terrible idea.<br />- The scales are nice but too slick. Needs to be sand blasted or something to give a better grip. It's a large handle to hold onto anyways, add in water, mud, blood, whatever and it gets more dangerous to use.

B00913DPW2|1.0|Graphics were wonderful. Music was fitting to a point. However this game needs a hint button, free guide in the game and some kind of interaction with the spirits. I also found that I was wishing for a spirit to pop out and scare me, which never happened. The only thing that happened in the 2 hours I played it was a floating Teddy bear. I barely caught it out of the corner of my eye as I moved from one room to the other. I plan to delete this app and I have no plans of finishing it. I'm disappointed and would rather use my money towards another game that has more suspense to it.

B005LAIGYQ|2.0|Watching this movie is like watching someone else play Call of Duty. Decent action scenes are tainted by annoying first person views, with rifles and EOTech sights and *pew pew pew*.  The action scenes seem aimed at 12-year-old video gamers.<br /><br />Then the action scenes end, and we get a few minutes of wooden \\"actors\\" chugging their way through the dialogue the best they can.  There are no actual characters in this movie, just a bunch of people you have no connection to.  They make one guy an expectant father in an effort to give him some resemblance of personhood, but it falls short.<br /><br />There's a scene in the movie where one of the dudes dies, and the music, cinematography, etc. seem to indicate that it's supposed to be an emotional moment. Didn't work for me.<br /><br />Not a bad action flick if you fast-forward through any scenes where people aren't shooting. But still not great.

B008BRC7BE|5.0|I have always thought it a shame that Tony Iommi and Ian Gillan only had 1 album together (Black Sabbath's Born Again) so it is awesome that they chose to collaborate again.  While they only have a couple of new tunes on this, you can still feel the magic they had together 25 years ago!!  Then add in all the other great tunes from Glen Hughes, Tony Martin and rare Gillan, this is a must have for anyone that has followed this genre of Rock!!<br /><br />Don't forget, the proceeds from this purchase are going to building a new Music School for children in Armenia with construction scheduled to be completed in 2013.

B007FLHW3K|5.0|Received the Monkey Light very quickly after ordering it. It was pretty easy to attach to the front wheel of my Trek 7100 Metro. It works great and really adds to the visibility of my bike. I don't often ride in the pitch dark but often ride just after sunset. It is very bright and easy to use. I can not detect any wheel balance problems with the addition of the Monkey Light. It looks kind of funky in the daytime but really puts on a show when it gets dark. Combined with other front and rear lights it has made my bike very easy to spot and makes me feel safer riding in the evening or early morning.
0316228540|1.0|Having enjoyed the Harry Potter books so much over the years, and reading them again and again, I was agog to see how J.K. Rowling wrote for adults - and I was absolutely horrified and disgusted.  I found the book boring, with foul language throughout and uninteresting rude, selfish and crude characters.  Let's hope her next excursion into writing for adults is better.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun free game that can get crazy.  its great because its free. cant put it down and great for the kindle fire.
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|This book is a fantastic thriller. I highly recommend. As a matter of interest, if you like crime thrillers that are similar to this book and have the same themes, such as female empowerment and rebellion against the establishment, have a look at this book: \\"That Girl Started Her Own Country\\", written by the \\"Holy Ghost Writer\\" [[ASIN:B0094IH8HC THAT GIRL STARTED HER OWN COUNTRY (The Count of Monte Cristo)]] It is an intelligently-written, thoroughly entertaining page-turner, full of international intrigue and engaging, interesting characters. It has fast action and many plots and twists that keep you guessing. I literally could not put it down. It is available on Amazon, Goodreads and Barnes and Noble, and is only $7.77 for the Kindle Edition. But don't take my word for it - check out the many 5 star, glowing reviews. I urge you to check it out. You won't be disappointed!:)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|If your not a fan of the Alien saga of movies or a scifi fan you may not get the story behind it. But it's still an incredible movie vivid and full if action. I loved it hope you do as well
0425263908|5.0|I just finished 50 shades and that had me hooked, loved the trilogy, was looking for something else and a friend recommended this book. Before I read something I check the reviews and omg the reviews alone had me curious. I got the book and it had me hot from the beginning! To me it is more down to earth (probably because I am a New Yorker) but just the fact that it is 2 people that are career driven and messed up in their own ways but find comfort with each other and make something of it. Getting towards the end of book one looking forward to book two and hopefully will be done before book 3 comes out. If you liked 50 Shades, this is the next series you need to read.
0895260131|3.0|Spencer makes many valid points and it is an important read especially for an European. His knowledge is extensive and what he states about the Quran is correct, if you you interpret it literally. His points about the Crusades are fascinating and the MYTH of tolerance that the MIDDLE-EASTERN form has to other faiths and beliefs is fully exposed. How the Greeks were treated is particularly revealing.<br /><br />THE THREAT IS REAL and Spencer exposes it, BUT IT IS NOT WITHOUT FLAWS.<br /><br />When we discuss the pros and cons of Muslim culture we must differentiate between the successful Islamic model of integration and success, that of the Malaysian and Indonesian model and the Middle Eastern variant.<br /><br />Islam can be successful economically and tolerant if the South East Asian culture of Islam is adopted.<br /><br />So most importantly, when we criticize Islam we must differentiate between these two variants of Islam.There is the Middle Eastern variant that is aggressive, intolerant and poor, and then there is the progressive, economically successful South East Asian model.<br /><br />Spencer does not do that, he seems to paint all Muslim regions with the same brush, which is unfair and counter productive. What is his suggestion?, to alienate all 1.2 billion Muslims?, which is plain dumb, all suggest that there is a more productive Islam and that one should encourage the Arab people to adopt.<br /><br />Spencer answers to the Muslims extremism, range from reasonable to the silly. He suggests to cut foreign aid to countries such as Pakistan and Egypt. However by doing so would likely encourage these states to become even more extreme and the US would lose leverage over controlling them.<br /><br /> For instance US aid and support helps keep the nuclear warheads in Pakistan out of the hands of extremists.<br /><br />The best way Europe can protect itself, is to limit immigration from North Africa and the Middle-East and to crack down hard on Muslim extremists,by having a no tolerance approach. Any cleric that encourages violence or intolerance and preaches the militant form of Islam should be deported or imprisoned for life. Sharia law should also be banned. Additionally there should be no areas in Europe that Muslims claim exclusively as their own, if so, such communities should be broken up and aggressors prosecuted.<br /><br />Indonesia, a Model for the Islamic Civilization in Transition to the 2lst Century<br />by Prof. Dr. Bassam Tibi<br /><br /> At a symposium of the Quagdt Foundation, Indonesia's Minister for Research and Technology, Habibie, who is a graduate of the Aachen University, answered the question whether his country could serve as a model for other Muslims using the following parable. Once upon a time there were two Muslims, one named Ahmed, the other Ali. Ahmed was an industrious and productive boy, more interested in prosperity than in the ideologies of religious hotheads. Ali, however, indulged in religions ideas and how to transmit them to others. Ahmed succeeded in his own way in attaining some prosperity and got many disciples, while the religious hothead Ahmed remained poor and suffered. In the orient there is the tradition that women remain publicly in the background while wielding great power at home. That's why Ali's wife became very angry and full of envy and urged her husband to go to Ahmed and ask him about his secret how he became so successful and rich. Ali gave in to his wife's request and Ahmed answered him that a Muslim could exercise more influence on others when demonstrating his economic success rather than through efforts to force one's own ideas onto others. Habibie didn't say it directly, but it's obvious: Ahmed stands for Indonesia and Ali for Iran, The audience understood very well the hidden insinuations of the parable. They knew that Habibie was about to travel to Iran and asked him to introduce this parable to the Iranian Head of State Rafandsjani. So he did and Rafandsjaniis said to have nodded his head thoughtfully.<br /><br /> Apart from Indonesia's economic success -- or maybe because of it -- in this present crisis it seems as if Indonesia is the most appropriate place for dialogue between the Islamic and Western civilization. Instead of a culture af aggressive defense I met there openness and tolerance. Even the chairman of the influential traditional Islamic Nahdatul Ulama Organization, Abdurrahman Wahid, calls for religious tolerance, human rights and protection of the Christian minority\\", what was confirmed by Franz Magnis-Suseno, a Christian missionary who teaches in Indonesia. In line with religious tolerance the economic success of Indonesia is overwhelming. Indonesia cannot only boast of economic growth rates which are comparable to those of Japan but has transformed from a food importing country to one that exports food. It seems to be the only OPEC -- country that has been able to use its oil revenues for financing a highly productive economy -- at first for import substitution then by means of industrialization to an export-oriented country.<br /><br /> But Indonesia has more to offer than just economic success. It represents a model for religiously and ethnic-culturally different communities to live together in peace and mutual respect. In Indonesia, too, there exists fundamentalism which can, however, be treated -- in contrast to the Arab Mediterranean region -- as quantity negligible. In general the insignificant group of fundamentalists is usually made up of Indonesians who have studied in the Arab centers of Islamic civilization and who arduously want to imitate the letters rigorous Islamic version.<br /><br /> The political system in Indonesia guarantees the equal standing of all five main religions in the country. Muslims, however, represent 85 percent of the 193 million inhabitants, living on 6.000 of a total of 16.500 islands. On Java alone live 40 percent of all Indonesians. The other four religions - Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism - are set on equal level to Islam.<br /> In Jakarta's city center the church tower of Christian cathedrals is not higher than the minaret of the huge Istiqlal mosque, the largest in all of Southeast Asia.  In Istanbul, on the other hand, one notices that the church towers are a lot tower than the minarets of mosques and discreetly hidden in side streets. The secular character of Turkey doesn't make a difference. That's not by chance but a religious rule which finds its historic roots in the definition of a Christian - the same as for a Jew as \\"dhimmis\\", a subdued, protected minority, therefore not on equal level with Muslims.<br /><br /> In Indonesia, non-Muslims are not \\"dhimmis\\" but citizens of equal standing. Southeast Asia offers a model, for an equal definition of Islam and Christianity which is expanded also to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism, religions which are not mentioned in Islamic revelations. The late 20th century is not the world of the 7th century when everything revolved around the then perceived main centers of civilization, the Christian and Muslim empires as well as around the Jewish religious communities.<br /><br /> Religious harmony exceeds by far the parable of Lessing as demonstrated by Southeast Asia; it has to embrace the other world religions, and Southeast Asia represents here a model for peace. Can a combination of economic success and the practice, of religious and ethnic-cultural tolerance as is the case in Indonesia, serve as a model? Is such a model not only an example for the Islamic civilization but also for peace between civilizations in general?.<br /><br /> The Islamic revelation of the 7th century (the first century according to Islamic calculation) falls together with the height of Islamic civilization. Because of the fact that the Koran was revealed in Arabic language and Arabia was the place where the revelation took place, the Islamic civilization is until, today -- at least by the Sunnite branch which represents 90 percent of all Muslims -- strongly influenced by Arabic Islam. As a visible sign non-Arab Sunnites (90 percent of all Sunnites) have an Arab or Arabic name. Southeast Asians, too, are Sunnite Muslims. Indonesians belong to the Shafi'i school of law/confession of Sunnism.<br /><br /> It was not until the 15th century that Islam's expansion reached Southeast Asia. Like West Africa Southeast Asia didn't come under Islamic influence by means of armed Jihad but through trade relations. Islamic traders - Arabs and Hindus of India who had converted to Islam - came to Southeast Asia early in the 15th century and were able to convert local rulers (there didn't exist unitary states like Indonesia or Malaysia at the time).<br /><br /> The ruler of Malacca, for example, embraced Islam in 1414. Thus the Islamization started first with the conversion of the rulers to Islam. Then these rulers spread their new-found religion to their subjects. Afterwards Javanese traders took Islam to the whole archipelago which is called today Indonesia.<br /><br /> The local rulers became sultans and as consequence Islam which was introduced from the outside world merged with local cultures into a synthesis. Fred van der Mehden characterized Southeast Asia's Islam as one that \\"lacks spiritual maturity - a feature which continued up to twentieth century\\".<br /><br /> Even today one finds in Indonesia a blend of adat (local customs and traditions often from pre-Islamic times) and Religious Islamic rules. The result is an Indonesian version of Islam that is not seldom quite independent.<br /><br /> The author calls attention to the quarrel between the former Indonesian Minister for Religious Affairs, Mukti Ali, and the Egyptian scholar al- Azhar in Cairo in November 1979 on the occasion of the \\"First Conference on Islamic Civilization\\". Mukti Ali caused a lot of frown among his audience when describing adat as the nucleus of Indonesian Islam. Responding tothe provocation that this would not be Islamic and he would have to decide whether he is Muslim or Indonesian, he stated in a sovereign manner: \\"I am an Indonesian Muslim.\\"<br /><br /> It is important to point here to the conflict-and-tension-rich de facto schism of Indonesian Islam into abangan and santri. Santri-Islam is in Indonesia orthodox and clings to the letter while abangan Muslims adopt into their religious way of life pre-Islamic, even pre-Hinduistic cultural elements and rituals. Abangan Islam prefers also Islamic mysticism to the Sharia.<br /> 85 percent of the 193 million Indonesians are Muslims but also part of 300 different ethnic cultures. That is why the great cultural variety is a main characteristic of Indonesian Islam. It can, therefore, maintain its position in Southeast Asia in recognition of the great religious and cultural diversity; and because of its adaptation it can serve as a better model for pluralism and tolerance at the same time.<br /><br /> In the Southeast Asian archipelago live approximately a quarter of a billion Muslims. In the Philippines, Burma, Thailand and Cambodia Muslims represent a minority. But Indonesia and Malaysia are both countries with an Islamic core population or Muslim majority. Both are counted among Asia's economic \\"tigers\\" and both, have not much of fundamentalism and, therefore, serve as a model for domestic peace.<br /><br /> Indonesia is to be regarded as a secular state, Pancasila viewed as a secular as well as an equality definition of monotheism since religion is defined as ethics and sepa-rated from the stale. This is the foundation which made it possible to overcome the tension between Islam and a secular national state in Indonesia and to demonstrate a successful pattern for harmonious unity of cultural-ethnically and religiously differing communities.<br /><br /> Since the Arab core countries of Islamic civilization have neither such, a cultural-ethnical and religious foundation for inner peace nor- despite their oil-based prosperity - can neither offer an economical successful development model the question comes up whether it is Southeast Asia that will become the center of Islamic civilization while moving into the 21st century because of its model capabilities. In order not to be guided by wishful thinking one has to part from Western reasoning patterns of economic and political rationality.<br /><br /> In forming a synthesis with nationalism Islam has played a central role during the independence war of the archipelago of 16.500 islands which is called today Indonesia. In 1945, however, the idea prevailed that such a diverse world can only get and maintain peace on a secular basis. When the first Constitution was worded a fierce fight erupted between the supporters of the \\"Jakarta Charta\\" and of Pancasila. The first group wanted to preface the Constitution with a preamble which would tie Indonesia to belief in God as an exclusive-islamic belief in Allah as well in recognition of Sharia as the legal basis for Indonesia.<br /><br /> The adepts of Pancasila, however, wanted to achieve a synthesis of cultural pluralism and secularism. Pancasila are the five principles (panca = five, sila - principle); monotheism, humanism, national unity, democracy and justice). Important is the definition of a tolerant and pluralistic monotheism by the then President Sukarno who described the first principle of Pancasila like this: \\"It's the principle of belief in God. It means that all Indonesians believe in God in the sense that the Christians believe in God in harmony with the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Muslims in line with the teachings of Mohammed, the Buddhists practice their religion as prescribed in their holy scriptures. But we all together believe in God. The Indonesian state is a state where every believer can worship God according to his own choice of religion. The Indonesian people believe in God in a refined manner that is without the egoism of any one religion.\\"<br /><br /> This Pancasila definition of Monotheism is a clear-cut deviation from the traditional Islamic Dhimmi principle. Pancasila puts Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Buddhists on an equal level. That's not only a revolution in Islamic thinking but also a translation of the mystical ideas of the great Sufi Muslim Ibn Arabi into a political program. The Sufi Islam's tolerance and its rejection of any dogmatism becomes a basis of political reality in Indonesia.<br /><br /> In this sense the fight in Indonesia is not one between local traditionalism and secularism introduced from the outside. It's more a conflict between santri, an Islam clinging to the letter, and Abangan Islam, the more flexible Islam which emerged from a synthesis between pre-Islamic cultures and Islam. Abangan is secular but still original, therefore not a fashionable idea of Western-influenced intellectuals. Pancasila is the highest expression of freedom of religion. In contrast to religious indifference in Western civilizations, the Pancasila-based freedom of religion does not mean a rejection of religion but freedom of religious pluralisms. It's an Islamic-Southeast Asian extension of the Lessing formula.<br /><br /> The decisive point is that this first monotheistic principle of Pancasila came from the Islamic periphery and not from the Islamic center where the definition of Christians and Jews as \\"dhimmi/protected ones\\" i.e. second-class believers is still dominant. The original Islam didn't know neither Confucianism nor Buddhism nor Hinduism. Southeast Asia enriches Islam not only by recognizing these world religions but also by putting them on equal standing with Islam.<br /> It therefore offers not only a model for domestic peace in this part of the world but also a promising basis for an Islamic-Christian dialogue in the Mediterranean region. The Mediterranean Islam can learn a lot from the Southeast Asian Islam. Can the periphery become thereby the center?
B0087ITC56|4.0|\\"Flight\\" is the first live-action Robert Zemeckis directed film since \\"Cast Away\\" back in 2000 and after viewing it you'll wonder why Zemeckis took so long to return to the format. This is the man who brought us the \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy, \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\\" and \\"Forrest Gump.\\" Despite how charming \\"The Polar Express\\" might be, Zemeckis kind of wore out the alluring nature of motion capture animation with the sub-par \\"Beowulf\\" and the decent enough \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" Zemeckis is at his best with his live-action roots. \\"Flight\\" is also the first R-rated Zemeckis film in over 20 years.<br /><br />Expectations going into this were somewhere along the lines of, \\"So this is basically going to be Denzel Washington portraying Quagmire from 'Family Guy,' right?\\" \\"Flight\\" is driven by alcoholism and the belief in God. Whip (Washington) is an alcoholic, but refuses to admit it. He drinks constantly, relies on cocaine to even him out, and tends to have sex with whoever he can. He has an ex-wife and a fifteen year old son who want nothing to do with him. Whip is eventually put under investigation with not only his job on the line, but jail time as well. Whip lands a plane that fell apart in the air; 96 of the 102 passengers lived because of Whip's incredible maneuvering in the sky, but alcohol was in his system so that's where the jail time could come in.<br /><br />From the very first scene, you know that R-rating is going to be pushed to its limit as there's plenty of nudity, vulgarity, and drugs as soon as Whip is woken up by that phone call from his ex-wife early in the morning. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but there's this rushing close up of Washington's face as he does a line of coke before it jumps to the next scene that is pretty great. You're introduced to how serious Whip's addiction is as he takes oxygen hits before the plane takes off and dumps alcohol into his orange juice while he's talking to the passengers. This may be the performance of Denzel Washington's career as he finally seems to be stepping outside his comfort zone and delivering in ways you didn't expect going in.<br /><br />The flight sequence itself is done in a very realistic way. It's already pretty intense when they're trying to get through the patch of rough weather, but turns into a white knuckled frenzy once the plane begins to malfunction. Your breath quickens as the events inside that plane become horrifying and the devastating aftermath will leave you completely breathless. You see Whip get pulled from the wreckage, but the film suddenly switches to first person and you see what Whip sees. It's pretty extraordinary.<br /><br />The hospital scene is really emotional as Whip wakes up and is told the extent of not only his injuries, but the crash itself. As Whip talks to Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), there's this moment when Whip is smiling but tears begin to stream down his face that just breaks your heart. John Goodman is the funniest he's been since \\"The Big Lebowski\\" as Whip's friend Harling Mays. He plays interference for Whip during the investigation as he brings Whip everything he needs while reporters wait outside of his condo. On Whip's last night at the hospital, he steps onto the staircase to smoke and meets a heroin addict named Nicole (Kelly Reilly). The cancer patient they encounter in that stairwell (James Badge Dale) is the most entertaining character of the film and you'll wish there was more of him. He's extremely humorous and witty while offering a little bit of insight.<br /><br />As the film progresses, Whip loses more and more control. It's kind of ridiculous what finally triggers Whip to realize things are bad. Losing his family didn't do it and neither did being responsible for six people losing their lives, but once blame is about to shift directions that's when Whip decides he's had enough. The film also teaches you that if you're incredibly drunk, you can just do a few lines of coke to even out. That bathtub full of cocaine you've got sitting at home will finally come in handy. The ending also feels like a bit of a cop out. It becomes more acceptable after you see it and you're looking back on it, but it still feels like a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />\\"Flight\\" slightly comes off as this glorified support video for AA, but the main (and even most of the supporting characters) are written so well that you can't help but sit back and enjoy the ride. It feels like Robert Zemeckis is finally back in full swing as Denzel Washington taps into some talent you may have forgotten he had. Gripping and sentimental, \\"Flight\\" puts one man's downward spiral on display to show that one broken man's journey can be pure intoxicating entertainment.l of cocaine you've got sitting at home will finally come in handy.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use and add additional locations.  I am very pleased with this product and recommend it  to others.  It was very helpful for tracking the effects of Hurricane Sandry.
B002H6ZQRM|5.0|This is definitely in my top ten of all time.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the Laurel and Hardy, the Lewis and Sinatra, the Harold and Kumar (errr), of our generation.  Clever dialogue, awesome buddy pic, hillarity ensues.  Must see
B009VB97EY|1.0|Like many other viewers I wanted to like this movie and thought it would be funny & amusing. It was neither. I wasn't expecting a great film but I wasn't expecting something this bad (lousy dialogue, mediocre acting, childish and sleazy plot).
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I kept reading to find out hoe it was going to work it self out.  I felt like I had<br />it figured out and then it would take a twist. Just like all of Jodi Picoult books<br />it always keep you interested.  Looking forward to more of her books.  I got this from Amazon for my Kindle.
B0086700CM|2.0|on my kindle fire the game continues to freeze up but its the closest thing to streaker run (a 5 star game) and that's why I like to play it.
B004DMIIO6|5.0|As many reviewers have stated this is a Japanese Robin Hood story that is a lot deeper than that Kevin Costner trash that passed for Robin Hood back in the 90's. The characters are fleshed out really well and you feel the connection with them. I watched a few times to understand everything that was happening and I suggest you do the same. Buy the film and watch it a few times let it sink in. The English dub isn't bad I didn't find it offensive as some but I prefer the subtitles and hearing the language the actors were speaking during filming. The last 3rd is dark and full of action, the later fight scenes are nothing short of amazing the cinematography during these scenes gives you a 1st person view of ninja magic. At the low price the movie is at now I wouldn't hesitate to buy. Enjoy!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I am hopelessly addicted  to this game!!<br />It draws you in so completely, you won't remember to eat or visit the W.C.!!  LOL<br />GET THIS GAME!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I began watching the 7th Season with low expectations.  I became disappointed with Dexter after Season 4 as some of the murders became inplausable and I thought the series lacked the creativity and suspense of the first two seasons.  The show's pattern of watching Dexter stalk other serial killers became too familiar with less attention focused on character development.  In my experience, it is *character development* that makes a series like this so watchable.  With Season 7, the show has restored itself to a level of viewership found in earlier seasons.<br /><br />In Season 7, while Dexter's character continues to evolve, the show focuses more on Deb's character.  Watching Deb and Dexter interact is fascinating - they both evolve in their relationship as each learns more about one another.  As Deb learns more about Dexter, we watch with anticipation how she reacts as she battles her own demons.  The evolution of Deb's character takes center stage in this season, a break in the series.  Dexter's new nemesis - the head of a crime family played with charm and great intensity by Ray Stevenson - is far more complex than the killer in Season 6.<br /><br />Yvonne Strahovski does a terrific job playing Hannah McKay - a mysterious and cunning character who has the rare opportunity of getting close enough to Dexter to earn some of his trust.  One of the more philosophical questions this season poses is the cost/benefit of making yourself vulnerable in relationships.  And Erik King makes a welcome and sometimes humorous return playing Doakes during flashbacks - the only person who was on to Dexter from the beginning.<br /><br />A great show like Dexter takes the audience to a place it's never been before.  In season 1, we had a glimpse for the very first time how a serial killer might think and feel on an intimate level.  In Season 7, the audience is taken to another place we can only try to imagine: what would it be like to learn your brother was a serial killer?  How wouldyou feel?  And what would you do if your job was to protect the public from the very kind of person your brother had become?  Watching someone work through the complexity of these emotions makes great television.  To keep this series fresh after 6 seasons, the show had to do more than its already done.<br /><br />The producers have made wise decisions by taking the audience back into new territory.  So if you've watched the other 6 seasons and are thinking of quitting, give this season a chance.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|About half way through the novel and it is all I anticipated. Plus the bonus of the character John Brenner from \\"Up Country\\". What a combo Corey/Brenner. So far DeMille has \\"wetted my appetite\\" with the persona of both characters and their realistic attitude toward the Goverment, their job and life expectations!?! I am looking forward to the latter part of the novel. Also I can honestly write that I would like to see further adventures/novels/movie (re. movie, probably be disappointed when the writers bastardize the story line!?!) of either or both characters. Thought the description of Yemen at the begining of Chapter TWO was very accurate.

0316228532|3.0|I had heard about J.K. Rolling's first adult novel and had not heard good reviews so I put off buying it. However, it was given to me recently as a gift and I was thrilled to read in Rolling's pioneer effort. As a writer, I like to support other authors, even when I am not sure about the book at first. The first few pages with too many characters thrown at the reader confused me. I had to refer back and forth time and time again and went on ahead. By page 149, I thought good heavens, when is a PLOT going to happen. Rolling's talent is definitely with character development and I came to know them well and pictured them in my mind. The plot finally did unravel and at a fast speed, and the book was worth hanging on with. I always like to see a moral angle in a book and I was not disappointed. I certainly applaud Rolling for stepping into new territory and would support her in anything she does as many of us do. This book? Glad I read it, I would be very hesitant to recommend it without saying to other readers know that in my view, it's a long read with paydirt coming way down the line. Also, my largest objection is the profanity from seemingly EVERY character had; it was not necessary. It got tiresome and offensive, frankly. I would love to sit down with Rolling or hear from her as to why she made everyone so profanity speaking, it really wasn't necessary. I look forward to seeing Rolling's next book, she's done a lot to bring reading to the youth and I really appreciate that.

0316212377|5.0|Like most other reviewers, I've been a fan of the Culture stories for years... What's not to like? Omnipotent ships, wide screen space opera, mind-boggling weapons and action, brilliant writing and characterisation and a rich vein of humour.<br />That said, the books of the last few years (excepting the brilliant Surface Detail) have been increasingly hard work... It's been a period of grim subject matter and Banks getting trapped in a cul de sac of trying to describe the indescribable intelligence and thought patterns of the Minds. Still miles better than anyone else of course, just not the master at his best.<br />The Hydrogen Sonata is a real return to form however... it's a pacy, amusing and just plain enjoyable romp.<br />As some reviewers have said, there are a few undeveloped plot lines that wouldn't have been there in the early novels (think Phlebas, player of Games and Use of Weapons...)... But these don't detract at all from the impact of the book.<br />Just think of the M. Banks name as a kind of guarantee of quality... 90% of his best is streets ahead of Asher, Reynolds et al...<br />Well worth it a read and if you are new to Banks, not a bad place to start.

The quality of the songs and the sense of mood created by them are probably universally appealing. Lost in A Lost World, For My Lady every track is successful. The is the sight of a good album. Many group have so many fillers or lesser songs. However all tracks can hold up on their right or when taken together they are all excellent.

0761171703|5.0|The photos in this book are so true to inner joy. Every image is a reminder to recognize beauty in the ordinary - in our everyday lives. You don't have to be a dancer to LOVE THESE PHOTOS!!! I really can't say enough about this except that I absolutely love every page.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Very smooth open/close action. It should have been a part of the camera. No more worries about losing lens cap.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|There are many many many different copies of Blade Runner. My advice, get this one.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Blu Ray<br />+You Get all the different Blade Runner Films in this copy.<br />+Awesome Picture Booklet/artwork from the film.<br />+Tons TONS! of extras.<br /><br />Cons<br />**really, none. Not one single con here**<br /><br />If you love the film, pick this up right now. It wouldnt look any better than on Blu Ray. I only paid 23 bucks for this awesome collection. Money well spent.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Movie was OK. I was expecting more based on the energy of the preview.  The singing didn't seem very well synched, I even started the movie over a few times in the event there was a problem with the signal.  That fact alone cheapened the experience for me and tainted my rating.

B007TK77QE|5.0|This book was so amazing!<br />I am a real Harry Potter fan, but I still loved it, even though it has nothing to do with Harry Potter.<br />Rowling writes so good, and for what I have heard, it is amazing how like reality this book is!<br />Keep writing Rowling!<br />And to the rest of you: Buy the bloody book, trust me, it is worth it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book, \\"Gone Girl\\", went from ordinary to OMG I can't wait to see what happens next. I thought I knew what happened a few times and I was fooled. I've recommended it to all my friends!
B0016CS0IK|4.0|I really like M83.  I prefer slightly more upbeat albums however.  That's not to say it's bad, and my rating is all about personal preference not a judgement on the quality of the music, which as we all know is in the eye of the beholder.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Heard about Castle from many friends, and we finally got Season 1, then 2 and now half way through 3.  Season 2 was great and continues with the same great characters.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|While I didn't buy this game on my Kindle Fire, I did own the game on console. I also have it on PS3. So I know its an amazing &amp; fun game. However based on the age of the game, as well as the fact its an app for a tablet device makes the price of $15.99 outrageous!!!! I would be more then willing to pick this game up if it were priced at $4.99 or less. I would get it today even. I just can't see this game (no matter how fun) being worth $15.99. I would suggest picking it up on PS3 or on a old console. One can even go so far as to get a Game Emulator on PC and get all the Final Fantasy Roms. So in closing this is a great game, an amazing RPG, and one of, if not the best game app I've seen in the app store. The only thing that brings it down is the extremely HUGE PRICE!!! I honestly don't feel any game, book, music or any other app in the app store should never be over $4.99 max for games,  $9.99 max for movies, $6.99 max for books, and $3.99 Max for music. To have a game app priced at $15.99 is just being really greedy. I can see if it were one of the newer Final Fantasy games though I still hold firm on my above stated price points. If you want to play this amazing title wait for the price drop. For I don't see this game selling much if at all at its current price. So either buy a used console and the game, or download a Emulator and the game ROM and enjoy this amazing game. I will list my top 3/5 fav. Final Fantasy games. Those I would suggest getting on a used console or with the Emulator &amp; ROM combo.<br />1. Final Fantasy VI<br />2. Final Fantasy III<br />3. Final Fantasy VII<br />4. Final Fantasy VIII<br />5. Final Fantasy IX<br /><br /> There are quite a few more but I will keep it at my fav. top 5. So if your looking for amazing old school RPGs the above list is a great place to start.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is not a mushy romance novel but is full of action and suspense. It is not a book for teenagers and I would rate it \\"R\\". Killing Floor is a rather bloody book, but in the old style of James Bond or Nick Carter it ranks pretty well with them. The primary character, Jack Reacher has a rather odd lifestyle as a wandering hobo. He uses his skills as an retired Army SP with Green Barret and sniper training. There is a lot of violence and sex in this book and overall a good read if you are into that kind of thing.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|It's a double album physically, but it's really not.  There are a lot of short tracks, \\"between\\" type tracks and about 1 whole album worth of full length songs.  But those songs are excellent, and this has already become one of my favorite albums.  If you like this style of music, you'll love the album I think.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it- ready for more in the series! I really enjoyed both books- was sad for # 2 to end!
B001NHNG64|3.0|This was a journeyman's book. Coherent and evenly paced. The most interesting thing about these books is the notion of being a person \\"Off the Grid\\" and how liberating that would be. An fairly pure expression of the Lone Hero -- no possessions, no family, no entanglements no papers. A man who won't be, \\"Briefed, debriefed, filed, indexed, stamped or numbered\\". ( for those of you old enough to remember The Prisoner ).  The flaws in the book are the areas that strain credulity where he is not ever impeded by system. This is a BIG problem in the next book -- I have not been able to finish it for just that reason.<br />However, not to digress, this is a solid book and a good story.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book had everything; history, family, love, tragedy. I just can't say enough about how good this book was. It was sooth reading from the first word. I have recommended this book to many people.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed if this is your next book.
B0064W639K|5.0|I love batman comic since I was a little boy. The mask, cloak and the suit are simply awesome. Batman movie is one of my favorites, and comic series are even better. I'll brag about this book and my friends will be hilarious too, l guess.

0345803485|4.0|James pens a character driven romance full of inner conflict and nail-biting tension with \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\" Christian Grey is a successful businessman determined to dominate in all things. Enter Anastasia Steele. She challenges him at every turn. Dare he give his heart to her?<br /><br />Set in contemporary Seattle, Anastasia is a grad student who interviews Christian for her friend, Kate. Ana and Christian can't deny there's a charge of attraction between them. Later, Christian finds Ana and they have a coffee date. Christian would like her to enter into a relationship with him. For Ana, Christian's proposal is shocking, but she's game to try. However, when she wants \\"more,\\" is Christian willing to meet her in the middle?<br /><br />James uses a strong character voice that easily pulls the reader into Ana's world. The story is written in the first person, present tense. At times, I found the present tense a bit disconcerting, but the characterization is so strong, I enjoyed the novel very much.<br /><br />What makes the novel resonate is the characterization. Christian is forceful, bossy, dominant even, but he reveals to Ana another side of himself that he hasn't before. Ana is strong, made of \\"steele.\\" She may be willing to try Christian's suggestions, but she speaks her mind all things.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Lots of fun. And not necessary to spend real money if you don't want to. The dragons are neat. I am addicted.
B008G12ERC|3.0|It's a decent album unless you compare it to Muse's other albums.  I think Supremacy, Madness, and Panic Station open up the album in good fashion, but it more or less goes down from there, with a few partial exceptions, until it closes with the title tracks, which are up to the standards I've come to expect from this amazing band.
0451450523|5.0|Yes, that is right! Beauty is only skin deep. This novel explores the issue of vanity in a very complex and simple to read fashion. What if you are an immortal being that has no concept of time? What if you willing left all you knew to enter the world of danger? This is what the unicorn does. She is a bit vain to begin with. However, she slowly finds out that humanity is much more complex than she could image. The novel goes into great detail to assist the reader in understanding the characters. However, it leaves just as much open for interpretation. It is great for concepts such as Questioning the Character (CTC) and Questioning the Author (QTA). This is a great book for critical and creative thinking.<br /><br />Students, who have never seen this book, will enjoy the connections it makes with the reader. It will allow them to escape the the world of reality. In fact, it will allow them to be silent for the minutes they are reading it. It will affect them as well in a positive manner.<br /><br />This book will make a great addition to classroom libraries around the world. If you don't have a copy, get one. If you have one, get another one to give away.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this book very interesting initially.  It was intense and the characters were believable.  The scenarios were a stretch but not too extreme.  Unfortunately for me, as the book progressed it became more and more bizarre and just not possible in my world of experiences (including TV).  I read to the end hoping for some kind of resolution to all the turmoil only to find it sizzle and die.<br /><br />I gave it a 3-star because I was very interesting at times and did finish it.  I wouldn't recommend it and probably wouldn't read this author again.
B008OOYALE|4.0|fun game to bad so many things cost real money. other than that Id say shorten the time on a lot of things.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|the lesson that is learned is that when something is limited in quanity it takes on greater value. on the contrary if this \\"item\\" is unlimited in it's quanity it is not desired and has very little value
0525457585|5.0|The Never Ending Story, which is a originally German, was introduced to the United States a few decades ago. Michael Ende is know for numerous works of fantastical fiction, which contains meaningful characters. What makes this book unique is its concept of comparisons and contrasts throughout every page. This is evident when Atreyu is on his quest and meets the three gates. However, many, who have seen the film, do not realize that the novel consists of 26 chapters. You can also name them with the alphabet. Thus, this book is a great method for teaching students the Alphabet, without using rote methods.<br /><br />The plot and theme are well structured and are perfect for elementary, middle school, and secondary school students. It is also a treasure for teachers and parents alike who want to read to their children.<br /><br />Although there are people that make criticism of this book, they need to realize that this book presupposes a certain age, which is why the wording is simple. Also, it is meant to be easily understood.<br /><br />In education, it provides a i+1 concept for 3rd to 5th grade students. However, it enjoyable as a fun read for those who grew up with the book.<br /><br />It is my hope that this short review is helpful for educators and parents.
1607885743|5.0|I love this book. The newest character has just that, character. He has feelings and a mind of his own. That does not say that he goes against what his job entails, he is just very real and caring. Thought I could listen to one cd at a time but this one kept me awake and wanting to listen to more and more. I think David Baldacci is probably the best author we have today. If you are a fan please read this you will not be disappointed one bit.

B0084IG7KC|4.0|A fan of the books, I was let down the first time I saw the movie.  Not alot of developement of the interrelationships between the characters.  When I gave the movie another go, I found it to be alot better than the first viewing, and if you're a fan of the books, you'll probably want to have this in your collection.  The digital copy is great for us...we like to take them camping, and watch them at night in the tent.  Good buy.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|The basic problem with Brave is just how inconsequential the plot is.  The heroine protagonist is charming, but unfortunately nothing interesting happens to her.  The film feels over before it even began, and the themes are so provincial its hard to really get involved on the scale of a film.  Its almost feels more like an extended medieval Scottish sitcom.<br />Without spoiling anything, the flame haired lead, Merida has to break an unwanted spell.  The way the spell is broken turns out to be so simplistic and lacking in obstacles, that the movie has to invent a bunch of very weak contrivances to pad out the film's finale.  The only audience for this film is very young children, if that.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A MUST READ!!!!<br /><br />A book that makes me fall in love with Gideon and Eva all over again. I loved it.<br /><br />It is one of those books that on an emotional level is so true to life. There are a ton of us out her scarred for whatever reason and carrying those things into new relationships.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has written a story that takes us all inside of the lives of these emotionally fragile individuals and gives us an honest and often painful look at what its like to try to love after being abused.<br /><br />All I can say is WOW. I am truly amazed. Also, the love scenes are amazing, but I love that this book would still be outstanding without them. It is enough for to peer into these characters lives and watch them try to make this thing work, while rooting for them along the way.<br /><br />I have run the gamut of emotions from being upset to hot/bothered(thinks to the love scenes) to laughing to feeling pressure in my chest from the sadness.<br /><br />I am going to be on pins and needles having to wait for what comes next. Please hurry that along Sylvia.

B008RZF2I0|5.0|Let me just say, I discovered Seventh Wonder last year, and was completely blown away by Tommy's vocals. They instantly became a favorite band of mine, and I wondered how I haven't heard of Tommy before. I thought it was only a matter of time before he gets discovered. I've been listening to Kamelot since 2002, and have always loved Khan, but just like everyone else, I noticed a decline in quality with Poetry for the Poisoned. Especially in Khan's vocals. There are some songs on that CD that are almost intolerable, such as The Zodiac. Black Halo was, in my opinion, Kamelot's absolute best album. So when I heard Tommy was replacing Khan for good, I was saddened by Khan's departure, yet extremely excited to hear new material with Tommy. After listening to the album multiple times already, I can say that it truly is amazing. There's this aura/vibe to the band that is unmistakable and captivating. Tommy fits so well into the band, it's scary, and I can't help but feel incredibly happy for him, as he has real talent and was discovered by a successful band that tours the world. Despite Kamelot following a somewhat consistent song structure as they always do, the songwriting and music just works on all levels. People have mentioned that there are instances where Tommy sounds identical to Khan, and I can hear the resemblance at times, but after listening to so much Seventh Wonder, I can easily pick up on his distinct vocals.<br /><br />This was the perfect addition to an aging Kamelot, (Remember, Kamelot has been playing for 21 years now) and adding a powerful young singer like Tommy to the mix has already brought a fresh element to the band. I absolutely look forward to future albums, and I feel he will meld with the band with ease. It won't be long until we start hearing his full vocal potential. If you want to hear him in full capacity, listen to Seventh Wonder where he lets it all out. Since this is his first album with the band, Youngblood may have held him back a tad,but it in no way affects the outcome of the CD. It's by far their best release since Black Halo, and I find the songs stuck in my head all day. Amazing band, amazing singer, amazing music, amazing album. Don't question it anymore, just get it!

0670022705|2.0|This was certainly an interesting concept.  I do question some of his choices.  But anyone will have a valid opinion about a list of anything.  I do have a few gripes.  First, the worst photography I think I've ever seen in a book.  Most of us have never seen most of these objects.  We still haven't due to the dark poorly rendered photography.  Second is the writing.  It's textbook.  It's boring, stilted, murky, uninspired writing.  I skipped the back half of a lot of the object write ups because I couldn't force myself through the writing.  It would have been an infinitely better idea to get some really good non-fiction writer to take on the task of explaining why the objects were important.  He also frequently quotes academicians for their insight and those are terrible too.<br /><br />So, an interesting book.  But I'm sad when I think it could have been a great book.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|The movie had solid special effects and scenery, but the protagonists failed to draw me in.  Charlise Theron played a haunting witch, but it didn't really matter, since I never cared much about Snow White.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I was really enthusiastic when I heard that Ms Rowling had decided to write a non Harry Potter book; my feelings were short-lived. This is a 400 page book and I thought that it would take a hundred or so pages to get into it; I then said \\"OK -- let's try 200 pages, because something must happen soon!!\\"<br /><br />Well I got through over half of  it and still there has been little or nothing -- other than teenage sexual desires! What a complete bore!<br /><br />Ms Rowling -- go back to Hogworts school!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The premise was good: effect of a death on various members of a village, but I found it too complicated to follow to savor the intended portrayals.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is by far the Best Performance's I have ever seen even surpassing the 10th Anniversary, the video is crisp, clear and outstanding sounds one could ever want in a DVD of this incredable show, the cast and music are absolutely the best next to seeing it live, and is well worth it.

B0071XO8RA|2.0|The most positive things I can say about the Wool Omnibus are that the prose is decent (though never thrilling or beautiful) and the basic concept (the \\"world of wool\\" so to speak) is fairly interesting (though never quite intriguing). I had a feeling the author had spent countless hours imagining details and working out all the connections. Even so, I read Wool 1-4 and then decided I owed it to myself to dispense with reading Wool #5--which (unless there are a number of appendices) comprises nearly half of the Omnibus, so even at its bargain price, I felt I'd wasted my money. Wool #1 is the most rewarding of the five and the only one that can stand alone. The other four are all dovetailed installments, each one skirting around the same central mystery and evidently inching toward some climactic revelation--but the movement within each installment is very slow, in part because each one introduces a new main character (entailing a fresh round of back-to-square-one exposition and re-orientation); and in part because the prose bogs down in too many picayune moments. It's possible I missed a marvelous payoff at the end, but getting there wasn't worth the effort for me: I was simply never captivated, didn't really care how it all comes together. The weaknesses of the Wool Omnibus are numerous, but the slow pacing is the deal breaker: by the fourth installment I was only reading the first sentence of each paragraph, just getting through as quickly as possible (more like reading homework than reading for pleasure) and sad to say I could still follow the narrative quite easily that way, so again, not that much is really happening, and there aren't any key insights along the way. The second major flaw is the interchangeability of major characters: there are a lot of them, and they all have nearly identical personalities, the same ernest and stalwart virtues, despite their differing bodies and different roles in wool society. There are simply too many heroes here, yet they all seem like clones.

Once I got over 100 coins, I had a hard time using them up anyway (level 85 or so) .  I hope they don't suddenly decide to delete this game (I had that happen with my toddler's favorote one).
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Van Morrison at his best.  His music is relaxing to the brain and soothing to the soul, and this CD leaves no doubt that he was Born to Sing.  Life couldn't get better stepping out of the rat race and being wonderfully entertained.  What a gift!

B003HARV3Y|1.0|I loved the book so much and could not wait to see the movie. I watched it right after the first Harry Potter movie, which was surprisingly accurate and very enjoyable. Did Percy meet the same results as Harry? No. Everything changed so much I am now re-reading the first book just to make sure it wasn't that horrible. The memorable scenes, laughs, and coolness from the book are gone, leaving the movie to feel like an enhanced Dora the Explorer episode. Percy uses the map on his quest and gos to 3 different locations complete with 1 obstacle to overcome. I understand some elements have to be left out because of run time, but the company was able to cram almost every event of Harry Potter in a reasonable length, so I understand how they missed almost the entire story of Percy Jackson.  To top off bad plotline, the CGI is awful. The monsters aren't scary, they look fake and unnatural. The battles look faker then fake. The cast is horrible as well. I never pictured Grover as tall and muscular, I always thought that he was rather puny. In fact, almost everybody is muscular. Did the people who made the movie even read the book? I could complain more, but I think the movie is really summed up. Read the book, avoid the movie. I will not be watching the sequel, either.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this book faster than most. I can only say how much I appreciate the personal sacrifices our armed forces give for this awesome nation, the home of the free and the brave, AMERICA! Thank you from me and my family from the bottom of our hearts!
1423140605|5.0|[[ASIN:1432772708 Modern Disciples: Volume 1]]<br /><br />As always, Rick Riordan delivers. The story was fast paced, plenty of action to keep you enthralled, suspense to keep the pages flipping, and an intriguing study of applied mythology.<br /><br />This installment he tells the story from four characters points of view. The first two one would expect, Percy and Annabeth. The next two threw me a bit: Leo and Piper. I wonder if Riordan watched the show \\"Charmed?\\" Anyway, the reason these two threw me off was because I thought Jason's story would be at the forefront. Though while not pushed to the side completely, even Jason admits that he spends most of his time knocked out or possessed. I do hope Jason will have a stronger focus in the next story.<br /><br />That leads me to my only real bit of bad news, depending on how you look at it. This is not the last book in the series. The next book coming out will be called The House of Hades. The title will make sense when you finish this one.<br />Great news for Annabeth fans, as I stated earlier, the story is told from her point of view. She gets chapters named after her and everything. This story is her true opportunity to shine as she matches her wits against one of her mother's ancient enemies. How she deals with this situation is a true homage to the Greek myths of old with the hero being out class and out gunned and relying on nothing but wits to get out of the situation.<br /><br />If you follow this series, this is a great addition. Only word of warning though, if you did not like the ending of the second book, this one will be even worse for you.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This album is just brilliant.  The first time I listened to it, I felt a bit indifferent.  The second time, I payed closer attention.  The third had me hooked.  Now, I can't get enough of it.  I highly recommend it.  Can't wait to see them perform next year!

1608871517|5.0|This book is absolutely stunning.  The book itself is gorgeous, big, heavy, classy covers.  The photos inside are beautiful.  Michael Bush obviously had great affection and respect for Michael.  To be honest, Michael doesn't sound like he may have been the easiest person to work for, LOL, always striving, always wanting to top himself.  So many interesting details (did you know Michael made himself a \\"bedazzled\\" glove as a youngster in the '60s)and there is a picture of the inside of the Thriller concert jacket that lights up showing all the wiring inside the jacket. Bush has some wonderful stories about his time with Michael, love the story about how particular Michael was with his Florsheim loafers!  The last chapter deals with Michael's passing and it can't help but bring a tear to your eye.  I cannot say enough about this book, I have alot of Michael books and this is probably one of the best.

I have never been compelled to write a review for any of them until now because this is the first time that friends and family members wanted to know my opinion of a book that they are interested in checking it out themselves.<br /><br />My advice is this: If you are fan of the wildly popular Harry Potter series and am hoping for the same magic here, I'd say look elsewhere. The Hunger Games trilogy, the Percy Jackson series, novels of Diana Wynne Jones, Hilari Bell, Tamora Pierce etc. You would really do better just simply looking elsewhere.<br /><br />In the months leading up to its anticipated release, the publisher marketed the book as a tragedy comedy or a black comedy. I'd say that is an inaccurate representation of the book. There is hardly any comedy here. The book reads like a sad tragedy that slowly unfolds and unravels through the course of the book, like those often depressing classic literature like Anna Karenina that school teachers love to make students read for academic purposes.<br /><br />For those reviewers who hated the book and mentioned not being able to read past 100 pages of the book, I'd say this: You got to persevere a bit more; you actually have patiently wade and yes, slowly but surely slog through exactly the first half of the book, about 250 pages or so, before you hit paydirt and the story picks up and really begins to engage your interest. I'd not give a summary of the book here since it's already been written about numerous times not only on the blurb itself, but on several other reviews as well.<br /><br />The first half of the book is really slow, as Rowling has to invest a lot of words in establishing her huge cast of characters, and there are so many of them that you will often find it difficult to remember who is who in the story at times. The book reads mostly as a portrait of middle class snobbery and can be sometimes one-dimensional and occasionally funny in its portrayal. Clever and vividly descriptive turns of phrases do elevate the prose at times, but for the majority of the time, Rowling's writing here is mostly workman-like.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to my friends and family? No, if you are looking for something along the lines of Harry Potter. With this book, it seemed as though Rowling tried to distance herself as far as she possibly could from Hogwarts and pen a book under a genre that is a total polar opposite of the famous boy wizard, although I shouldn't have been too surprised since Rowling has always been an outspoken advocate of social causes, having suffered through poverty first-hand before. But if you'd think you'd enjoy an engaging and interesting read about the miniature of English middle class snobbery in a small predominantly White conservative town, with social themes woven in that can be a tad heavy-handed at times, I'd say give it a try. You might be surprised at the unexpected small nuggets of gold you can mine here.<br /><br />Did I enjoy the book? Yes, once I managed to get past the first half of the book, I enjoyed the second half tremendously. Was it worth reading? Definitely yes, in my opinion.<br /><br />Would I have picked the book up if it had no been penned by Rowling? Honestly, no. I mostly read fantasy fiction with a smattering of historical fiction thrown in, and this book clearly does not fall under those genres. Like many others, I was simply curious about what the writer of Harry Potter would come up with that was separate of the intricate and complex world she built with Harry Potter.<br /><br />Three stars from me.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|good game, took me a while.  i liked the searching ouzzles and liked how they were used over again. good overall graphics and other puzzles.  i woukd gave liked a little less scary aspects onky because my 6 year old likes it and i really have to skip some scenes and worfing for him.

044654759X|5.0|Wow, this was an amazing story, so amazing i cldn't put it down. I finished it the day after it arrived. It had everything, suspense, curiosity, drama, thrills, humour and romance just an amazing book. I recommend this book 100% to every Nicholas Sparks fan.
0525953728|2.0|If readers are looking for secrets there aren't any. Just some specifics that were not in the news. More of a blow by blow description  of the work of this Seal along with parts of his own thoughts of his life as a Seal. I enjoyed Chris Kyle's book of his life as a Seal more then this book. But each to his own!

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I've read most if not all of Albom's books and this was a bit different. He sometimes deals with the abstract but this was more like fantasy. Fairly tightly woven tale with a moral. Put it down a few times but enjoyed the book. Thoughtful.
B008L1PYQU|5.0|I can only think of two albums I know of that I've actually liked the revisited version even better than the original. Pearl Jam's Ten Redux, and this.<br /><br />This was the first non-Ktel album I owned as a kid. My brother got it for me for Christmas. We were absolutely obsessed with KISS. As I grew older, I stopped listening to a bunch of their catalog because it wasn't as strong. This album, though, is top notch, yet I had also stopped listening to it much because it has a few of the tracks that you hear ALL THE TIME on it.<br /><br />Well, this remix is so well done it's like hearing these songs again for the first time. The vinyl edition is nicely packaged, and sounds phenomenal. It doesn't sound like a new album, but it just sounds better.<br /><br />I only wish it had come with a download code. Oh well, I'll just rip my brother's CD. Sorry Gene, but I've bought it enough times. I'll pay you for these remixes on vinyl, but I'm not paying again for the mp3s.
0812550706|5.0|Let me first start by saying that I don't think this is the greatest book ever written.  It's not the best book of all time, nor the one that will go down in the future as the Illiad of the 20th century.  But it is the book that started my journey into Science Fiction, and for that I will be forever grateful.<br /><br />Back when people could enter airport terminals without having a boarding pass, my uncle came out to see me for a few hours while I was traveling alone as a not-quite-teenager.  I don't know how the conversation started, but it eventually came out that I had not read this book so off to the bookstore we went, and by the time I was my next flight I had a fresh new copy of Ender's Game and a promise that I would read this book over the summer.  Not only did I read it, I devoured it, and since that time I have read it 13 times, all of them by the time I was 18.  This new literary world that I discovered later brought me to Asimov, Heimlein, McCaffery (I know some would argue with it being included as Science Fiction, but the later books...), more Card and an entire Science Fiction class just devoted to my new genre.  I later went and started reading Fiction, Non-Fiction, Historical Fiction, and basically anything that I could get my hands on (this includes cookbooks).  This book changed my view on reading from \\"because I had to for school\\" to \\"reading because it was actually enjoyable.\\"<br /><br />Like I stated at the beginning, this is not the greatest book in the world, but to me it is the most important.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I was looking for a good read - and I also wanted to prepare<br />myself for the upcoming movie version of Les Miserables.<br /><br />You have to be able to read way more details than you might want to,<br />but the writing is powerful.

1451695195|1.0|This was the worst book I have ever read. It is full of info about the author and his family and life, but the little he says about the afterlife is fairy-tale like and not informational at all. He obviously meant to write an autobiography which is all this is. I laughed at the girl on a butterfly wing as she had no importance in a story of this kind.<br />DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie very intertaining, could watch it over and over.3d was awesome was like being part of the movie. Would recommend this to everyone.

0316228532|2.0|Tried so hard to like this book...but perhaps a person shouldn't have to try hard to like a book at all.  As a person who loves using four-letter-words, I found the use of them in this book unnecessary.  It was as if Rowling was trying too hard to write an \\"adult\\" book.  Mostly I was a bit bored and quite honestly, I didn't get past page 65.  I also tried very hard to forget about the Harry Potter books, which I absolutely loved.  But The Casual Vacancy just did not grab me, as Potter did, in the very first chapter.  Perhaps one day I'll pick up The Casual Vacancy again and give it another go.

The 2nd season is a little more slower than the 1st due to character development and setting the stage for the third season but enjoyable none the less.  Check it out and you'll see why it's one of the best shows on TV.

0307279189|5.0|You don't need to be a runner to love this book, but you'll probably want to be one before you're halfway through.  The author does a great job with this story.  I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down.  It was suspenseful, insightful, moving and educational.
B004UZ66M2|5.0|I've been a fan of Haruki Murakami for a few years now and I have yet to find a single work of his that is not entirely brilliant. His mastery of literary form, alongside Jay Rubin's beautiful translation, makes for an amazing experience! Murakami is bound to receive the Nobel Prize at some point in his career, it's only a matter of time!
1439152802|5.0|I was so impressed with this book.  Being a HUGE fan of her earlier works, I thought nothing could top them, but she has managed to do it again.  As soon as I finished it I put my copy in overnight mail to my mother so she could read it too, and then we can talk about it.  My mother lived through World War II (in the US) so I know she'll appreciate the historic parts even more than I did.  I told her to keep notes -- at 92 she sometimes forgets minor characters.  But, once again, a brilliant ending, caught me completely off guard, even though I'd been watching diligently.  As soon as my mother has finished the book, I'll ask her to send it back to me so I can read it again.  So happy for the way the plot resolved.  So intriguing.  I wish I could sit down and just talk to the author -- what an amazing brain she has.  Now I have to wait for her next book!

B004IFD9HE|5.0|Love, love, love, the movie! Kept the kids entertained and giggling for hours after the show was over. Good fun for everyone!!
030758836X|3.0|I read this book with an expectation of suspense and mystery. In the beginning, that is exactly what I experienced. The premise, a wife gone missing on her five year wedding anniversary, had me wondering from the start. With the introduction of each new character and twist, I found myself trying to resolve the story in my head, anxious to read how it would all turn out. And then I got to the end and all I could think was, Why did you build me up? To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The book flowed perfectly until the end, where it appears as though it had to be wrapped up and no real thought was put in to how the reader would feel with the lack of resolution or justice. I like to put a book down satisfied with the ending, whether it is happiness or sadness for the characters. In this case, I put the book down and thought, Really?<br /><br />I have three categories when it comes to my opinion on books: buy it, borrow it, or burn it. In this case, I would recommend borrowing it knowing that the beginning will build you up only to let you down by a severely anticlimactic ending.
B005J29HCQ|3.0|I own the two disk set and while I do enjoy quite a bit of it, I have a feeling that if this album came out as intended in the 60's it would be a niche record and would not have made a market splash.  Not that the market is everything, but I think it would be among the great forgotten records.  Compared to other albums of the era this is very fragmented and veers too often into the unusual and quirky.  I think a lot of the love for the album is from its mystique.  Over the years the legend has been built and it is quite the story, but I think the story bleeds into feeling about the album, which people generally were positive about for years before this was actually released.  It's not bad, nor is it legendary quality.
1451627297|5.0|With the publication of 11/22/63, Master SK has done something that I was doubtful would ever happen again. He has overwhelmingly silenced his critics, written a brilliant novel of depth and believability and created a work that slides effortlessly into the high five of his canon. Arguably, this is King's most poignant and human book to date. If you can buy the premise of a time portal residing in the corner of a greasy diner, the rest of the book is as palatable as anything the horror meister has ever written. For those who pay attention to foreshadowing, there are no surprise endings here. As King reminded us dozens of times, \\"The past is obdurate.\\" Perceptive readers will grasp very early what that means, but the beauty of this book is that it is so exceptionally developed and craftily constructed, that most of them just won't care. The motivation to read is encapsulated in the unfolding of the story. The journey is the reward, and I submit to you that it is one of the best journeys of recent years. Jake is the most unlikely hero imaginable: teacher, dullard, milquetoast. He embodies a certain everyman quality that all people can relate to, whether through personal reflection or acquaintance. His development is remarkable, made all the more so by actions that ring soundly of real-life decision making. He becomes what any of us might have, given the circumstances. Sadie is a grounded cornerstone of humanity and stability in the face of Jake's shaky and uncertain arc. She is one of the finest female characters King has ever written. As to other players from small-town barkeeps to no-town property owners to big-city reds, the supporting characters are almost all excellently rendered. I won't ruin it for those who have yet to read, but long-time King fans will be treated to Easter eggs that make you feel like you're in a special inner circle of author confidence. (wink, wink) In a time travel novel, the most critical element, and the trickiest to get right, is the conclusion. Too often, the reader is left with a bitter taste of disappointment. There are few other genre niches that are as rewarding to read about and as depressing to conclude as time travel. You will have no such issue here. I can say with certainty that this book ended exactly as it should have and that isn't to say that it ends the way I wanted it to. There is a moment in the last few pages that is as emotionally piquant as any SK has written and will live in my book memory for the rest of my life. Like it's characters, this book transcends time and space. I would not be surprised if 100-years hence, this novel is the one that has bibliophiles still applauding the name King.nclusion.

0345528581|5.0|I have read several book about weight training so far. Some books are really good for those professionals who want to spend more than 2 hours a day! But I can't spend that much time and effort. This book provide a 30 minutes a day, 4 days a week time saving workout which really works. And at the same time, this book provide lots of useful knowledge about weight training  theoretically that tells you the science behind the workouts!<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great book for any non-professional like me！<br /><br />BTW, the app for this book is also highly recommend!
B004IWF64Q|3.0|If you read other reviews, you probably having a great deal of people who hate this movie. I definately see their point, but I still like it. I tell you why I like it. I like it because it is realistic to me. People change and sometimes when you believe you close to your dreams life changes. See in the real world the movie would make sense. I believe Pocahontas fell in love with John Rolfe, because he understood her. He learn more about her when she got into Londa. She loved him, because not only did he understand her but also because he learned to respect her. She was not afraid to stick up for what she believed in which in turn made him respect her. The previous main character John is a really life guy in the real world. People change. I believe when everyone thought he was dead as well as Pocahontas, she realized that she was missing something. It happened not to be the previous John. She learned she was missing being her. She was sick of hearing everyone tell her what to do. In this movie, she learns what she wants and goes for her. Good for her.

0553801473|2.0|I feel that I'm not alone in loving the first three books of this series, being iffy about the fourth, and nearly ready to give up when it comes to the fifth. Even from the get-go I wasn't convinced that George R.R. Martin is a brilliant writer-- I think he's a very creative story-teller, but that seems to have gone to his head and now he's dragging us along, trying out new convoluted plot twists that at this point are just too intricate or off-balance. Five books into a series, a reader has basically decided whom they're rooting for. We all have our favorite characters or our favorite plotlines, and Martin isn't doing himself any favors by ignoring those and introducing new, less interesting ones. At this point the plot needs to move quickly, and it doesn't. This book is one slow build-up to soemthing that might or might not be worth it. That said, here are the things that really aggrivate me abou these novels:<br /><br />1) The constant descriptions of clothes. If there's action going on in a scene, and one person enters the scene-- doesn't matter if this person is important to the plot or not-- Martin has to STOP the action completely to describe in very vivid detail what this person is wearing. I just don't care. Setting the scene is important, but not when it interrupts what's already in motion.<br /><br />2) Rape. I understand that this world is pretty tough 'n rough, but I find it pretty hard to care about how Westeros will fare in the end because Westeros seems to be the rape capital of fantasy literature. Seriously. Rape and abuse is treated so casually-- even by the seemingly moral characters-- that it makes me not really care WHO ends up as king or queen. Sounds like the majority of people in this country are pretty rotten. Maybe they deserve a rotten tyrant.<br /><br />3) Cliffhangers. Every single chapter has nothing to it until the last paragraph. Everything before that is just build-up to the inevitable twist that occurs at the very end of the chapter. The twists are pretty good, but it never seems worth it to wade through all that mire just to get to it. I feel like every single character represented in this book could have had his or her story told within one chapter. Bad editing.<br /><br />4) New characters. This is the biggest annoyance of them all. There are already SO many characters in this book it seems ridiculous to keep introducing more. What's that you say? Someone ELSE wants to be the king of Westeros? Well get in line. I was happy when the contestants started getting killed off, but now there are more adding themselves to the roster and it's just getting ridiculous. If anything, Martin should be diminishing the number of characters he's focusing on because at this rate it's going to take five more books to tie up all these loose ends.<br /><br />I started out a fan, but I don't know if I'll be able to continue with the next books that come out. It's gotten sloppy and ridiculous, and I hope that Martin's editors do a little research and correct the mistakes that have been made next time around. Goes to show that an author isn't perfect just because he or she wrote a hit the first time around.

1469984202|5.0|The Omnibus edition comprises 5 books of the \\"Silo\\" saga.  Book one \\"Wool\\" is probably the best short book I've ever read. I found myself re-reading line after line to make sure \\"did read what I just thought I read\\"? \\"Let me get this straight\\"? \\"Are you f'ing kidding me\\"? Wool is brilliant like a \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode because it's a story that cant possibly never be dated (always relevant).  It's got a femme fatale, a massive love story overlapped by another fairly large one, a great villian. In short it has everything. It's not so much of a page turner as it is a \\"WTF is going to happen in these next few moments\\".  In fact Hugh Howey transported my body into the world that is \\"Wool\\".  What are you willing to do to keep the status quo? What are you willing to do to NOT keep the status quo? No character introduced is safe from harm in this story. They may not be killed off, but they will certainly be tested.  Ultimately though it's a story of the hero's or heros journey.  I read somewhere that Ridley Scott bought the rights.  I see this as movie, but I somehow see it even more as a AMC series. Thanks Hugh for giving me this gift. I just now saw a book 6 available. Click! It arrives next week.

I LOVE HIS DRUMMING I PRAY HE GET OVER THE HATE HE HAS FOR EVERYONE. I HOPE PETER AND ACE WORK THINGS OUT I BEEN MESSED OVER TOO SO I AM NOT JUDGING HIM AT ALL. TO ME IT WAS A GREAT READ!
0316227706|5.0|I met Seth on the plane traveling from Chicago to LA for some of his press events.  Not only is he an incredibly talented photographer... he is an amazing person as well.  We chatted for a while and then he casually, humbly mentioned this book he just had published.  He pulled out he book and I was shocked!!  The quality and content of the book are amazing.  I sat for quite a while going over each photo, hearing stories about the dogs, adventures at the shoots, and sentiments he has towards his work.  You can tell he loves what he does and that emanates through every single page.  The book brings out new and unusual personalities in the dogs... some make you laugh, some are kind of ferocious looking, some make you think about the soul inside this incredible creature... all in all an amazing collection of photos.  You won't be disappointed with this book and if you are ever lucky enough to meet Seth, you will feel like you have made a new friend for life.
1419703692|5.0|This book is a MUST for any 'Batman' fan! Tons of awesome behind-the-scenes info and top-notch photos. Well worth it to have on the table for repeated browsing.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like the combat mode a &amp; the ability to collect diamonds to buy upgrades. I also like the fact that you can generate resources like wood in larger numbers at the various factories.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Maybe it's Hollywood. Maybe it's the glitz of film musicals. Maybe it's Tom Cruise. Whatever the 'it' is, I quit looking at it 2/3 through. There are people who love to see musicals in the cinema. There are people who don't. I am in the latter group. On stage and live makes musical theater, musical theater. (The only musical I ever enjoyed on film was The King and I.) Hollywood is too slick. The people are too pretty. And far too often their personalities overwhelm characters they portray. I wasn't looking at the character Brand was supposed to be, I was looking at Russell Brand. He acted like the Russell Brand I see when David Letterman interviews him. Who was Brand in the film anyway?<br /><br />Why did I watch? I love the music. Just close your eyes and listen. I did.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|Loved the movie so much that I just had to buy the cd...great for exercising to at the 'Y'.  Takes me back to my high school days when acapella was common.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|Great game. The best in its category, however it will not let me reinstall on my phone. Previously was playing it and loved it. But now it tells me it is uncompatible with my decice. Will amend to 5 starts as soon as this is fixed
B0086700CM|5.0|the graphics are cool. this is an addictive game; very easy to play. love playing it on my kindle. I play it everyday.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Th detail of the violence was utterly amazing... Peeta's love for Katness was so wonderful, I loved it. Though I was forced to hate the Capital I found it so... interesting. I think over all the book could become a go to for me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was an extremely well-written account of very complex characters that definitely held my attention. It was the perfect answer for keeping myself busy during Hurricane Sandy. The plot twists and turns were actually unexpected and unconventional.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app for my kindle fire, I'm able to listen to the readings with this app. every one should have this app.
B007704HO6|5.0|I saw this book in a shop and being a cat lover myself I just knew I had to read it. So glad I did as it was an amazing story
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great! Im on it 24/7! Its definitely worth the price! The only thing- if your device's battery dies, all of your memory of that app will be deleted and you will have to un-install then re-install the app. Other than that, i love it!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Love this movie, a true classic film. Grace Kelly is a natural \\"princess.\\" Cinematography and location are superb. What a shame movies today have to put all the trash in them in order to get attendance.  Says a lot for our current society. Thanks Amazon for making this available on instant video.
B007RXRSEY|4.0|I am a big AlterBridge fan and Myles Kennedy fan. This album seems to overshadow his natural born voice with SLASHMANIA. I mean I like Slash as much as the next guy but why this unholy marriage? Myles voice on the AB ballads and rocking tunes is perfectly set. Here it seems to be overrun. I feel like its an uncomfortable marriage where none of the participants doesn't want to hurt the others feelings.  I also think that Myles can outplay Slash's guitar. Shine on you crazy Diamond.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|Would be even better if it were longer, but other than that its a very funny and entertaining book. I love the oatmeal and can't wait for more books to come out.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I have a 4th gen IPOD and was looking to use bluetooth headphones with it. Well this little dongle does the trick. Its works like a charm and I am happy. Nuff said.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have always enjoyed Ken Follett's books and the Winter of the World was no exception. It was a page turner and hard to put down. The history was well researched and described in such a way that you felt you were there living every incident. I am sure you will enjoy this book and it is an easy read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|there's no lag in the servers. no real freeze ups or anything. not a bad game to keep someone busy and keep them havin fun.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I thought at first that this was going to be a dry book and a chore to read.  Then it started moving right along and I was caught up the story and characters. I really got into the plot.  The author had a great way of pulling you in and making you think.  Love the story line
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I just got an Angry Birds Space Update on Nov. 2 2012 and it didn't erase my progress!! THANKS ROVIO!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|does exactly what it says. a couple more features and it would be 5 stars. I use it every day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good books, I really enjoyed reading them. I would highly recommend that anyone who like romance and suspense reads them. So fascinating the way he(Christian) makes all those changes for her (Ana).
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Pleasantly surprised by this album. I didn't know much about Awolnation a few weeks ago, but now the album is on repeat in my car. Awesome stuff.
B00008S7KC|1.0|I was unable to view the DVD. It was made in a Mac format that was unable to be read by my Bluray player or my girlfriend DVD player. I gave the DVD to a friend and he was only able to view it on his Mac computer. I do not own a Mac and this was not what I was purchasing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|for some reason, this game keeps me entertained for hours. kindle fire edition works well and looks great. fun game!
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I think this type of thing is horrible. I got this app when it had decent permissions and then I see an update available. New permission required. Now they want to have access to my network info. For what!? No reason for it.<br />Very poor practice putting an app on the market with good permissions and then putting out an &quot;update&quot;  with the bad ones in tow.<br />Uninstalled and will delete from my account.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I'm so mad I have been playing this game for about a week now ut sucks cant buy the power ups get kicked out have uninstall sucks. plz fix
B008OOYALE|5.0|best game ever I had a blast got all of them and then some would recommend to others to play
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I haven't quite finished Winter of the World but have enjoyed it. I like following the characters and their children that were introduced in the first book and although it is not great literature it's the kind of page-turner that holds your interest and gives the reader an easy to understand overview of the war. It's a very long book that reads quickly and easily.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it was so intense!!!<br />I would really recommend this book to anyone interested in Greek mythology and adventure.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Even though I enjoyed the movie, I thought the writers could have created more weird events in the hotel itself. The funniest line in the movie was Penelope Wilton's Line that she was busy all day naming the cockaroaches.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|the reason I gave this four stars not five because its very slow and when I don't play it for a day it makes me restart the whole game.But other then that I really enjoyed it totally and its JUST LIKE TEMPLE RUN its like the same thing but better I got bored of temple run in a week but this game I wont be done with it in an year ha ha well this is totally my opinion so don't hate me for only putting an four not five.Thanks for reading my opinion.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Very good follow-up to their smash Sigh No More. \\"The Boxer\\" remake with Jerry Douglas is top-notch. Each song is definitely Mumford & Sons, but I'm eager to hear them stretch their boundaries a bit more. I don't want them to fall in to the \\"more of the same\\" trap.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! The buttons are nice and big, and I love that you can see the calculations from the previous entry while your working on the next one. I use it all the time. It's perfect for balancing check books and I love it when I'm out shopping. I can always figure out the best deal, it's been a real life saver.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|MUST SEE MOVIE!!!great movie of all time. i really do enjoyed the action from IRON MAN 2. i recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I was turned on to this app by a good friend of mine and he really knew what I was looking for.  Great app to keep you up-to-date on the weather.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The characters are boring and immature with no real development during the story, saying that, I can understand why bored un-sexed house wives would enjoy this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A good time waster!  I enjoy solitaire on my IMAC and MAC PRO so this was just another extension of my play time.  Thanks for the effort and the no charge.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Please, it's the big bang theory, as long as the cd's aren't scratched when my fiance opens it on her birthday all's good. It did arrive as scheduled and unmarked so she doesn't know they are dvds
B0083EM24C|5.0|As to be expected from Passion Pit, candy for your ears. The transition from Manners to Gossamer is flawless. All the songs have similar themes to them, it's no secret the album is dedicated to someone but it doesn't get to interfere between the band and the fans. Gossamer is music you can sing your lungs out with.
B004I744AS|5.0|This distionary is great. It contains synonyms and antonyms as well as dictionary definitions. You'd be hard pressed to find a better one on line.
B008SOSBJM|5.0|Absolutely love the album! It's been eleven years since their last album and this definitely didn't disappoint. They're amazing and this album proves just that. No Doubt is a timeless band.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|Fast shipping to Hawaii! Cool product! Assembly took some time as I had trouble understanding a few of the pictures, but fairly simple. Tried some practice cuts and by my 3rd wine bottle the stars aligned and I got a near perfect cut! Make sure you follow the directions and not score the glass too hard/deep. I was so excited to use this I forgot to put oil on the cutter part like it directs. I put olive oil (lol) on before my 3rd bottle which is perhaps the reason why it separated perfectly. Did 2 perfect bottles in a row! Super glad I bought this! Seriously, other reviewers who rated this poorly probably did not follow the directions correctly or had complaints with other aspects like shipping. That's my guess because this tool is really cool!<br /><br />(it helps to watch the video by Dan Rojas that another reviewer mentioned. \\"Wine bottle cutting in 30 sec.\\")
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham at his best. This captivating story has one cheering for a lawyer /federal prisoner who vindicates himself while making the feds look foolish!<br /><br />Loved it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed this book from the beginning.  I liked the way that the author took you back and forth between the husband and the wife as good guy, bad guy.  I was always switching between them as to whom I was supporting.  However, the ending or lack thereof left me questioning why I read this book.  I actually thought my Kindle broke or did not download the rest of the book.  No editor, or publishing company should have let this book be printed with such a horrible, anti-climatic ending!  It didn't leave me wanting more.  It left me wondering where the last page was.  Do not waste your time reading this book. You will be disappointed.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Excellent from start to finish! It was great watching how the different characters dealt with their own situations,Piney threating Clay to come clean or have the letters about him & Gemma shown to the club,Juice's situation in being a possible rat,and with Jax taking control of the club at seasons end. As far as I'm concerned,the series could go on for another five seasons &still be excellent!
B007SXB498|4.0|Classic story of life and love. A bit difficult to read in the old English but having seen the movie made it more understandable.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|My son was disappointed that the gun doesn't shoot more than 10', and it isn't even remotely accurate.  Looks cool but doesn't perform.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano Guys and their CD didn't disappoint! I think that everyone should give their music a try because I know you'll love it :)
B004XVMCMQ|3.0|I've never read the book Mansfield Park so I can't really attest to the accuracy, but as a stand-alone Period Piece, I was less than impressed. I live for these kinds of films. For me, there is no greater perfection than Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility. I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but I just haven't gotten around to reading this particular novel of hers. However, I am just going to assume, that it was no way as risqué as this film! There are a few scenes here that left me bewildered and sort of stunned. Lewd stares and leers, artisitic depictions of rape and abuse, and a creepy uncle/niece vibe that I just couldn't shake.<br /><br />So the story goes: A 10 year old, very poor girl named Fanny was somehow chosen to live with her incredibly wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park. She believes it is only temporary but she remains there for years, growing up, and doing...well, I'm not sure exactly what her role is supposed to be in the new household. Here is where I started losing interest, and it was only 10 minutes into the film... Is Fanny supposed to be a servant or helper? A ward? For someone who was brought up in such a poverty-stricken environment, she is incredibly bright and learned. Now obviously it appears her education was continued at the Park, but these are all assumptions. In once scene she is seen serving her aunts, and in another she is galloping away on a horse with Edmund, her Uncle's youngest son. She is clearly enjoying her time and life there. She writes(alot), horses around, and is usually in good-spirits. And then in another scene she is being dismissed by her aunt like a servant. It's somewhat confusing.<br /><br />Frances O' Conner as Fanny is a decent choice, but a bit too old in my opinion. She is not entirely likable either. Her relationship with Edmund seems sincere and sweet, but then at other times she just seems out of character. She accepts and then(the next morning) rejects a proposal from a handsome, wealthy man for reasons she is only guessing at. She deems him untrustworthy and false, but she doesn't mind flirting with him regardless. Oh, and she practically throws herself at him when she first agrees to his proposal, sealing it with a brow-raising kiss.<br /><br />I think the thing that really threw me off this film is, it just doesn't feel like a Jane Austen adaptation. The way the characters act and speak just feels innapropriate for the time period and just wrong for Austen. There are nice, bright moments here though that can't be denied, and once you get past the icky fact that Fanny and Edmund are (first) cousins, their relationship feels genuine and heart-felt.<br /><br />Besides plot and characters, I love looking at all the different costumes that usually come with any period piece. Once again I was dissapointed. Nothing seemed up to par and frankly, everything was just kind of boring. This is one film that is practially SCREAMING for a remake. It's time for a fresh start because I really think great things can be done with the proper director and actors.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Mission: Impossible is a 1996 action spy-thriller directed by Brian De Palma, starring Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Kristen Scott Thomas, Ving Rhames, and Jean Reno.<br /><br />Beginning in the first half-hour, where half the cast is killed (Don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler), Mission: Impossible makes it clear it will NOT be your typical spy-thriller!<br /><br />The improbable and thrilling action sequences and clever gadgets (the infamous latex masks!) are brought to life by Brian de Palma and Tom Cruise in probably the most realistic (Whaa? Mission Impossible realistic?) Ethan Hunt outing yet.<br /><br />Cruise plays the role he plays best: the (young) cocky action-hero, and plays it well, and the supporting cast steals the scenes (Look out for Vanessa Redgrave, Jean Reno, and Ving Rhames)!<br /><br />Mission: Impossible has everything you want from an action film: action (obviously), adventure, explosions, mystery, one-liners, a great cast (an added bonus, actually), humor, and big-budget set pieces!<br /><br />Strong Recommendation!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great price and great quality.  Easy to insert the Fire HD and the case does not impact the speakers in any way.
0316228532|5.0|No spoilers - it's a story brilliantly told by the author. The Casual Vacancy is not an easy book to read but one I found impossible to not to return to every time I put it down. Not at all what I expected even after reading the initial reviews - deeply moving and very uncomfortable in the way it held my own attitudes and behavior up for scrutiny.<br />I don't remember being moved to tears by a book in the last 5 years or ever feeling compelled to write a review but this story and the questions it raises hits home hard. I highly recommend reading it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started reading \\"Mockingjay\\" as soon as I finished \\"Catching Fire\\". Once I started reading it was all I could do to put it down.  When I did put it down, I couldn't wait to get back to it.<br />I am looking forward to the movies.  I will reread these books before I watch the movies. The series was that good!!!
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a truly great book. It is an intricate history of cancer and the various researchers who devoted their lives trying to find \\"the cure\\". An absorbing, easy to read book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is a very fasted paced and has one twist after another. A lot of book are easy to figure out the next thing that is going to happen. Not so with this one.  It is a very exciting book.  Easy to read and understand.  I can't wait until the movie comes out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|show game is cool I guise but I don't feel like wrighting that much so I'm going Wright a lot of junk. cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
B008OOYALE|5.0|good game. if you don't spend real money its more fun. I am level 32 with tons of different dragons without spending any cash.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i love this! so easy to use! never had any issues setting and has several extras like sounds and ways to turn off
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is definily worth the seven dollars. it even lets u play with ur friends. the game lets u ether pick creative or survival. it will have updates because they are still transporting the stuff from Java to what ever the devices use
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Truly this is the first book that has really,really made me think, in a long time. No matter what inspires the author, just realize he has many more skills than you do, to tell a story that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, and still surprises at every turn.  I plan to read Mr. Crouch's other works.
B00402FGEE|1.0|so playing on the ps3 which is up to date. I cannot navigate to the episodes with any certainty, there is only the slightest intensity change to let you know what you have selected, combined with ads at the beginning and tons of non-skippable warnings/disclaimers it takes about 5-10 minutes to select an episode to watch, more if you can't pickup the slight brightness change of the menu.<br /><br />The show however is the best sci-fi space show I have seen, but the menu design is horrendous
B008OOYALE|3.0|I wish I had never spent money on gold because I would have quit after repeatedly getting the same common dragons while trying multiple times to get super rarest and LE dragons.  It isn't fun to get the same dragons over and over again.  I continue to play, however, hoping to get lucky sometime soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fun I played this for hours and again I did not stop playing it. this game is better than temple run.
B008OOYALE|4.0|it is a fun game. with really cute dragons.  fun fun fun fun fun fun. fun fun fun fun. fun fun
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game and it is fun to have the story. The game also lets you have more than one player and you can start a new game or go to your saved game.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game. it van freeze sometimes. but love it. enjoy the awesome run. avoid the scarey monkeys
B0073XORLU|5.0|TAAB 2 did not disappoint. I'm a long time Tull lover, so I was probably going to like it no matter what.  But the first time I listened to it, I couldn't help but think I was hearing little bits of melodies or instrumentation that reminded me of just about every Tull record I'd ever heard.  The first time through I only picked up a few...Heavy Hoses, A, War Child and of course, TAAB 1.  However, the more I listened, the more I realized that it was Ian's look back at the last 40 years musically as much as it was a look back at the last 40 years of either his life or that of Gerald Bostock.  No wonder he made it an Ian Anderson album and not a Jethro Tull album.  It is far too personal.  This is about his journey, personally and musically, and it has been an honor to have been invited along for the ride.  Those familiar sounds have made this album more enjoyable to me than some of the lesser new Tull albums of the last twenty years.  I put it in my car and listened to it over and over again.  Soon after, I was humming bits of melodies subconsciously.  Now, I can't get it out of my head.  I can't wait to see it performed live in Newark, Ohio next week.  Even though it was Ian's journey, it fully satisfied my desire to hear new Tull.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|Great movie and Great quality. The scene at the end gets me out of my seat every single time! Definitely one of my favorites!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|new movie in perfect condition as promised for great price. My family loves this movie, it helped to complete our collection because we couldnt find a copy of this one in the store.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Cannot wait to see what is next.  Good read for anyone who appreciates romantic novels with a twists and secrets.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|This is twelve of the numerous Sherlock Holmes cases that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote through his lifetime, there are some issues within the text where the symbol for the pound appears as some sort of code, same with some of what I assume are meant to be letters with various punctuation associated with them, if it were not for that, I would give this five stars.
B000E6EJAC|4.0|I liked the CD, but it wasn't exactly how I remembered it, which didn't have anything to do with the CD or sender, just me.  But I received it in a short time in perfect shape and it did take me back to yesteryear!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I had it wrong for years, did not know the science behind gaining mass whatsoever, so I never did. It really is a simple science after reading this book. Mike Matthews debunks so many BS ideas in regards to training, supplements and really does shoot straight. I emailed him after I finished the book and I got a reply within 24 hours. I've already recommended this book to my friends and you will too.
B00004WNHC|5.0|I bought this for my son and he loves it. Great music and great sound. I would recommend it highly.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Best game ever . It has an interesting story, super fun. Very addictive  I can't stop playing it. Totally awesome !!!! I wish there were more games like this one.
B000V7J82S|5.0|I bought this for my son. This is such a great record. Nothing like listening to a vinyl record. Great sound and great music.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This is without a doubt in my top 5 favorite movies ever.<br /><br />The humor is complex and exactly how I like it - a little adult without anything downright inappropriate (my favorite is the use of the word \\"cuss\\" in the place of any obscenities - as in \\"this is going to be a total clustercuss\\"). The visuals/sets are stunning and oddly soothing (Wes' choice of warm colors is flawless and well detailed). The story is hilarious, the characters are wonderful and the voices are perfect. Bogis, Bunce and Bean are a riot just as much as the animal characters.<br /><br />I laughed out loud several times while watching this, didn't want it to be over and continue watching it on a monthly basis almost two years after first seeing it! Highly recommended!
B009XY97VC|5.0|Loving this release by 2 steps from hell, i love all there 3 public albums. There is some very different songs in this album to some of there previous work but i think this adds depth and character to there work. I personally think that the best tracks are compossed by Thomas Bergersen, Skyworld,El Dorado, Winterspell, blackheart are just some of my favs, he is a genius.<br />Well Done guys on the brilliant album. 5/5
0321811984|5.0|I have learned a lot with this book. I recommend it if you are interested for a new way of presenting your ideas.
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is not a book I would usually read, but I found myself interested due to the title and hearing about it from others in my book club. Upon starting the book, I was immediately suspicious of the husband (Nick Dunne). The writer does a good job casting him in a bad light and leading you towards the assumptions that sustain the plot in the first half the book. She paints a well developed picture of the troubled marriage and challenging circumstances which lead the main characters toward their 5th anniversary and the beginning of the mystery. Then you turn a page and are shocked with what comes next, not expecting the turn of events! It's a shocking surprise, but one that you will be impressed with since it isn't what you expected.<br /><br />The 2nd half of the book is where it gets really good, as you try to imagine the ending given the reality of the situation that you've been made aware of. It's similiar to watching a riveting movie and saying to yourself \\"I know how this will end,\\" and being shocked when it ends differently.<br /><br />The story is gripping and the character development in this book is fascinating, so it's well worth reading! Although it is slow at first, it will grab you in the middle and hold your attention to the end and you will probably be shocked at the very last word. Enjoy!
B00913DPW2|3.0|ok maybe I'm just not smart enough for this app but when game play goes from fun to frustrating in about 5 minutes, then what's the point? I had to consult the walkthrough for every move. The puzzles were infuriating. And like most games of this genre, there is no skip option. I like to try and do the puzzles but if they are too frustrating I will skip them. This game did not allow that so I finally gave up. Ended up being a total waste. If you like a challenge you'll love this app but it was a bit too aggravating for my taste.
B001F12J48|1.0|This 3D version came with \\"3d\\" glasses & the quality was awful. We have a 3D TV & all of the movies we have watched have been great but this one was not. The 2D blu-ray was good. The glasses don't fit kids well at all, so we watched it in 2D.  I imagine that is why the price of this movie was so cheap.
B008966SLM|4.0|I have to say that I listen to so many different types of music and with all of the releases over all the genres that sometimes an artist gets lost from me for a while and for various reasons, it's been a few years since I've listened to Robert Cray.  I originally discovered Robert Cray back when I was 16 and \\"Strong Persuader\\" came out.  My vinyl copy of that record has been spun more times that I would care to count and it is still the standard by which I have to compare to when it comes to Cray's music.  It's probably the utter and complete genius of that album that keeps this one at a very strong 4 or 4 1/2 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />I think the artwork on the album cover here tells you a lot about this record.  Robert wearing a fedora hat with his vintage Fender Strat in front of a vintage automobile, is that powder blue I see?  It all just screams as something out of the \\"Mad Men\\" era.  It's a timeless look for an album with some timeless Robert Cray sounds.  It isn't an album of an artist that has changed much since 1986's \\"Strong Persuader\\" and I think that's a good thing.  Cray continues to make solid blues music with hints of jazz and rock mixed in.<br /><br />As always it is Cray's guitar work here that takes center stage and it is in fine form.  There aren't many artists that have such a signature sound that you just KNOW the guitar playing is them, Mark Knopfler comes to mind, but Robert Cray has that signature sound.  The songs here are mainly about love and loss and are very story based lyrically.  There's a reason this guy wins so many Grammy awards, his writing and performance skills are second to none.<br /><br />Listening to \\"Nothin But Love\\" reminded me of just how good Cray is at his craft.  It's not quite as good as \\"Persuader\\" but what really is?  I will leave the review a little open ended and reserve the right to come back after more listens and after the music has had some more time to sink in to see if this one can rise to that mythical 5-star level.  The bottom line is this is a disc that deserves to be heard and I'm betting has a great chance at winning Cray another Grammy award!l 5-star level.

It now allows me to take pictures with my phone to store, and it stores stuff on my phone, but I still cannot receive or send picture messages to people. not sure if it is the card or my phone or both.

1591841666|4.0|Regardless of how you make a living, the lessons delivered in Seth Godin's The Dip will apply to you in some way. When collected, these dozens of useful pieces of entrepreneurial insight are dead on accurate.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers claim the book is too obvious. I disagree. Although the strategies may not be top secret guarantees for financial greatness, they are motivating. Reinforces what most of us know, or suspect, or are in the process of learning. Sometimes learned through failure. Mr. Godin, thank you for this positive book on quitting.<br /><br />If you pick up a copy, read it, then share it with a friend or colleague. I have, and have been thanked for loaning it.

Great work Ms. Skloot.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|The Blu Ray movie was much better than what I saw at the digital movie theaters.  Blu Ray's unbelievable contrast, dark image details, jaw dropping image depth and the emersion was off the charts, as Chris Tucker would say.  This is now my number 1 reference movie.  What a turn around.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|I have ordered several of the connection kits from other than Apple and have not had one work yet after the IOS update.  Prior to that update, they had each worked.  So, I decided to try the Apple interface since their website says that the interface works on the Ipad 2 and the Ipad 3.<br /><br />So, here is the good news, the SD card reader works with both my Ipad 2 and my Ipad 3.  Here is the mixed news, the camera connection kits works with one of my cameras but not the other.  If your camera requires you to hook up a cable, turn on the camera and select (PC) for connection, the kit should work.  If your camera has wake on connection to camera and download, it will NOT work.  Apparently the wake on connection draws too much power for the IOS update and it will not connect.<br /><br />While frustrating that my Nikon will not connect, I can at least remove the SD card and read it with the connection kit.  That is my reason for it being a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating.  While not exactly the fault of the connection kit that the IOS limited the power from the connection, it is an Apple product and Apple did change the connection capablity.<br /><br />Over all, I would recommend this if you are trying to use you Ipad instead of a PC while traveling and taking pictures.

It is thick, so there is a lot to read; but I still forced myself to read it slow to make it last. If you like time travel you will love this one, and how about a nice surprise? You will see the main character meet up with some of King's Characters from one of his older classic!

B004A8ZWVU|5.0|After hearing about the incredible reviews that The Help was getting in theaters, I decided I should probably read the book then see the movie (which is what I usually do).  First off, I LOVED the book!  It has become one of my favorite books of all time.  I loved how it is written in the POV of the three main characters, Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.  Such detail and so much history goes into the book of what really went on in Mississippi in the 1960s.<br /><br />Now on to the movie.  Of course there were pieces left out of the book (which always happens...and I really don't like that), but in this case, it worked in a way because some of the scenes from the book were in different places in the movie which I thought worked rather well (i.e. Minny telling Skeeter & Aibileen about the \\"special pie\\" for Hilly before telling Celia).  Other than that, I personally adored the movie.  The actors are amazing and everyone fit their roles perfectly.<br /><br />Although I adore Meryl Streep, I really think that Viola Davis deserved the Oscar for her performance as Aibileen.  She was just...I can't even put into words how incredible she was!  She really brought the character to life and I just loved the way in which she narrated the movie.  Until Doubt in 2008 I didn't really know who Viola Davis was; now she is up there as one of my favorite actresses!<br /><br />Octavia Spencer who plays Minny was GREAT!  She truly deserved her Oscar for her role.  When I was reading the book, I kept picturing her as Minny.  I already knew that she played her in the movie, but it was just so easy to picture her in the book as well.  She told the truth and didn't care who heard her!  My favorite scene was definitely when she brought Hilly the pie...that special pie just for Hilly.  I won't say any more just in case people have not seen the movie or read the book; but if/when you do, you will just burst out laughing!<br /><br />Emma Stone was brilliant as Skeeter (Eugenia).  I had never really seen her in anything serious like this before.  She has mainly been in comedies so at first when I heard she was in this movie, I will admit I was a little skeptical.  I am so glad I was proven wrong.  Emma portrays Skeeter to a \\"T\\" in my opinion.  From her insanely curly hair to her charm to the way she would mouth off at Hilly or her mother at times was great.  I do wish that we got to see a few more scenes of Skeeter and Stuart though.  And I wish we got to see her telling him about the book instead of his reaction.  But all in all, Emma gets an 'Easy A' (haha).<br /><br />Allison Janney...oh my goodness.  I think that the role of Charlotte was made for her.  She was really lovable at times and then you just wanted to yell at her (especially when you find out about Constantine).  I do wish that there was more of a build up to Skeeter finding out about her mother's condition rather than it being known to her already, but I guess that's what you have to do in movies.  Still, it was quite effective.  Especially their talk towards the end.<br /><br />And then of course there is Bryce Dallas Howard.  Oh Hilly.  Bryce was simply brilliant in portraying the villainess here.  She was just as sarcastic, rude, and stuck up as she was in the book.  I do wish that there was a scene (I think there may have been but it was deleted) where she convinces Elizabeth (the woman Aibileen works for) to get an outdoor bathroom for Aibileen.  However it was mentioned in another scene after the bathroom was put in.  Bryce really sold the character here and really made you hate her.  At times I forgot I was watching a movie!<br /><br />I cannot recall their names, but the two little girls who played Mae Mobley (or Baby Girl as Aibileen calls her) were terrific.  They could not have been more than 3 years old when this movie was made and they were simply adorable.  Like the title of my review, that is my favorite line she says with 'Aibee'.<br /><br />If you loved the book, chances are youwill love the movie too.  Of course the book has a lot more detail, but this is just a magical movie that is both dramatic and comedic at times and really tells the stories of what it was probably like for maids in the 1960s in the south.will love the movie too.

B009WJX10G|5.0|I really like this episode.  The cinematography was fresh.  I thought it was cool to watch the \\"monster\\" follow Sam & Dean trying to get answers what a clever concept.  The actors in this story really nailed it.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was an Awesome episode I love the direction this season is going.
B00001QEE2|5.0|This is an entertaining animation for the family. If you don't know your Greek mythology, this film will make you want to look up the original story. Disney takes great liberties with the storyline, but makes up for it with humor and music. I recognized the voices of the characters: Danny DeVito, James Woods, Rip Torn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Hal Holbrook, and Charlton Heston.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I don't have a lot of experience with other lights - but this one works well and has some nice features for changing color and using the camera's flash or the screen's LED.<br /><br />My only complaint is I would like to be able to access it easier.  But that is probably just my phone - I have to mess around trying to get to the app to load it.<br /><br />Would be cool if you could program it to come on by default when you pick up your phone and press the volume or something. In the morning I'm always up early scurrying in the dark trying to find my clothes and shoes - and don't want to turn on the light to bother the wife.  It comes in handy for that.<br /><br />Get it if you want a simple, easily adjustable light!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|From the very first song to the last second of this thirteen songs long album, I've listened, analyzed and was marveled at each of Jon Schmidt's key strokes, each wonderful note of Steven Sharp Nelson's numerous cellos.<br />This album made me **cry**, which is something the original songs did not. The Piano Guys have a way with music that is just outstanding, which makes every song a well of inexplicable emotions that mix up to create a wonderful symphony, reminiscent of the Classical era, but with modern influences and songs.<br /><br />Being subscribed to their YouTube channel (CHECK. IT. OUT. DO EEET!), I had already listened to pretty much every songs The Piano Guys released in the last two years or so, but I was still surprised at how addictive, relaxing and wonderful this album was. A masterpiece for everyone.<br /><br />I also have to add that the quality of the Album's recordings and mastering is flawless. Worth way more than it's cost.
0385344333|5.0|I have been a longtime fan of the works of Lee Child. His newest release \\"Jack Reacher: A Wanted Man\\" was wonderful.  His characters are so well built you can see them (definitely NOT Tom Cruise!) in your head and the action and suspense keep your interest.  I find myself reading as fast as I can at the beginning of each book and then forcing myself to slow down towards the end because I don't want it to stop.  Great read!!

B009XY97VC|2.0|First, save your money, this album doesn't even begin to scratch the awesomeness of their previous work. In fact, there are really only two songs worth downloading (\\"SkyWorld\\" and \\"For the Win\\" are must-haves, \\"Juggernaut\\" is fun in spite of its being extremely minimalistic and repetitive, \\"All is Hell that Ends Well,\\" \\"Starfleet,\\" and \\"Queen of Crows\\" - barely make the grade, get them only if you really need a TSFH fix.)<br /><br />Most are simply mediocre and wont be remembered (\\"Titan Dream\\" - starts out awesome before crapping out, \\"All the Kings Horses,\\" \\"Realm of Power,\\" \\"Winterspell,\\" \\"Blackheart,\\" \\"Dark Ages,\\" \\"Our Last Hope,\\" \\"Icarus,\\" \\"Big Sky,\\" \\"Breathe,\\" and \\"Ocean Kingdom\\") and \\"Back to the Earth\\" is just hideous.<br /><br />A diverse style is certainly present, kinda like TSFH couldn't decide on what they wanted to do so they just dipped their fingers into everything. Arabic fusion is present on \\"El Dorado,\\" there's a violin solo on \\"Blackheart,\\" metal guitar on \\"Dark Ages,\\" and \\"Our Last Hope\\" sounds partially inspired by the music of \\"Tron: Legacy.\\" Although the single addition of some dubstep on the first track was cool,most of the music is bland to the point of being lifeless. Lyrics are ridiculous - very much like something out of an Enigma song - and add nothing. Actually, the lyrics on \\"Back to the Earth\\" are so touchy-feely they sound like they were ripped from a Disney movie.<br /><br />It would be a major improvement if they offered \\"no choral\\" versions of the songs with lyrics. Out of the entire album, I'll probably copy four, maybe five, tracks to my pmp. Since I can only recommend at most 5/22 songs I'd rate this album 1.5 stars.<br /><br />I hope TSFH's next effort is more enjoyable. If anyone wants a good epic fix in the mean time, I'd recommend The Immediate or The Best of Brand X.<br /><br />Bottom line for the rock lovers: if \\"Invincible\\" and \\"Archangel\\" were akin to Linkin Park's first two albums, \\"SkyWorld\\" is like \\"A Thousand Suns.\\"

B009NQKPUW|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie.  Is it as good as Alien or Aliens?  No, but I enjoyed it anyway.  The acting is good and the story is not bad despite not being a true Alien prequel.  The special effects are good when they are there and the Engineers are cool too even though I wish they would have told more of their story especially towards the end.  All in all it was good and I'm glad I finally watched it.

B00992CF6W|2.0|I have to admit, mincraft is a fun game to play. Based on you have you have to start the game, it's not close to being worthy for the price of seven dollars. Why two stars you ask? Because a lot of people are interested in building and breaking so this game could steel their interest before they can even look at the price!

0525953728|4.0|This is a pretty good book. It's not ALL about the Osama mission. It reads more like a story line of key events is one seals career. I'm a former Force Recon Marine so much of the book didn't surprise me. Different terminology, but much of the same training and duties. The book revealed no secret information that I found what so ever, I was look, due to the big stink over it.<br />Good book, not action packed, easy to read and pick back up.
B00913DPW2|5.0|An enjoyable game. Lots of puzzles and mysteries to solve. My kindle did not want to respond well at times but none-the-less I had a great time playing. Hope to see more of this type of game.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It is a really cool game but it felt very short, wish it would had been more than 10 minutes to beat but I guess for 99cents what do you expect, please update or make another game just like this but make it worth our while and make it as long as possible with an indepth story.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Perhaps I had expectations for this movie that were too high for movie making these days. Spending more time on your characters then green screen effects seems to be something that the action/sci-fi production houses don't seem to think is all that important for modern viewers these days. It's not that Prometheus was bad, just that I expected to care a bit more. Oh well.

0525953728|4.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]<br /><br />In terms of the quality of the book, it was better than I expected. The only problem I had was a whole section or run of consecutive pages that were out of place in the book. This was toward the picture section.  This was confusing for me until I figured out what happened. It ended up being all there, just not where you'd think it might be.<br /><br />It was easy to understand and what I'd call a page turner. Also an eye opener, politically speaking. Well worth the $16 or so for a hard-bound book delivered to your door.<br /><br />Richard G Crum

B008RYN44U|5.0|\\"Easy\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album<br /><br />\\"Push and Shove\\" has a great sound to it<br /><br />I like all of the songs on this album, but these are my two favorites.  I really like this album because it doesn't sound like their previous albums - they did something different this time.  Not as much \\"ska\\" style as previous albums.<br /><br />So glad they finally came out with a new album.  I haven't stopped listening to it in my car since they released it.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Johnny as strange as usual...maybe just a little bit of a surprise ending. The video store dude where it was out of stock said I was wasting my time... he was wrong.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great Great Great Show! So original wonderful cast and SCARY! The house this is set in is so spectacular. You totally get drawn into the show as well as characters. Warp and twisted.. I am so hooked on this show :)
B0098VXE50|5.0|I had already seen this movie at the theater and enjoyed it so much that I ordered a copy for my own library. After rewatching it I found I'd missed a few things I hadn't caught on the big screen.
0060775858|5.0|My dad read this story to me almost every night when i was a kid.  So much he can recite the story without a copy of the book.  The memories having the book read to me are priceless. When i found out i was expecting, the 1st thing i purchased was a copy of \\"Goodnight Moon\\"
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have enjoyed the Cornwell books until the last three, maybe four.  The thrust is not the same and the reader is innudated with technical nuance that may impress other like-minded professionals, but tend to blur the plot and encourages 'skipping' over lots of verbiage that seems to do with impressing professionals than capturing the readers interest.<br /><br />Her early books were geniune plots of intrigue and the machinations of moving the characters around was an art form.  Lately, not so much. Scarpetta stands around more than anything else, her niece, the really interesting personality, is relegated to a vacuum and the story seems to center on technical tension that means little to readers.  The characters are almost stage props.  I was a bit disappointed.  Her early works stand as proof that she can write, but the last few stand as evidence of having lost the edge of her Scarpetta family tensions.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I fell in love with this story. The romance between Ethan and Ophelia was so tender and I was in tears by the end of the story. This is a great introduction to Rebecca Hamilton's or great bonus content for The Forever Girl depending which you read first.
B005QUQP76|5.0|Great Mouse for FPS. The mouse fitted my hand perfectly (considered normal size hand) and very comfortable to use for long playing time. The quick change in DPI setting is a plus for switching between sniping and assault combat. The mouse is very sensitive to movement and has a very quick response to your action. Some might say the mouse weight a bit more than others, but for me it was a perfect ratio. The plus side to it is that you can customized your own weight ratio. The sniper button on the side is very useful for those who like to play as a sniper. I found myself using every time I am using that class in BF2. All and all I am very please with the mouse.    Other thought: the software does not included with the mouse, but it can be easily downloaded on their website at [....]. Once installed, it is very user friendly and easy to customized.
1444737090|5.0|I so enjoyed the amazing story of bob and his devoted partner james.  james told us again of the wondrous bond we form and the absolute loyalty and unconditional love given to us by our kitty pets.  when we give them a forever home they are always there for us.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was so much better than first! I felt like the characters were more believable this time. I contemplated even reading this one because I was so disappointed with the first one but I am so glad I decided to. Now I can't wait for the third one!!
B008TMA1LY|1.0|This game has in-app purchasing, and *DOES NOT* tell you how much the item you're purchasing costs in real money. This, to me, shows questionable business practices on the part of the app developer.<br /><br />My daughter loves to play this game, and this morning I found a receipt in my inbox for $9.99 for 1250 Hello Kitty points. When I checked within the app, I found that nowhere does it say how much buying points costs. Caveat emptor, everyone. Buyer beware.
0553801503|5.0|Remember the Blackwater episode of the show in which Cersei got really drunk and was a super villainous mean girl while the other ladies feared for their lives?  This book is like a prolonged version of that with extra insight into the roots of her paranoia and twincestuous past.  The extent of her evil is, at times, gross and shocking but those elements are balanced by hilarious one-liners that could only be delivered by someone who is deeply embittered and has a terrible drinking problem.  Also, like another powerful female ruler from Westeros, she has to dabble in some sapphic affection because that is what Queens during the gap between husbands.  Without this book I might know about Cersei's actions and some of her spoken lines but I would miss out on the wonderfully sassy train wreck that is apparent in her POV chapters.  Witnessing her crumble under her own insecurities and missteps is not only satisfying, it's extremely entertaining.<br /><br />Jaime's POV chapters are also engrossing as he, like the reader, catches on to the full extent of his sister's disturbed psyche and needs some space to sort out his feelings. Arya's development is fantastic and weird while Martin's description of the bustling city she lands in is superbly written and a welcome contrast to the devastated gloom she has left behind.  Sansa continues to hone her skills dealing with crazy entitled rich people while keeping a smile on her face and I continue to admire that and wish I could channel that type of strength during my own work day.  I have to admit that Brienne's chapters dragged a bit but there is always at least one POV per book that I rush through and her storyline picked up considerably towards the end.  This book also has a bunch of awesome major and minor character run-ins.  A Feast for Crows does not have any Tyrion or Theon or Reeds or dragons but I don't hold that against it!  They are waiting for me in the next installment.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the fact that I am still addicted to this medieval fantasy soap opera this far in is actually pretty shocking to me and reveals a lot about Martin's ability to dispense and withhold plot arcs at just the right pace to keep me craving more.  Do not be sad like I was when I finished A Storm of Swords and glanced at the reviews for this book, there is plenty to look forward to!at I am still addicted to this medieval fantasy soap opera this far in is actually pretty shocking to me and reveals a lot about Martin's ability to dispense and withhold plot arcs at just the right pace to keep me craving more.

B005VEQR0W|5.0|Back in the 70's I used this albums (LP) to demo speakers because of it's quality.  This SACD version is amazing!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Loved this on my pc, love it more on my tablet. Can spend hours on it. Highly recommend to Spider solitaire lovers. GREAT APP!!!
B008R14YBK|5.0|I hadn't reviewed an album in a while, but this one deserves it. It is by far one of the best albums of the year. It is better than anything Colbie Caillat or even Taylor Swift did when they first started. This is a solid debut album. The fact that she actually wrote every song is impressive. The lyrics are fun and clever, with time she can be one of the best song writters in the world. Her voice is soulful and super fresh. This album is like nothing out there. It is hard to choose a favorite song, but maybe \\"All I See Is Gold\\".  It is great to see a \\"Disney Girl\\" get out of the pop field and try something new. Two thumbs up to Bridgit!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I could not function without this app. It makes my life work. Easy and everywhere. I treasure what it does for me.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I love the music of Joe Bonamasa. This CD is hard to not listen to when I'm driving. I'm planning on buying more so as to further enjoy the talents of this fine artist.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I utilize the reviews for every product i buy but i've never taken the time to actually write reviews.  Decided this is probably a good place to start.  I absolutely love this stylus.  My biggest concern in buying it was the width of it but after receiving it I can say that it is extremely comfortable in my hand and writes like a charm.    I ordered it because i thought i had lost my Wacom Bamboo stylus (which i've subsequently relocated).  I really like my bamboo stylus but can say with certainty that the Cosmonaut stylus has a better feel and writes better on my iPad.  I use the Penultimate app to take notes throughout the work day and this stylus is perfect for that task.    I initially read about the Cosmonaut on a great review article on The Verge [...].  They rated others a little higher than the Cosmonaut but i give this one 5/5.
B001OGLRRO|5.0|This album is fun to listen to. The music is like a party. It puts me in a good mood. I used to have it on a cassette tape. Too funny right?
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I hesitated for weeks before buying this. I wanted to be relatively certain it was good item, as I don't like buying worthless do-dads. Let me state I LOVE this item. Your hand goes on 25 programmable keys that are thru-lit with any color you like. Each of those keys can be programmed for up to 3 different keystroke/macro combinations. The LCD display displays game and system stats. It fits your hand. It looks pretty.<br /><br />But, the primary thing that has improved my games is that little tiny thumb joystick. It takes over motion, and combines with the mouse (which you should already be using for your pointing and turning) and makes spinning and attacking or running an almost instinctive measure. I thought it would be hard to get used to, but I loaded in Serious Sam HD, and started off. Where before I was mindful of conserving ammo, now I almost always have a surplus, as I use the chainsaw to take out most mobs. A were-bull or skeletal cow comes at me, and I simply play El Matador and dodge and carve them as they pass by, continue my spin, and carve them from behind. nd i can afford to have the chainsaw out as it takes a tenth of a second to select any other weapon that might be claled for. I've got the keys programmed so my pinky sits on the 1 key, with number 4 being my forefinger. (Fitting, I suppose :) The next row of buttons down is 5-8. To select my rocket lancher, I move my pinky down a half inch and the chainsaw goes away, and the rocket launcher comes out. Sniper rifle? Middle finger drops half an inch. I can call forth every weapon in the game without moving my hand, without using the mouse scroll wheel, all the while I am still maneuvering using my thumb joystick and mouse. Jump? I raise my middle finger half an inch and jump. (I selected that spot because I am used to using that finger for the W key or forward motion, so it was not hard to re-learn.)<br /><br />I have set up these keys the way that works for me. If I want to taunt another player, myforefinger goes up one inch and pre-programmed taunt gets sent while I am still moving and firing. You could set them up in any manner you wanted.<br /><br />The programmable keys are sweet. The thumb joystick takes WASD and gives those motions all to my thumb. And, It is omni-directional--I can move my character in a full 360 degrees. That frees up the rest of the fingers on my left hand to be dedicated to weapon selection or any other duty I want.<br /><br />And, as much as the thru-lit keys are sweet, you will find you don't need them. Your hand fits on the ergonomically styled pad in one position, and you don't ever need to move it. You don't need to look at the keys, and you don't ever risk putting your fingers on the wrong keys after moving your hand to hit a number key or some other key.<br /><br />I am using it for Serious Sam, and Guild Was 2. If you like games more complex than solitaire, you will love this.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|this is the 3rd book in a trilogy.  Supposedly its suppose to be very risque. Lots of BDSM  but in MHO it is on the very mild side really.  This book was really tame compared to the first book.  and I really did not see that as being all taht pornographic as ppl say it is<br /><br />Its really just a love story with a slight bit of edge to it. not the same old \\"Vanilla\\" as most romance novels.<br /><br />Oh and men not as much on the porn side as you have heard.  I have read other books with more detail and such than this series had.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|work right away after downloading. fast easy to use. panoramic option pretty cool. not to mention it's cheap but FREE would have ben better that's why i gave it a four

B009NQKPUW|2.0|and still was a bit confused.....very puzzle like with lots of pieces missing.  Seems like Ridley went for the money -- not the structured content we all like.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app except it sucks when you cant get any gold and it doesn't matter whether you get this app or not, but I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B005LAIIDU|5.0|It's all fun and games at Litwak's Fun Center, until someone gets hurt. While this cliche'd line seems to reflect the simple plot in most movies (while the moral outcome does, too), the setting makes Wreck-it Ralph a wonderful, refreshing, and unique pleasure. Inside a family arcade, all the game characters (both old and new) are real, and travel among the other games when the doors have locked. Ralph, from Fix-it Felix Jr., desperately wished to be a good guy, and be rewarded, so he sets off in search of a medal. By doing this, he sets off a chain of events that puts multiple games at risk, and unveils a hidden threat.<br /><br />Disney has made this film equally accessible by both parents and children, and I find that wondrous. At times, Vanellope sounded quite mature, and at others, just like a tod. Soon, kids will squeal in excitement when they find a Fix-it Felix Jr. game, along with other last-gen arcade delights. In this way, the film has rendered itself timeless, if only in that small way. Although it doesn't feature many of the games themselves, you are able to see many characters, including retired ones.<br /><br />Being inside a game world gave the artists a great deal of freedom, but they didn't waste it. At every new turn, another extremely creative point would grab your attention, and I'm sure I missed many (which would enhance a second viewing). Another big enhancement is the 3D atmosphere. I doubted I would ever say this, but I urge you to see this in 3D, or turn around and go home. Because of all the pixel-related artwork, and 3D modeling, it is natural to have such a dimension added on. It's the perfect film to have it for!<br /><br />Now, for all the extra material surrounding the movie. Similar to Pixar, Disney has included an animated short right before, called \\"The Paperman\\". It doesn't feature any voice acting, but it's hilarious, and very well-made. I am sure you'll enjoy it. Second, the end credits are worth watching through, but not because there's an extra scene (there isn't one). It's only worth it for the visuals during the credits themselves, in 3D.<br /><br />In conclusion, Wreck-it Ralph is family-safe, and highly enjoyable. See it in 3D as soon as you can!there's an extra scene (there isn't one). It's only worth it for the visuals during the credits themselves, in 3D.<br /><br />In conclusion, Wreck-it Ralph is family-safe, and highly enjoyable. See it in 3D as soon as you can!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was definitely not what I expected. Through the entire book I was left wanting more. Such a page Turner. I absolutely loved it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series for far I have recommended it to every reader I know. I cannot wait to the next book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing solitaire and this app makes that possible with my Kindle Fire. Having all kids of options customizes it so you play like YOU want to or mix it up for a challenge.
0545265355|4.0|Nicely put together box set of the Hunger Games Trilogy. If you do not have the hardcover books, this is a nice way to get the entire set. The outer box that holds all three books is made of heavy paper so it will over time get scratched but it will protect the books.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|I'd really like to rate this 5 stars. I do, but some change of actors/actresses was a little annoying. Of course this excludes Andy Whitfield's (RIP) omission. The change of Crixus's girlfriend (forgot her name) was the worst. But, a good show none the less.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game does require money, but only if you are impatient.  everything can be earned in game if you just take the time to allow it.  the goals give you added chance of earning game money.  I particularly like how I am able to breed any dragon even without spending my own money...furthermore, all habitats and farms are bought with ingame earned coins...not with your real dollars...unless you choose that route.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|As usual, it came with no scratches. I can't believe I use to buy dvds new and spend a fortune. I tell all my friends that buying used on amazon is the way to go. I have benn pleased with eveyone I've ordered.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Maybe this was good reading when it was first published over 100 years ago, but it can't compare with today's novels for readability and interest to modern readers. The characters are boring, and the book is about 200 pages longer than required to tell the story. It does give some insight into the lifestyle of well-to-do Europeans of that era. It even has an intelligent woman in it, which is more than can be said of some books from that time. The price was right: free on Kindle!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Cant put it down once you start your hooked. Like the different angry birds and the different levels. A must play game
B009JEM1PK|5.0|This is a great album. If your a fan of slow crunching riffs with the eerie existence of violin then this is for you. The singing is great along with the occasional screams.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I was once able to use the highlighter function to highlight mid sentence or a single word if I wanted to. now this app only lets me highlight lines of a paragraph. not even at the beginning of a sentence.
B00000272N|5.0|From the opening guitar riff of \\"We Die Young\\" - you can tell it's going to be a heavy gritty opening studio album for Alice In Chains.  This record, maybe more than any of AIC's, is an ode to the heavy dirty 'hard' rock of the late 70's through the 80's ... Black Sabbath obviously coming to mind.  Along with the opening track, \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", \\"Bleed The Freak\\", \\"Love Hate Love\\", \\"Confusion\\", and \\"Real Thing\\" deal with self-loathing, drug addiction, and anger; Layne Staley's voice is extremely powerful and the guitar from Cantrell gives the words alot of weight/power/angst.  The 'best' track on the album is probably \\"Man In the Box\\" (which would go on to be a big single for the band) - it featured the crunchy riffs, chanting/moaning, and extremely tight song writing that would define AIC for the next decade.  The band also shows off a prototypical grungy-blues sound that would be refined on future albums - check out songs like \\"I Can't Remember\\", \\"Sunshine\\", and \\"I Know Somethin (Bout You)\\" - the latter rivaling the funk sounds of contemporaries Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The album might not hit home if you are just looking for the well known AIC singles, but for devoted freaks this is where it all starts for any comprehensive understanding of AIC and their discography.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun but progress is way too slow unless you buy upgrades. a little rediculous so u lost a star
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in you is fantastic. I can't wait for the next book. Eva and Gideon keep me anxiously waiting wondering what they were going to do next.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I have enjoyed this program. The sounds can be very relaxing. They don't necessarily make me want to fall asleep but I was not looking for that. I simply like the ambiance. If I could change anything I would make the sound loops longer. Some of them are short enough to be distracting.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was hooked as long as she was gone, but once I realized what the end was to be (about when she returned), I was bored.  I had a hard time finishing it.  Interesting ideas but not spellbinding writing.  I think the novelty of the ideas was what kept me going.

0307744434|4.0|I'm not usually entranced with books about magic.  After all, anyone can describe magic in words.  It's making those words seem believable that's the hard work.<br /><br />I loved nearly everything about the book.  The descriptions of place are magnificent.  You can picture the areas of the circus, rooms in a house, a garden, clothing - all seem to spring to life from the pages.<br /><br />There's a lot that isn't explained about the background of the men behind the competition that drives the story line.  Usually, that lack of background would drive me nuts.  In this book, it just seemed like part of the mystery and the story line worked just fine without it.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" or \\"Chocolat\\", you'll enjoy this book.  It has the same mix of familiar, everyday activities happening in a context that is mysterious and magical.
0345803485|3.0|What in the world did I just read?? I give it three stars because it entertained me, which is what I expect a book to do. I'm just not sure if  thats the kind of entertainment I want.<br /><br />I just want to state one minor detail flaw. I only read the first one so correct me if I'm wrong, but she starts taking the pill, correct? And its almost the very next day that he stops using condoms. I'm pretty positive it takes at LEAST three months for any pill to be fully effective. Ask any doctor.<br /><br />Going by THAT logic, Ana- along with her every annoying inner goddess (WTF) and her subconscious- are now 50 shades of PREGNANT. Congrats dumbshit.
1572816112|3.0|Nice ok deck.  Rather cutesy than gothic but the real problem is that the cards all sort of look the same in the minors and that gets old rather fast.  I don't really see the great attraction but probably a good teen or young 20 somethings deck. There isn't much there beyond the novelty.  The rest of us can easily pass this by.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|O.k.! It's really nice story,easy to read. Life is cruel as we are to each other. Both,good and bad sides (of humans) are nicely described. Worth reading!
B009ZQBZZE|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I give the creators of this show huge kudos for last night they broke the biggest rule in super hero comics, the hero's secret identity was discovered and he was arrested.  This is absolutely unheard of in writing this kind of yarn.  Typically we watch one villain after another week after week be defeated by our super hero but he always remains in the shadows, fooling everyone into thinking he's the last person capable of acts of heroism.  We were going along that comfortable route until this episode when the creators just simply upended the whole show.  I am now absolutely fascinated to see how they are going to handle this.  I have never seen anyone attempt this before. This happened at the very end and before that it was the typical episode where he was defeating a villain who was trying to get an innocent man executed. If you have not watched this show up till now but are a comics fan, start watching it NOW!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Amazing story of ones persistence to reach his goal. He was a bit of a jerk but very successful one. His odd behavior at times was fully justified by success. Also it makes reading even more interesting. Must read!
B009ZQAN9I|5.0|When Jessica Lange was lured into doing television, Drew Barrymore, who costarred on their first tv venture, said to her, \\"Just think, now a whole new generation of people have the opportunity to discover you.\\"  Indeed. I wonder how many viewers realize they are watching a first rate film actress, who was also one of the great beauties of her day. And boy, is she giving it her all.  In this episode, although there are a lot of other events, Lange plumbs the depths of her nun, showing her anguish and guilt underneath her ironclad rule of the asylum. Specifically, the nun killed a child by running her over when she was in her partying days prior to being a nun. The only word for this is WOW.<br /><br />Not that anyone else is a slacker. We now have a demon nun whom the devil crossed into during the exorcism. Our mad scientist is getting madder and now has Chloe Sevingy in his clutches, apparently long term. There is another attempt at escape by a trio during a wild storm. Plus in the future there is a bloodbath with our original two who opened the season.<br /><br />If you like the horror genre, this is quite the feast.<br /><br />note: further along in this season i was delighted to discover the incomparable Ian McShane had been hired to guest star in an episode.  He plays a killer in a Santa Claus suit who goes around killing people during Christmas.  He manages to make this so blackly comic that I watched it over and over again. He ends up in the asylum and he and Jessica Lange get into a brawl.  Now here is an actor who is totally worthy of Lange's talent!  Wow!!!!!!  I would have paid the whole subscription fee just to see him!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book gets boring at times,describing their training. Skipped some pages or scanned briefly. It's absolutely worth reading though and gets quite exciting toward the end.
B008BO61BE|5.0|In short: This is how great music is done and performed.  These five guys are the nuts and bolts that form the best well-oiled super metal machine that ever existed.  Yes we have Zep, and we have Black Sabbath, but JUDAS is just AMAZING-out of this world. Mr. Halford and the band are at their peak here, both, recording one of the greatest metal albums SFV and during their live show at US Festival.  For all metal bands of today this cd/dvd package should be looked up as their bible, as the blue prints on how to be a great metal band.  Mr. Halford and the band show here that you don't need special effects, fancy equipment, computers, pyro, ego, jumping and screaming your lungs out with no sense of melody to be a great band.  Judas Priest screams not onlhy for vengeance, they show you how screaming is done with art.<br />There will never be another band like Judas Priest in the metal world.  Long Live JP.  Thanks Judas Priest for being part of US Festival, and to the promoters for releasing this live DVD of such a historic day. (sigh). 4 more US Festival bands to be released.  The price of this package is worth every penny and more, and the icing on the cake, great bonus tracks were added as well.  Need to say more?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I don't know why Droid has no native file explore, but they don't When I first got my smart phone I ended up getting Astro file explorer, which its a pretty good program. When I got my Kindle fire I downloaded and installed this program. It's great and is even supposed to be useful with your network, but I couldn't get that part to work. Everything else is great and this is the program you need.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Cute and fun.  This app has fantastic graphics and enhances imagination.  Can be somewhat addictive!  The adds are annoying though
B004SKJTY6|2.0|The King's Speech (2010) Is Another British Monarchy \\"Behind The Scenes\\" Movie.<br /><br />The King's Speech (2010) starring Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter, directed by Tom Hooper is yet another Hollywood movie about the British monarchy which joins The Queen (2008) and The Madness Of King George III (both of the latter featuring Helen Mirren as the Queen of England, past and present).<br /><br />The next Royal Wedding is coming up soon as Prince William marries later this year, and the tabloids and other newspapers and watchers of the British Royals are getting ready for the spectacle of it all.<br /><br />Interest in the British Royals is \\"in the air,\\" even more than usual, since the soon to be married prince may well become the next King should his father, Prince Charles, give the job of being his mother's replacement and the next King of England a miss.<br /><br />The King's Speech (2010) movie shows us the insides of many grand Royal places well photographed in wonderful color. It is a sort of travelogue, and that makes the movie's many, many shortcomings worth putting up with.<br /><br />The acting is good to the extent the actors have material to work with. However, the script is weak and gives actors little range, and repeats dramatic situations good when viewers first see them, but stale when repeated. For the first 20 minutes or so, we enjoy and appreciate the considerable talents and actor expertise of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush (who play King George VI and his speech therapist respectively), we are shown the anguish of the King faced with speech problems he has, and the humor and teaching talents of the therapist in duet scenes the movie starts out with.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie fizzles after the first 20 minutes, and we see nothing new for the rest of the show. Just more anguish and more clever teaching done with humor. It gets old. Not the actors fault. They were and are good. But the screenwriter and the producers who hired the screenwriter simply didn't deliver the goods, but rather served up formulaic bromides about the inflexibility of King George V, the father of King George VI, the controversy and criticism which surrounded the future Duke of Windsor and his American girlfriend and future wife (Wallis Simpson, who like Camilla Bowles, Prince Charles' current wife, was divorced), and Hitler and the Nazis in Germany.<br /><br />Nothing new or original or interesting is part of any of that, and the movie lags and lags as a result.<br /><br />But the visual part of it all is good, and the lovely settings used and shown are terrific. The gigantic rooms, the expensive furniture, the grovelling servants and deference paid to the Royals by England's trained servile population are all there to see and capture our interest.<br /><br />It's an OK movie, and not more than that. Hollywood and the movie community worldwide have created great masterpieces over the history of movies as an art form, a history now more than a century old. WWW.Amazon.Com will sell used copies very cheap of the world's greatest movies (see the Library Of Congress National Film Registry List for 475 titles all worth seeing, all cheap in used form from Amazon.Com).<br /><br />The King's Speech (2011) has many good points and parts, but it is not a great movie. My advice is to see the great ones, and then if you have time left, check out OK but not great movies like The King's Speech (2011).<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.ho hired the screenwriter simply didn't deliver the goods, but rather served up formulaic bromides about the inflexibility of King George V, the father of King George VI, the controversy and criticism which surrounded the future Duke of Windsor and his American girlfriend and future wife (Wallis Simpson, who like Camilla Bowles, Prince Charles' current wife, was divorced), and Hitler and the Nazis in Germany.<br /><br />Nothing new or original or interesting is part of any of that, and the movie lags and lags as a result.<br /><br />But the visual part of it all is good, and the lovely settings used and shown are terrific.

B008OOYALE|4.0|fun game but the wait times for breeding and hatching can be frustrating. but dragons r cute and it is fun to do
B001EC0ONG|5.0|\\"The Fugitive\\" (1993) works because both the man chased and the man doing the chasing are likable.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays a wrongly accused of murder physician escaping from captivity, trying to prove his innocence by locating the actual criminal who did what Ford is accused of doing (murder).<br /><br />It'a a similar, though less leisurely, role to that played by Ford in \\"Witness\\" (1985) in which Ford plays a Philadelphia police detective wrongly accused of crime and hunted by other Philly cops (who are actually guilty of the crime).<br /><br />The entire movie moves, and pulls the audience in because both the protagonist and his pursuer are likable characters.<br /><br />The policeman doing the chasing is portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, who got a Best Actor Academy Award for \\"The Fugitive\\" (1993) and deserved it.<br /><br />The audience roots for both the man chased and also the man doing the chasing.<br /><br />It is important for audiences to like characters they are presented with in dramatic movies. The more humanity, character depth, and intelligence a character shows through his dialog and actions, the better the movie, and this applies to all characters in the story, certainly all the main ones.<br /><br />Harrison Ford faces two opponents during the movie....Tommy Lee Jones (the major opponent on the screen most of the time), and a minor villain (also likeable in his portrayal) who does not survive to the end of the movie.<br /><br />All characters in well written screenplays should be likeable, human, and multi-dimentional, not characatures, and certainly not villains who are characatures.<br /><br />\\"The Fugitive\\" (1993) does this very well, better than any other famous action movie I ever saw.<br /><br />\\"Casablanca\\" (1943) starring Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains comes close, and has a similar structure with two main opponents who end up friends at the end (Bogart and Rains) and a villain who is dispatched at the end and not really centerstage most of the time (\\"Major Strasse\\" played by Conrad Veidt).<br /><br />Another thing which makes \\"The Fugitive\\" (1993) a superior movie is the complete absence of four letter word expletives commonly heard in most other \\"action movies\\" (espcially Bruce Willis movies). Good action movies are possible and better without the expletives. But in today's world (2012), it is unusual to see and hear a movie without them, sadly.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.most of the time (\\"Major Strasse\\" played by Conrad Veidt).<br /><br />Another thing which makes \\"The Fugitive\\" (1993) a superior movie is the complete absence of four letter word expletives commonly heard in most other \\"action movies\\" (espcially Bruce Willis movies).

B00824ZJ84|5.0|If you watch Rebecca, you will know why she sounds as she does. The Lady is classy, humble and gorgeous. The complete package. Her voice is from the angels, her performance stunning. The way she dresses, her make-up, her amazing eyes, from the eyeliner to the mascara, from her hair to her shoes, she is a DIVA all the way.<br /><br />Classy and controlled, at her young age, she is bound for an amazing career where she is at the top of her game. Unstoppable! I adore her. Just discovered her and fell in love.<br /><br />Rebecca Ferguson is a must for Soul lovers.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Do not hesitate to purchase this DVD!  I own all seasons and my husband and I watch the DVD's so much!  Modern Family gets funnier as each season comes along!
B004HO6I4M|3.0|I saw this in theatres, and recently borrowed it from the library.<br /><br />The good: Blu is realistic and so is Jewel. The creators have managed to convey real bird behavior to the big screen, for both the house pet/companion macaw (Blu) and the wild, untrusting of humans (Jewel) one. It's easy to get into the characters because their actions and reactions are so believable as real animals. Just watch a wild bird fly, sometime, and you can catch Jewel's thrill of being able to fly free. there's also real humor in it, as when Blu impersonates his owner's alram clock to wake her up.<br /><br />Colors are great, scenery is vivid, as is the parade in Rio, as busy and gaudy as a real one. so are the costumes of the people in it.<br /><br />Culture and music are portrayed accurately and in detail. Even down to the poverty stricken boy who steals for his boss, to get a little bit of money.<br /><br />The bad. It's terrible for Conservative values, be they Jewish, Muslim, or Christian. Granted, the main characters are BIRDS, and do not naturally have morals. However, this is a humanized cartoon of birds, set in Rio with all the cultural mores of that city. So, we have to look at it as not a documentary - but as entertainment aimed at humans.<br /><br />The music and dancing focus on sex and sensuality, and inspiring desire (even lust) when performed by people in real life. This would lead to \\"hooking up\\" and illicit sex. It makes little difference that these are cartoons. Blu's friends urge him to be a \\"love hawk\\" and get his moves on the girl. This repeats through the film. Not values I'd want in my kids! Nor do I want them play acting scenes from the movie. Role play leads to adult behavior later. Free sex may be okay in the Rio singles scene, but not for conservative minded people.<br /><br />There is the bulldog that dances around in a gold foil costume for carnival - a pro-gay offering put into the film? An effeminate dog isn't \\"cute\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />I also didn't like having yet another \\"men-are-stupid\\" themed movie. Jewel is the smart one who has her act together, Blu is smitten, clueless, and inept.<br /><br />The kidnapping and hostage scenes are intense enough to build suspense, but could scare some kids. Old Disney films would never have been this realistic and include so many details of criminal intimidation and evilness.<br /><br />Bottom line - no, I will not have this in my library. I returned it to the local library stacks.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thank-you
B00991TCOG|5.0|This product is amazing wether you're a Lindsey Stirling fan or not. If you're not a fan you'll become one hearing this super CD where you'll see that this violinist can really rock out!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thank-you

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thank-you
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|the movies was great well written and with a lot of good action.great picture with 3d a very good movie to watch and to enjoy
B008X8QCTO|5.0|really, I think this game is great.  just the right amount of difficulty to be challenging and fun.  sure, it was a lot to install, but it's a huge app, and you can see that before you purchase...  I highly recommend it!
B0013ND30M|5.0|The movie was in excellent condition, and was everything I wanted. I appreciated the extra disc that I received as a bonus offer. I would buy from her again.
1567184855|4.0|\\"Journey of Souls\\" has changed my view of an afterlife.  As a long time cynic, I now see that our spirits are on a long journey to gain knowledge, wisdom and humility.  \\"Journey...\\" offers hope and peace in a  world of chaos, crime and struggles.<br /><br />The case study format is intriguing; I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />Dr. Newton has tapped into a new world and helps us to understand it in our terms.<br /><br />Regardless of religion, faith or beliefs, \\"Journey of Souls\\" presents a fresh and appealing view of where we come from and where we're going.  Take it or leave it...it will fascinate you and challenge what you know or think about the spirit world.
B007M45PMU|4.0|The Lumineers have written some brilliant little pop/rock songs and wrapped them in an organic, folksy package.  The result: a fantastic and refreshing record.  The band trades in the kind of poignant simplicity that few of their contemporaries can manage.  Their songs serve as a welcome alternative to the constant crescendoes and epic (arguably overwrought) emotions of bands like Mumford & Sons; nothing seems remotely calculated, nor do the songs border on hyperbole.  If it weren't for a couple of duds during the second half, this would be a five-star effort; as it stands, it's a heck of a start, and I'm really looking forward to what the Lumineers will bring to light in the future.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This is a timeless Hitchcock classic. Its suspenseful yet lighthearted. Grace Kelly has such dominion over her role and Cary Grant is as charming as ever.
B002APU580|5.0|I've seen this movie over 10 times and every time I watch it I fall in love with it all over again. I had to buy it for my collection. Never gets old!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is one that I would recommend to anyone who loves hidden games and a great story line! If you buy you wont be disappointed!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I play Dragon Story on a Kindle Fire and now there are goals to do which makes the game more interesting.You can breed to get different dragons that you can buy with gems. So you don't have to buy gems unless you want to.
0425263908|4.0|I'm not done reading it but so far so good. I wonder where the men are like in the books because I need my own Gideon Cross...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is a must have. I have it on my ipod and had to have it on my Kindle Fire!! Great!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|While I don't support fake mc clubs, this group of B grade actors have taken it to a new level as a team and produced a great TV series.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My grandson got the 3 books on my Kindle, I found them one day while looking for something to read. Well why not see what he is reading? I finished the first book in 3 days, the other 2 in a week, When I found out that it was being made into a movie I decided to get it also. Like most movies that are made from good books they don't follow the book word for word. What they did to this movie was very good and I do recommend it to all, But read the books first.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its better than temple run. :) this game is so awesome I have been wait a long time for it to be. free
B0091REZMW|5.0|wish we could link our facebook account from the original game but still tons of fun better than dragging my laptop all over the house lol
B006LSZECO|5.0|A lot of twists and turns in this mystery novel.  Just when you think you have figured out the plot of the story another turn comes around and keeps you reading this book right up to the end.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|After 3 country albums, Taylor has changed her style. If you are expecting more of her cathy country tunes, you will be disapointed. THere are cathy tunes but are a lot more contemporary. While her voice is still good, this album does not differentiate from the rest of the pop crowd
B008NAFU9A|2.0|I wanted to like this, but I just didn't. There were a couple of info dumps and all the terms got confusing. It didn't flow very well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is really the best app I have ever seen. It is not as good as the PC version but it still rocks
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This is an amazing and unique cd! The songs are so honest and relatable. There isn't one song that I don't love!
0062073486|4.0|This was published in 1939.  You have seen countless movies and read countless books that have tried to recreate this story.  A classic mystery with great characters.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|\\"Girl at Home\\" & the original \\"Treacherous\\" songs make the already great album well worth a few extra dollars. I'd rather have extra songs rather than the Walmart guitar picks or nothing at all.
0446573027|3.0|This book is a page turner.  It flows well and I liked the story, but it was a little predictable.  I look forward to reading more John Puller stories.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|I had a friend who \\"Didn't enjoy life\\" and I had her him listen to Letter to Me and it changed his mind about everything :) Thanks Brad!! :D Plus, every other song is great too! This was the 1st album I ever bought and I bought it in 8th grade and I stilll listen to it often! Buy it if you love great country music!!
B004EKCNMA|2.0|Obviously, someone learned (invented) some dazzling cgi techniques, and made a movie to play with them.  Some of the effects made me dizzy and nauseous.
1451695195|5.0|I have researched this topic of NDE's extensively because my seven and one-half year old described the death/transition experience as she was dying and many, if not all, the information from my research rings consistent with what I saw and heard at the moments of her death. I endorse this account by Dr. Alexander whole-heartedly.  I, too, am a science-oriented person in that I am a Registered Nurse. I personally have had mystical experiences that are fully explained in this book.  I think Dr. Alexander's life AFTER his miraculous return is huge evidence to the fact that he was not connected to this earth for a period of time.  His behavior and intentions are consistent with those who KNOW that earth-life is inferior to the general universe and infinitely inferior to the God/Creator of the universe.<br /><br />In reading the accounts of the \\"I have to have proof\\" sceptics, I laugh so hard.  No amount of proof will be \\"good enough\\" for them.  Dr. Alexander does not have to produce his MRI's, nor dissertations by his fellow scientists, to have me step out on faith that those pieces of \\"proof\\" and information are available. I say, \\"jump on board\\" the fast train out of the \\"slums\\" of ignorance and reach out to love.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Rarely does Hollywood capture the essence and beauty of a novel. And yet, there are exceptions to the rule. This movie is a beautiful rendition of the best American novel ever written!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Since my kindle goes everywhere I go... now  so does my alarm clock!  The options for configuration seem to be pretty complete.
B0049WHNLO|1.0|This is the version avaliable for over a half century on Columbia. It is not the real Newport concert, but a studio re-creation cut the next day, due to technical deficiencies in the original recording. Buy the later two-disc set, which has the ACTUAL concert, in fantastic true stereo,with more than twice as much music. That set was carefully cobbled together from two different recordings-one from Armed Forces radio, the other the original Columbia recording. The double disc also includes the re-created version, so there's no reason to buy this thing,(except that it's cheap).
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This is a great calendar app for people who want either a simple or detailed list of organizing appointments, holidays, birthdays, work....you name it! Color coordinate any events in any color. It syncs with most any email and other accounts like facebook. I have an EVO 4G LTE and it imported my contacts birthdays from facebook....something I wont take time to do normally. I haven't been able to sync facebook with my Kindle Fire HD or my Acer A500 tablet and therefore have given the app a 4. Otherwise, I love it!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Highly readable and highly enjoyable. Jonasson's madcap tale is a romp through 20th century history, told through the eyes of the eponymous Swede. His abiding belief that most problems can be sorted out over a few glasses (or a bottle) of vodka leads to some highly entertaining interactions with world leaders on three continents. Good fun.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Very interesting insight into the other side of the financial crisis, which tells the story of the winners and how they figured it all out. Also exposes the financial world and explains how wealth is created and destroyed with out 99% of America ever knowing what is happening. It isn't all about stocks!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|After lot of back and forth I decided that i would choose the grey/black one, since I wanted to be able to use it over a long period of time. I like the photo, since its kind of a dark grey/black color and it didnt look a black. When I opened the package it was all black, kind of disappointed. But the rest of it is great![[ASIN:B008HK3XKO Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Black (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]]
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its a app that allows you to post to face book,twitter and you stir pics off of facebook twitter and google
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Whoever thought that making a film based on a board game would be a good idea has no clue what they're doing. This film makes no sense whatsoever and is a huge insult to film fans everywhere. A pointless attempt to cash in is all it is.
B004293WKA|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's so this album takes me back to my teenage years and great songs. Love George Michael and Wham, this album has all the hits I love.
034580404X|5.0|I was afraid to order the item online because I really wanted to read the book. My friends have been talking about it for a while and I really wanted to know what it was about and I did not have a lot of time to return back to work. I place my order and a week later my book arrived which I thought would have taken longer time than that. I very happy for the choice that I made ordering it with that vender and will definitely order more items from the vender in the future...happy customer for sure!!!!
0316227706|5.0|My absolute new favorite coffee table book! The pictures are amazing and each one is funnier than the last! I am buying at least three more for Christmas presents!
B009YDUVOO|5.0|If you are like me and you love Once Upon a Time but you're never home when it airs on TV then you will appreciate AIV giving you an ad-free version of episodes for $2.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|For years I have wanted to read this book, and I finally got around to it.  Vonnegut is unique in style and content.
B000085RPU|1.0|The DVD was used and revealed and was broken and would not play which was very displeasing. They did rerun the item but never shipped me a working DVD
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther contained a lot of history on the cities of Yemen. John Corey had numerous funny lines through out the book which cracked me up. There was little action in the story line until the end of the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I love how often they change things up with new content. Everyone in the family likes to play it including my 2 year old.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I first watched this film while flying across country. It made the time fly by as quickly as the miles. However, we landed too quickly and I missed the ending. I finally rented the movie and had the pleasure of seeing the ending.<br />As a mature woman, I was delighted to see characters who had wrinkles, sex drive, realistic conversations and the ability to grow and learn. Add to the talented cast a glorious backdrop and the color of India and you have an exceptional movie. Watch and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a cool app to help time pass by. very entertain for Me I enjoy it a lot. would recommend it to anyone.  even a child would be entertain by this app. which is why I just had to rate it. so many games to choose from once you have unlocked them. you get points for just about anything, which allows you to unlock those other games in the first place. I thought I was done with 30 words... I guess not. when do I stop writing this review. I was just trying to give this app a good rating but I am sure I have reached the word minimum of twenty. words like dude come on.  look I didn't choose the. star rating lol
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is addicting unfortunately you pay like a hundred bucks in all YOU JUST NEEED COINS but over all its a great game
B0063IH60K|4.0|Every new game you start, it takes you to an ad, but all you have to do is exit out. you can customize your cards from your own gallery, giving your cards a unique look.
0062200399|2.0|First, I should mention this reviews the edition itself and not the text - chances are that if you are looking at this, it is not your first encounter with the novel (as it has been in publication in one form or another for over ten years) and you are wondering if you should purchase THIS edition.<br /><br />Short answer: not really.<br /><br />The good: It's a handsome edition of a book that never really had a great hardcover. The [[ASIN:B002MFOFK2 Stardust 1ST Edition Signed]] was little more than a rehashed version of the superior graphic novel (lushly illustrated by Charles Vess) and pretty much everything about it felt warmed over - from the dustjacket to the interior formatting. By contrast, this text has the right feel to it, and the interior illustration is very attractive. In addition, the weight of the paper and the quality of the binding are top-notch, so it should last for a long while. If you've never read this book before and are considering a purchase, it will be a handsome addition to your bookshelf.<br /><br />The bad: aside from a few cosmetic enhancements (and a page-and-a-half intro by the author) this book doesn't add much beyond an attractive exterior and a few colors on the interior pages. To compound problems, it's VERY SMALL. The actual book is maybe about the size of a trade paperback, and I was honestly surprised by the size when I encountered it in the wild. The original hardcover was standard-sized (if slim) and for the price you are paying, you'd expect it to be smaller.<br /><br />Ultimately, this feels like a double-dip. Gaiman hasn't come out with a new book since \\"The Graveyard Book\\" and in lieu of new work, his publisher is simply re-purposing older texts to sell to fans who (like myself) will buy anything Gaiman sets his name to. Unlike the update of [[ASIN:B004TTHLBE American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition (Enhanced Edition)]] that was issued a year or so ago, this doesn't have any new material to make it worth your 17 to 30 dollars (depending on where you get it). While I would LOVE to say you should get this , it might be better to pass on this version or buy the deluxe edition, which at least comes with the author's signature.<br /><br />PS: To the people that say \\"shame, shame\\" to the author for \\"selling\\" this book to teens: a) Gaiman does not dictate how the book is sold - it was initially written as an adult novel and Harper Collins rebranded it after the Potter/Twilight YA craze hit; b) kids read worse things than this, and honestly, the \\"offensive\\" material is tastefully integrated and is largely subject to inference. If you're getting upset over what is ultimately two or three lines of text, you might want to stick to softer fare.dollars (depending on where you get it).

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent interface.  Easy and intuitive.  Enjoy access to so many popular bible versions.  Also like the daily devotional content and interactive bible studies.  My wife installed on her Kindle Fire and I on my Iphone.  Works great on both.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I have read and loved every one of Grisham's books yet I couldn't get through this one. The character development was awful and they weren't believable. I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't so I put it down. It is almost like he had an amateur ghost writer and he didn't have a hand in writing it at all. It didn't have that Grisham voice I am so used to. Very disappointing.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|LOVED IT! This movie made me feel like a kid again. Well played from what I remember from my favorite childhood story.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Her first christmas album is one of my favorite, so i doubted that she could do another christmas album..<br /><br />BUT this one is really great! she has her beautiful voice as always, ans i love the fact that she signs with her mom!
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie is great to watch. It mixes the reality of war with heroic act of our elite soldiers. It has drama/action/adventure mixed all in one bag. There is no Rambo style victory here. Just pure reality of how the seals fight and how great they are.
0345803485|5.0|I am not a big romance novel person but an associate of mine told me little things about the 1st book and it peeked my curiosity so I ordered it an absolutely love it. I don't think this book would be recommended for anyone under 18 but it is a must read for anyone that loves the taboo of sex. There is alot of intrigue an action as well but after I read the 1st book I couldn't wait to read the 2nd,an 3rd of the trilogy an I hope there are more books wrote by this author in Christian Grey's point of view cause I will be one of the 1st to order.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|The cable did not charge my kindle fire. So either I'm going to get another kindle or  move on to another type of notebook.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Awesome!  Now that I have a Blu-Ray player, this is the beginning of my new movie collection.  The special features that aren't included on the DVD made this a worthwhile purchase.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I wanted to see this movie for the special effects and never expected to find it as interesting. Turns out to have great movie plot and lots of action and the special effects didn't dissapoint. I don't think Kristen Stewart was the best choice to pair with Charlize Theron. I feel Kristen is a very plain actress and the movie could have been even better if there was a different Snow White.
B001BZRUR4|3.0|The Messenger definitely cannot hold a candle to Zusak's other novel The Book Thief. I had high hopes and expectations after reading The Book Thief. The Messenger was slow moving with only a few of the messages the main character delivers being very interesting. It starts to build up momentum at the end of the book and throws some interesting unexpected turns in there. Interesting concept, but it wasn't a 'can't put it down kind of book'. I don't regret reading it, but it wouldn't be at the top of my reading list.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I powered through a borrowed copy of Larsson's The Girl Who Played with Fire on a flight to Barcelona, then had to, HAD TO, get The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest for the flight back to the states.  I found the third installment in the The Girl series just as compelling and exciting as the first two novels.  How can you not root for Lisbeth to best her many foes after all she has been put through?  Being shot in the head and dumped in a shallow grave by one's own father is one thing, but to have been the target of a cover up that reached the highest levels of government makes you want her to savor the sweet taste of revenge.  I was thoroughly sucked in as I absorbed the intricacies of how a black ops department came to existence within the Swedish government, the extent of the corruption and marveled at the careful chipping away at the wall of silence and deceit that Lisbeth's greatest ally, Mikael, did with a tenacity that nearly got him killed.<br />I especially enjoyed some of the side plots that Larrson wove into the narrative, like the story around Erika's departure from Millenium and  the bizarre set of problems that brings she and  Lisbeth together in a strange way.  The introduction of Monica, a new, strong female character and love interest for Mikael added a lot to the story, as well.<br />This installment of the series had a very satisfying ending, but there is more, so much more, that could be written with such compelling, fresh characters, making Larsson's untimely demise especially painful.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Got to level 2-24 and all my progress was lost.  Sucks, not wasting anymore time on this.  Was fun at first but now just frustrating.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it because it makes me feel like I am getting chased by muntan monkey's. And it makes me feel like I am active.  Logan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It kept my attention the whole time.  I was worried it wouldn't be as good as Bared to You, but there was no need to worry.  I have already read this book a second time.  I can't wait to purchase the next book!
B0098VXE50|5.0|I loved the way the movie was put together. It was much better than the original but kept to the same story line. Much. More exciting with just the right amount of fantasy and a good representation of the time period. I would recommend this movie to be added to your library. A good soon to be classic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple concept and yet surprising challenging at times! I like that you can replay the same screen to see if you can solve it faster/in less moves. In some cases I wish it would show you the solution... Especially at the higher levels.
B007MDB6L0|2.0|This is not the best of the Tink series (that would be the Great Fairy Rescue).  The story in outline is sweet, but it's grounded by inflated melodrama and the really awful songs that are poured over every montage like syrup.  Does every preteen singer sound the same, regardless of gender?  The McClain sisters could have been manufactured in the Disney factory; there is nothing original, personal or distinctive about the songs or their performances: it's an assembly of pre-fab parts and it drags the movie down.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Intriguing and fun - my favorite app! So sorry when it was over - reminiscent of Zelda back in the day. I can't wait for Enigmatis 2!
B005LAIIE4|5.0|It has been enormously easy to be a rabid Disney fan over the years, which I am, especially since the company's animation studio has never, ever produced c/r/a/p or even any cartoon movie that has never been massively huge at the box office, especially not during the Michael Eisner years or the early- and mid-2000s. With that said, it's no surprise to me that Write-It Ralph is another phat hit in the long line of Disney animated movie awesomeness! It is soooo amazingly successful as a Dreamworks-copying 3D movie that it nearly--but not quite--reaches the dizzying heights of Disney's most famous animated masterwork, Titan A.E.<br /><br />The plot of Write-It Ralph is super-intelligent so that only smart children will be able to appreciate it. In fact, if your child is not enrolled in the honor program at his or her local charter school, then you might want not to bring him or her to Write-It Ralph and just take him or her to a Jersey Shore drive-in marathon instead. Here is the plot: Write-It Ralph is a villain at your local arcade (do people even play arcade games anymore with that awesome Playstation Network and that even awesomer Xbox Live service?!) who is sick and tired of being a friggin villain! In fact...you could even say that he is mad as hell and...get this, get this...won't take it anymore! Really, with a plot this complex and highly developed, please don't even show up with your kids to see this unless they are enrolled in the ultra-gifted AP program at your school.<br /><br />To make a long story short and not spoil any plot points for your children, I'll just say that Write-It Ralph eventually solves his dilemma of being forced to be a villain, but really wanting to be an arcade game hero, for a change. He simply votes for Barack Obama, which immediately qualifies him to a \\"white person who cares.\\" As such, he is instantly elevated to hero status by the fawning, liberal media.<br /><br />If you ask me, the ending--again, without having given away any spoilers, I hope--was just too abrupt for my liking. Then again, I'm still one of the last, lonely clowns who still believe in that façade called global warming and also affirmative action, so what in the heck do I really know? Am I right, or am I right, folks?!poilers, I hope--was just too abrupt for my liking.

B0090SI42Y|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of the Kiwi actor, Russell Crowe, ever since he, back in 2005, confronted the American singer called Moby in a bathroom and a/s/sailed him with a bunch of anti-American slurs. I think that alone qualifies Crowe as the greatest actor the world has ever seen...if you do not count Carrot Top, Pauly Shore and Tom Green, of course! I'm glad to see him back in this martial arts movie conceived of by none other than RZA, who is a rapper from the Wu-Tang Clan and a 110 percent, hardcore Obama voter, to be sure.<br /><br />This highly poetic movie that is best enjoyed like you would a fine glass of wine centers around RZA, a blacksmith, who fashions highly complex weapons of destruction for a small village located inside of Chinatown. After a person who is planning to commit treason (also known as a traitor) menaces the village, the blacksmith teams up with both good guys and bad guys to defend the community of wonton soup-enjoyers. As you can see from this plot description alone, this movie will likely be the movie nominated for the most Oscars, on account of its extreme, arthouse quality and attention to method acting.<br /><br />Since this is a martial arts movie, I was not at all surprised to see Carl Douglas make several cameos while singing Kung F/u Fighting, which was easily...easily the sole highlight of this entire train-wreck of a film. I am, nonetheless, a little bit worried about the implied racism with his cameos because they are essentially a black man singing about Asian people in Kung F/u Fighting, which means two minority groups are mercilessly referenced...true racism if I ever saw it! However, a small upside was the brilliant and inspired casting of Dave \\"The Manimal\\" Bautista as one of the rice-eating villagers in this funky tale. I was especially impressed with him powerbombing, bodyslamming and spinebusting Russell Crowe and the rapper from Wu-Tang Clan several times over. That is surely powerful filmmaking at its most awesomest.<br /><br />I am going to go out on a small limb here and make a prediction: The Man with the Iron Fists will easily sashay away with the Best Picture Oscar in 2013. You heard it here from me first, people. Just remember that when all those a-h/o/l/e/s at Entertainment Tonight are taking credit for making this prediction when Oscar season rolls around, okay?

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Folliett is a masterful storyteller, enjoyable read. Many storied plot,quick read. Details very graphic, sometimes to graphic for my taste. Not great literature but very entertaining. I love the characters. I am looking forward to the next book of the trilogy.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I wish I had known that this book was really intended for tweens....and that it's the first of a series.  I do read these types of books since I have a tween in the house, but they aren't my first choice.  This book reminded of the Percy Jackson series, which was fun, but not what I was in the mood for.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addictive strategic fun game like the coin fall skill game at arcades. a little mindless so great for stress busting.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with 'The Casual Vacancy'.  It was all over the place and lacked clarity with plots and characters.  I give it points on surprises but little else.
B008ER9QKG|3.0|The Lepage production has important attractions, such as great singing and an intriguing machine.  Still, the overall result feels strangely conventional and even stiff, in spite of the fantastic visuals created occasionally by the interaction between the machine, the acrobats and the video projections.  Lepage is a tremendous artist, but here he did not project a true director's insight into what the opera means. On the other hand, in spite of the great achievements that the Ring has inspired,  I have always felt that theater technology remains insufficient to deliver Wagner's ideas.  Perhaps George Lucas, Steven Spielberg or some other visionary director should produce a Ring on film, with a full array of cinematic special effects.  I keep waiting for it! In the meantime, this production has been commented upon so much that true Wagner enthusiast will be curious to view it.
0062060554|3.0|The first 3/4 of this book is highly repetitious. The circumstances are ridiculous and even when the protagonist's best friend realizes something is seriously wrong, she does almost nothing till the 11th hour. And does no one think about calling the police? Does the doctor not see a pattern of abuse? The beginning was beguiling and it's well written; thus the 3***.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game was recommended to me by a friend. I am very glad I checked it out. Adorable little dragons. Fun game overall. Its kindda pricey to advance but there's no need to spend real money if you have patience.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Spectacular writing as always, and. Mr Reacher what can you say a man with a code and a certain ethic is always a win in my book. Fantastic read well worth the buy...
B008VBYN80|4.0|I absolutely love this game. if you like a game that takes a while and has a lot going on I recommend this one for sure. having tons of fun.  yay!!
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I enjoyed the book. But the ending was a tad bit disappointing. I wish she extended it a bit more.
B00932A5QA|1.0|The trailer for this \\"movie\\" is misleading and shows only the scenes that look really good and feature no real dialogue and no actors faces. The fact that it is Anime and is not exactly advertised as such, only serves to upset me more. Let the buyer beware. This is a turkey, and not the delicious Thanksgiving type. Go buy used chewing gum, you will enjoy it more!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong. I couldn't believe that it is free. I been waiting for this for a while. Anyone who loves this game, better get it while the gettings good.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Alright, I'm going to preface this review by saying there is a lot of potential here with the storyline and author, and I enjoyed getting to know some of the characters in Pride and I actually wouldn't mind reading more about this close-knit community.<br /><br />In saying that, I did have major issues getting through the story primarily because of the plethora of spelling and grammar problems. Even if the author couldn't afford an editor, handing the story over to someone trusted to proofread would probably have helped in catching some basic and recurring mistakes. I noticed that there were several instances where the possessive 's was used in place of pluralizing a word, or the a possessive word was pluralized. There were fragmented sentences sentences that weren't sentences, and sentences that went from passive voice to present; commas were inserted where they shouldn't have been and places that required punctuation were void of any. The spelling errors such as caring for carrying, hast for haste, or the shorthand, thru, instead of through, made me feel like I was reading text messages instead of a novel. I actually stopped at around chapter 2 and started over, highlighting areas that I was able to catch as errors. My husband called me insane when I told him what I was doing because I'm just a lover of books, not an editor, but I really couldn't help it. I know there were more than the 200+ words and phrases by the time I finished the story (by the way, a prelude comes before, an epilogue comes after).<br /><br />I would love to give a higher review but I just couldn't justify more than 3 stars with all errors.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I finally completed the game! The game was amazing. I liked the scenery and the story line. Reminded me of a bejeweled game.
0525958002|2.0|I was the biggest Duran Duran fan. I lived and breathed for anything Duran Duran. I was hopeful and excited waiting for the release of this book. It turned out to be very disapointing. It was, I did this and I did that, Nothing terribly personal and infromative. I felt as if I was reading something released by an agent. I get more from following him on Twitter than I didnt in the book. Terribly Disappointing.
B008OOYALE|5.0|awesome. this game is simple yet satisfying. I really enjoy it. never had it close on my kindle fire. bug free and easy to use.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Please fix highlighting issue. It doesn't let me highlight partial lines on documents. It only allows me to highlight the whole line. It was working fine before the recent update.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of the game at the fair. Even tho the coin generation is a little slow, you will win either coins or prizes with perseverance. A fun and addictive game if you like games of chance. Take a chance...give it a try.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app did not work for my kindle fire. The search worked, but the download button did absolutely nothing. After uninstalling this flop, i got tubemate, which worked fine. Yeah, get tubemate.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|I haven't had a lot of uses for it but it's been a really good app when I've needed it. Nice UI, and good features. I also like the intuitive zoom.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|If you like psychological dramas, this is a good book to read. I was disappointed that there was not a second book by this author.

0811874192|5.0|Love pop up books, and have never seen such a perfect one as this depicting bouquets of flowers, etc.<br />Have sent it to friends who are bedridden and they love being able to display a different bouquet every day.  Recommend it highly.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|What can I really say about a movie that didn't hold my interest and was sort of boring to boot?
0321811984|5.0|The product was as advertised - quick shipment - very impressed with turn over.  Ended up returning the book because I found it in a local library and saved me some money by renting it from there.  Return policy was easy and refund was fast.  Very impressed!
B00976NY6A|3.0|Trying not to give it two stars, but man what an underwelming undeveloped bunch of songs.  I love this group but the inate power of their music is not evident in this album.  Who ever produced this thing didn't do them any favors.  I don't know what happened to their guitarist, it seems his riffs and his excelent song writing isn't present in the album either.<br /><br />Better luck next time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|As a fan of Kate Morton, I was thrilled to hear of her new book, The Secret Keeper, and purchased it right away on Kindle. As it turned out,we lost power for 2 days during hurricane Sandy and the only thing I was able to do at night was read on my ipad. I read most of the book during those 2 days, and finished it this morning. It was fantastic! I couldn't stop reading it, telling myself, \\"just one more chapter\\", but would keep reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. Get this book. Now!
B00474GUEA|5.0|If you grew up in the 80's then you know the vibe. 30 years later, that 80's sensation lives on in the kids we spawned. Definitely worth the $.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I really like John Depp but felt he \\"might\\" be getting a little over exposed ? No worries . Working , for like the eighth time or so , with his fine friend and frequent collaborator Tim Burton , has payed off well for fans of horror/comedy . With a smart and fun script and a swell supporting cast , i strongly recommend you check it out .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|my brother loved so I hot it on my kindle and man is it fun my brothers birthday was yesterday (halloween) it so cool he born on that day he got a kindle fire for his birthday so now we both have kindle lol back to the point this game is awesome!!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book.. read it on a flight from Nashville to Las Vegas and cried at the end. Beautiful story...
1451695195|5.0|This is a beautiful and touching book. It has such an encouraging message. It is a very quick read, about 2 or 3 hours should do it for most folks. Also, it does not have anything in it most people would find inappropriate for younger readers (about 12 and up I'd say). Now, for anyone considering reading this book, please note, this is not really a denominational book...no particular religion seems overly represented here...this book is more about a universal spirituality. If you are looking for a book by someone who had a near death experience who is going to explicitly tell you that they spoke one on one to Jesus while surrounded by harps and winged cherubs, this is NOT the book for you....perhaps last years hit \\"Heaven is for Real\\" would be more to your liking (though there are interestingly enough, a few similarities between these two popular books, which I believe, only furthers their credibility). Now, if you are a skeptic, or a person who is inclined to try to find logic/rationale in everything, but you are seeking out something more, something outside yourself, outside the realm of science and/or you need something to give you hope or a bit of encouragement, then by all means read this book, read it right now, as quickly as you can get your hands on it! The overall message of this book is one of such love and positivity, I can't imagine anyone could feel anything other than hopeful after reading it. Even hardened skeptics will have to admit that the author, being such a man of science and having admited to his own lacking faith prior to his experience, cannot be completely discounted. I do, like several other reviewers, wish there had been more information about what he experienced (there is a lot more biographical/family related info than otherwordly info) but, in fairness the Dr. does several times explain how difficult it is to put the experience into the confines of human experience/vocabulary. In as much, the overal message of the book means more to this reader than the individual details. All in all, in these dark times, this book is certainly a shining light, and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants something to help lift them out of the gloom. A big thank you to Eben Alexander M.D. for being brave enough to share his story with a world that might look at him in such a way that it could hinder his career....the scientific community can certainly be tough on people when they try to be open to other possibilities...so a big thanks to him! Such a gift of a story!
B00846REIS|5.0|Got this book after reading The Fifty Shades series.. although there are some eerie similarities, this one is good on its own merit.  Where Fifty left certain ugly worlds out, this one does not.  A good read for anyone who wants something lucious to cuddle up to after Fifty... steamed up my glasses for sure LOL
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is so wonderful - I have watched this many many times - it is mystery, sci fi, western, romance, excitement - Lots of science and just plain perfect!
0345536886|1.0|Pretty boring stuff actually. Grisham is running out of ideas. Tort litigation has been done before. Anyone heard of a book called THE KING OF TORTS? That one was good. This one was not. This plot was long and drawn out and I'm soooo glad it's over. A GOOD book is The Religion by Viktor Wolfe. wow.
1612680011|1.0|Everyone has a long review, but I'll keep this one short...<br />Robert Kiyosaki made his money from this one book because he was on the Oprah show.<br />If it wasnt for that, he would'nt be rich as he is today. Oprah made him.

B000W8HC8I|4.0|the book was a very easy read. Interesting how much an a**hole can steal, cheat and lie and still think he has done nothing wrong. Jordan seems to be bragging about his exploits but I guess that just shows his true colors.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Amazing characters, exciting story, interesting style. Everyone should read this classic at least once! Bram Stoker was a creative genius, and he gets people and the nature of their relationships.

1582701709|5.0|I would say I was at the pit of my life when I stumbled upon Rhonda's \\"The Secret\\".  It changed my life!  I found so much inspiration in all the interviews and bits of information. It was like a bulb went off and all of a sudden things made sense.  I love that The Secret walks you through WHY you are in your current state of living and HOW you can create a brilliant life for your self with step by step action plans.  And the best part is that it has so many different contributors that it really speaks to all different people and walks of life.    This is a must READ or WATCH (whichever your preference).    Also, if you love the Law of Attraction (which is the premise of The Secret) then you will love @denisedt's free manifesting guide, make sure you get it and sign up HERE: [ ... ]    It will walk you through creative ways to manifest anything you want in this life and more!
B00164GDA0|4.0|I really believe this movie will remain a classic and have legs for many years to come.  I have owned several editions with this being my first on Blu Ray.  No plot summaries or acting critiques here, just a review of the BR's quality.<br /><br />There is a definite improvement in color resolution on this Blu Ray transfer.  However, the movie retains its filmic look with soft focus unlike current films shot with that sharp contrasty video appearance. While it is not terribly noticeable as a bad transfer would be, the film does have its share of grain. Pause the film most any time and the grain becomes apparent.  You won't notice this while the movie is playing but you will notice the soft look of Stand By Me.<br /><br />The original audio was in mono and  you have the choice to retain that but you can also set it to DTSHD 5.1.  However, you will not get a whole lot from your surrounds and nothing from your sub. Never the less, there really never was any low bass at any point in the film.  The stereo front channels are used somewhat but not very much. The audio is well balanced and dialogue clear and distinguished so that once you set your volume you will not need to adjust it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are several previews on the disc which could have been better used by a lighter compression.  I have a real bug about disc space being taken up by movie previews.  The other extras are the directors commentary and a P in P commentary with Wil Wheaton and Corey Feldman along Rob Reiner.  When it went to the PnP, the only audio I heard was the movie track and not what the, now grown, actors were saying.  Didn't stay around long enough to figure it out but did wonder where Keifer Sutherland and Jerry O'Connell were.  There was also an extra with Stephen King talking about his memories of summers gone by that was pretty relatable to me.  Maybe that is why this has always been a favorite film.<br /><br />While there is color improvement to this Blu Ray version, I don't believe that if you already own the standard def version that you will gain much by buying the BluRay.  The choice is yours on this one.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks't believe that if you already own the standard def version that you will gain much by buying the BluRay.

0525953728|5.0|Excellent book that verifies my son worked with Seal Team out of Jalalabad. Highly recommended for those who want the first hand account of the truth.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it.  A ton of options for every alarm need, easy to use (even in those early-morning-can't-think-straight-need-caffine moments), fun, and reliable.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Excellent game! Nice graphics and scenary. My kids love the movie so this game was a huge hit with them. I was surprised at the quality and how much it resembles scenes from the movie for it being a free app.
B002VECM6S|5.0|What can I say. I love \\"feel good\\" movies and this is one of the best I ever saw.  Sandra Bullock again shows that she is an \\"actress\\" not just a whiney voiced romantic comedy fixture.  She conveys with absolute believability the affection she feels for her new \\"son\\" and the lengths she will go to to protect him. The fact that this is a true story just makes it more wonderful. Nice to know that there are really people like this family still alive and well in our country. Supporting cast is excellent. Beautifully filmed,directed and acted.
0345803507|5.0|Enjoyed all 3 books, but found this to be the best; tied everything together and held interest to the end. Still had some surprises I did not see coming.  Thought I had the ending figured out, but I was wrong.  Very sensual books with good storylines.  Enjoyed them all!

B009ANAQ4S|5.0|Light up a fire in the fireplace, select your best red wine and sit back and enjoy this mellow, but bluesy adventure with Van Morrison.  His voice is a great contrast to the music on this album and that's what makes it all work so well.  If you don't have a bottle of red wine and a fireplace, buy it anyway...it's that good!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Like another \\"trilogy\\" the second book was better than the first.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's continuing story kept me turning the page to see what happened next. The introduction of a couple of characters from Eva's past gave the story a unique twist and glimpse into the depths of what Gideon and Eva would do to keep this twisted relationship going.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read Entwined with You to see how it all ends.
0307943259|4.0|I pre-ordered this as an e-book so I could read it immediately when it came out, since I'm very much a Grisham lover.  I have read all of his \\"lawyer\\" books although there are one or two of the fringe ones that I have not read.<br /><br />I definitely do not think this was his best, most riveting book....and I have to say that through about the first half of the book, I was shaking my head going, \\"Where are you going with this, Grisham?\\"  Some parts were on the slow side...but of course his writing style tends to keep you with him, so the slow parts were not really boring so much as they were leaving you wondering what was going on.<br /><br />I found through the entire book he kind of lets you wonder where he's going before you actually find out...and after the aforesaid \\"first half\\", I finally figured out that it is probably precisely what he MEANT to do with the plot.<br /><br />As yet another reviewer pointed out, the foreshadowing does make you sort of thing you know where he's headed at times, but then you're never really SURE....other times, you have no clue and you just have to keep turning the pages to find out.<br /><br />I was happy with the ending....I was hoping it ended the way it did, but judging by a few of his past stories, I knew that he tends to end things however he pleases rather than how it \\"should\\" end...so I was pretty happy with the ending and felt it matched the rest of the book just fine.<br /><br />Its more of a \\"puzzle\\" book, I think....nothing real intense...just lots of \\"figuring stuff out\\".  As a side note, I think he included LESS political leanings and LESS political satire than some of his past books, which I appreciated.<br /><br />Overall I gave it four stars because I did enjoy the book and would recommend it...although I think it included a bit less of the high suspense and action than some of his past books, for which I deducted one star, and it also included a lot less \\"lawyer\\" than some of his past books as well.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is hands down best written book I have read. Gives great detail into who the.characters are rather then focusing on the details of characters appearance like most authors do. Leaving your imagination to make the character your own. I love how there is more than 1 main character and, they all play major roles in this book. There are no page fillers. All the information given to you is key. this book makes twilight look boring. I cant wait for a movie. I hope it is as epic as the book.
0143121006|5.0|The unsolved (until now) 1937 Peking murder of Pamela Werner, a young English girl who was killed during the impending collapse of China to the Japanese occupation sets the scene for one great non fiction police procedural. The author, Paul French, lives in China and obviously found the research and story compelling. He notes that \\"When something casually read remains in front of your brain the morning afterwards, it's usually the sign of a great tale.\\"<br /><br />A bit of a warning... the crime here is quite horrendous and Paul French returns to the ugly details as the two officers assigned to investigate (one Chinese and one English) go about their step by step investigation.<br /><br />This is really an interesting and engrossing book as it twists in a bit of a history lesson thrown in on top of a sociological study of expats living in their enclosed community many years after the boxer rebellion.  We have suspects galore, false leads, and scandal as the two detectives try and discover Pamela's movements on her last day alive.<br /><br />I am not going to go into more detail on the suspects and the shape shifting that goes on as it would ruin the stranger than fiction aspects of the story. But I really recommend this book to you.<br /><br />By the way, for those who have read my previous reviews know that I enjoy the Fictional Inspector Chen novels by Qiu Xiaolong which take place in the 1990's. These books have much the same perspective with crime set against that period of history. Paul French's book reminds me somewhat of the first book in the Inspector Chen series, THE DEATH OF A RED HEROINE.

B008G8SFGO|4.0|I have to laugh at peoples personal reviews in music taste lol  KISS haters no doubt will never give this album an honest review. Flip that coin over, die hard KISS fans will say it's the best lol  Ok, I'm a die hard KISS fan and I must admit that I thought this record was disappointing when I first listened to it. Yeah, I just saw KISS and CRUE live a few weeks ago and KISS performed \\"H or H\\". I thought the song was great. Then MONSTER released and the studio version of \\"H or H\\" was rock solid killer. However, the rest of the songs didn't grab me . . . .  UNTIL, I listened to this album 4 or 5 more times in a row. Now I can't stop listening to it lol  The production sound of this album is top notch, heavy and thunderous! If KISS ever reads this review, very well done guys!!!  Todays modern rock on the radio sucks and it's all pure shit. For the good veteran bands still playing, it's hard to see them as most do not even tour the US, or tour the US very little.  These bands tour Europe heavily as well as South American countries.  American radio sucks and that's why they play today's bubble gum shitty stuff. KISS is cool and MONSTER rocks!

1423140605|5.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: The seven demigods of the Great Prophesy have finally gotten together. Now they set their sights on Rome and rescuing their friend Nico de Angelo.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: Until she met the exploding statue, Annabeth thought she was prepared for anything.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />It's finally here!!! And it's huge!!! But Mark of Athena was definitely worth the 400 some pages! Percy and the gang are back in this hilarious and jaw-dropping third installment. We finally get the reunion of Percabeth but of course nothing goes as planned and the seven demigods are already running for their lives by the end of the second chapter. Unlike most other Riordan books, this one lacks the usual structure of prophesy, quest, rescue the camp just in time. Now that the seven demigods of the Great Prophesy have finally grouped together, they journey across the nation and eventually the Atlantic to reach Rome, where Nico de Angelo (who might know where the Doors of Death are located) is trapped. Along the way the group goes on miniature quests to either repair the Argo II or find help along the way. Now that the group is together, can they close the Doors of Death before Gaea awakens? And will Annabeth be able to avenge her mother? Riordan spins yet another dramatically funny and unexpected novel about Greek and Roman mythology.<br /><br />Ever read any of the previous Hero of Olympus novels? Mark of Athena will completely blow you away and catch you by surprise. Usually the stories are revolving around three  characters, but this time there are seven demigods that have tone accounted for. Riordan does an excellent job of juggling all the action and conflicts that develop between all of the characters, plus timing each one to match the others. This story is narrated from four different points of views -- Annabeth, Leo, Piper and Percy. Although Piper has a main part and I always love hearing from Percy, Annabeth and Leo stole the show. Annabeth has her own quest from her schizophrenic mother Athena/Minerva. She is to avenge her mother and find the Mark of Athena. Her own personal quest (with no help from Percy or the others) really shows how strong and resourceful she is even in the midst of her worst fear. Leo is amazing (I would say just because he is, but I don't think that's acceptable in a review.) He's the seventh man out -- the only one without a girlfriend or friends to talk to (yeah, he has Jason and Piper but they're doing their own thing most of the time.) But the major plot twist that had me tearing up had to do with Hazel.<br /><br />There was not a single part of this book that lacked pacing or had me bored. Yes, it is predictable but everything happens in the most unexpected way. Riordan knows how to capture the voice of a teen perfectly, keeping older ones like me still intrigued and laughing at the same time. He takes you across the nation (from San Francisco to Atlanta, Georgia) and then journeys across the Atlantic to Rome itself. Don't get me started on the ending, though. Major cliffhanger alert! The worst one yet in the whole Percy Jackson series! Next fall seems so far away...<br /><br />Spectacular scenes will make you laugh, smile and stay up late to finish it (at least I did.) Haven't read the Heroes of Olympus before? Or even the Percy Jackson series? You poor deprived things. Just kidding! Go read the books now and fall in love with the mythological world and the demigods that inhabit it. I know I did.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Disney Hyperion provided me with a copy of Mark of Athena.

B008BR3QOQ|4.0|While I'm having some good times listening to this album, I think it should be a little longer. Also, since it's my first CRB album, I'll have to buy the other albums, just to know better if the quality keeps the same.
0385344333|1.0|I have read all the Reacher books and had this one pre-ordered - very excited to get it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If this was the first Reacher book written, I would not go on to read a second book.  The plot is meandering and aimless and really quite uninteresting.  It is the third book in a row now (or is it the fourth?) that takes place in winter in the Nebraska/mid-west corridor - the setting is getting old.  Come on Lee, let's move on.<br /><br />Between the plot quality of this book, the choice of Tom Cruise to play Jack Reacher in a movie, and the \\"Rules\\" book about to be released, I'm afraid the series appears to be going downhill fast.
B009KKLQVS|3.0|Without a doubt I agree with most of the reviews.  Out of 50 songs, the songs chosen sound like everything Mike Love would have picked out, and without a doubt Im almost sure of it.  I saw them at Irvine Verizon this last summer and the show was awesome, the best songs however along with the tribute to Dennis & Carl have been left off.  I will buy this dvd just beacause I am a huge fan, but this is not a idea of a true Beach Boys fan set list.  Brian should have put Mike Love the control freak in place right from the start, got a great attorney and took back the Beach Boys name.  Dissapointed Im Sorry.  3 stars just because its all of the remaing members left along with Brian's great solo band and the great drummer they had on the tour John Cowsil and the Great David Marks!

B00979CS50|5.0|Psychedelic Pill is a long, sprawling musical work. It comes on two discs, with two 16+ minute songs and one that is over 27 minutes long. It has plenty of self-indulgent moments, wacky lyrics, and it sounds absolutely fabulous! Neil sounds like a kid part of the time, like a farmer some of the time, but regardless, he's always moving forward even when he's \\"driftin' back\\".<br /><br />This is of course a Crazy Horse record, and people like to say things like \\"The first album of original music from Neil Young and Crazy Horse in almost a decade\\" (that's from Amazon's own listing) but Crazy Horse has always been an off-again/on-again band for Neil. When he's hankering for them, he draws them close to him, they jam, and it's always special. This is no different. The band sounds great and the long, wandering jams are made possible by this loose group of musicians that are accomplished enough (but not TOO accomplished) and are in sync with Neil Young's ambitions to rock.<br /><br />People like to dismiss Neil's current lyrical output as being too simple and too grounded in modern life. It's true you won't find Aztecs and Incas on Psychedelic Pill nor will you find any rock anthems, but what you will find are songs that express what I imagine are the things that are currently important to Neil. In their youth people can express idealism and have their heads in the clouds but as you grow older you know what you believe and what you aren't so sure about, and as someone who is fifty-something, that's fine with me.<br /><br />The bottom line is Psychedelic Pill is an album full of great rock'n'roll. It may all be familiar in many ways (Neil used to say \\"it's all one song\\") but it's also new and fresh. And as someone who is a firm believer that new music is ALWAYS better than old, I'm personally glad to have a second new album from Neil Young this year. I can wait another year or two for The Archives Volume Two.
B007EDYN36|4.0|When I saw that Peter had written a book I got it immediately (thank goodness for Kindle!) and started reading right away. Peter was always my favorite KISS member - he seemed more down to earth than the others. Nice to know that sometimes our first impressions are correct. It was fascinating to read about his life and often maddening to realize how badly he got screwed over. His honesty about his addiction, his anger, his mistakes made me admire him even more. I love where he is with his life and his Self now and wish him the best. And thanks for the music, Peter!
B009157BWU|5.0|I enjoyed every moment of this movie, and that is literally a first for a Disney production.  Usually I admire their artistry but am in misery through at least part of the movie, either because it depicts loss or because I get bored at points.  Although this film has the usual heartbreak of a parent that dies, which Disney has inexplicably featured in virtually every child's film from Bambi to Dumbo to the Lion King as though the death of a parent is a requisite for children's film fare, this time it was handled much better.  The heartache that you feel for little Oscar is tender, and you feel sorry for him but are not racked with sobs for a change.  Although it looks for awhile as if he will not survive, a surprising development helps him overcome his loss and restores his safety.<br /><br />If you think about how this movie had to be made, you begin to realize how incredible it is that the footage was even captured.  Unlike a movie set, where there are actors who recite their well crafted lines on cue, this film was built from raw nature footage.  If you think that's easy, go out in your backyard and try to put together a film with a riveting storyline based on the nature you see there.  This was not just nature footage; it was a developed plot that in reality was not under the control of the director.  This story was discovered, not created in a writer's imagination to come out just the way he intended.  The only manmade part of it was the narration, and paradoxically, that was what made it all seem so natural.  It takes a lot of talent to take the raw footage and build a story from it, even when the footage might suggest a story.  In this, the filmmakers did an excellent job.  The story is compelling and cohesive.<br /><br />What really makes this movie rock, though, is the narration by Tim Allen.  He totally nailed it.  If you just saw the footage without the narration, you would find that the movie was not nearly as good.  Allen resonates in this movie.  As magnificent as the lush photography and the real nature story are, it is Allen that makes it all come together and gives it impact.  I'm sure there was a script for his work, but he made it come to life.  He's got the narration gene, not to mention the voice.<br /><br />This film merits awards, and I hope it gets them.  Although I love nature, most nature films are several rungs less interesting and well done as this one.  This is far beyond being a nature video with a running commentary.  It is an unforgettable story set in a jungle exploding with fascinating wildlife and told by a narrator with the perfect pitch and timing to make it real.  Kudos to everyone who worked on this film, and by the way--thanks!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The last part of the book descibing the actual raid was the most interesting. Military jargon, abbreviations, code names and dwelling on training might have some interest for some readers, but not for this one.
B005XN31LY|4.0|I started watching season 1 right when season 2 was beginning.  I had taken advantage of my Amazon Prime account over the summer and watched all of the seasons of Lost and loved it, which got me interested in this show.  The quality of the stream (not HD) was very good and only had to refresh once or twice.  I also downloaded episodes to my Kindle Fire quickly and the playback was great.  This show has an interesting take on traditional fairy tales, but I must say I was not familiar with all of the fairy tale characters - maybe that's my age (28) or that I'm a guy, I'm not sure, but my fiance was familiar with all of the characters.  I think the writers do an amazing job interweaving the stories and have now begun watching season 2 on my DVR.<br /><br />The stories can be a little \\"out there\\" at times, but who doesn't need a little break from reality and believability?<br /><br />As for my personal rating system, I reserve 5 stars for my favorites of any genre.  In this case, 5 stars would go to shows like 24, Dexter, and The Shield.  As for the quality of the streaming video and downloads, they would both get a 5 from me.  I was very satisfied.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I had high hopes as there was so much hype in the theater pre-release clips and critic reviews. Once I got the Blu-Ray I popped it in and was surprised how long it took to get to the first screen. Some of that is due to the player I am using but it took way longer than any other movie I have including Avatar. Once I got into the presentation the visuals were mind-blowing and state of the art.  Definitely a 5-star for visuals.  Absolutely stunning through out the entire movie. Watching this on a quality 3-D screen would definitely be the way to go as the visuals just want to take you along with its majestic mountain scenes as well as the different views from afar and within the sets created. Audio was spectacular as well in rich HD stream. The movie nicely pushed my 5.1 system and I was pulled in and into the dialogue as if I was right there as the center speaker pushed greater than most movies I have. It was very easy to make out the words and there was no mumbling or inaudible vocalization heard. Matter of fact, I turned the center speaker down a bit as the DTS pushed it a bit stronger than I wanted and after toning it down a bit it was more surround than otherwise. So for this, another 5 star.<br /><br />I won't get into the details of the movie itself (explaining the story line) as that could be covered elsewhere. Anyone who sees this movie will know what I am talking about with the following commentary. Where I have to drop it some is in the story and acting. Here I was a bit disappointed as character development and the acting is a bit curtailed and kinda not polished (real). The movie could have put another 10 minutes into it and enriching the main characters a bit more to allow a better/fuller understanding instead of a few one-liners or very quick summaries. I felt they were rather rushed. It just didn't flow for me. The plot and story line was interesting and it developed quite nicely but for me it wasn't the message I was looking for. Perhaps this could have been a two-parter movie that would maximize on some further background coverage as well as generate further detail that would really sink me into the characters personalities. So for the first time it is usually an entertainment perspective and the second time it is a technical analysis but it progressed rather slow for me so I got into the technical before its time as you tell my my commentary. Nevertheless, I will be watching it several times hoping to gather more information about the characters and plot and story line. So I guess I could give this an overall 4.5 stars if you want to get right to it!ve been a two-parter movie that would maximize on some further background coverage as well as generate further detail that would really sink me into the characters personalities.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|It becomes apparent half way through the movie that this is the story that came before the first movie ALIEN.  Ridley Scott had fun on this project, and a big budget.  It is not clear if this is the same planet, or this is the planet from which these aliens based their operations.  The CGI is all that you would expect and you will not be disappointed. The story is well-scripted and from the outset there are no slow areas.  Definitely, one of those movies where you enjoy watching again and again, so it is well worth buying.  GREAT movie.
B005F3GMAO|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Before I started reading I had little idea of Richard Branson except that he owned a record chain and an airline but couldn't see the connection between the two. This book gave me a insight into Richards childhood, school years as well as the years when he built his business and I found out that he is a real decent human being as well as a great entrepreneur. Thoroughly enjoyable.
1595822003|5.0|There is a real, sensual delight in turning the pages of this massive book, and seeing the incredible illustrations by Bernie Wrightson.  I'm all about ebooks, borrowing from the library and using my local used bookstore but this book is a keeper.  It's the incredible line drawings.  I first saw them online and was surprised to find I wanted the real thing.  The book did not disappoint.
B007REW8AC|5.0|I loved this album. I wish there was more of it, but I'll just have to wait for her next album! It's a very fun, soothing album and I have already recommended it to my friends.
B007THA4FI|2.0|J.K. Rowling has fallen below her usual fine standards in this book. The characters do not develop well and there is a great deal of confusion as to who is who. However,in all fairness this may be the seperation of two peoples by a common language. Apologies to W. S. Churchill
B009439HEY|5.0|I have always enjoyed Genesis Revisited. I'm a HUGE Genesis fan, first off, so anything involving their music appeals to me. Secondly, Steve Hackett is a master Guitar Player and music writer, and was responsible for many of their great songs. When I got Genesis Revisited, I was impressed with his arrangements on most of the songs. This new Genesis Revisited II is even better. With songs like Blood on the Rooftops, Dance with the Moonlit Knight, The Lamia, and most importantly, THE Genesis song of all time, Supper's Ready, this album has so many great tunes and such wonderful arrangements, I could listen to it all day without getting bored! Incredible songs originally, now simply fantastic songs again with Hackett's touch! I highly recommend this CD Set to ANYONE who loves Genesis, and also liked what he did on Genesis Revisited 1.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and so when I watched it, I was so disappointed because it was so violent I could only watch half.  Bummer.
B00136JS12|5.0|Perfect classic rock album. This album causes high school memories and the days of a California summer to come flooding back.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|What do I do now that I have gotten all the puzzle pieces and all the prizes?  Tell me I can do something else in this game.  It was great.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|This book was good.  Coupled with the online strength test, it definitely qualified a few of my strengths and goals.  I recommend as a affordable way to help create a cohesive work environment.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The FREE Battery HD app is very useful.  Having remaining battery life separated by music, video, browsing use has been incredibly helpful. I also like having a numeric estimate of battery life when I'm only able to partially charge Kindle battery.  Battery HD is better than the default buzz that signals 15% battery life left.
1451627289|2.0|I looked forward to reading this book as I thought it was a significant departure from mr. Kimg's usual style. I found this book had a very slow start and hard to follow the action. He uses so much detail that the story frequently got lost. It was hard to become invested in the characters and I couldn't wait to finish the book.
B008EEWN6I|5.0|Serj never fails to crank out some good stuff.  I can always listen to his albums over and over again and this one is no different.  I especially love the use of older stuff in combination with some new stuff.
0316212377|5.0|Short and sweet.  If you've read a couple or more Culture books, and liked them, read this one too.  Highly imaginative, amusing, scary, all of those things, yada yada yada.  IMHO, the greatest living writer of science fiction.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, it's quirky and reminiscent of early 90's Tim Burton or The Adams family.  Definiantly not a masterpiece but it was fun.
1451695195|3.0|I believe Dr. Alexander had an NDE, although his book makes clear he did not die, of the out-of-body variety. His brief description of the afterlife rings true to me as a fellow NDEr. Unfortunately, Dr. Alexander wrote an autobiography with only about 12 pages of description of what he actually experienced and learned in the afterlife. I want to hear more about what he experienced. For example, my own NDE books include over 500 pages of description of what happened to me -- including the content of many of the downloads of knowledge Dr. Alexander alludes to in his book, learning how to manifest physical reality, having a life review, recalling hundreds of other physical lifetimes, getting the answers to all my questions about life, seeing a documentary of the development of religion, witnessing Creation of the universe, and merging into Source and learning our true nature as integral parts of Source.<br /><br />Nanci L. Danison, Author of \\"BACKWARDS: Returning to Our Source for Answers\\"
0783225733|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for about six months. The price was great and it even arrived a day early. This is the type of movie you can watch with your whole family.
0871164566|5.0|I just got this in mail yesterday! Flipping thru it last night I found many projects that will be easy to do. Have some wire experience so that may contribute to how easy I think it is but for beginners the directions are VERY clear. Totally agree with author that should use copper to learn on before you start with the sterling. I have always done a easy practice project that way. Would recommend that you get some of that new goo that you can coat your pliers with so that you don't dent wire but you can always wrap with painter's tape as well--that's easy to remove but so is the goo stuff. Sorry forgot name. It smells awful and should open a window when you use! Ugh :(<br /><br />Have many stones that I wasnt wuite sure how I would use and this book is already sparking some ideas!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I purchased both the book and the DVD.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book because it provided a snap shot of the South in America for both Black women and White women. The characters displayed courage because they were willing to tell their story. It was a good read. The DVD closely followed the book!
B001L83PLQ|2.0|This book is only nominally ok. The story drags and takes forever to get through. I had heard good things about this author, but I was disappointed with the writing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I do not usually read mysteries, but I heard so much about this book that I was curious so I bought it. I was hooked from the first page. She did such a great job of voicing the alternate voices of Amy and Nick and the many layers of their personalities. I was recommending it to everyone in my book club while I was reading it. The author's writing is brilliant with many uses of metaphors throughout. Unfortunately, after reading it non-stop for two days I got to the last page and the author just stopped writing! I can't believe she purposely wrote that ending. It is one of the worst endings I have ever read. I get the feeling she was planning a sequel and didn't clue us in.....I didn't give it one star because her writing style is excellent, but felt cheated enough to only give it two.
B003PJ6UHA|2.0|What a surprise, since Berman's name is attached, I figured this would be an easy score for some relaxing science reading, but Lanza is the author and storyteller.<br />The idea that consciousness plays a role in quantum physics is an old one, and there is nothing new in this book other than the typical New Age unsupported claim that since particles  seem to demonstrate behaviors of entanglement based on an intelligent observer, than somehow this validates the idea that everything in the cosmos is created by thought alone.<br />The subject matter is fascinating, but Lanza does little if anything except to repackage stale ideas and offer about as much supporting evidence for his thesis as your local Reikki practitioner could (which is to say not much at all)<br />Lanza does drop names of scientific luminaries quite often, especially to point out how those he has  personally met seem to be confounded by his deep and vast intelligence, and there's a few stories of the general public looking to him as a miracle worker.  It all feels like listening to a great bore at an otherwise great party.<br />The book just didn't deliver anything outside of pseudo-science, and is only supported if you accept several specifically laid out concepts (Lanza has a list) presented as fact.  The problem in this case is that the concepts are based on a faith that Lanza is right and everyone else is wrong without any support for such a claim.<br />Truthfully, I sometimes felt as if Lanza was trying to sell a new religion rather than present a scientific theory.<br />What's disturbing is that according to Lanza, this book collapsed into its present state when I observed it, so I \\"created\\" this as it is.  I apologize.  :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a GREAT GAME for Kindle Fire HD, I recommend it to everyone !!!!! It is not complicatated at all !!!! Buy it or have it downloaded via Amazon.com
1423136802|5.0|Purchased and shipped to my son overseas.  He has shared the books with his buddies and they have all enjoyed the series.  Thank you
B007JMW46U|4.0|Am enjoying The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock is so clever.  He writes nice short stories that are interesting and fun to solve.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one did not miss a beat in continuing where the first one ended. If you enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey you will love this one too.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|A fascinating twist on the perennial game of love and playfulness; where the actors perform their comical love antics staged within the happenings of a cricket game.  The book is a standout rendition of risqué metaphors, innuendo's and double entendre's that are as titillating as there are stimulating.  A lively read that will tickle your fancy.
B00009Y3L4|2.0|This is one of the most awesome films of all time.  Winning critical praise and 8 Oscars to boot.  It is the ultimate \\"musical<br />with a message.\\" Yet still no truly restored Blu-ray version of this important film is available and I wonder why? From the reviews I've read here for years now the DVD versions of Cabaret that are available are a real let down for consumers and fans of the film.  Comments range from \\"terrible quality\\" to \\"not worth\\" buying. Does anyone know why the Warner Bros. studio refuses to release this film in a format it so richly deserves?  I'm giving 2 stars because I don't like the fact that no Blu-ray of Cabaret is available after more than 40 years.
0790729628|5.0|The classic.  Period.  The lush, atmospheric, futuristic tale of a blade runner coerced into one more \\"job\\" hunting down violent, killer replicants.  In Ridley Scott's version of 2019, not everyone is human.  So how can you tell the difference?  Completely absorbing; the movie delivers in every aspect.<br /><br />I was not able to tell much difference between the Director's cut and the Final Cut editions.  The two-disc Final Cut includes a wonderful behind-the-scenes DVD.
0802473156|5.0|I really like this book. It doesn't complicate things or give a lot of very specific things to try. The author presents the concept of the love languages and really leaves it up to the reader to translate the idea into his or her own situation. I like this book for several reasons. First, is that it doesn't make the book too long. Most people could read this in a day or two. Second, I have found that a lot of books get bogged down in the \\"try this, and this and this\\" part of the book and most of it is only going to work for a small subset or the people reading the book. Third, he never lets his ego get the best of him. Many books I have read can tell you all the specifics of a concept or idea but then immediately follow it with, make sure you are working closely with a trained professional. Immediately making the reader think that it is impossible to do any or even part of the concept on their own. This book is really the presentation of a concept and nothing more. That means it is open for your own interpretation and the author leaves it up to you to figure out how to make this work in your marriage.<br /><br />This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone, even if the marriage was stable. Everyone can decide to love their spouse a little better or make some changes to their love strategy.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|I am very pleased with this product. The Edge 800 computer is absolutely fantastic! Considering how much the Edge 800 costs, the sleek Silicon Skin Case is a wise accessory for a nominal cost which nicely accommodates that little bit of added security for protecting such a substantial investment from being damaged from accidental falls, fumbles and drops. The low profile design of the case is barely noticeable, it seems like a standard part of the computer. Thank you for such a terrific product.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It has annoying  adds, too simple and I didn't like it very much, but still lt is free, therefore I stil use it
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a book that really held my interest all the way through. I see it being an exciting movie. I never had a clue until the end what was really going on. I usually can guess what is going to happen way before the story is at its end and love it when I am compelled to not sleep until I find out. This book is definitely not like anything I have ever read before. The author is new to me but will certainly try this author again soon.
0783230079|5.0|Will make you smile. It is not a move I would watch once a month. But a couple time a year is great. Kinda give use who have screwed hope.
1594135851|5.0|My wife and I read the first book then saw the movie.  Could not find this the second book anywhere locally so ordered from ebay.<br /><br />Came very quickly in perfect condition.  I now have the trilogy of the Hunger Games series.
B00081U7HC|5.0|We think it was a great movie. Have watched it a number of times still makes me smile and laugh. It has a good ending. Wish they would make the next one.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|purchased because I needed $25 to get free shipping.  That was ok because my wife and I had seen the movie in the theater and liked it.  Just like any movie taken from a book it does not follow accurately.  But it is close enough.<br /><br />Shipping was excellent and arrived it great condition.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Couldn't put them down, awesome read.  normally it's easy to guess what will come next but these books kept me guessing fantastic
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is really fun i really enjoy playing it. i like to breed dragons and get eggs then try and guess what dragon it will turn out to be and see if i am right. im 12 and love this game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun and addictive ...!!!!! Wish it was totally  free ....not enough coins ...!!!! My husband and I fight over who's gonna use the free coins first...lol
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I would totally recommend this book!  I felt it had a very profound message and made the reader think about not only the aspect of time but how we live our lives with the time God has given each of us.  It makes a person evaluate themselves and ask the question of what is our priority in life and what is truly important.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love love love Pinterest!!! So many great ideas for everything you do in your life. Fun way to shop without spending a dime.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game! The layout changes every time you play it, so it doesn't get boring. Fun for all ages- my 6 yr old and 10 year old love it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love breeding different dragons and getting the surprise of new and rare ones. Wish it was easier to clear the land tho and easier to move stuff from one island to another.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My kids love this game at the carnivals - but it is always so expensive to play. This is a very fun version of that game, super addicting. The coin refresh rate is just slow enough so that you don't play for a super long time.. but you want to keep checking back often to use the new coins you've earned.
0451232852|5.0|This book melds true history into a superb novel.  It covers families in Russia during the Fall of Nicholas.. Czar of Russia,  British nobility and the Coal miners of Wales.  The First World War - how thousands of young boys were thrown into battle with the Germans and Kaiser Wilhelm  It is a book that I read at every opportunity.  Amazing novel, with realistic characters of that time.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It was easy to read but has profound meaning of life.<br />I liked the stories and I plan to give this book to my best friend.<br />Wonderfully written and many lessons to learn.<br />Really enjoyed.
0525952926|5.0|The Book arrived in timely fashion  Excellent condition  Excellent book. I couldnt put it down.  The writer is so good and keeps you enthralled  - it is a continunce of the Fall of Giants. I understand it is going to be a Trilogy and eagerly await the next installment.

B006ISJQBM|1.0|The most boring and pointless movie of the decade. I sincerely don't know what this movie is about. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, there's no plot, and the acting by Giovanni Ribisi couldn't be more obnoxious and fake.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I'd consider this a standalone from the Aliens franchise personally and if you go into the movie with that in mind (and enjoy sci-fi movies) you should enjoy yourself.  While it is true there are hints & faint threads tying this to the other movies (very thin threads of a prequel) I don't believe it was really designed to be Aliens The Prequel.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Handy to have access to my facebook on a larger screen than my phone. Easy and quick to download also.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Never would have thought who  done it! loved the amazing technical details and descriptions  of the  thought processes of the investigators. what a mind Patricia Cornwell has!

B00479SVBU|4.0|My Car does not have an auxiliary port or cassette player (2003 Honda). I intended to get a new radio installed for approx $100 and then replace my iPod for ($200), I hate putting songs on my iPhone. BUT I found this product and my life has changed. Previously, I had purchase a cheap fm transmitter. This was worth the $40!!! I simply need to figure out how to locate the songs quicker. I would have given the product 5 stars otherwise. Also I cannot figure out how to get the songs to play back to back without me having to press \\"next\\". The sound and volume is clear as ever and there is not static!! I recommend this product!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|An absolute delight to watch, no matter what age you are or feel you are.  A terrific story with an amazing cast.

B005EGXTEE|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, different from the film much better. Got me wanting to know more. Like the revolution she has started.
B008KE3960|5.0|The game IS free and fun!! The &quot;paid&quot; maps are add-ons and dont need to be bought to play this game. Love this game and u will too!! 5 stars!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has done it again a great plot and it has been absolutely amazing I reccomend this book for anyone.
B001NTLYKC|1.0|I bought this concert because of the reviews. They had to be made by diehard fans because these songs are embarassing to regular rock and roll fans. Horribly lame lead vocals, long, drawn-out solos induced by cocaine and tediously long songs create a feeling of \\"I've been had!\\". I was hoping Frampton would carry the load but he can only do so much. In this case it was a lost cause.... D:
B000KRNG5E|2.0|My copy starts with the director making an appeal for understanding, which I took to be a bad sign of what was to come.<br /><br />The story underpinning this movie is relatively straightforward and starts very promisingly with a situation that builds to an unlikely (but very evocative and atmospheric) underwater sequence. Illogical, and in my opinion some other footage could have been sacrificed to make this a little more believable from the character's Point of View, motivation-wise, but very well executed.<br /><br />After that fairly strong start the movie basically fell apart, with an ensemble cast we never get to know well enough to care about and a wandering plot that failed to hold any real interest for me after the first half hour or so. Characters wander into this story, are given portentous (or pretentious) lines to say and then are rendered irrelevant.<br /><br />It seemed to me a bunch of ideas for scenes that had been glued together with no inter-scene continuity to give the story any sort of structure as it was told rather than a story that had been fractured in order to tell it in a novel fashion and disguise its ordinariness.<br /><br />And it suffered greatly from having no point of view character for us to hitch our suspension of disbelief to.<br /><br />Even I know that you can't tell a story effectively this way.<br /><br />Not by any means Argento's best, and not a great episode in the Three Mothers saga.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Timekeeper was my first ever Kindle Book.  I love being able to select NYT Best Sellers easily and see how many folks like, love or hate a book. So for example, I can skip all those 'Shades of Gray.'<br /><br />Very imaginative concept and story. An incredible fast read, it kept me engrossed on a long flight home.<br /><br />Recommended for a nice way to get lost in someone else's world for a couple of hours.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|please someone email me @ threed333@yahoo.com and tell me how to start the puzzles... past the 10th level?!?!? I am addicted already that's for sure!!!

B0092QITO2|2.0|I have not seen the Total Recall from 1990, nor have I read the Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale that inspired that film and this one. I intended to watch the original soon after this one, but now I need a few days to cleanse my palette.  I can say without a doubt that this version has better special effects and more elaborate set design, but Total Recall feels like any generic science-fiction movie, re-worked to share elements with the story and slapped with the title to make more money. It's wonderful to look at and boasts the occasionally impressive sequence, but with Len Wiseman's humorless direction and a formulaic script, its little more than forgettable tripe. If Total Recall went by another name it would share the same fate as any other big-budget, predictable sci-fi movie from any given year; quickly disappearing from the public consciousness and ending up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. Despite reservations I had about the director (I've had issues with his films before) I was fond of the trailer and excited for the finished product. The trailer is the best thing about this movie.<br /><br />It's the end of the 21st century and due to the devastation caused by global chemical warfare, Earth has become almost uninhabitable and is now divided into two superpowers; the United Federation of Britain and The Colony. Citizens commute between the two via The Fall, a gravity elevator that travels through the Earth's core. Enter factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), happily married for seven years to Lori (Kate Beckinsale) but growing tired of his recurring nightmares and monotonous lifestyle. One night Quaid decides to visit Rekall, a company that implants allows you to experience an imagined adventure. Things go awry when a SWAT team bursts in and Quaid instinctively takes them out. Arriving home, Lori reveals she's not his wife and is actually a UFB agent. Soon he's on the run from her and the entire police force. As he starts to piece together his real identity, he encounters Melina (Jessica Biel), a fixture of his recurring dreams. Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy co-star as Cohaagen, the president of the UFB and Matthias Lair, the leader of the Colony's rebellion.<br /><br />Total Recall takes inspiration from an earlier film and a short story, but the plot and visual aesthetic recall the Bourne movies, Blade Runner, Minority Report, and any run-of-the-mill science-fiction movie of the last ten years. There isn't an original idea here, but Wiseman's talent lies in visual exposition and he gives the material a fair presentation. If only he'd apply these talents to a better script. With non-stop action, Total Recall only grows dull in the tired way the story plays out. There are layers of mystery and intrigue in the plot, yet the film never builds suspense and many scenes are prolonged beyond necessary. It's bloated, predictable conclusion doesn't help nor does the silly way it attempts to engage the audience a final time in the last couple minutes.<br /><br />The film is somber and humorless, as are the soulless performances. Farrell, Beckinsale, Biel, and Cranston are all charismatic people, yet they bring no charisma to their roles and share no chemistry with each other. Farrell brings likability, Cranston brings his usual intensity, and Beckinsale and Biel bring beauty; but this comes from their own natural persona. Wiseman knows how to create a dystopian world and stage large action sequences, but his grasp on character interaction leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The elaborate, murky set design makes the film great to look at and the stylized action sequences keep your attention, although there appears to be CGI in scenes of hand-to-hand combat. The futuristic car chase is one of the film's most thrilling scenes, but it's also derivative. A minor, biased complaint; why is there dubstep in this movie? Dubstep is this decade's disco. Is this really something we're going tohear at the end of this century?<br /><br />Total Recall is not a colossal failure, nor is it frustratingly bad. It's just a mediocre, forgettable movie that goes through the motions of its genre. Wiseman has proven he can handle big-budget action movies, but he has yet to prove he can create something original or, at the very least, something that breaks from the formula. If not for the title, this film would disappear overnight. Regardless, you totally won't recall this movie a year from now unless you stumble on the Blu-Ray in Wal-Mart's bargain bin.
145162607X|3.0|I found The Kingmaker's Daughter to be an interesting look into the War of the Roses, showing the same events explored in The Red Queen and The White Queen from yet another perspective. However, whereas I feel that The Red Queen was at times too introspective and heavy-handed with character-driven plot, The Kingmaker's daughter falls to the other extreme. In The Other Boleyn Girl and The Boleyn Inheritance, Gregory did a masterful job of writing characters whose motivations and loyalties were deeply conflicted, and unclear even to the characters themselves. In The Kingmaker's Daughter, loyalties are equally messy, but without the same introspective quality, the characters come off as inconsistent instead of conflicted. Anne often seemed to change her mind about things in the middle of conversations, and while these changes would make sense if given the proper context of years of loyalty to one person or another, without context they seem almost flighty.<br /><br />In short, I did enjoy learning more about other players in the War of the Roses, but wish we had gotten to see more of Gregory's thoughts of what might have been going on inside the characters' heads!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great!!  So many people are complaining about the cost but it's totally worth it.  I love it!!!!  It so fun and I could play it for hours straight.  This is one of the best games offered in this whole app store.
