B0070Y46UY|5.0|An outstanding work!  I can't understand how this book was originally turned down by publishers.  One learns a great deal about human nature and the desire to avoid the unpleasant side of man's nature.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|Awsome movie! I really enjoyed it. Great deal too! I would definetly recommend this movie to my friends. Makes a great xmas gift.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Was the point here just to add an installment to the &#34;Bourne&#34; movies?  I didn't get the sense that they were doing a switch of main characters, or anything really.  At the end I was surprised it was over and was just left wondering what the heck the point of the movie was.  It was decent action and could entertain for a few hours, but I don't think it comes close to as good as the previous films.
1400052181|3.0|A professor wanted us to buy and read the books, but never brought it up again. I didn't get past learning that Henrietta Lacks had cancer, her cells were the first to multiply in a lab, and her family didn't even know about any of this. I'm sure when I get the chance I may get more into the book, but only time will tell.
0307455874|5.0|I think anyone interested in the President's history would learn from this book, I did.<br />Give it a try and educate yourself about Barack Obama
B009E3EY38|5.0|Good Concert!!! Very awesome and the box comes with everything, music cds, blue ray and dvd with the rehersal of the group!!!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|At the begin I thought it was fun but it got stupid fast and the diamond add came up it was annoying
B00AA7O22U|3.0|If you do not want to see a cheesy butt-whuppin' movie, do not rent it.  You have been warned.  This movie is hilarious for it's corny dialogue and over-the-top action.
1594132054|3.0|I don't know if it was the style of this book or the fact that my brain didn't want to even attempt to process what could be learned about how our food gets from the farm to our homes but I just wasn't able to get into it. What I did read was informative, but like the title says I didn't get past the second chapter. Maybe if I want to become a vegan I'll try again, but until then it'll sit on my book shelf.
030758836X|4.0|The book is shocking, and absorbing from beginning to end.<br />Difficult to put away so be ready to read for hours
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|In love with all the batman movies but i might say these movies get better and better<br />Its a must see movie in my book.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a break through book on health problems in America.  Wheat's chromosomes were changed in the 60's from 14 to 34!  The reason was to have wheat that produced 8 times the crop and end world hunger!  One chromosome separates men from women...so 20 was a drastic change.  There was no testing with people and animals on the effects these changes would produce...so our food supply was changed.  The result was obesity, diabetes, cancer and all kinds of diseases and health problems.  This book should be required reading by everyone but especially in the medical field.  (Bill Gates Foundation wants to make the same changes  with rice to increase production and feed the world...more health problems down the road)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|One of the best super hero movies ever.  It's great to see a nice blend of the characters together after watching their films apart.
B00A0R42L6|4.0|A great family movie that warms the heart and makes everyone feel good. The story and characters never get old and still warm the heart.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|This is only the second book by Tom Clancy that I have ever read, and it was excellent. I loved it.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Must see movie with with a glass of wine and a bunch of friends lol Mr Tatum is HOT lOL
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. the ending was interesting but the first half of the book was slow for me and a little gruesome.
B0020M99LC|4.0|This is an excellent bond movie.  Daniel Craig is a great Bond and the action is pretty non-stop in this film.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|Enya has a sound of her own.  I have followed her since she  was  featured in new age music on hearts of space
B008N9AASC|2.0|I saw this in the theatre and couldn't have been more excited for the experience. I've been a fan of Ron Fricke's for years (starting with<br />Koyaanisqatsi and throughout all of the \\"qatsi\\" films except for Naqoyqatsi, which I did not care for.) Unfortunately, I was totally disappointed. That's not to say that the cinematography wasn't stunning - it was - there is no better master of the craft of cinematography. My problem with Samsara was Ron Fricke's bleak, dismal, distorted, horrific and depressing world view. Maybe a condemnation of everything western? I don't know if it was an overall endorsement of Islam and the Muslim religion, but it lacked the open minded natural spirituality so evident in films like Baraka and Koyaaniqatsi. Instead of embracing what's different, it felt like an indictment. This was no mistake, it was an effective statement of his \\"World View\\" or political opinions. That's fine if that's what you're looking for, but I preferred the softer and less condemning nature of his earlier films that were more a celebration of beauty executed masterfully.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a fun movie for everyone in the family.  My children ages 3 to 8 love the movie. And so did daddy and mommy. Great for movie night
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|After seeing the theater movie trailers it seemed like a movie to watch when it comes out on DVD. Surprise! The trailers did not indicate the F-rated language and context of the movie. Why anyone would take a childhood cuddly bear and turn it into a foul mouthed, dope smoking, sex fiend is an indication how low writers can go. Avoid this movie if you were looking to be entertained.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Neat Game.  However, no instructions as to how to play.  I had to search the internet for this information.  The advertising was not particularly intrusive.
B008ROH07W|5.0|I like her trumpet work very much , in particular handel pieces , I have played her on U tube  , also I follow her reviews in my BBC Magazine
B008JOK59K|5.0|You know those friends who complain (wrongly, of course) that there isn't any great rock n roll music coming out these days? Let them listen to this album, and see if you can change their minds. I already liked this band a lot before I got this album, but even I was surprised how good this is, from start to finish. There is not a bad song in this collection, and many are great. I think Pearl Jam meets Gin Blossoms, or something like that. Mostly hard-driving rock & roll, with just a bit of a (punk?) edge to it, with a few great ballads thrown in for good measure. If you only buy a few CD's (or downloads) this year, \\"Handwritten\\" should be one of them (along with Metric's \\"Synthetica\\"). I have heard that this band is one of Bruce Springsteen's favorite bands. I can see why. Awesome job, guys!
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|graphics and the added storyline incorporating charles dickens' christmas ghosts are incredibly well done. I highly recommend it for the holidays.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I could not read this - my fault for ordering it, I should have known better.  I am so over this kind of book.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|This collection is awesome.  It does not disappoint and the sounds vary quite a bit.  Will be more awesome to see their last show at Ultra Miami, though!
B004V73FGE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies now, it is a great experience.  Visually, audibly (soundtrack is AWEsome thanks to Daft Punk) and plot-wise, the movie is just epic.  Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have a neuropsych background.  This man experienced what he said he did, how he said he did it.  There is no other explanation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had a trip to the Los Angeles and was looking for something to read on the plane.  I couldn't believe how well-reviewed Gone Girl was but decided to give it a shot.  I was rewarded handsomely.  Great plotting and well-scripted prose. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />Special note to the guys out there:  I usually do not prefer female authors.  I find them a little too warm and fuzzy. Not Flynn. She is razor sharp.  Highly recommended.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Think Family guy in movie/human form and you end up with a talking bear and a actor that is funny.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Does anyone know if this system can also work for the wii? I just bought a Wii and I am currently in college and would like something portable to have in my room so I can play.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Looks and acts just like a digital alarm clock!  Easy to use and it works!  Lots of different sounds to choose from.  Nice big readout.  This one is a 5 star for sure.
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|Purchased this for $14.99 Amazon prime streamin and got a pretty crappy Standard Def  movie for the top price.  Could have waited and purchased the BR cheaper and had the movie for my library.  The quality with the SD was poor and just made the movie blah, with the kind of graphics on this movie HD is the only way to go.<br /><br />Have fun...
B000FBFN1U|3.0|By the third book, I am tired of all the protagonists being killed off.  Too much frustration for me; I'm not reading the fourth book.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I had a little problem getting into the first 20 minutes, but once I did, I loved the movie.  I watched it a second time and the first 20 minutes were enjoyable as well!  I'd watch it again tonite if I still had it!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I typically don't read from the young adult genre because I find that the language and themes are too &#34;dumbed down&#34; and the genre is not often challenging enough to hold my interest but this was a pleasant surprise.<br />Although there are times where the author does &#34;tell, not show&#34; (the cardinal sin of good writing), I was engaged enough with the plot and the pacing that I was able to overlook the heavy-handedness of some of the themes.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I could not figure out how to use it.  I did not think that it was intuitive at all.  I deleted it from my apps altogether.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show, love it!! The only show I've ever been kept interested to keep watching. Can't wait for February!!! Amazon buying super easy to use and works streaming wonderfully!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Strongest book I have ever read, especially powerful immediately following the Conn. school shootings.Shocking ending!  I especially liked the format.
B006LSZECO|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN.  THROUGHOUT THE NOVEL THE AUTHOR KEEPS THE READERS' MIND TRYING TO GUESS THE NEXT CHAPTER, ONLY TO BE SURPRISED AT TO OUTCOME.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|After reading both the 4-Hour Workweek and the 4-Hour Body, it was a no-brainer that I was going to purchase the 4-Hour Chef. Tim Ferriss' style of writing may not be the cup of tea (or Kool-aid as some have referred to) that some people may need, but he does put out information in a stylized and poignant way so as to keep the reader entertained as well as informed. I was already a decent cook before reading this book, but now I have more weapons in my arsenal to continue the battle with eating healthy.<br />The first time I tried the Slo-Carb diet, I lost over 50 lbs. After this holiday season, I'm looking to drop even more than that as well as pack on some muscle. With this book and the 4-Hour Body, I believe I have all the tools necessary to accomplish my goal!<br />Good luck to anyone out there who is trying this out for the first time. I definitely recommend this book.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|10 years after release, this movie still holds up. Very entertaining, even seeing it for the 3rd or so time. The kids enjoyed it as well.
B003M2DWE4|5.0|My 8 year old has wanted a Lego alarm clock for quite some time. Packaged nicely and fast shipping, I was pleased and I am sure my son will love it.
0670921076|5.0|Couldn't put it down. A case of truth is better than fiction. It also gave good insight about pre war European influence in China.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I love the entire series of Men In Black movies and this edition fits right in with the first two. This isn't Academy Award material and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But for those of us that enjoy this kind of movie I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it's no longer as new and innovative as the original. However, it still retains the humor, effects and story line. For those folks that don't care for this genre of movie I don't recommend it, but for those of us who do - I highly recommend it.
B00755MHXG|5.0|My ten year daughter normally enjoys action books but after hearing about this book at school she wanted to read it on her Kindle. She told me it makes you think about what if there was a child at your school like this. What would you do? It gives different opinions and perspectives by his different class mates and family and friends on August. It is a book anybody would enjoy.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|C'mon people, it's titled &#34;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&#34;. What did you expect, Les Miserables? It's fun and entertaining. Glad I watched it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|my husband, myself, and our two teenage sons absolutely loved this movie. great action, awesome story line, and the acting was really well done. we highly recommend it :)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I felt this book was a good ending to the series, however it definitely left me wanting more. As this was the last Twilight, I did go on to read The Host, which was also very good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it a great zombie show and my wife and i like zombie movies<br />nothing wrong with the show<br />yes i told people about the show
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. Probably not for the squeamish though. Good character development and interesting story line especially rare in action movie, I really came to care about the characters by the end.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I love the actors and the preview made this seem like a great comedy....the only problem, there was not many funny moments.  I thought that the situation was a vehicle for a fun, laugh-filled movie----but the focus was more on the situation rather than the funny.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Yes, there is a lot of sex, maybe a little too much,but there's excitement too. The story itself is good. I can't wait too read #3.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely love this case. It fits my kindle fire snugly so that it doesn't fall out or shift around. I also love the irony that is makes my ebook look like an old book!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I guess I need to read instructions if I can find them.  My daughter-in-law takes wonderful pictures with her tablet.  So far all I have been able to get pictures of is me and I don't even like looking in a mirror these days.  :-)  It was inexpensive but should have been included.  So far not so good!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This was a big hit with my little jedi!  He loved the game and has had no complaints with how it works.  I have had fun with it as well when he allows me to play!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Of of the four Navy SEAL-authored books I've read, this one has the least amount of swearing (although there is some).  Compelling, even though you already know how it ends.  A must read for all Americans.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I thought this book was too much like the first book of the Trilogy<br />It was well written as all of Ken Follet books, but did not hold my interest.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this version of solitaire. The options of backgrounds and cards is good.<br />The opportunity to play against other players online is an added bonus.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Novel novel, but not different enough to make up for the content. I had to make myself finish it. I didn't like Pulp Fiction, either, if that gives you any hint. I didn't like the characters and found it hard to empathize with anyone in the book.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Cannot put this down. A real page turner. I love the Scarpetta novels, and she's really outdone herself with this one. For people who like mysteries with strong forensic story line and well-written books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is a good read, holds interest and has a mega giant twist at the end. This book would make a good quiet weekend getaway read.
193413712X|3.0|Many parts of this book are so beautifully written that it has potential to be five stars, but so many other sections were bewildering and chopping up the flow of this book that by the end I was terrible confused and the only thing that I had gotten from the book was that someone had died. Despite the few pages of this book, it is no easy read. I had to read it in many short sessions so I had time to think and make sense of the pages I read. Maybe others would have more luck than I did in understanding and appreciating this book because some parts are truly breath taking.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Really happy with the free Angry Bird game on my new Kindle Fire ND. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B005PK553C|5.0|Amazing!  &#34;A+&#34; on all facets.<br /><br />Nothing is ever dragged out and you are never strung along.  The action, discoveries,  and twists are banged out as if each episode were the last!
B008PCVGKI|5.0|This analysis is a devastatingly clear indictment of the perverse incentives of the whole drug industry. Ben simply chronicles public research, court cases and examples of bad practice and regulations that could be changed but are not because of clever lobbying of vested interests.<br /><br />I particularly liked the suggestions for fixing the problems at the end of each chapter, but can see that they do not have a hope of being implemented by the current regulators, dispensers and doctors.<br /><br />I discussed it with a pharmacist who claimed that she was impervious to the marketing and spin, but that doctors were not.<br />If only more medical journalists read this book before writing up another farcical case promoted by compromised pressure groups we might reduce our costs and get a bit of integrity back into research.<br /><br />Sponsored research seems a particular problem at the root of a lot of the distortion. If government funds were spent on compulsory reviews and independent research we might get somewhere. New Zealand's Pharmac is a model that is extremely unpopular with drug companies that should be implemented in every country as a start.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this animated film by Disney.  The animation was remarkable.  The story and music were entertaining.  This is a great family movie especially for Mothers and daughters to watch together.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is so cute and definitely challenging at times! My kids love it...and i love that it makes them use their brain!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Maybe the characterizations aren't the greatest, but this tale of survival on Mars is great fun.  Most on the tech stuff is reasonable, although a couple of the items (including the initial disaster) don't hold up under scrutiny.  Hard to put down, though, an easy couple of days read - or a long plane flight.
B003B02O14|5.0|John Grisham is awesome. I have read this book several times and it never gets old. He hit this one out of the park..
0547884591|5.0|Another excellent read from Timothy Ferriss....many unexpected gems of learning and living well - if you love to learn (plus food as a bonus) then get this book!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm. I use it every day. I like that the sound starts quiet and gets louder. I also like the whole screen easy snooze.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|the book offers much more insight into the Westeros world than TV series. few lines (esp. Tyrion's) are quite hilarious
0783225881|4.0|We have lots of movies but come back to view this one from time to time. It's a great story even for those who don't recognize the names of the &#34;old-timers&#34;, but especially for those baseball buffs who know them. The casting was great!
B0053O89Z6|3.0|This is a Christmas present so I'm not sure of the quality yet.  It looks like it is in good shape.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app puts my colicky baby right to sleep. It is the best app I have purchased for my kindle and iPhone.
B002RV01QI|4.0|I woukd give five stars if it had not been for the crack. Its a gift and didnt have time to return it for a nice one :(
034580404X|5.0|This is a really good series.  At first I didn't think I was going to like it, as some of the stuff seemed a little too &#34;over-the-top&#34; to me, but if you keep reading, the story comes together and you fall in love with Christian & Anastasia.
1848378963|5.0|I purchased the book to review it for a book club.  I was not familliar with Wilkie Collins.  I enjoyed his style and recommend it highly.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|As a sceptic of most of the video games out there claiming to be 'not just a game but an experience' AND kid friendly, I didn't expect too much from this one. My boys were especially disappointed that there weren't any tv characters, race cars or army tanks on the cover. That all changed within 3 minutes of playing. Even though only one boy was playing, all 5 were captivated by the MUSIC (not just sound, or dinky repeating bites of jingles but honest to goodness music!!) and the imagery (again calling it anything else is unthinkable) with no guided text, no spoken words, no 'this way' arrows, no crash and burns, 'you have died' notices, and a new way to navigate with the controller what had them spell bound? An experience  . . . from a video game  . . . may wonders never cease :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend and I read this book and had a book club discussion, even though we are not part of the book club.  The controversy this creates in the imagination makes the book worth reading.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app was great. I have a wonderful time browsing :) I have already bought stuff and I can't wait for it to come in the mail :)
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|good old school music to rock out too it was shipped fast love this cd and this band give them a try youll like
B000FC12SM|4.0|Communication is part of our everyday life, involving interaction with every kind of people who surround us.<br />Well, concerning this subject I've recently read Jack Dusenberry's \\"The Power of Connection\\" [[ASIN:B00AAQHEQM The Power Of Connection: Secrets To Successful Communication]] that has really helped me bettering my way to interacte with the world.<br />After that, I've discovered another book, that is the one I'm now going to review: \\"Men are from Mars, women are from Venus\\" by John Gray.<br />I remember to have heard this title a long time ago... maybe it was a movie... whatever, reading the title has brought a little smile on my face, because it remined me of a urban myth: the difference between women and men can be explained in the two planets where they really come from: men come from Mars and women come from Venus.<br />Of course, this is a funny explanation!<br />Reading this book can certainly be a good way to spend pleasant time, just to realise how important the sense of humor is, according to John Gray.<br />This guide could help us improving our relationship with the opposite sex, that's why it's recommended to both women and men.<br />Reader will find many tips and pieces of advice, who will suggest him the best ways to communicate with men or women.<br />This guide has also been thought for married couples: in their life, there can be many obstacles deriving from a missing communication, so that's a good reason to buy \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" by John Gray.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Seth McFarlane and the Family Guy show. HUGE fan. Also kind of a Wahlberg fan, ever since being blown away by his performance in Boogie Nights. Finally, I'm from the Boston area, so I always love to watch films set in our town. Unfortunately, Ted was a sort of triple let down.<br /><br />First and foremost, the movie is just not very funny. Certainly there are some good laughs in here, but the plot is thin, the jokes are too obvious and lazy, and the production value is lacking.  It seemed more like an overly-long episode of a sitcom than a movie.<br /><br />I usually try to pay close attention to any film, even comedies, to catch some of the nuance of dialog, set design, etc., but I found myself paying more attention to my laptop while watching this. In fact, my wife and I both fell asleep during this movie. Though to be fair we have a three-year-old and a newborn, so perhaps there were other forces working against us at 10:00pm on Saturday!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Need a little spice or some ideas?  Want to try a new adventure?  Read this book and apply some into your own life.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|i enjoyed this movie in the theatre,  I wanted to own it and the Amazon price was right.  My next girls night-in will feature this excellant  movie.
B000000JO3|5.0|good old school music to rock out too it was shipped fast love this cd and this band give them a try youll like
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending is fitting. Sometimes I wanted an end to the returns Katniss kept making into those states of hospitalized helplessness. But when I considered all that she went through, then I suppose those times were understandable. The trilogy is a fast read into a believable and frightening world. There are worse games and many far less interesting reads.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|It started out amusing and enjoyable but got tedious by the end of the book.  It is a good summer book - one you can pick up and lay down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book had everything the first two had and more.  Great finish of the series.  I would reccommend this book for couples, not just women.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another hit from one of my favourite authors. Great story with a number of twists you don't see coming. Read this for a quick escape!
B001AKTZO6|5.0|Bayou Country by Credence Clearwater Revival.  Speak's for itself.  An ageless classic.<br />I like the packaging.  Not a plastic case.  A &#34;miniature&#34; version of the original vinyl album cover.  Nice.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, John Grisham weaves a spellbinding story that holds your attention until the very end.  He simplified a complicated plot and made it believable.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|As &#34;Looking for Alaska&#34; is one of my favorite books, I had high expectations for &#34;Paper Towns.&#34;  I thought the writing was lovely, and the plot interesting, but I didn't love the characters the way I did in &#34;Looking for Alaska.&#34;  That was a minor disappointment, but overall a well written story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I gave this book five stars because it kept you wondering what would happen next. It was a great read! I downloaded it as soon as I knew it was out and didn't put it down till I was finished! This is one if those kind of books that leaves an impression on you. You will not be disappointed in this one! If you've read her previous books and loved them I would highly recommend this one also!
B005UD1D62|2.0|Perhaps the last part of that title is actually a compliment. The length of this horrible book meant my torture was over quickly. It's obvious when the editor or ghost writer put in a few big words to jazz it up. I would recommend this type of book to a young teen girl but I wouldn't want to damage her brain. Don't waste your time or money.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The book was pretty good.  I did not realize it was part of a series when I selected it and I felt like I would have enjoyed it more if I had known the main characters background.
0525953728|5.0|im speaking second hand since i purchased this book azs a gift for my family member they really enjoiyed the book
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and intriguing games I have ever played.  It sucks you in and you actually feel like you become part of the game.  Very rare for a free game.  Great!  RV Guy
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Even thought this movie does not have too much excitement and well knit content, I would still recommend this title to batman fans.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Loved it- but I love everything that Ewan Mcgregor is in.  I just wish infidelity wasn't in every movie these days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really enjoy the show. allot of action and suspense. Looking forward to next season. Just wish we didn't have to wait so long till next season.
0385006896|5.0|I always wanted to own this book with all stories about Sherlock Holmes and now my dream came true! Thank you!
B000YHG72E|5.0|It was cute and heart warming!We love to watch it as a family and my chilren are grown now. I'd love an Elf 2
B0072OFM28|5.0|I couldnt get enough of this series on TV so I purchased it so I can watch it when I wanted to. Loaded with action and interesting story lines.
B004XGN8W4|3.0|Why not spend the extra money to get the larger and newer system. Bought this first by mistake then realized that there was an even better gaming system available by Gaems - the HALO UNSC Vanguard edition. For just a little bit more money you get a better overall value. On the newer model its a Bigger screen, better sound, more headphone jacks and overall its more functional.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie. I watched it recently because I remember it was popular when it first came out. I decided to see what the hype was about and I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Love the songs and the artists have great voices I would reccommend it to friends enjoy it emensely glad to own it
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This item was intended to be viewed on my Tivo.  After purchasing online and setting it to download to my Tivo, it has still not downloaded.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I couldnt get enough of this series on TV so I purchased it so I can watch it when I wanted to. Loaded with action and interesting story lines.
0446554995|5.0|This whole series has been a great trip. These guys write well and take the reader all over the place with tremendous detail
B004SIIBGU|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 6 year old grandson plays it for hours I love it I play it as much as he does. great game
B009HEJXFS|4.0|A young and old K. Jump in and enjoy a good time paradox. The movie goes full circle full of humor.
B007THA4FI|3.0|JK Rowling just writes well. All the characters are distinct and so well described you can visualize them.<br />I found so many of them unpleasant and the social welfare message of the book heavy handed. That I would reccomend this book with some reservations.
B009HELT3C|1.0|I should have stopped at MIB 2, very disappointing.  Not anywhere at being as clever and funny as the first 2 movies.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Great book for people who are in the project management business.<br />It´s really quick an fun to read, but also is the kind of book that one will read more than twice to get inspired.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Very thought provoking!  Gives a wonderful insight into what a person with dimentia experiences.  Anyone who has family members with any form of dimentia should read this.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This product is free for a reason. Loads of ads... other than that, it works great. I would download an ad-free version.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I found this book to be an interesting read. I was into it from the very beginning. The characters are very well drawn. They are certainly not the ordinary. Likewise description of places and scenery are graphic.<br />  The plot is unusual and although you are given clues about the outcome, it didn't interfere withmy interest. I recommend this book
B004GJDQT8|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B009ZE27US|1.0|ok this app sucks any other free app I would not complain about but I'm 12 and it said I was 46
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Hot sex but don't want a man addressing me like that. I find it degrading to women. Single ladies find a men before you read this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is very addicting. I have it for my iPod as well as my kindle. It's one of the best games. :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use this mostly on iPhone, but that I can also run and access my docs from my Mac, PC, iPad, and Kindle Fire is awesome.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoy this style of hidden object game.  I like ones where the characters interact with the main character giving you hints etc.  Having the monkey get items that you needed but couldnt reach was a amusing twist.  If you liked Nightmares from the deep: The cursed heart, you will like this one although this one seemed shorter.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|My son (5yrs) has been on this &#34;I am a karate kid&#34; rant since he saw Karate Kid on tv, so we recorded on our DVR, but he just wanted to watch it over and over and over and it was difficult to get him out of the game room for anyone else to watch tv, so I bought him the video so that he could watch this movie in HIS ROOM on HIS TV (lol).<br /><br />Now we have our game room back and my husband can watch football again (lol).<br /><br />#winwin
B0000714BP|5.0|It shipped in the time it was supposed to, it was a great price, and there were no problems receiving it.
1442353279|5.0|In his book, he details the difficulties he faced as a young man.  Despite these limitations, he accomplished extraordinary things because of his dedication and work ethic.  As he stated, what are the chances that a man from the small country of Austria<br />could win more Mr. Universe titles than anyone else, become the biggest box office star in the United States, and then become governor of California.  The book is the inside story of his rise from obscurity to fame and the people and celebrities he impacted.<br />.
B004SBULWE|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|Brings back memories from my youth when this had a two-year run in a local movie theatre. Offbeat humor and worth seeing.
B007XHWROK|1.0|If Justin Bieber had any artistic soul he would not have released this awful CD.  The rapping lyrics are so bad they are comical.  Our family now laughs ever time we hear Bieber sounding like little kids playing cowboys and indians.  Our daughter was a Bieber fan.  This release has thankfully allowed her to move on.  So I guess there is that one redeeming aspect.  Oh, and Justin, pull your pants up!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having just recently lost my husband to brain cancer, I have been searching for answers.  I learned about this book and bought it.  I am so happy I did.  I believe this to be true as I know my husband experienced similar things prior to death.  I have many things to think about, and many things to review on this book.  I recommend this to anyone who is searching as I have been.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love it!! Alot different than doo wops n hooligans,<br />But in a good way. More sex :) everything from get busy music to \\"when I was your man\\" my favorite!
B0063IH60K|3.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Wonderful. Emotional. Perfect in its simplicity.<br /><br />Yes, the Marius character was the weakest vocally, but he made up for it with his depth during Empty Chairs. I thought he played the character sweetly.<br /><br />I bought for myself, my mom for Christmas and have been recommending to friends. BRAVO!
B000MG1ZGA|5.0|This is the Door's last work. I hard time for Jim Morrison, facing jail time.<br />Nonetheless, it is an EXCELLENT, BLUESY, BAD ASS Cd! Jim was in the prime of his game!! A lot of pain and hard blues here! LA woman is a perfect portrait of Los Angeles
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I found this book, too much like a fable. Although I liked the thought of having your own personal legend and doing what you need to do to fulfill it,, I did think this book inspired me, it is written very simplisticly and parts of it are dragged out
B00508W37K|5.0|I loved the movie and thought it was very funny. My kids wanted it for Christmas. The DVD was in very good condition and it came lightening fast.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
076781326X|5.0|This was for my son-in-law - his favorite movie for Christmas. his youngest son is also named Oliver. Great version of the movie
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Merida is a very independent young woman who won't be forced  into marriage.  The story could have been a little more exciting.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think that it great, and very handy. I think that the warning that your Battery is low (15%) is what everyone useing the Kindle Fire HD should have.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Cute, I like the music, doesn't give you a preview of the layout on the menu so it's hard to find one you like.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Flynn's books and consider The Last Man as good as the best in the past.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Not the funniest movie of all time, but certainly one of the funnier ones in 2012.  Seth McFarlene is genius... Love a Teddy Bear with a Bostonian accent!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Ok, ive had this game for quite some time now and give it 5 stars for my expieriences. Any time i try to log in, it says that I hav to download an update, but  I dont kno how to. Please someone write back and tell me how.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Saw the movie before reading the book.  So far the book is just as interesting as the movie.  The ending was a little different but I would recommend purchasing it.
B0039YZPZ4|3.0|The movie was great but it froze up and skipped scenes a couple of times. It was very frustrating. I will attempt more movies in hopes that they will not freeze up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome, always surprises you!  Love how the new &#34;community&#34; is being brought in.  This is one of the best series I have seen in a while
B0090YHSFC|4.0|My daughter really likes this game. It is very fun for her and she is only 3 years old. Good game!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is a very interesting book. Very well written and a good paranormal read. I enjoyed it. A good rainy day read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a fast simple alarm clock. I just love it . I can keep my case closed ans it still works.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|I chose this rating because this game was messed up and I wasn't able to finish it. I couldn't get past a certain point even though I completed the necessary steps.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book about Adam Brown might be one of the most inspirational books out there. Adam Brown is a legend and everyone should know how great of a guy he was.<br /><br />A heads up the book is very religious. I don't have any complaints about that but some people might.
B002DD67XG|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than vintage James Taylor.  These are some of his best loved, all time favorites to stroll down memory lane with.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you like Family Guy then you should enjoy Ted.  That teddy bear was hilarious, but definitely not for children.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This may be the second best of Crowe (the Gladiator is just fantastic), and for sure the best of the director. Some criticised that the movie was slow. I had not read the book but IMHO the pace had been just right to build up the characters and consummate the plot. What's more, the combat scenes far excelled those of the \\"Privates of the Carribean\\" series. The main actors (no actress at all, except a shot or two of some female S. American locals) were all great, and I am obliged to praise all the supporting \\"sailors\\" for their superb performance. Buy the Blu-ray format. You can repeatedly enjoy 2 great sea battles in HD repeatedly, hopefully with your decent AV system and your male friends. Highly recommended!
B001N3OJEG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Its all-star cast, non-stop action, and intricate plot twists separate L.A. Confidential from the many gangster/crime family movies that all seem to follow all too similar plot lines and character stereotypes.  The time period and the setting in L.A. allow the introduction of different varied underlying elements such as the movie/porn industry as well as racial discrimination into the mix to present a truly unique movie.  Russell Crowe at his best.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie was so funny. I really liked it and would recommend it to everyone who wants a good laugh.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I fell in love with this movie just by watching the trailer.  I wanted to propose to it when I actually got to see it.  And then the DVD has great features such as seeing the movie from the College Kids' point of view and such, and that was when I realized that it was too good for me, and I put the ring away an never bothered to let it know of my affections.<br /><br />So, go, watch it.  Fall in love with it yourself.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm addicted. Can't stop watching. It's definitely a must-see. I usually would just wait for the season to come out on Netflix but I loved the show so much that I bought the season early so I could catch up on the new episode on January 2nd! Watch the clips! You will be intrigued!
B0076DELIG|5.0|LOVE ALL MICHAEL CONNELLY BOOKS!  AND THIS ONE IS GREAT too!<br />HE IS A FANTASTIC AUTHOR.  HE IS A DOWN TO EARTH WRITER!  HE LOVES<br />THE &#34;LITTLE GUY&#34;.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder is a great system so how could I not give it 5 stars. The only negative being the book is slightly too large for the binding they use and unless they fixed it in a most recent printing it may start to separate from the cover (I've seen it happen in 2 friends books). Maybe this will get fixed in the future or maybe it's a 'feature' in order to get you to buy it again after you've read it over and over.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I feel the Doctor is the most knowlegable person to speak and write on this subject.  I have read Ross's book and many others.  His is great and believable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone as well and it never works. This one is great. I never have problems and I am on it all the time. It Mossberg quickly and easily. I love my kindle and this app on the kindle ROCKS!!!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|.The book had a good story and premise.  It got a slow reading in parts, but the ending was definitely worth the wait.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I does what its supposed to do, sharpen your knives. I feel this is more for pocked knives or multi tools. You might want to buy a better one for your good kitchen knives. It has a little arm for your serrations and is fairly quality. Its a simple knife sharpener, nothing to really mess up on it.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|this type of entertainment shows the sad state of american entertainment. I realize its fiction but given the current state of the world it's sad to make our soldiers into possible terrorists.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I kept waiting for something to happen - it never did.  Storylines were hard to follow, kept having<br />to back track - who is who?
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I really loved gossip girl! This was a shortened season which is the only thing that sucked about it. I'm gonna miss this show so much!! But I am glad how everything turned out :) it was perfect!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This is a beautiful soundtrack, and if you appreciate the The Lord of the Rings Trilogy soundtracks you'll definitely want to add this one to the collection.  The bonus tracks were definitely worth the extra $.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for my parents as a Christmas gift, it is just down right funny. Great spoof on &#34;Who Done its.&#34; Well worth the price :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show lives up to the last two seasons. Always keeping you on your toes and surprises you constantly going left when you think they're going right. Awesome!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Mis fans, this is a must-have collector's item!  One can never get tired of watching and listening to the soul stirring music and lyrics.  Now waiting to see the movie during the  Christmas Holidays.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|my wife an i really enjoy this serious,it is well done,an cant ask for more,part 2 was great also tx
B0086700CM|2.0|I love the game but it does not play right. Turning the corners on this game  does not work right, when you go to turn the corner half the time it will not turn.
1615238948|5.0|My sister-in-law recommended this book and my wife has enjoyed reading it and would highly recommended it to all readers.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|If looking for a great story, some hard hitting action, and good acting, i highly recommend. My favorite genre of movies are crime movies and this would be top 5.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift is cute. I mean, that's my opinion of her and the opinion of many others. Very few see her as a true artist who has diversity in songs--she does the same lyrics and the same style every time. There isn't much to call art, to be honest.<br /><br />That was until this album was released.<br /><br />Granted, WANEGBT wasn't artistic in any regard (still pondering that Grammy nod...more likely a &#34;thank you for hosting the nominations concert&#34; treat), but that was not indicative of what was to come on the rest of the record. If you are a dire-hard country fan, you will be disappointed by this album. Then again...why are you listening to a Taylor Swift album in the first place? Her last two albums were more pop than country, so I don't really see a worthy criticism in that regard.<br /><br />The album opens and doesn't reach a weak point until...well, track 10. State of Grace is a U2 throwback that can only be described as epic. Red is the song everyone (male and female alike) will blare with their windows down on the highway. The gradual crescendo on Treacherous is absolutely wonderful, leading into I Knew You Were Trouble. I never thought that I would see the day when DUBSTEP was in a Taylor Swift song and it worked...but I guess I did. This is one of the best songs released this year and will be a bona fide smash hit on the Hot 100, no doubt.<br /><br />I just realized how long this album was and how great it was and how repetitive I would be if I went through each and every song and said how wonderful it was, so I will say which tracks were bad.<br /><br />The Last Time - Meh. nothing appealing about this. Slow and groggy would be two choice words to describe it.<br /><br />Starlight - VOMIT. Horrible. Sounds like a throwaway Selena Gomez track.<br /><br />That's it, honestly...The Ed Sheeran Collab was PERFECT, and BEGIN AGAIN WILL MAKE ANY GIRL CRY. Just saying.<br /><br />A solid fourth album. She has made me a fan.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Emotions run rampant in  this incredible series!! Love, lust, evil, and some weirdness, too!! Cannot say enough about the quality of the performances. I am thoroughly enjoying every second of this incredible story line -- try it, you'll love it!!! Already pre-ordered season 3!!!
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Good book, but not my favorite of her work. Would have liked some different characters and locations.  Still better than most.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|It is just. so. sloooooow.  And boring.  And honestly doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times.  Here's a prime example of what bugs me about this book.  Jace - the fierce, dangerous, brutal demon killer is threatened with being GROUNDED for bringing a Mundane back to &#34;headquarters&#34; and getting blood on the floor in the entryway.  (visualize sardonic eyebrow quirk here)<br /><br />I saw the movie preview and was interested in the books based on that, but sadly, I am still in search of a new series to love.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|For her seventh album in just as many years (time flies, don't it?) Rihanna needed to do something different. Talk That Talk was an overall lackluster record despite the bombastically catchy and tailor-made-for-radio single choices. It was a step in the right direction from the extraordinarily manufactured Loud, which was her label's reaction to the artistically cohesive, emotionally impactful, raw, wonderful yet lowest selling (it ONLY hit platinum, for goodness sake) album Rated R. That being said, however, there was still someTHING that was left to be desired.<br /><br />As a reaction to this conundrum, we now have the number one album Unapologetic. The album pays homage to her urban radio roots (because, let's be honest, when was the last time Rihanna had a song that actually DESERVED to be played on an R&B/hip hop radio station&#34;?) with tracks such as &#34;Presh Off the Runway,&#34; &#34;Numb, &#34;Pour It Up,&#34; and &#34;Loveeeee Song.&#34; These were the songs that took the longest for me to warm up to, but they end up adding to my positive view of the album as a whole when I finally did. They are located at the beginning of the record, sandwiched between the ubiquitous and delightful &#34;Diamonds,&#34; which is oddly enough not the strongest song on the record (a good thing for future single choices!).<br /><br />Right as the urban section started, it ends, bringing us to the pop hits that Rih has been made famous for. &#34;Jump&#34; and &#34;Right Now&#34; are the songs that her record label put on there just in case some of the other more risky songs end up flopping. Right Now is miles away from Jump in terms of quality, and if either of these see radio play (which I hope they don't because there are better songs on here), I would prefer Jump due to its unique production and lack of cliches that plague Right Now.<br /><br />Next are the two best songs on the album. &#34;What Now&#34; is a midtempo power ballad that explores the registers that I didn't even know Rih had. The piano riff is wonderful and the bridge and outro make the song absolutely perfect. But STAY. THIS is where the album's opus happens. This is her most powerful ballad to date, and one of the strongest songs she has recorded. Definitely one of the best songs on the record. It would have been FAR better as a solo version. I hope we end up getting that eventually!<br /><br />Now comes my one gripe: Nobody's BIDness. K. So Chris just didn't need to ruin an otherwise musically tight production. I just skip over it every time. Professional reviewers have been giving her flack for this (which I agree a certain degree of flack is needed), but that has made them ignore the actual quality of the album itself. Oh well. Her and her label's loss I guess.<br /><br />The album ends on a much better note than track 10, however. Love Without Tragedy is FINALLY a two-songs-in-one track from Rih (I was wondering when she was going to do this...we got kinda close with Birthday Cake and Cockiness on Talk That Talk). I would give LWT the edge over MM, but they are both good and compliment each other well.<br /><br />Get It Over With is one of the more forgettable tracks on the record. Nothing really stands out about it.<br /><br />No Love Allowed is the track we get on every Rihanna album that is directly inspired by her Barbadiosan roots. It is very similar in lyrical content to Man Down off of Loud, but I like this one better. Lost in Paradise is very intense, and I love it.<br /><br />HALF OF ME is worth buying on iTunes! Emeli Sande is a wonderful songwriter and the song's production is awesome!<br /><br />Overall, this is her best album since Rated R (which I don't think she will ever top to be honest) and a worthy purchase that you WILL be hearing if they actually decide to release singles from the album for more than a year...t even know Rih had. The piano riff is wonderful and the bridge and outro make the song absolutely perfect. But STAY. THIS is where the album's opus happens.

B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Good movie, but maybe not at the normal &#34;Pixar bar&#34; that was set by movies like Bug's Life, Toy Story 1-3, and Monsters, Inc.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. Sad there were only three books. Great Book!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I only use it to go to sites that interest me.  I only have three friends in it and that is ok with me.  I do not give status or anything about my life business or personal.
B00A135YUW|4.0|Born To Die was a nearly flawless album. Saying that, it comes very hard to try and make another that can match the sound and feel of the first, yet delivers a sense of freshness and progression. With &#34;Paradise,&#34; Lana accomplishes the first task with flying colors but the second task needs more work.<br /><br />The issue with this album is that Ride, American, Cola, Blue Velvet and Bel Air are all wonderful, yet the rest of the album is very forgettable. Considering the length of the EP itself (only 8 songs on here and 9 on iTunes), you need to be very sure that more than half (in this case, only four) of the songs are KAPOW awesome. The thing with Born To Die was that I felt that a good 12 out of the 15 songs on the Deluxe edition were of that impact. The ratio just isn't there on Paradise.<br /><br />That is not to say that it wasn't a great album. I am expecting great things from her and can't wait for her next effort!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I really really wish I would of ordered two of these except 1, is there any way I can do that?<br />Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, thanks for the speedy delivery :)
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Dr.Alexander gave a very descriptive view of his experiences, transporting the reader with him.<br />A lot of technical medical terms were a little hard to understand but I realise these were very necessary.<br />Confirms my thoughts on the afterlife
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Awesome movie. plenty of action like all Bourne movies.<br />Looking for next, hopefully with Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner.<br />Watch it!!!!!!!!!!!
B009M5CJI0|5.0|Terrific read!  Had trouble putting it down! Brings history to life. Can't wait for book three to come out. Soon I hope!
B00A8Q1N9S|5.0|Ok serioulsly I just received this in the mail today, which is awesome but its no bigger than a tissue box actually the same size. I paid 35.99 on amazon for this. When I received this I got on here to order another for 35.99 and its half off of 399.99?!?!? That is crazy. Its really cool, I know you cant find in stores anywhere but really, help me out and sell me another for the same price :) Merry Christmas!! Happy I got the one I did..

B008RNGCAO|5.0|Kinda like the last Dark Knight movie. But better I think. I'm only half way through the book and it is really great. The art work is great too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like this game allot. I think that it could be a little more challenging but maybe I am just really good at it.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Well performed and incredibly touching. I found myself easily identifying with characters and truly gripped by their plight. I absolutely loved it and highly recommend it. It also serves as a powerful tool I plan to present to my church men's group as a means of reshaping and focusing men's and father's commitment to family.
1451695195|5.0|I was hospitalized this year and twice felt like I was slipping away.  The second incident was scary because I stood at a door and looked out, and it was a black void.  I just couldn't step out because I was afraid that I wouldn't be in heaven since so many near-death accounts talk about walking toward the light.  This book, however, described the author's experience, and he, too, went through a dark place before arriving in Heaven.  The writer is believable because he is a neurologist, and he maintains his belief about dying and going to Heaven even though many of his friends and other neurologists are slow to accept his experience.  I was not disappointed and plan to review it in my study group in January.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Awesome....<br />Jason did such a great job and the boys were incredible..<br />A perfect evening, like they never missed a beat..
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you have a sense of hunor, watch this movie. I laughed all the way through!  If you are offended by language, don't bother.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This is a very good album, however it does contain some explicit lyrics that should not be heard by younger children.<br />Think you will love the album if you love Maroon 5.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It has been many decades since I read it last.  I probably enjoyed it even more now. I could see all the action taking place just as if I would have been watching it in a movie, but much better in my imagination than someone else's.  I read it during a road trip on my large smartphone through Kindle and it was easier than toting a book along and I could read at night in a car without a distracting light.  As far as the content of the book:  it is Samuel Clemens, what more could be said? I highly recommend the book and Kindle.
0316228532|5.0|I've been waiting for a book to sweep me off my feet and consume me for months and I honestly didn't think this would be the one to do it. I understand there have been mixed reviews about Rowling's first offering to adults and thought it may take a while for her to get into a rhythm but I was wrong.<br /><br />From page one I was transported back to the small village and bordering town I was raised in in Cornwall, England. Rowling has perfectly encapsulated the small minded nature of small communities and intertwined it with the cataclysmic events which happen in people's, seemingly normal, everyday lives.<br /><br />Firstly I will address the two things which I found challenging/frustrating about the book<br />1) the number of characters. Be warned. There are lots of characters and you get to hear from their perspectives regularly. I stopped halfway through the book and made a character map to get my head straight. I would recommend you do this too, especially if you are having to pick the book up and put it down regularly (I had the luxury of bring able to read this in 4 days). I want to note, however, that, upon reflection on finishing the book, I would not remove one character. They all interwove seamlessly to make this the richly, rewarding novel that it is.<br /><br />2) overuse of the words perennial and perennially!  I'll overlook that though!!<br /><br />Rowling uses multiple narratives to question your thinking at every turn. The moment you begin to feel empathy or dislike for one of the characters she turns it on its head and shows you another person's point of view so effortlessly you don't realise its happening. You find yourself battling its your own morals and beliefs and reflecting on your own life and those in it. She explores perfectly so many demographics of society. She was able narrate from (to name but a few) the perspective of teenagers, a junkie mother, pompous middle class women, a single, lonely mother and, not once, did she let the ball drop. Not once did I think to myself 'Gavin wouldn't have done that' or 'Sukhvindef wouldn't do this'. When I read reviews where people said they didn't like once character I find that hard to understand. I found myself liking different characters, at different times, for different reasons-very much like real life. I did feel the most likeable characters, for me, did end up being the underdogs.<br /><br />Rowliing really challenges the way we all think are lead to think and let ourselves think about others.  From the do-gooder busy bodies in the village, who everyone loves to hate, to the people from the 'fields' she quickly brings to life a split society. Rowling guides us through the reasons for people's behaviours and place in life, which we so often chose to overlook, such as rape, incest, drug abuse, domestic violence, self harm, bullying, affairs and navigates us through the journeys of those experiencing these situations so fully and convincingly you can almost feel their pain,anguish, shame, hurt, hope, lust and disappointment.<br /><br />This book is not anything like the Harry Potter series, nor does it claim to be, but I think a lot of the more negative reviews may come from people wanting a faster pace ,like that of her previous work.  The Casual Vacancy is slow and thoughtful but that's because it's so beautifully constructed making it such a moving, well rounded novel. It is a book, however, which may be difficult to read for 20 minutes a night unless you are very good at remembering characters, links etc. so treat it as a special book. Set time aside over a holiday, long weekend and lose yourself.<br /><br />Please pick this book up. Especially if you grew up in Britain I will be surprised if this doesn't get to your very core and, like me, leave me feeling lost and sad that I have finished it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this one, another great book by Nicholas Sparks. He always knows how to captivate you and get you hooked.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|After about 15 minutes of waiting to see if there was any possibility of finding something remotely entertaining we pulled the plug. Ted is with out a doubt the worst movie ever. There was nothing even mildly entertaining in this piece which features a constant barrage of vulgarity, crude sexual innuendo and dope smoking. Sometimes even a bad film is un-intendedly<br />funny because it's so bad but this one couldn't even score in that regard..
B000FCKIFU|3.0|Book is very slow and has far to many characters. I'm on the 18th chapter and is just now getting interesting.
B009YU62H2|3.0|Expected much more from this album. Superunknown and Down on The upside are much better albums. Most tracks Sound similar to Cornell's tracks when he went solo.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game even more than angry birds! But random ads pop up when I am in the middle of a game! I wish they would fix that! Then I would love the game even more!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Unit added background music in our living room from iPod without unsightly wiring.  Works great with concealed powered speakers and Bluetooth receiver.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoyed following the stories of complex people over nearly six decades during a particularly interesting period in history. The writing is superb: each word and sentence has been carefully chosen to keep the reader's attention.
B003VANOFY|5.0|What an amazing headphone is this for PC.<br />7.1 channel surround sound was just amazing.<br />It installed on win8 in less than 5 minutes and the range was quite awesome for at least 30ft, farthest I could go in my apt.<br />One thing that I liked was its ease of use and win8 compatible and excellent sound quality.<br /><br />I am loving it...
B0014H32MG|5.0|I don't usually read novels, so when I do it's gotta be good and hold my attention.  If you like fast paced action/adventure dystopian novels this is a good bet.  This is much different than the movie, better in my opinion, and will hold your attention from start to finish.  I really enjoyed it and recommend this book to anyone!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the few free games that I found to be challenging and fun. Found it hard to put down!
B003Z8OUT6|5.0|This is a must have for blues fans. Impressive array of guest artists including Robert Cray and Johnny Winter. Some newer stuff, and some older stuff redone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I live these book I'm reading them for the 2nd time.. It's worth the price because you will want to read them again. I read all 3 of them the first time in 5 days because I had borrowed them and only had 14days so now I'm taking my time reading them this time
B008M36EEI|5.0|McGregor and Blunt and the sheikh are very well cast.  The settings are excellent.  Teared up on an Emirates flight of all places.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|This is a great movie and i love that the rental is for a month, makes it well worth the price!
B009FZZK8I|4.0|Having watched seasons 1-3 within the past 3 weeks, I certainly enjoy the series. However, Season 3 as with the previous two required that I place my brain in zombie mode in order to avoid being overly annoyed by things happening that made absolutely no sense at all! Granted, we're talking about reanimated bodies and by no means do I expect some high degree of consistency, however...<br />--When people have the opportunity to put on riot gear that would potentially save their life...but they DONT!? I get frustrated at the ridiculous level of stupidity.<br />--When they attempt to secure a cell block, place markers indicating the proper direction back, are confronted by zombies in the front, somehow get lost on the way back, and somehow have zombies show up behind them...well yeah...stupidity levels go off the charts.<br />--When Walkers, who hobble and wobble, suddenly become ninja stealth fighters that show up behind someone unnoticed...I notice! :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Needed a calculator for my Kindel Fire. Easy to use, read and carry around. Have used it many times and it seems to work.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The writer delivers a very interesting alternative to our current world. The concept of older people being useful and extending life beyond the typical amount of years we get is cleverly developed. Overall, I found this more enjoyable than many other works of science fiction.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|A witty and adventurous tale that keeps you rooting for the main characters' survival..... .... ..... ..... ... ... .
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|Easy to record and works great so far.  Our daughter really loved it. You do have to open the pages all the way for it to read the page.  Sometimes this frustrated my daughter.  But for the most part, it is a hit. :)
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I loved this book.  If you want to laugh out loud and cry out loud, this is the book for you.  It's light, no brain strain and fast reading. This book is entertaining.  I have read two book written by Sophi Kinsella and I will read all of them.
B000YJ85BI|3.0|I found the first two books intriguing, capable of captivating my imagination. The Last Colony felt as if it was a bit of a fall off from the previous two books, a little bit too much deus ex machina, considering how very well the author painted the picture of his universe in the first two books. Overall, I would say the trilogy was a fun read, and for consumers of extensive science fiction, worthy of a read.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|I purchased this as a gift for someone else but I have seen the movie before and I enjoyed it.
0375826742|5.0|We have been waiting for this book to come out so we can finish the series, which is impressive. It is good reading
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I found this on Amazon for a great price. My daughter loves talking animals so I thought it would be worth it.  She watches so much and the story is actually entertaining for adults.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|I enjoyed watching this film with my 9 yr. old.  He enjoyed it as well and thought it was pretty funny.  It has a good holiday message.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Well done story. Moves right along. Not too hard to follow or keep up with the characters. I truly enjoyed this, up to date, spy thriller.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Lacked substance...some plot holes but entertaining none-the-less. I often wondered where the story was while I was watching this. Not bad but could have been wayyyy better.
B0045XICB2|5.0|This is my favorite Twilight movie. I have seen them all and I make my husband watch them.  I already own the movie but was out of town and needed my fix so I rented it anyway.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So, first let me say, I love this game. It is actually quite fun and  I play it with my 9 yr old.  You can do everything for free as long as you have enough patience to wait.  Otherwise, the in-app gem purchases (to help speed up the process) get rather expensive.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Me ha encantado el documental aunque si tuviera subtitulos en castellano mejor. Se lo recomiendo a todo el que desee disfrutar de un viaje a través de la guitarra.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had the foresight to read reviews of this book before purchase (and of course, got the free sample) so, unlike a lot of the lower starred reviews, I had an inkling of what I was getting myself into, grammar wise.<br /><br />The English is horrid at times. The grammar, even worse.<br /><br />But. I could not stand to put the book down.  The story is interesting, captivating even. The characters draw you in although they do tend to ramble on about the same things over and over again. If it weren't for the copius amounts of adult situations (and copius is most assuredly an understatement) I would say that this book would fit rather well in any teen section at Barnes and Noble.<br /><br />I do recommend this book to others. It really is interesting and decent despite its need for further editing and a wee bit of sprucing up. I am most definately going to have to purchase the next in the series myself so I can find out just what new shall befall Ana and our dear Mr. Grey.<br /><br />-Allie
B00622BF40|5.0|I'm an unabashed romantic, I guess.  I love stories about success against adversity and the blooming of the caterpillar into a quite lovely butterfly.  Also, Strictly Ballroom gives an inside look into the culture of competitive ballroom dancing.  The effort, the politics and the sloppy business as usual of life.  I'm a guy, but I enjoy it just as much as I think a girl would.  I have owned the movie for years and I drag it out and watch it every so often and enjoy it anew each time.  I think it's special.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great film,great rock,great art.<br /> Sure wish they would have taken this show on the road,the power of this performance is astounding.
B005XI9456|5.0|It was purchased for my little grand daughter and she loves it. So I guess that's why I'm rating it high.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|this movie never gets old love the joker and man i recommend anyone thats has not seen this movie to see it now
159420411X|3.0|A large interest in my life is dicovering what is really going on in the world. i.e. Reality vs. illusion.  The signal and the noise fails through tackling a subject that is not ready to be pinned down quite yet.  Through anecdotes and tales of the authors life experiences, he give a good number of tips about the complexity of making predictions that should help the layman avoid the worst pitfalls, but when it gets to Bayes' theorum, it loses me.  It's simple in concept, but for a chump like me to make it work requires so much estimation and guesswork that it's hardly any improvement over simply guessing.  Obviously, Nate Silver makes it work since He successfully predicted the outcome of the 2012 down to the last race.<br /><br />In other words, for a layman like myself, unfamiliar with the underlying education, the sometimes obscure graphs and not self evidently clear principals cited dont really enlighten.  No doubt it's my failing, but if your reason for buying this book is being able to make reliable predictions.  Probably not.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Paid 15.. Wanted to pay 10... It was a gift so I had no choice but to pay the ridiculous prices of dvds
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It would seem that when the showrunners heard the loud and long complaints about season two being slow, they took them to heart. Half-way through season three and it has been non-stop action, story progression, and reveals. Great season so far. Greatly looking forward to its resumption in Feb.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind was excellent and I enjoyed it enough that I immediately ordered all of Zafon's other books.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|this is a great game to play any time of day or might at home or on the go-great... game.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|So far this game is pretty good, allot of improvements from kingdoms and lords. It's allot easier to level up units and harvesting no longer requires energy. A set back however is the expense of units and I feel like my base never has enough energy. But for a free game it was well worth the long download time. I'm having a great time with it and I can't wait for this companies next game.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|It's a great movie it looks great on hd best movie ever I can't wait for the batman and robin
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is one of the best book i ever read.<br />It is a book a start thinking in a otherway
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Good actors, good direction, and Tom Hardy is excellent.  I enjoy watching movies that have a true story behind it.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love Christmas songs in general, even all the old standards, but it's nice to hear fresh versions of the oldies. This CD is very mellow and jazzy, and it captures the essence of the season.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son loves this mobile. He is not easily entertained but is fascinated by this. He enjoys the music and the bright colors.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose this rating because I'd have to say this is one of the best books I've read I like every bit of it and honestly was very sad when I finished it.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was an excellent movie for he whole family.  It is not only visually appealing but has a wonderful, good-hearted lesson.
B005HSL626|4.0|Mindless fun to fill a void in the day. The kids like it and thus us it more than I do.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I thought this game was a lot of fun. Feels a lot like the original but I had a little trouble with the controls.
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is a cult favorite my cousin, Marty introduced me to twenty years ago. He had annual Harold-and-Maude parties, where we would wine, dine and watch the movie. Now we are introducing it to our twenty-something kids. They don't quite see the humor in the series of graphic &#34;suicides&#34;, but I think over time they will. I don't know that I'd recommend it for teens, especially unstable teens. For adults, however, the sly and cheeky humor is a joy! Maude is the most believable of all unbelievable senior citizens. We all want to be like her when we reach that golden goal, but know we won't be able to match her! It's also a visual dream of the seventies in super-kitsch style. Enjoy!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Gillian Flynn is a gifted writer. She can prose together in a clever way that makes you stop and think, 'wow, that was pretty good.' but this story itself was contrived to say the least. I found that I didn't care about either of the main characters. They were both selfish horrible people, so the plot died right there for me.<br /><br />Very disppointed. Sad terrible ending.
B000002VQQ|2.0|I know, I know!  Rolling Stone and Time Magazine (strange bedfellows)tell me how great this album is and how influential it WAS.  IMO, if a man had gotten up on stage and done what Smith did, he would have gotten booed off the stage.  But Patti Smith is not a man.  This album may or may not have had a big impact on other artists.  That said, I really don't care at this point.  When it comes to my listening, I really don't want to hear this crap.  When I listen to music, I don't care who was possibly influenced by the artist's music.  I care whether it is appealing to me and I care at the moment I am listening to it.  Many albums I bought 30+ years ago have not withstood the test of time, while others have. If this was in fact an historic album when it came out 37 years ago, so be it, but it has NOT withstood MY test of time IMO.  Another critically touted group, Big Star, also sounds like total crap to me.  If The Clash were influenced by Patti Smith, their talents took them far beyond where Ms Smith went.  That she is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a joke to me.  Not a \\"ha ha\\" type of funny, but a shake my head from side to side joke.<br /><br />I bought this album because it was so highly rated by critics.  Well, I've =had great experiences by listening to critics and I've also struck out.  This time I just took the pitches and dropped my jaw as the umpire called me out on strikes.  Best thing Patti Smith ever did was \\"Because the Night\\" and it was good, probably only because of Springsteen's input.  YMMV
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|No spoilers here.  I will say that Dark Knight Rises concludes the trilogy on a somewhat more... disruptive... way than I had expected.  There are a few scenes where I think the movie was trying to be 'written dark' a bit too hard in a way that breaks realism just a bit, which is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars.  Aside from that though this is an excellent film- well written, well directed, well acted.  Highly recommended!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno just keeps getting better!  I can't recommend this album enough.  I can't wait for him to tour.  Please come to Minneapolis!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another of the Harry Bosch series that captivates the reader and keeps you interested till the end! This is a must read for all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was SO pleasantly surprised with this book. I hadn't heard anything about it. A co-worker recommended it to me. It was amazing. The plot twits and turns are so totally unexpected ! The characters are so real. The internal struggles and thoughts of all the characters are staggering. As each chapter developed I found myself being unable to read quietly - I was either expressing shock out loud or laughing at myself for being so shocked at the plot twists. I have told everyone I know to read this book ! It is a really fun read.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|As the title says, it is a solid backpack and worth the price. As a commuting college student, I was looking for something that would be able to hold my laptop and textbooks securely and this bag does just that. It has quite a few pockets, including one just behind the handle for quick access. It is surprisingly deep, allowing me to store my calculator, pens, etc without problem. Shoulder straps overall are pretty comfortable however, I have noticed some discomfort as of recent. However, this has more to do with the shirts I am wearing then the bag itself. The bag claims to remain up right at 90 degrees and it you have some light items in it then it will. If I have my laptop in it, it is likely to fall over. I also have not had any problems with broken zippers or torn mesh pockets.<br /><br />On a slightly different note, I also did not have any problems with the bag while traveling. Overall, one semester in, the bag is in (just about) perfect condition, I noticed no signs of wear and tear on it, and I can say that it was a solid buy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. It was constantly playing with your mind and making you wonder who was responsible. I must say I was disappointed with the ending, but I would still highly recommend it to anyone.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Good book but very slow in parts. The ocean story line was the most interesting. I am looking forward to seeing how the movie compares.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Every character in this book is miserable. I didn't really like or relate to anyone. The storyline about the council seat and the issue dividing either side is boring. I kept hoping it would get better. Even after the pivotal scene happens, it really went nowhere. It continued on its depressing way telling the story of these miserable people leading their miserable lives. I would not recommend it and have actually discouraged someone I know from bothering to read it. Sorry JK - I  looked forward to reading it and wanted to like it but I ended up really NOT liking it at all.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|LOVE IT..... best movie of the year, full of fun and laughter,,, of course adult themes.... but good..... and Mark is wonderful
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good story and  interesting characters. Read the whole series in one go :)<br />The mood of the book is dark, and there is twist and turns to keep things intresting
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|I never will get tired of watching this old movie.  It is really fun and good for laughing a lot.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Came just as described, i the color I wanted.  I've ordered a black one for my husband's Kindle he's getting for Christmas! So far, seems sturdy and looks good too.<br />I would recommend this to friends!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|My husband and I liked this movie a lot.  Who doesn't like Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt?<br />They have chemistry!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing! I loved the twist and the ending. This is for sure my new favorite book. I could not put it down!
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Jethro Tull is a extremely unique band in several aspects! Everyone who likes rock knows that.<br />But the quality of this album is impressive! To think that they record it in a tour throughout Europe, several different shows in a analog 8-tracks device! Ian and his troop are always amazing!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. I have to make sure all my daily business is done because once I start playing it I can't stop.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|this movie wasn't widely publicized, or even seen (until I got my 1st DVD); it will be viewed as one of the best cult movies in history, and I am so glad it is now nominated for a Golden Globe. I loved it so much I bought a 2nd copy as a gift! characters/actors can't be beat, and the story line is as incredible as the settings are!
0684824906|1.0|This book, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln was to be a Christmas present. It arrived with the jacket torn in one spot and upon opening the book, the entire left side of the jacket had a crease in it.  It is permanent.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Bought this DVD for my daughter because she is a huge Chris Pine fan, so I sat and watched it with her.  I thought it was a good movie with some pretty exciting action.  Highly recommend!!!
B000006YXV|3.0|Some I know and love others I don't like so much but Marvin Gaye was a great all around singer.
B00005JLR2|4.0|I am not a Treasure Island fan, but I loved this movie.  Jim and the Cyborg have an awesome rapport -- which is saying something for an animation, and Morph is great comic relief.  The soundtrack is great, and the animation is beautiful.<br /><br />It loses a star for the robot on Treasure Planet.  That was an utter mistake by the scriptwriters.  If you can ignore his existence, this goes back up to being a 5.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Once I started reading it -- I found it hard to put down. The writer shared the credit and made sure the reader understood it was a team effort.
B000SZK41M|5.0|It's a classic for a reason. Hans Gruber 4eva. We are all in debt to Alan Rickman for this one.
B001AG52AG|1.0|I am sorry I spent all three dollars on this movie. I never read the book, nor would I. This movie was so boring and, really?, people's souls are called daemon's? Wow! Alright then, I guess whatever floats your boat. I wouldn't watch this movie again if it was free!
B009P5S11G|5.0|I love this CD.  I purchased it without having heard it before simply because I heard it was amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This CD met and exceeded my expectations.
B004JHYRAE|4.0|This is a well written book that leads to liberation of ones sexual self!  I am monogamous and believe that is right for me, this book is for everyone who embraces freedom to love who you will!!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|AHS is the best, newest entry into the horror-television genre with a scope and vision exceeding that which is possible in cinema.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I don't typically enjoy &#34;children's movies&#34; but I LOVED this one.  The characters are well developed and humor enveloped in the dialogue that only adults might pick up on.  Beyond that, it's a warm, feel good story too!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I started to sour on batman in the last movie, but this one has brought me back to the Dark Night. Anne Hathaway is great and they have now set up a &#34;Robin&#34; for the next one. There isn't tooooo much action. It hits the right balance between story and action with the appropriate twists. Can't wait to see the next one!
B008BM9L72|1.0|I haven't got a single good word to say about this, and other reviewers have already done a great job pulling it to pieces. Please read those reviews and don't even think of buying it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|There are several &#34;problem/solution&#34; stories entwined in one. I love watching the movie with my class year after year! It's timeless!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|It just got stupid. And the new town thing is ridiculous.  Go back to zombie hunting and and stay consistent with the disease thing.  By all accounts from season 1 the old Farmer man would have been dead instantly after having his leg gnawed on
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A solid telling of the events that lead up to WW II and the war itself.  I personally learned much about the events that transpired.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its a very fun village game! anyone that loves my little pony should by this app. I'm not a big fan... I just wanted to know what this app was like, and I ended up liking it
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's just a small portion of the FB that i see in my kindle's fb.  unlike in the laptop of desktop.  also pics in my kindle fb occupies 1/3 of the screen.  I wonder how i could adjust the size.  Still learning.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very imaginative and original.  It's great how he tells a short story from the perspective of different characters, and relates them to each other.<br />I didn't want this book to end!
B0098VXE50|5.0|This movie was just what I was looking for. I loved it. I thought K. Stewart was perfect for ther part of Snow White and I loved the ending. Charlize Theron was awesome!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Busy small little bugs but pretty good other than that. It keeps you being able to play not just wait for ever.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My kids love to play this game.  It is easy to play and challenging for them.  My son loves that he can play in space and gets excited when he can complete a level.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I've been reading the series for three months and this story was a great edition.  You never know what's next and the characters are all well developed and keep you on your toes!
B0017313I2|4.0|Was very good movie. The ending was a huge but better surprise. A lot of suspense and action. Love the two of these acting together.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great show, keeps you wanting more! I like the use of the same actors from season one in new roles.
0316743003|4.0|This is a good reading book.  It's very detailed about the design and launch process of our early stealth jets.  If this material is of interest to you, this is a must read!
0345529057|5.0|Loved it.  I thought the twists and turns of this series have been brilliant and I thoroughly recommend the books to anyone who likes a good read.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Read the trilogy. As everyone knows, when you read the book first the movie is ussually a dissappointment. Not so in this case. The movie managed to capture the essense of the book--the &#34;feel&#34; so to speak. Jen Lawrence was perfect as Katniss--totally nailed it. Woody Harrelson absolutely great as the mangy, cynical, secretly wise Haymitch. I wasn't too crazy about the kid who played Peeta--very bland and he's supposed to be better looking. They also changed around a few things that I thought would be fine left the same way as the book. But they put more emphasis on the head game keeper, and showing how the games are manipulated, than the book did and that was cool! All and all, really liked it.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever.  Our family has watched this movie many times and never get tired of the acting abilities,<br />We just purchased it on Blu Ray and we can't wait to see it in an even better sharpness.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is going to be a Christmas present , as soon as I surprise my little six years old girl, I will let you know.<br /><br />well when ny litle girl told me exactly this: \\" I did not like it\\"  wow I was surpised, because it was the most expesive present that i bought for her, but as soon as I did not respond, because i was not finding any word, i really got surprised, she said.  \\" I LOVE IT\\" wow i got relax...
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I've been buying up the seasons for my neice for birthday and Christmans gifts.  She is always is happy to get them.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I honestly don't see why &#34;all the stars&#34; isn't an answer option to the email I got asking me how many stars I would give 'Elf'. I would give 'Elf' all the stars.
B000YHG72E|5.0|my favorite. i love it i love it  get it for christmas or anytime its a movie must for the family
1476704163|5.0|If you're a Ke$ha fan, then you should like this. As soon as I found out about it, I purchased it. Ke$ha details her bio and lets her fans in on her process of making her special brand of entertainment and music.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|Works well to print pictures from my fire but I wish it would allow me to print email and web pages.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Engaging read. Recommended. You won't be able to put it down. That's for certain. Better than the movie. Start with this.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Best chair I've ever had!!!  It's so comfortable and looks great!!  I loved it so much I bought another one.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|There is always at least two sides to every story. I think this gives a good idea how Indians were treated and how they felt about it. It also shows that Government corruption flourished then just as it does now.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever, & well worth having in Blu-ray. O'Toole was robbed - he should have gotten Best Actor, but the Academy handed it to Gregory Peck for a politically correct (albeit not bad) performance. Regardless, no DVD collection is complete without this truly magnificent film.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Great Toy - simple safe NO BATTERIES but wonderful for a kid that likes rocketships.  All the kids in my daycare like it and it is small enough to carry around.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is the best series EVER made for TV!  Better than ROOTS from the 70's and more.  I sent this set as a thank you gift to someone who has not followed the series and the much anticipated 3rd series coming out January 6, 2013.  I can't wait.<br />This is the third set I've purchased with Amazon and sent off as a gift.  Beautifully packaged, GET IT!
B007AFB868|5.0|Wonderfully directed and accurate portrayal of Frida's life! I recommend it as a cultural supplement to all upper class men Spanish teachers.
1601252463|5.0|I am a fan of the way Paizo writes their books, and this one delivered. It has 6 new classes and I would rate them based on originality.<br />Alchemist-5/5 I love this Int based spellcaster who throws surprisingly powerful bombs, just fun<br />Cavalier-3/5 seems like an improved archetype for a fighter, mounts can restrict DM or force player to frequently abandon his mount,<br />Inquisitor-4/5 feels like Sorcerer+cleric+archer. I am giving 5 because of the good char design and the fact this char is based on Wis.<br />Oracle- 3/5 Sorcerer+cleric. The only reason I give a 3 is because of the curses.<br />Summoner-2/5... It's just an archetype for sorcerer. I love the class and I would play it,but it is just a sorceror+animal companion<br />Witch-2/5 above for wizard+hexes.<br /><br />Base archetypes-5/5<br /><br />Feats-4/5 some feats were... Just bad<br /><br />Prestige-Can not rate my DM's don't force me to take any prestige so I can't tell<br /><br />Equipment-5/5 some armour and weapons disappointed but rest made it up<br /><br />New rules 5/5 traits=nice new maneuvers going to breathe more life into non-caster classes<br /><br />Races- 5/5 great detail about races and relevant alt.race traits<br /><br />Overall-5/5 even though some new classes lack in originality I still loved the concept of them and they will certainly freshen up the game, the best thing overall is how it contributes to the understanding of the world
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game!!!<br />It plays really well and its a lot of fun when your bored.<br />I recommend it.<br />Great!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The best series ever done!  Love, love, love it.  Glued to the TV every Sunday night after 60 minutes.  Can't wait for season three to start in January 2013.<br />I sent it to my sister so she can get caught up on what she missed and we can talk about it together.  My little 11 year old neice is enjoying it too, surprise!  I say, GET IT!!!!  The entire set too!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is a wonderful second step in the series. For those who have seen the HBO series and think they don't need to read the book, you're wrong. This book has so much more detail than the series and provides a much better look into Westoros and the characters.
B005IQZB14|2.0|The author delves deeply into the depths of her grief but glosses over the heroin addiction that most likely caused her decline.  I found this book a very skewed portrayal of recovery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son love's it ,he play it and was very entertain with all the construction he made and his sister like it too
B001QFZADA|5.0|Good book here, teaches one about him/her self and is effective no matter what stage of life your in. You can't help but become a more enlighted person after reading it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This was another thrilling and exciting continuation in the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; story. I can't wait until George R. R. Martin finishes book 6.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Recommended for any 20th century World History buff. Events are depicted with historical accuracy and the characters are interesting and portend the future believeably.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is true Nelson Demille story and John Corey is great in it. I loved it and it was wonderful.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this is crap all they do is geuss your age and it ends up have the wrong age trust me don't get this app
B0086700CM|4.0|It lags a little bit on my first gen Kindle Fire, but it is still a very fun game nonetheless. I'm sure its great on the newer Fires, and it is a excellent on a bigger screen than my phone.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is an interesting tale about an Attorney that has been screwed by the Criminal Justice system and exacts payback with an eleaborate and complicated scheme. Not quite as taut as other books by Grisham.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The book was wonderful and I would like to read the first one in the triolgy.  I would recomend it to any one who loves a good book.
0425252868|5.0|I was first made aware of A Higher Call through Valor Studios (a Makos Family endeavor) depicting the incident involving Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler in a beautiful World War II portrait created by artist John D. Shaw.  The story behind the portrait captivated me, and I wanted to know more about it.  My thoughts at the time were, \\"Someone should write a book about this!\\"  Well, thanks to Adam Makos and Larry Alexander, we now know the whole story.  And a fascinating story it is!<br /><br />Like many Americans, I was brought up to believe that all German soldiers were Nazis, and that all German soldiers had a roll in the concentration camps.  As I grew older, and read more about World War II, I realized that this was simply not the case, especially in regards to the typical German soldier (except in certain cases, i.e. the SS, etc.).  Mr. Makos makes this point very clearly in the Intro to the book, a point which I think makes a great Intro into the book.  I believe this will resonate with many readers.<br /><br />I finished the book as quickly as I could (as time would allow).  I simply had a hard time putting it down!  The book is engagingly written, and transitions well from chapter to chapter.  I especially enjoyed the background material regarding the Luftwaffe and the famous, but short-lived JV-44.  Mr. Makos covered every anticipated question I had regarding the incident behind A Higher Call, and I cannot praise the book enough!<br /><br />The reader will be richly rewarded for reading the book to the end!  Hollywood could not create a script with more drama and pathos as this true story contains.  It simply has to be read to be believed!<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|I thought this was going to be a great Mario-Kartesque game for my Kindle Fire. The controls were hard to get a hold of and the game wasn't that captivating. Also, it was a bit choppy. I guess I'm still waiting for a comparable racing game to MK64.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Real page turner for people into this genre. Another insight into the LA police dept.'s troubled past. Harry Bosch is LA cop tough, but also is shrewed, analytical and flawed.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Flower and Journey in particular are some of the best games you will ever play. Flower and Journey are typified by a gaming-lite notion of cerebral euphoria. I have rarely experienced being in such a great light and place as when FIRST playing through these games. Add in some greenery and it is pure magic. Sure, they are short, almost too short. Journey is over before you know it and could have EASILY added in another 3 hours of gameplay. Flower is about right but could have also been a little longer. You can read other reviews to get the gist of the gameplay but you don't need to imo at all and should just dive straight in on a dark night with some headphones, tea, and greens. Flow is a decent little game that is fun to play with your GF or someone in particular that doesn't really play many games. All in all a great trio to add to your collection.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is such a long involved series, if you've gotten this far, you will like the book.  Only downside was the names of the chapters,  they weren't the name of the characters, more a description of them at that point.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love the style George R. R. Martin used with this book, splitting book 4 and 5 geographically instead of chronologically. It allows the reader to really get in tune with the characters and see them in a whole new level. Once again, I couldn't put the book down and was anxious to jump right into Book 5 at the end.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is really a masterpiece. History at its best but at the same time touching stories of five imaginary families. Time for part two!!
B009IJJB8G|4.0|This may be the best show no one is watching. But you should be. It's fantastic.! Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal as Sherlock Holmes is brilliant. He's quirky and humorous. Best of all, the producers did not make him alter his British accent. It makes his role more credible, IMO.<br />Lucy Liu is good, but I hope they develop her character more.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Captivating. I was unable to stop reading until I completed the novel. I regretted  having reached the end. Looking forward to reading more from Robert Harris.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is great to have on a larger screen. It is so much easier to make detailed and clear drawings on the 7&#34; screen of the Kindle Fire than on a phone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the fact you can click your move and you don't have to do a lot of  blasted dragging
B00030DEQE|3.0|I run windows 7.  Took me about 3 hours of fiddling around with drivers, to finally get it to recognize.  Since then 100% up time so  cant complain too much.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|This is a classic Western with roles that were unexpected.  The story is engaging.  In the days the studios hired the strs and made movie after movie using the same people, it is great to see the ability of the actors to play their role in this movie.  John Wayne is tough but places his life on hold for his community.  Jimmy Stewart risks his life for something he believes in beyond himself.  The supporting cast emphasises these values.  It is a quick move and does for the most part describe the life of the times in those little Texas towns along the Picketwire.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Talk about a book you can't put down. Just when I thought I knew where things were going, book 3 completely blew me away. If you weren't hooked on Game of Thrones yet, this book ought to do it.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|There was something aesthetic about the movie.  Something that was interesting and kept you watching.  Salma Hayek was great, enjoyed her scenes thoroughly.  Blake Lively....shot a fashion shoot/ soft porno.  They could have done better with another to cast as O.  Travolta was great, brought a nice humor that wasn't too obvious, just right for this film.  What do I know, I'm no film critic.  I didn't mind watching, but I'd never watch it again, or recommend this film to anyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We can hardly wait for the newest episode to arrive on Amazon. A show that my husband and I enjoy watching together once the kiddies are snug in their beds.
B002R22PB6|5.0|The acting was superb.  I felt the pain with each and every character.  The love of his family surrounded the victim yet, as the audience, I could understand his side as well.  Everyone who is outspoken or even undecided about Euthanasia shoud watch this move.  It will create a more humanistic understanding than mere words ever can.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I love it, recommended to everybody,, very easy to understand. It answers many questions about NDE the way i never imagine, very good.
B001706I5I|5.0|This is such a great movie! The Grinch is full of laughs! Its a great family movie to watch around the holidays!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|There's never been another writer like Diana Wynne Jones, and out of all the compelling and complicated characters she created in her long life, there's never been any quite like Sophie and Howl. This is my favorite out of all her books. Sophie's freedom that she finds within her curse, Howl's seeming heartlessness, Calcifer's exploited condition, the way the plot builds straw-upon-straw until you're holding your breath for fear the whole thing will crash down, right before DWJ brings it to triumphant conclusion ... it's a masterpiece. Every time I read it I wish anew that Sophie was a real person I could invite over for tea!
0670023329|5.0|This book will keep you captivated. I read it to my husband and we both were in shock at what is happening in North Korea and is still happening today. This book will make you very happy for what happened to one young man and your heart breakes into for the ones that are still there.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Yea, it was very good and the characters were and all that stuff. I would highly recommend it for any who like sci fi
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I loved this movie because it gives you an inside look to what Queen Elisabeth might be like. It really make you look at her like a regular person.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|I was a big fan of the Mario type games and felt I would enjoy this game.  Unfortunately I found the game play fustrating and deleted the game after getting stuck on the first level.  Just wasn't fun.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good book. Not as good as the grey books but still really good cant wait for the third book to come out!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I just love this tv show it takes you to a whole new world with magic and good vs evil.
B00632HWOG|1.0|The new version was automatically installed. I thought good maybe this will be a nice enhancement. Boy was I wrong. It is not intuitive at all. Uninstalled and reinstalled the old version.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Did not keep my interest. I found it  needed more substance, it was  to much repitition  and moved very slow.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After seeing the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; and having read other books on him, I believe this is the most in depth and interesting of them all.  It is very long but worth it.  Everyone who values democracy and our history should read this.
1594203334|5.0|I am not sure whether I like the book more or whether I just love the French philosophy for raising kids, but either way, I learned a lot from this book!  Great gift for a mother-to-be or any mother!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A very unique book - although it is believed that it has been inspired by another book. Very well written. A page turner that kept me engaged.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas, great recipes it's fun to see the different and exciting ideas, recipes, decorating posted from everyone. You see many people with your kind of taste! Love it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. Tons of versions for comparison. Many of the versions are free to download. Also has reading plans and social media integration. A great free app.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|After several disappointing tries, I enjoyed this latest effort.  Thankfully, Cornwell returned to a little more concentration on Scarpetta with others playing a supporting role.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|perfectly cast actors ,displaying all that makes us human, with tragedy,pathos,meaness, against an &#34;of our times&#34; background, yet it made me laugh and smile more than any other movie I have seen in a long time.<br />This is the movie that captures us.<br />I have bought it for friends and family,just so they don't inadvertantly miss something this great, and I have never done that with a movie before.
B000068CNX|4.0|Purchased item as a Christmas gift. Dvd's are a replacement, so I am sure my friend will be pleased. Item arrived well in time for the holidays.
B0085YNML2|4.0|it's fun and challenging, but it has a lot of competition. I played through several levels, but it couldn't keep my interest. It's too much like other games I play. I have already deleted it.  It's fun, challenging, and the creature is cute.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly has never disappointed me in a Bosch book!  Despite Harry's gruffness, you can't help but love him.  It is truly amazing the way Connelly brings other main characters in and out without losing the core of Bosch.  I always look forward to each new one!
B005HSL626|4.0|Good way to have some fun and relax, addictive.  Fun to see the slicing options and hear the sounds when you slice different fruits.
0066620996|4.0|The author presents an interesting take on management style, highlighting the importance of things like knowing your economic drivers and the place for humility in the business world. However, I think with the pace at which business changes, by the time that any idea is able to be published, you're probably already six months behind the curve.
B000FC10MU|1.0|What happens after page fifty six?  Does any care?  Should I care?  Should I burn the book?  Should I make an appointment with the groomer?  I ought to be doing laundry.  I can think of a thousand ways to cook chicken.  These are some of the thoughts I had on page three and I discovered that I have a wonderful imagination.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I have been enjoying the the game and the storyline.  Get a kick out of the aspects from the potter series.  My EVO does let me zoom in on all but the spot the difference puzzles.
B006VRDZ44|2.0|Chose this movie because Steve Buscemi is in it.  His acting really fell flat.  Not as good as I expected.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|the characters were a bit unbelievable.<br />to good/ to bad/ to beautiful/ to perfect.<br />For a business man, Christian, did not spend much time actually doing business.........
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book is excellent.  It is brilliant.  It is well researched.  It made me laugh.  It made me cry.  I was frightened.  I was outraged.  I understood all the characters.  If there is one book you MUST read this is the one.
B007EDYN36|4.0|Peter Criss writes a very honest and telling story in this book. The childhood stories are a little too much, but once he starts talking about his rock days I really enjoyed it.<br />I read allot of books by rock stars, and this is one of the better entries<br />.
B00632HWOG|1.0|this app upgrade has made it completely useless. doesn't even launch your messages in your inbox just stays frozen on the same page
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It helped me a lot on my spelling mistakes. I loved how the definitions were so simple and understandable. It was just great......jk
B004J4WKDI|5.0|From the introduction all the way through to last page I was intrigued.  the author is magnificent in creating pictures with words.  So great that I can hardly wait for her next book.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Great price and fast delivery.  My brother loves this series and I was to be able to find it and get it under the Christmas tree so fast!!!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Poorly written scripts, scene, and editing, confusing storyline, was expecting a lot more of excitement and action. Multiple disruptions during the streaming didn't help either.
B000T433CO|4.0|If your interest is in romantic stories or movies this is a great one to view. Plus it has some beautiful scenes of an English Cottage and England.The theme of the movie is the exchange of houses which results in meeting new loves.
B000FCKC4C|1.0|I think it's me.  I mean a lot of my friends have this book and they just adore it.  I thought it was senseless, idiotic and most of all, boring.  I think it is not only a waste of time to read it but a waste of ink.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|What a consistently great series. Just beginning to feel that the strident colombian accent thing needs to knocked back 20%... It's just become default for every episode....BUT but... I still think this is the funniest thing on tv.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie. I've seen all of them and this one is just as good. Worth watching for sure! ok ok
068484267X|5.0|Frankie McCourt is the oldest of six children, three of whom survive.  This reader wonders how three children could possibly survive such a childhood.<br /><br />Frankie's conception in America, the result of a \\"knee-trembler\\" between Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan, puts Angela in an \\"interesting condition,\\" which incites her fat Irish-American cousins to force a marriage.  However, Angela is from southern Ireland and her family forever discounts Malachy as \\"having the strange manner of those Protestant northern Irish people.\\"<br /><br />Malachy's affliction with \\"the Irish problem,\\" means the family never has enough -- money, food, or attention, because it all goes for \\"the pints.\\" Angela is devastated by the death of the baby  daughter, Margaret, probably because of starvation. Young Frankie and his little brother Michael never quite know from day to day if they will have anything to eat or not.  A good meal to them is usually a slice of fried bread, with tea sipped from a fruit jar.  Angela's cousins notify her mother in Ireland of the situation, and somehow the Widow Sheehan scrapes up money to bring the family home.  However, Angela's Irish relatives have troubles of their own and aren't able to provide much assistance.  Their life in Limerick is even worse than it was in America.<br /><br />Frankie McCourt tells his story in straightforward manner without offering judgment or opinion.  That's just the way it was, he says, in his Irish brogue, offering only a few songs in his true clear baritone to lighten the stories with songs of his childhood in Ireland.<br /><br />Angela descends by degree to the deepest depths of humiliation, from the dole to begging. The family moves from house to wretched house, usually carrying everything they own in their arms.  \\"Respectable people live on a street,\\"  Frankie's schoolteacher tells him.  \\"You live in a Lane.\\"  Living quarters are less than adequate and McCourt spares us no details: particularly the stench of the one toilet shared by an entire lane, that latrine just outside the McCourt's front door. The family's flooded first floor makes the second floor an oasis, which they dub \\"Italy.\\"<br /><br />They must find a few lumps of coal every day to heat their room and warm their food. They must contend with Malachy's endless pints and Angela's addiction to smoking woodbines and her understandable depression.  The family must find food --- onions, bread, water, an egg if they're lucky.  Frankie recalls with relish the good day when, after the death of yet another baby, neighbors brought the family a pot of mashed potatoes with butter. The children had enough to eat that night.<br /><br />Those rare times when he had work, Malachy McCourt would come home late from the Pub on payday, line up the boys and extract promises that they would die for Ireland. He drank up the dole, his wages, and even money meant for the new baby --- putting himself \\"beyond the beyonds,\\" as Angela says. Yet he escapes vilification in the book because on his good days, in spite of his alcoholism Malachy loves his children.  He inspires the boys by telling them over and over the story of the great Irish warrior Ka-hoo-lan (Cuchulain).<br /><br />There is the emotional pain inflicted by the insults of the charity officers, and the physical pain of street fights, Frankie's infected eyes, the fleas in the mattress, the danger from marauding rats, and a shortage of medical care. Wearing shoes repaired with tire treads, stealing a bag of bananas for his twin baby brothers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner, and searching the pubs for his father, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the unforgiveable cruelty of relatives and neighbors.<br /><br />After urging by Angela, Malachy finally takes a job with the hated English during the war.  \\"After the way the English have treated us Irish for seven hundred years!\\" Malachy storms, \\"You want me to go to their side?\\"<br /><br /> The boys are sad to see their father go, but are sustained by the hope of finally having enough money to pay for their basic needs.  Instead, Angela and the children are worse off than before when Malachy spends his paychecks in English pubs instead of sending the cash telegram to his family in Limerick.<br /><br />Frankie McCourt leavens his story with humor and fascinating details, like the story of his first love, Patricia, whom he meets while they are both hospitalized; Frankie with Typhoid; Patricia with Diphtheria.  Patricia shares her books with Frankie, but boys and girls are not allowed to talk to each other in the Catholic hospital so the Nuns move Frankie to the top floor where he is the only patient in a room of empty beds, unused since the plague.  After a few days, the janitor brings Frankie the news that Patricia has died.  Frankie recovers and eventually works his way up to \\"messenger boy\\" delivering telegrams.  He delivers a telegram to a young girl with \\"the galloping consumption.\\"  His friends tell him that sickness causes a young person to want to experience everything immediately, so the gal is not responsible for indiscretions.  She introduces him to \\"the excitement\\" and Frankie visits Teresa's house regularly.  One day Frankie sees a black wreath on the door, learns that Teresa is deceased and Frankie is certain he has caused Teresa to go straight to Hell.  Frank struggles with that burden, which causes a conflict for him in his religion.<br /><br />This book is filled with references to the Catholic Church, from the difficulties of confession for a young boy, to the conflicts between the Protestants and Catholics in Ireland, to the \\"collections\\" for boys who make their first confession, to the concern that the Church does not really help the members with their problems and apparently does not \\"love\\" the poor.  Yet Frankie never criticizes the leaders for shutting doors in his face.<br /><br />At confession, Frankie admits to stealing food because his father drank the food money away. His confessor responds, \\"My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet.\\"<br /><br />It is this attitude that offers the dominant flavor in this Irish stew.r father go, but are sustained by the hope of finally having enough money to pay for their basic needs.  Instead, Angela and the children are worse off than before when Malachy spends his paychecks in English pubs instead of sending the cash telegram to his family in Limerick.<br /><br />Frankie McCourt leavens his story with humor and fascinating details, like the story of his first love, Patricia, whom he meets while they are both hospitalized; Frankie with Typhoid; Patricia with Diphtheria.

After a few days, the janitor brings Frankie the news that Patricia has died.  Frankie recovers and eventually works his way up to \\"messenger boy\\" delivering telegrams.  He delivers a telegram to a young girl with \\"the galloping consumption.\\"  His friends tell him that sickness causes a young person to want to experience everything immediately, so the gal is not responsible for indiscretions.  She introduces him to \\"the excitement\\" and Frankie visits Teresa's house regularly.  One day Frankie sees a black wreath on the door, learns that Teresa is deceased and Frankie is certain he has caused Teresa to go straight to Hell.  Frank struggles with that burden, which causes a conflict for him in his religion.<br /><br />This book is filled with references to the Catholic Church, from the difficulties of confession for a young boy, to the conflicts between the Protestants and Catholics in Ireland, to the \\"collections\\" for boys who make their first confession, to the concern that the Church does not really help the members with their problems and apparently does not \\"love\\" the poor.  Yet Frankie never criticizes the leaders for shutting doors in his face.<br /><br />At confession, Frankie admits to stealing food because his father drank the food money away. His confessor responds, \\"My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet.\\"<br /><br />It is this attitude that offers the dominant flavor in this Irish stew.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is a good thing to read the words of the author.  It is a great feeling to see what the author wrote and the difference in what Hollywood put on screen.  I enjoyed this book.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I've been reading this series with my 5th graders.  We both anxiously await the new book.  In fact, I've had to hide the book so he doesn't read ahead--what could be better?  Some mythology, a lot of adventure, engaging characters.  Too bad we'll soon be done and waiting once again.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I found this book to be quite affirming.  It was great to hear that others deal with similar issues and that I am not &#34;weird&#34; (at least not for the reasons I thought).<br /><br />The book is certainly slanted toward introverts.  At times it is cheerleading a bit, but I think this is simply done as a way of trying to correct the overwhelming slant much of our culture has toward extroversion.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
0446364495|5.0|\\"Francesca supposed that for Robert Kincaid, this was everyday talk. For her, it was the stuff of literature. People in Madison County did not talk this way, about these things. The talk was about weather and farm prices and new babies and funerals and government programs and athletic teams. Not about art and dreams. Not about realities that kept the music silent, the dreams in a box.\\"<br /><br />This 170 page book is packed with sexual energy and tension. Every person who has loved and lost can identify with this romantic tale. When world class photographer Kincaid on assignment to shoot covered bridges stops to ask directions from an Iowa farmer's wife, they immediately connect on a higher plane.<br /><br />\\"His eyes looked directly at her, and she felt something jump inside. The eyes, the voice the face, the silver hair, the easy way he moved his body, old ways, disturbing ways, ways that draw you in. Ways that whisper to you in the fiinal moment before sleep comes, when the barriers have fallen. Ways that rearrange the molecular space between male and female, regardless of species.\\"<br /><br />They are both living quiet but full lives, yet recognize something is missing.<br />She is a former school teacher, a good wife and mother, she never steps out of line. Her husband and children have gone to the fair, and she stayed home to handle chores. She invites him in for tea and they have an unforgettable encounter.<br /><br />\\"Afterward he took her to a fancy restaurant for lunch and held her hands across the table, looking at her in his intense way. And the waiter smiled, just watching them, hoping he would feel that way sometime.\\"<br /><br />This quiet but powerful story of four days in the otherwise mundane lives of these two middle-aged people, leaves you looking at all your neighbors with a curious eye about what secrets they may be hiding. Like ships that pass in the night, Robert and Francesca never meet again, yet their lives are forever changed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp at his best. I hope and pray we have someone in America like him doing this for real!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show. Love the episodes that keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat, just waiting to see who survives.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I highly suggest this app for anyone that enjoys flash games. It is simple yet extremely addictive and fun. It is also very cute.
B001P06GX4|3.0|Obviously this is a great game for MANY people, but my family wasn't impressed.<br />We gave this a try and just didn't really enjoy it (with any number of players).  It isn't even in the &#34;liked it for a while, then got tired of it&#34; category.<br />So it's possible if you have game-tastes similar to ours (Settlers, Carcassonne, Dominion, etc) it might not be the right game for you either.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- Easy to learn<br />- Can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players (if you shrink the board appropriately for less players)<br /><br />Negatives<br />- The playing pieces could be higher quality<br /><br />So - I'm not saying it's a bad game - it just isn't fun for everyone!  No game is.<br />Trying to add a review that would have been useful to me before I bought it, so I would have chosen something else.  :-)
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Some of Neil Young's best music -- if you're a fan, this is worth buying.  Cinnamon Girl is one of my all time favs!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|And oh my, did Josh Brolin nail it! Loved the insights it gave us into their histories. No spoilers, it was just very cool. Of course, this is the third one - so we expect certain things and there is no way it will be as fresh as the first one. But I was delighted with the movie and recommend it.
B009AP2G26|4.0|uneven at times, but I can't not watch it; this service works very well, using it for either my Kindle Fire or laptop.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This 3 book series is different and while it was written with young adults in mind any age bracket can & should read it.  You find yourself really rooting for the characters.  You bond with them and when it’s all said and done, you still want more.  This is a series that really shouldn’t be missed.
B008OTTRXU|4.0|Most of the songs sound the same after a while.  Would recommend the cd if you are a huge fan.
B001F4UHFI|5.0|Henry Ford did it.... Was this man any more of a criminal than him?  I say no.  Supplying vehicles to transport men to battle....is that any less of a crime than selling the weapons the men carry in these transports?..Think about it before you label this man as a villain and Henry Ford a &#34;hero&#34; of industry.  This is a good movie to illustrate the real criminals in war.  The men that supply the &#34;ability&#34; to fight.  It is almost a shame that they didn't make the correlation between Henry Ford and this man.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I'm not quite sure I understand this game yet and I don't see a help button to help me understand it, so it's a learning process.

B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This movie is pure junk! If I had not seen the Original I would have no idea what it was about.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I have to admit, I only decided to watch this movie when I was extremely bored one night. Wow, was I surprised. This movie rocks. If you like vampire movies that are NOT like the twilight saga and more like the blood and fun of a typical vampire movie then this is a must see.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I tried playing this, it was hard to use with my stylus, and I think this is one of the applications that when you downloaded it, it also downloaded all its &#34;music sounds&#34; into my &#34;music&#34; on my device which Amazon and Kindle could not figure how to get off.  They weren't in my Cloud, just my device.  This and two other apps did that, and they downloaded 330 separate &#34;sound bytes&#34; that I had to manually remove.  Not going to happen again!
B006LSZECO|2.0|By the end of this book I despised the two main characters and regretted that I had spent so much time with them.
B002M89UMW|5.0|They don't make them like this now days. Most of the new movies are junk, all CG and no story!
B000HL09SA|5.0|A film for everyone with true feelings... The relation dog-human is more than relation. I thing that compose the secret ways that sentiments are expressed...
B0096CDG0O|4.0|The only problem with this game is people leave it all the time and it can take a while before it's your turn again, and so it can be time consuming, but otherwise, it can be fun.
B00ACFL69C|1.0|I thought this movie was senseless and stupid.  I hated the ending and wished I hadn't watched it and wouldn't have if I would have known how it was going to end.  This movie really lowered my esteem of Matthew Mc. I had marginal feelings about his acting abilities, but after this movie, I really am beginning to doubt his ability to pick movies in which TO act. This movie had senseless nudity, senseless cursing, senseless vulgarity, you name it. To me, the movie was made for the mentality of those who were portrayed in the movie!  After watching Matthew in this movie and then in Magic Mike, people are going to suspect that he is actually of the mentality that he is portraying in this flick.  Matthew needs to step it up in the parts he is choosing, in other words, clean up his act, especially now that he has small children of his own.  Does he really want his children to grow up someday and watch him act in such vulgar, senseless movies?  I would not recommend this movie to my dog.  I have too much respect for my animals!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Can't compare to the first Three. All action and no story. Would not watch this movie again if it was free!
B0096PYUE2|1.0|SWF FLASH PLAYER LITE<br /><br />I downloaded it on a 2nd generation kindle fire.  I still was not able to see flash supported programs.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This can be fun, took me a while to figure out how to get out of the game, but finally figure it out.  I like Uno, so I guess I would have to say I would recommend this.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|The game itself is Angry Birds and everyone agrees it's fun but the free version is too intrusive with the full page adds just buy the real thing it cheap.
B008HRZ4TK|5.0|This is a very great product, the only thing I would change is hide the Icon, so other people not ask what it is.
B0060D123K|5.0|For being a Muppet remake, this version of a Christmas Carol holds close to the original story while injecting a good amount of Muppet humor. A must watch for fans of the Muppets.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is a thought provoking game.  What seems simple at first becomes more difficult with each level.  The 8x8 and 9x9 levels are truly fun while frustrating but the answers are simple once you do it.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Be careful using this product with certain HP printer and  router combinations -- the app may lead to the crashing of either or both. Researching your combination ahead of time before using this app is advisable.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Will not download! It keeps tellin me to check my library and it is not there. I have tried everything and it will not download.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I'm a sucker for love stories, this one was good and kept me turning the pages wanting more. Cute love story!
B002APU580|5.0|There was nothing that I did not like about this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The movie has now became my favorite movie. Thanks.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This is what I was hoping for at a minimum out of a non-Damon Bourne flick.  It was enjoyable with good action sequences.  The storyline wasn't quite as well put together as prior Bourne movies, but the acting from Renner helped (mind you, it wasn't something to write home about).  Altogether, my girlfriend and I both enjoyed it.  But, it's a 3 star, not a 5 star Bourne.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Good movie, action and fiction. Good service, Good movie, action and fiction. Good service.Good movie, action and fiction. Good service
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I would Have rated this 3 1/2 if I could have. Without a doubt, Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is a favorite of mine. I love the absoluteness of Reacher from the way he talks to the way he addresses the impossible situations in which he finds himself. But this book had a few too many implausible and unexplained occurrences.  Just one example was the female FBI agent getting in the impregnable facility unassisted when Reacher had to wait for the bad guys to unwittingly open the doors. There we're too many others that I felt did not make Child's usual solid sense - kind of like Hollywood casting tiny Tom Cruise as Jack in the upcoming movie!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This guy must of lived many past lives in order to continue to come out with new lyrics and music. I believe he will continue creating songs till he is 100yrs old if he takes good care of himself. LOL!<br /><br />More nondisturbing and wondering lyrics form this album. Good job Bob!
B00838HSYM|1.0|It turned out to be a Region 2 DVD and would not play on my Blu-ray Player. I had looked at so many before I bought it I must have not looked, or it wasn't posted.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|very good book would recommend it to all my friends.  Alot better than the movie in my opinion. my grandson also enjoyed it.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is an amazing movie with a ton of one liners that will keep you laughing the entire movie!  A must see!  Not suitable for children though.  We did not allow our 15 year old son to watch it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great story line and the way they put the ending together made it great!!  Might want to watch it before kids view it. Lil more violent than the others.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Gutteral humor, great with friends and a few drinks. Basically a family guy movie in close to real life. Its missing Quagmire and cleveland sadly.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|I enjoy this latest CD from the Strokes but it does not live up to expectation but they were pretty high from their previous albums
B007SGM084|3.0|Poorly written, english and grammar was below a good writer`s standard.....she sure made alot of money for such a bad &#60; writer!!!  Koodos for her!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Nothing can beat the original - but the franchise is in tact with this third (and I expect last) installation of the defenders of the universe.  Story development is a bit rushed and surrounding characters not as rich.  For my money, Vincent D'Onofrio's bug will never be surpassed, but Josh Brolin does a great Tommy Lee Jones.  Will Smith has developed into a superb actor, but has lost some of his youthful energy.  Still a great family movie with lots of exciting special effects.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is one of, if not the best wifi, analyzers you can install on your android device in my opinion.<br /><br />I love the signal strength meter, like an old VU meter of days gone by, you can locate access points by watching the signal strength meter as well, kool.  The join add in will also allow you to join the network you are monitoring if you have the passcode.<br /><br />It loads quickly, and appears very accurate in my use.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|I really loved all the books, but this one ended before I was ready. Not sure of some things. Good series of three by a wonderful author
B007MD2RHC|5.0|I can't tell you just how invaluable this assortment was in 'transporting' me into my novel's storyboard, inventive world.... from C. David Murphy, author of a new book called [[ASIN:B00AM6GY98 The Chronicles of Good and Evil - Dracula's Lair (The Chronicles Series)]] Such an unbelievable resonation of sound & music (with few exceptions)that the listener can discover a personal distinction to interpret the music with. There is simply something for everyone here.<br /><br />I am somewhat new to the 'trailer musical' genre. But with an intuitive ear to the nature of how music evokes an emotional and perhaps, spiritual sense, this collection tops them all. It truly is, by and large, a masterpiece of musical difference, supreme qualities, powerful scores, reaching heights of emotional ambiance and the depths of feelings that can greatly move you.<br /><br />Bergersen is truly a master at crafting the temporal stage for his profound music - the scope and mood to which speaks to each listener differently and in the most intimate way...<br /><br />I have my favorites, as many would; some of which might be different than what you would discover for yourself... My descriptions come from what I felt, and what book scenes were catapulted by this music - so keep this in mind when reading through each track.<br /><br />But here are a few:<br /><br />Track 2 - Starvation - a powerful, engaging piece that draws the listener in with a slow, cautious flair until the full thrust of the music reaches to its more aggressive performance<br /><br />Track 7 - Rada - the seamless use of strings from the very start rises and elevates this musical score like nothing I've ever heard. I utilized this piece again and again to 'inspire' many dramatic scenes in my book. The gallactic battle between good and evil / heaven and hell / Satan and God are incredibly captured in this masterpiece..<br /><br />Track 9 - Merchant Prince - begins with a slight, somber overture (as its appeal for the Flight of `Chronicles' legion angels after discovering the devastation caused by Dracula and his forces). The horror they felt is aptly captured in the start of this piece, which moves into the lingering wail of souls, evolving into the triumph of knowing their purpose and what they must overcome to accomplish their mission.<br /><br />Track 10 - Promise - starts with the movements of a single chello, the hopeful chords of a piano, the flight of an angelic voice, the rush of strings, the ascension of angel's wings... A diverse piece that is filled with hope and the endurance of our collective, human spirit...<br /><br />Track 11 - Femme Fatale - A dramatic, gallactic score with a combination of winds, strings, choral brought together in the end, much like a marching hymn of defiance...<br /><br />Track 12 - Homecoming - a tender, emotional score that truly the longing for a home left behind, and the desire to someday return to it....<br /><br />Track 14 - Remember Me - a spectacular, moving piece. I've rarely heard anything remotely similar to this piece. A deep, provocative, yearning musical score that simply will pull you in. Performed in two identical cycles with one exception - the second versing is partnered with the most angelic voice - which gives this piece incredible beauty. It is one of my two favorites on this track. I call this the romantic overture score...<br /><br />Track 16 - Reborn - Simply my favorite piece... An epic, mastering tightrope between illusion and reality. Nothing beats this with its intensity. If my book were ever made into a movie, this would be the opening score for it. The use of strings, the parading burst for winds; the driven notations on keyboard - all brought together in the end by this tremendous ensemble. An incredible musical score!<br /><br />Track 17 - Age of Gods - entails in appropriate fashion the nearly apocalyptic scene where Gabriel / Satan confront one another for the first time after many millenniums.<br /><br />This is one of the best, if not the best soundtrack/trailer score I've ever purchased. Well worth the purchase price. Many other scores only give you one or two, maybe three tracks that stick out; ones that you are drawn to - the variety here will keep you listening for some time to come.<br /><br />If I have one piece of advice for Thomas Bergersen, please come out with more compilations like this!<br /><br />It's truly a masterpiece for which the masters of old (Wagner, Beethoven, etc) would be most proud of...ne of the best, if not the best soundtrack/trailer score I've ever purchased.

B009EAO38C|5.0|I first saw The Piano Guys on YouTube, like most folks I assume.  Now when I listen to their album I can't help but picture their happy smiling places.  Besides Great music it makes me happy!
0061992860|5.0|This was one of the first items purchased for my Survival needs. Have not yet found a subject that was not covered in the book. Written in an easy to find, follow and understand layout. Size is perfect and I keep next to my EDC in my truck so its always at hand when needed. Handy size and easy to take into waiting rooms or any place I have a little time for light reading. This book helps me keep my skills at a higher level.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|however; my little grandchildren do and they don't like this version so we have 47 other versions. HA The love the concept
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Absolutely love Madonna and arrived in great condition.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I am not quite finished with the book.  It is a good story, but it seems to really drag on.  I am looking forward to the Puller series as I have heard that it picks up a bit, but this particular book is not a very compelling read.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 4 year old has a great time with this program.  It lets you choose different art tools such as brushes, pencils and markers.  There are all kinds of special effects and stickers
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like this fine, except that when I whip open my Kindle I want to see the real time. It always shows 8 something. Otherwise it is okay
B000002MUW|5.0|I am a huge fan! The CD arrived in great condition. I couldn't  be happier! I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Timely situations.  Good writing.  Great character. I will no longer do reviews as the requirements take more time than I am willing to apply to your advertising.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|This movie does a good job of capturing the spirit of Dickens' story but has a couple too many unnecessary action sequences that don't really add anything to the story.  I guess they are there to keep kids from getting bored but for adults, they are just tedius.  Otherwise, I liked the movie and would recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I couldn't seem to use this one without getting the other version which was a full version. I may not be doing it right
B00005J6SZ|5.0|I am a huge Madonna fan! When I came across this CD, I just had to have it! Excellent customer service.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an excellent little guide to getting your work published. Thank you, Amazon, for putting this out there. It is most appreciated.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|They keep trying to get me to upgrade to Outlook for e-mail but I like the way Hotmail works and looks so much better.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love this. It is hard to use at first, but my movies are fun. Everyone was so silly because of the way I have to take them with this one sided lense on the Kindle. Fun
B00005J6T0|5.0|The CD arrived in great condition. No complaints here.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Wonderful story line with a good moral statement.  And what would we do without all the magic.  Just remember it comes with a price.
B009NXV51S|1.0|The quality of the video stream was terrible!  I have 30 mps service and have no problems with any other streaming service.  Last time I will purchase video from Amazon.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this CD for a friend and she loved it! The songs are great, and the CD came in great condition.  However, I was a little upset that it took quite a while to be shipped to my house, but all in all, it was a great buy!
B009329Y30|5.0|Awesome movie.  Sometimes a movie can be an escape from reality but this one gives you hope that there can be a happily ever after.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|One of the most discombobulated books I've read - can't imagine this being made into a movie.  Sci fi fans may like it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written and one of the most interesting themes I've read in a long time.  You think you have something figured out and then another twist happens.  I immediately wanted to ready the other books Gillian Flynn had written.
B001LX2J22|5.0|Red Dragon was a Terrific book and an AWESOME movie.  I am a huge fan of the Hannibal Lecter series and this was a great purchase.

B002W2U3H4|5.0|We've watched this movie a dozen times by renting it and decided to finally purchase it.  We received a copy that would not play.  We were getting ready to ride a train that does the Polar Express the next day so we decided to use Amazon Prime streaming which was not HD it of course was a great movie.  Amazon quickly replace our damaged DVD (2 days) and the HD copy was leaps and bounds better in HD.  It made this wonderful movie even better.  I highly recommend purchasing this in HD.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett remains a favorite writer who gives us a thousand pages of a meaty story.  The historical accounts are detailed to the point the reader knows more about this time period from fiction than any nonfiction book.  His characters are brought to light in detail so the reader feels they know each one personally.  Can't wait for book three!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Fun with just about the right level of frustration. Highly recommended to those who enjoy puzzle games. Good for all ages.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, my brothers and I are competing to see who can get the highest score.  This game does not get old, I can play it everyday, very addictive

B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book. The story is and the format are out of the ordinary and very entertaining. I was not too happy with the ending.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love the app I wish it had more levels. That is the only down side. It needs more levels other than that ... best game I have ever seen/had.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I love all the Twilight movies, and this one did not disappoint!!  I can not wait to see part II....
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The show is well acted and well written.  You care about the characters and the story line.  It's action adventure with enough romance that my wife enjoys the show.  It's rare that we can both find a show we both enjoy.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book. Sure the writing isn't up to par, but the love story, and the anticipation are what keep people hooked. I seriously could NOT put the book down. After reading book two, I instantly bought the third book, as to not miss a beat. I even read while I was at work during my down time. A must read, and I highly recommend it!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I dont understand what the point of this game is.  I actually wasted a good five minutes of my life trying to play it!!!!!
B005XN0SGU|5.0|I've been using Perfect Viewer on my android phone for a while now and really loved the app. The ease of use and its ability to allow me to easily read comics on the go had been a blessing.  But the atrociously small size of my phone made it more of a chore and constant eye strain. I mean yes the app is now much more easier to use on my Kindle Fire but I was surprised to see $2.99 price tag on it while its totally free on Android App Store. I mean I know its not really Google's app store on kindle fire but that is the only minor annoyance I have with this app and well...with the whole amazon app store. But thats another day's discussion. Besides that, it has worked flawlessly on my fire.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|My friend rented this movie for us to watch and I wasn't too excited, but it turned out being a cute movie.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|One of my favorite CDs of all time! I bought while deployed to Iraq an it arrived in a good amount of time. Adele is truly amazing!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I liked the way the story line unfolded with Harold's soul searching journey.  The story had well developed character's and a good plot.
B00AFEQA5K|5.0|if you're looking to watch something a bit untraditional, but well-scripted and well-made, this one's a winner. good characters, good acting, and overall evocative. one of my favorite ending scenes in a movie, ever
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought the plot was dynamic a well done project hats off to producer/ writer directors and all others who paticipated.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wanted to read them so that I could be part of the conversation but I regret it. Could have been written as a short story
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Excellent and detailed preparation for the next one to come.  It was surprising in the character<br />development department, in that the characters were surprisingly developed in depth.  While the current<br />edition was not completely satisfying it certainly built up a desire for a movie (part 2?) to follow.<br />The movie was worth my time and money.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A well written, well acted show! I would recommend it to anyone who has even a passing interest in crime procedurals. But what I like best about this show is the relationships between the characters.
B003B02PEU|4.0|Great book....I read early in the morning before anyone in my household gets up.....I found myself gettint up earlier and earlier each day to continue reading.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|It's interesting when people have a perfect set up and it's working for them and then they screw it up.  This film is violent and cruel, but I watched it anyway.  Like watching a train wreck.  In the end, I was okay with it all, but I can't tell you why.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|The game, when I was playing the trial game (b.c. we all know these are NOT free people), was awesome!!! great graphics, makes you think, not too easy not too hard, games with in games, loved it..until....got almost all the way through and it wouldn't load. Tried many many times and it would kick me back to my kindle fire home screen. It was either delete the game and forget about it or start over. I want to finish what I started so I'm starting over...wish they would fix this. I would give the game a 5 star if it weren't for the glitch.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Not to drop any spoilers, which you can get from other reviews, this story has satisfactorily tied up some loose ends from ST:TNG series regarding Data, Lore, the Borg, and tied it neatly into the current history of the Star Trek Universe (not the new, alternate one created by the latest ST Movie.) Oh, it also deals with Data's \\"rebirth\\" (which I don't think is a spoiler, given the title and cover of the book.) Buy it.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I was trying to get the entire show for a Christmas present.  This one ended up being just $8.  What a great deal!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a keeper to enjoy again and again in years to come.  I came in on season two and ended up buying both seasons.  The actors, sets, costumes and stories are just all wonderful/
B0037472PM|5.0|I'm a big Harry Borsh fan and thought this was really well done.  Harry has passed a phase in his life and now can go on.  Up until now I thought he would have benefitted form an antidepressant.  Hope he comes across a little happier in the next book.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|be aware - you only get a short period of time to play and then need to buy the full version.  Would have been better is unlimited play but not given all of the features.
078324228X|4.0|I believe this is really a great movie and it was a true story as it was told.I watched it and yaped it on a VHS,but I have to admit it better on DVD.It is a movie that keeps your attention through out the complete movie.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I got this for my sister.  She said that she cannot get in the Christmas spirit unless she sees &#34;It's a Wonderful Life!&#34;
1905236042|5.0|I use these with my students and the pictures greatly help the kids to get into the correct positions. They love choosing the cards they want to do and I love that they are working on coordination, strengthening, flexibility, motor planning and following verbal and visual cues. Great activity for warm up or cool down.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I have never seen this and I have to wait till after Christmas when I give it to my boys and watch it with them but from what I have heard it is a funny and clean cut movie for kids and adults as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So I didn't read the first book.  Rather, I saw the movie. But I liked the movie enough to have an interest in the other books. And I loved it.  More so than the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have been hooked on solitaire for years and to now have a kindle and have the game with me 24/7 PRICELESS
B005721W9O|5.0|Great cast of comedians and serious actors. Still cannot figure out why somebody put the chompers in the middle of a star ship? The DVD is worth every penny!
0316187216|4.0|I'm a long-time fan of Abercrombie, so I had RED COUNTRY on pre-order and was basically drooling as I waited for its release date. I'm very happy to say that it did not disappoint.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of westerns, but I found the idea of combining fantasy in a western setting extremely compelling. There isn't much fantasy in RED COUNTRY though, certainly less fantastical elements than was found in THE FIRST LAW trilogy, which I found slightly disappointing.<br /><br />All right, here's a breakdown of my review of RC.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: I love, love, looooove Abercrombie's characters. If you're looking for special snowflakes, he ain't the guy for you. But if what you want are real, gritty, complex characters, then Abercrombie's got it down pat. Admittedly, I found RC's main, Shy, less compelling than past mains like Murcatto and Glokta. Of course, saying that Shy isn't as interesting as Glokta is like saying something isn't as valuable as a diamond the size of a hamster. She's still a great character. Err, I feel like I'm not expressing myself very well, so moving on...the rest of the characters in RC are your typical Abercrombie cast of effed-up, cowardly bastards. Which is amazing, because I love it when characters are flawed and cowardly and not fighting to sacrifice themselves for a greater good.<br /><br />PLOT: Shy South comes home to find the children stolen and the farm burned. She travels to the Far Country in pursuit of the kids. Like BEST SERVED COLD, RED COUNTRY's plot is pretty straightforward. I find that Abercrombie's books tend to be character-driven, but this doesn't mean that his plots are thin. On the contrary, set during a gold rush, on the cusp of newfound technologies (coal and gunpowder), Abercrombie has managed to ramp up the stakes in RED COUNTRY. Y'all know how TFL trilogy was described by TV Tropes as being set in a \\"crapsack world\\"? Well, RED COUNTRY's setting sinks even lower than that. And I mean that in the best possible way. Part of why I love Abercrombie is his ability to shine a light on the worst of humanity, and he sure as hell did it in RC.<br /><br />WRITING: Abercrombie's writing is as unpretentious as before, albeit smoother, with an economy to his words that I find admirable. There was never a point in the book where I felt like he was indulging himself (cough, cough, Rothfuss). The writing remained consistently strong throughout the book, the pacing fast, the story richly-set and moving at a healthy pace. The ending left me with tears in my eyes and goosebumps all over my arms.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed RED COUNTRY, but I have docked one star because I didn't find it as amazing as his other books. I much prefer BEST SERVED COLD and TFL, both for the plot and the immense complexity of their characters. Having said that, RED COUNTRY is a strong book that I will definitely recommend to fans of low fantasy.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|From the minute l started reading this novel l was compelled to keep on reading. Such courage and determination is beyond any average humans capabilities, yet in this novel it took you to the furtherest of boundaries. A great read and reccomend you to read it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's addictive, frustrating and fun.  My only complaint is that it is slow to get on to the next try after you fail an attempt.  Maybe I don't know the secret to making it work faster.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I think for the average reader it could easily have been broken up into three books.  However, reading it on the new Kindle really made it easy to handle. I did not find any slow spots and had a hard time putting it down at night.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|The \\"Warriors\\" is a brilliant use of the boxing movie genre.  There are thousands of westerns but only one \\"High Noon\\", which uses the well-worn conventions of the western movie and makes a high style, suspenseful film which makes us care about its characters.  The \\"Warriors\\" is such a movie.  I did not  find the ending \\"predictable\\"; in fact, the story could have led to many different endings without changing the experience much. Very little of the plot tensions were resolved beyond the biggest of all--the reestablishment of the lost family relationships. We do not really know what will happen in the future with the characters' lives; but we feel they will be intertwined again, which is the real ending.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG.  GREAT CAST. GEOGRAPHY LESSON TOO. SALLY ANN HOWES HAD AGREAT CAREER THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF.  WONDERFUL MUSIC AND SCENERY
B003GYEGNO|5.0|I'm quoting Newsweek here - &#34;It's The Human Comedy, on a skyscraper scale and at a taxi-meter pace.&#34;<br />Published in the 80's it's still a relevant portrait of human biases today.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can spend enless hours getting the most fabulous ideas, recipes and generally just great stuff.  Sadly it can waste HOURS of your life :)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I would place this in my list of all time favorite business books.  A balanced exploration of the life of Steve Jobs.  Highly recommend.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has an incredible imagination. I guess having been a lawyer hasn't hurt his thought process. Any fan of mystery will love this book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|What else can I say. I could see how teenagers would like this series although Katniss isn't likeable at all in my opinion. Decent quick read
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Great site to get all the info from the best places to stay, eat, and things to do.  Never lets me down.  Went to trip advisor to find a good hotel in NY that wouldn't cost a fortune, went to a less known hotel that was everything they said it would be and cost about 1/2 what we would have paid elswhere.  Truly the most used app I have!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I've always hated Scrabble, so when nu Aunt told me about &quot;Dice with Friends&quot;, I couldn't wait ti download it! My 10-year-old nephew &amp; his 7-year-old sister want to play every time they see me. Now we can play even when we're not in the same room. Awesome game!!
B005COO1X6|2.0|For a minute I thought Christine had been reincarnated. Thought the ending was very weak. I did not think it was very good.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Well written, mysterious and continously kept you wanting more.  Great character descriptions and i'm a sucker for books that don't leave you hanging at the end of the story.
B0092QITO2|3.0|I've been having problems with the audio of this blu-ray. The Dolby HD track would keep dropping out when bitstreamed to a receiver.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Nothing better than a great Tom Clancy techno thriller during the holidays. Tom's the best there is in this genre.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The Movie was excellent, but the downloaded rental was disappointing due to interrupted streaming and slow buffering, like 3 minutes for complete buffering or complete failure.  Had to restart 4 times before we were able to watch the movie and then it occasionally still had buffering problems.  We don't experience this with Hulu or Netflix so this will cause us to think twice about renting from Amazon again.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The new update sucked the first day I installed it, no emails would load, so I uninstalled it, then installed again and it worked fine. you guys should try it. it fixed the problem for me
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I really like my new TK41 Fenix. I am a flashlight nut, but not a guru.<br /><br />Before purchasing this light, my brightest light was my LED Lenser T7. It claims 175 lumens and throws its' powerful beam 680ft. While it may illuminate the entire 680ft, its' practical usefulness comes in at around 450ft. Meaning? It may illuminate a reflector at 680ft but recognition of figures or seeing colors seems to be limited to around 150yds.<br /><br />The TK41 claims to cast a beam 476 meters. The same application of usefulness comes to play here as well. Its' real illumination seems to be somewhere about the 300-325 meter range. That is still quite an accomplishment in my book.....especially utilizing 8AA batteries. Out to 200 meters its' extremely bright 860 lumins still makes this light extremely useful.<br /><br />I work in the EMS field and as a handheld search light, it proves to be a very useful tool.<br /><br />My user interface seems to be a little bit different than those I have seen on YouTube. My right hand switch still serves as an off-on switch. The left hand switch toggles between low, med, high, and turbo. The difference is, to achieve strobe or SOS function, I must depress and hold down the left switch for 2 seconds for strobe or 3 seconds for SOS. The ones on YouTube, to use the strobe or beacon, you must depress the right hand switch twice quickly, after the light is on.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now, would I buy this light all over again? I sure would. The cost per lumin as well as the cost per distance meter or &#34;throw&#34; meter is unsurpassed. I'm amazed at this little light and highly recomend it.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like this game but I don't know why you have to start over when you fail a level.  I would rather try the level again than to start over.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|so grateful I can have my cell phone back and let the kids play the game of Angry Birds on the Kindle, they love it !!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome App, it is full of ideas and inspiration. Made christmas shopping much easier for friends and family. I used their boards as a gift guide.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|Henry Fonda in the role of a villain; amazing. Charles Bronson and the best musical score of any western only add to the beauty of this film. Hum along with the theme song as you enjoy this film.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The book starts slowly and then it picks up. Good read and would recommend even though Tom Clancy is in coast mode lately.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Some great lines for the hero and non-stop action when this movie is at its best. Family conflict and hugs ... not so much.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love the characters in this book.  There is true love and much adventure in this book.  A book for everyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has a fascinating plot. It is full of twisted energy which allowed me to be apart of the of deception.
B001HN69AY|5.0|This movie is a great entertainment.<br />If you like surrealism and far away lands, then this is the movie for you!<br />All the acting is superb.<br />The story line itself is interesting and keeps you guessing and wanting to watch more.<br />This movie isn't exactly for children, I would say 15yrs and up.<br />This movie is excellent and shipping arrived early.<br />A definite buy
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Not particularly intelligent, but good for an entertaining laugh.  Bawdy at times, as expected, with a fair amount of drug use.  Very MacFarlanesque!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Very happy with my purchase. The story line really starts to pick up during the second book. I found myself having trouble putting it down!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Great movie for anyone who has seen the Firefly series or not. Firefly fans will notice that the story they depict in the movie of how Simon got River out of the Academy is different in Serenity than how he describes in Firefly, but nonetheless, great movie. :-)
1423140605|5.0|I love all of Riordan's Olympus series books.  This book is as good as any other in the series and I can't wait until the 4th book is done.  I'm older but a kid at heart and find reading these books and enjoyable break from the crime novels that I also read.  These are great books for young teens and up, and really put a smile on my face when I'm reading them.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This is not a cute Teddy. He is gross, disgusting and very vulgar. Do not allow your small children to watch this movie.
B000NOK06W|5.0|This collection is incredible to the Morricone lover. Comes with 3 cd's and info on the songs. Highly recommend it and great for the price.!
B0014C0BMU|1.0|30 mins in the sound gave out and couldn't do anything to fix on PS3 so moved to finish it on a laptop.
B0053O89KG|4.0|Season four of Castle is fun to watch, and of course in the finale they hook up. Hooray. The main difference between this season and the others (and the reason why I give it four stars and not five) is that it is slightly darker, which is not necessarily a good thing if you consider the show's premise. Other than that, you have of course a few episodes which are very, very, very well conceived and done.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Very good read; Harry Bosch lives on to solve the mystery as usual and does not disappoint. Michael Connelly in his 20th book with Bosch has really excelled this time.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Besides for seeing Natalie Portman with minimal clothes during different scenes :), the story line itself was very entertaining. You wonder where it will go so you're kept in your seat, watching waiting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! Every one i know an hang out with watch it an we are on the edge of our seats waiting for the next episode soooooooooo good
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked this book, it got a little more medical than I would have liked, but overall I thought it was a great read.
0143113100|5.0|Facscinating book.  A must-read.  It is amazing how the brain can be re-trained.  They talk about Phantom Leg syndrom and other ways the brain's perception is off.  If you have a neurological illness that shows negative test results, this helps you understand your problem. Your brain signals are not correct, therefore even if you have a normal test, the pain you have is real and you need to train your brain to take different paths.  I wish there was a doctor who understood it so I could implement it.  I am not able to on my own.
B008COD5UI|5.0|This movie is just plain crazy, as there is just so many wild things that go on.  If you love seeing crazy things happen watch the movie.
B009LREA1S|4.0|However, ..not the same without Heath Ledger. overall good movie with a good twist, but could have been an hour shorter
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The whole story is only about the two characters, no side plots. Really liked the characters, the romance and relationship development were absorbing and enjoyable. Immediately bought another book by this author
1451627289|5.0|Just when you think Stephen King could become predictable, along comes this book.  He continues to come up with original ideas.  What if you found a way to go back in time and return to modern times safely?  Where would you go and what would you do?  Would you try and prevent JFK's assassination?<br /><br />Mr King covers this along with a number of moral dilemmas one would never think about.<br /><br />In addition to the suspense/scifi/horror aspect, the book is thought-provoking
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen the other Bourne movies in the series.  Just watch it.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|My favorite tracks include Overture, The Grid, Armory, Outlands, Adagio For Tron (haha), and Flynn Lives.  A great album for any chilled occasion.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great story and excellent production quality! Always keeps you guessing what's gong to happen next. Love it! Can't wait for the new season!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate this game because I turned off my kindle and it restarted my hole game over and I was almost done
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent seller.  Prompt delivery.  Would recommend to anyone.  Couldn't ask for a better product. Got exactly what I was asking for.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This product works well. I use it at work to measure the signal strength of our access points throughout the plant.<br />The only think I would have liked it to do now is give me the ability to log the graph information and send it to my computer.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Overall I have to say I loved this book because it draws you in immediately and it's hard to put it down.  It starts out with a huge hook when the wife disappears.  It was almost impossible to stop reading because you get to know the characters right away and you become very interested in them.  I also immediately wanted to know what happened to the wife who disappeared and if the husband was guilty.  The overall pace of the book is very fast and the character development is excellent.<br /><br />There are some very unexpected plot twists in this book, some which are disappointing.  I was loving this book until I was about 70% done and then I was really disappointed in where the plot was heading.  I don't want to give anything away, but I did not like the ending at all.  Overall I'd say this is a good, fast read and something that most women would enjoy reading.
B0071CBBKS|5.0|They are a really good band, probably one of the best in the world.<br />I really like this album, I listen to it while I cut the grass.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excellent seller.  Prompt delivery.  Would recommend to anyone.  Couldn't ask for a better product. Got exactly what I was asking for.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Yahoo mail is just okay.  I can't go directly to Yahoo mail from the Yahoo home page.  Instead I have to sign into mail also.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|The Italian Job has a great cast! There is plenty of humor and adventure to make it fun to watch over and over.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I was told twice in one day that I'd like this guy, turns out I do.  Listen to a few songs and decide for yourself.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not the usual plot lines from his previous books, but still a very good read. Definitely some unexpected turns at the end.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Usually sequels are not as good as the first. In my opinion this is the best MIB out of them all.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Anyone who likes a story that will make you realize how such a few could control everything and everyone, which is  very real in parts of the earth now.So wake up and take notice before it can happen here. Look forward to the sequels to find out whats next.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I like the bourne movies starring Matt Damon and wasn't really sure what I'd be getting out of the new borne movies.  Jeremy Renner did a good job.  Good movie to rent.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|...until I saw Moonrise Kingdom. This is a cute, light comedy about the late summer antics of a couple of kids who try to get more adventure and romance than children are usually allowed.<br />The story and acting are superb - I especially like the way the a-listers  took on background characters to help emboss the pre-teen central characters, who were awesome.<br />After 30 minutes of pondering the weirdness in the shooting of movie, it suddenly dawned on me that the director was showing me this story through 12 year old eyes and did an excellent job of showing how a child may interpret the world at that age  - well done.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is the best game to play on any mobile device. The way it is set up, you can play for days, weeks, months, etc. It gives you a drive to keep playing, unlike some of the other games where you play for a few days, reach your goal, and then it's just excess after that. This game is well designed and well executed. Recommend to anyone.
0812992784|4.0|Joseph Anton is the memoir of controversial Indian author, Salman Rushdie and concentrates on the time in his life during which he was under threat of the fatwa imposed by the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini for his novel, The Satanic Verses. From this memoir, the reader gains an understanding of the roots of Rushdie's atheism, as well as the inspiration for and circumstances surrounding the writing of his novels. It is certainly interesting to see how events in his life are linked to his novels: I was especially gratified to learn about the genesis of my favourite Rushdie novel, Haroun and the Sea of Stories. The mechanics of being in hiding, protection by Special Branch, risk and threat are intriguing and occasionally quite amusing. The loyalty and generosity of his true friends (\\"Friends Without Whom Life Would Have Been Impossible\\") was nothing short of remarkable; the lack of support and criticism from certain literary figures, politicians and governments was surprising. Well into his years of hiding, he says \\"I have been given a lesson, in these years, in the worst of human nature, but also the best of it..\\" While the details of the many trips, dinners, meetings, press conferences and politicking verged on tedious, it is apparent that Rushdie's journals must have been extremely detailed. The matter-of-fact manner in which he describes his infidelity is breathtaking. The soup of famous names began to smack of name dropping yet the funniest part, the interlude in Australia, involved no celebrities, just a bunch of ordinary people helping out: I also loved that because it mentioned my home town and lots of familiar places. His \\"unsent\\" letters were clever and often very funny. His strong stand on freedom of speech and imagination is well presented and his comments on what he was battling, \\"popular irrationalism\\", succinct: \\"The unreasoning mind, driven by doubt-free absolutes, could not be convinced by reason.\\" As with most of his major works, Rushdie never uses two words where three will do, more evidence of those detailed journals. Bizarrely, Rushdie has written this memoir in the third person, perhaps because he was writing about his alias, Joseph Anton: mostly, this works, but occasionally it gives rise to some ambiguity: which \\"he\\" said or did that? This is a fascinating insight (even if is it rather one-eyed) into this fine writer.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|What can you say it's a great game not enough Star Wars out there everyone in my family love this game I wish there were more Star Wars products out there
B00000ICN5|5.0|1. Insert CD<br />2. Press Play<br />3. Listen to entire album uninterrupted<br />4. Repeat<br /><br />One of the few albums that can be left in the CD player for months at a time, every song is great from start to finish.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|Excellent movie in old style sci-fi with a bit of hurt thrown in.  Harrison Ford always does well in any movie.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|My 12yr really enjoyed watching this movie. He saw the previews from a previous movie and wanted to see this. Just what he expected n more.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Of all the Christmas movies, Miracle is still my favorite.  It looks terrific in Blue Ray.  Edmund Gwenn is terrific.
B003BOUKRU|4.0|Really enjoyed this since you get to see her life as a huge icon. Great addition to anyone into concerts. I would still say buy the other bluray she has also. 2 different versions of her concerts.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I was disappointed when I could not download videos on my new kindle HD,this app cured that problem. It works great I now have my favorite videos back on my kindle
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Mr. Martin is straying from his story.  Seems to have lost control of all his characters.  The first 3 books were great...excellent story line...this book isn't adding anything to the plot that wasn't already there.  I'm afraid this series is just going to go on and on and on...never finishing the story he started out with.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best series ever!!!Storyline and acting beyond Superb.....Music is fabulous..everything about this show is superlative....Cannot wait for the next season...
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome quality. Definetly must own for any batman fan. Great sound and picture. Best thing of all you get all 3.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This is a great movie.  Little intense for young young kids, but overall great! In the witches hut is where you can see the PIxar pizza truck!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I initially got the free version to travel with and block out the usual plane noises.  However I also started using it to go to sleep at night.  The timer is great and will shut off my Kindle quietly when it's done.  You can combine sounds to customize your experience and save your favorites.  Whether you just want ambient music, nature sounds to work or meditate by, or a lullaby for your baby, it's there.  It even has the sound of a clothes dryer and AC for really blocking out background noise.  I liked the free version so much that I bought the upgrade with even more sounds.  This is my most used Kindle app!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a Great series! I wasn't sure how I felt about the first book but it got way better on the second one. Five stars!
B00AAQ7JNA|2.0|Just got the bluray thinking it would have awesome audio and at least 1080i or better picture. Guess not. Audio was horrible and so was picture. Only reason it got 2 stars being a fan of the songs.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|CUSSING AND LAUGHTER ,ITS HERE..i RECOMMMEND IT FOR THE ADULTS ,KIDS GO IN THE OTHER ROOM ,PLEASE LOL...... !<br />.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|The best TV series I have seen. There is a progressive weaving of character tapestry. I never viewed the original TV episodes, but after watched 2 or 3.reruns I was hooked. Humor, pathos, excitement, and a slowly progressing love story...and no commercial interruptions...what's not to like. I recommend watching from the beginning of series 1 through the end. It is like a good long book...hard to put down
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Very entertained by this movie. It was fast paced and kept my interest. Would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Oh how horrible.  I really tried to read this book.  I started out reading every word and pretty quickly started skimming.  It wasn't long before I was turning multiple pages at a time just trying to find where \\"the good part\\" starts.  I couldn't find that part anywhere in this book.  After this complete waste of time I'm convinced you can buy your way onto the NY best sellers list.  I'm just glad I borrowed this book from someone and didn't actually spend money on it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I was expecting a light hearted book written from a dog's point of view.  It turned out to be a very different story.  It was hard for me to read in parts and I would have to put it down and come back to it later.  This was not because of the dog but it was the human story that was difficult.  I would recommend it, but be prepared.  It is not full of laughs.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|The good:<br />7 DVD's, averaging 15 hours of movie per box, for only $27.<br />Very good drama (I don't watch it, but my wife constantly was changing from lauging to crying to being happy watching these series)!<br />She can't stop watching them, and loves them more than any regular movie!<br /><br />The bad:<br />At this current posting, it only has 4 seasons, and it's over :-)
B0030B624E|5.0|This is a great take on a zombie apocalypse. So funny and Woody Herrelson is the greatest in this flick.
B001223BLU|5.0|This is a great compilation... I bought this after the wife and I saw Jersey Boys. We have listened to it countless times and still love it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Runs well on kindle fire! Kind of short but lots of fun. Good HO s Good story line. Like the hints feature!<br />_<br /><br />Good fun. Runs well on kindle fire. Great hidden objects. Interesting story. Kind of surprise ending. Ends abruptly. Still love G5.
1401232590|4.0|The Long Halloween contains many great writting strategies. This book is a mystery of murders coinciding with holidays, and Batman try's to stop the murders. This book also has varius villains in the 12 chapters of the book. This is a great book for any fan.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It is a great series worth every penny. Amazon got it to me quickly. And if i miss an episode its instant HD is amazing
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book totally did it for me to end a sequel.  You can't read just one, you have to read from beginning to end.
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids love this game, it keeps my 4yr old busy. He love to try and beat his brothers score, trying not to slice the bomb it keep him focused. Great game
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great to see Tommy Lee Jones when he is not chasing someone. He has great comedy deilvery style. Of course, Meryl can't be bad.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Awesome movie. I like the way they tied everything together from the first movie. Bane was a good villain, but of course not as good as the Joker.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Love this book!  It is so sensitive and unique and would highly recommend it to anyone.  What a special relationship this dog and his owner had.  We should all be so lucky.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I am a big Mark Wahlberg fan, but I just didn't think it was that funny or entertaining.  Ended up falling asleep in the middle of it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|To much repition on discriptions of scenes.  Did not like the ending.  Usually I cannot put aPatricia Cornwell book down, this one was a hard book to finish.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I love the book and every version of the movie that have been made. If you haven't watched it yet, you should do so. You might learn something.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I enjoy this game so much that I can't stop playing it so I can play with my many other apps.  This version of Mahjong is the best I have found.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|The cancellation of Firefly was one of the biggest mistakes ever. However since it was cancelled, Serenity does a good job of bringing the series to a true ending. It doesn't disappoint in anyway. It is as good as the series. It just left me still wanting more.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very good book. I recommend reading the other Nelson DeMille books before picking this one up though. You'll need to learn about the characters from the other books first.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A quirky little tale about books and quaint folk and an interesting little puzzle.  It is a clever and charming little book.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I was force to see this movie by my girlfriend. I thought it would be weird and silly but i found it to be very funny and weird. It is defiantly an adult movie only not for kids. The return of Sam Jones to the big screen is fantastic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|get this app its amazing :) :)<br />but you have to play a lot of games to get a lot of points
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is fun to read and is fairly well written but there are definitely some holes in the plot.  I'd still recommend it though.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I do love Phllip Phillips.  I'd give this 5 stars because it definitely is what we expected, but I get a little bored by a couple of the songs that don't have as much melody.
B000HKYBXA|2.0|Online it said it was brand new. However, when I received it the case looked totally used and somewhat mangled.
1476719071|5.0|One of my favorite Love stories...reread it 5 times...<br />Travis & Abby were made for each other...It's funny, romantic and engrossing...can't wait for Travis' POV in the next book...
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Why did I choose this rating: Because I absolutely enjoy the music of Enya.<br /><br />What did I like: &#34;One Toy Soldier&#34; has already been listened to over 100 times.<br /><br />Who would I recommend this product to: Anybody who really enjoys the music of Enya.<br /><br />My personal rating: 10 of 10
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Loved it! Was a unique and uplifting story. This is a a great family movie. You will love it. Watch it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My children and I like this movie alot. The 3D plays out very well. I would recommend this movie for anyone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a fun read - well written.  I talk to my dog differently now, and wonder how much she really understands!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I watched this movie twice in the first two days I owned it. I am a newly retired person and related to the story theme. The story confirms that ones worth is not lost when you retire. Life continues to be rich but different from previous life. It stresses everyone has value in the community.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|exactly as expected and just what I wanted, an entertaining vision of the space program.  some of the information was powerful to me, since I was old enough to experience the landing (for example) but still young enough to not fully understand the significance, excitement, danger.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|good to read about Harry's beginnings...still reading and still need the second Hole book translated - i have read 3 through to 9
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|If you like Family Guy you will like this movie.  Mila Kunis is very easy on the eyes too. How can a beer drinking teddy bear not be funny?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book grabs you from the first page.  Stephen King knows how to tell a good story.  Lots of references to some of his other books.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This smart and very funny book was a energetic look at the life of a wonderfully endearing old dude!  The crazy interludes Jonas Jonasson places him in are historical, but historically correct.  He is obviously a history buff!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I bought this a gift for a five year old for Christmas. it was just what she wanted., i may have to get one for myself
B008602KQI|3.0|I got the movie on sale at Amazon, so the price of the movie was less than the price of a ticket at my normal movie theater.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining, but somewhat slow at the beginning.  It was a little predictable in places (which I cannot adequately describe without spoiling the plot).  And, I guess I am going to have to read the books to figure out the meaning of the last scene in the movie.  I am not big on violence in Movies, and there was more than I normally like.  But all things considered, it was a good way to spend the evening with the family.<br /><br />Bottom line, I am glad I purchased the movie and will probably wait for the DVD and get it when the sequel comes out.
B004HD61KE|5.0|As always James Rollins never fails to keep me on the edge of my seat! Or bed, as I love to read in the evening but then I end up with such a rapid heart rate it is impossible to sleep. I spread his books out because I always want there to be one more I haven't read. But sometimes I just get a craving for a great &#34;Sigma&#34; adventure to take me away from the cares of everyday life.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|I like Led Zeppelin, but I'm not a crazy fan.. It has all the numbers that I like from this band. This adds well to my collection.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|When I first heard this CD from its beginning, I was a little dissapointed.  Rod sounded a little old and tired.  As the CD went on it got better.  Rod's collaboration with other artists really lifts this CD.  Some tunes are just OK while others are superb.  This record is a worthy effort and should be considered for your Christmas music collection.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Bane had the expected menacing and fearful presence... The Talia twist was an unexpected version of the story line... otherwise I found I grew bored with another series about the league of assassins...<br /><br />I think I've been tainted by such an exceptional criminal that The Joker was.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Character development excellent<br />I cared about the people involved<br />Story line was too slow to develope<br />and the ending was depressing.
B000002KHB|5.0|Machine Head was my first Deep Purple album (on a cassette) and I loved it. Wanted to replace the tape with this CD.<br />I like it, so it gets 5 stars, what else can I say.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Big fan of Bourne Trilogy. Missed Jason in this one. A lot of clips from prior films, took a while to get started with the new series.
B004V73FGE|4.0|It doesn't make you think like the Matrix, but it is very entertaining and visually different than other scifi movies.  Worth the rental price.
B009AP2G26|5.0|What a great and emotional season. Really still want Rachel and Finn together. But they really out did themseves. I really loved racheals the frist Noel performance.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun. How you play is there is a coin pusher that pushes coins. You have to aim a coin so it pushes other. coins.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I am beyond obsessed with Lianne, since the beginning of her career. She's brilliant also is her voice, style, voice and every other part of her. Loved every song buy this album!!!!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I would have thought was this written by Seth Macfarlane when he was 15.  Awful.  Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, tsk, tsk, thought ya'll were better than this.
B009B2VBWE|2.0|This is a complete edit of my original thoughts of this recording. At first I was enjoying the CD, but it wasn't long before it grew stale and annoying. I now agree with many others that the music here can become grating. The song and music most defiantly are much better suited for Elvis Costello than Krall. Perhaps for me the most annoying of the songs is,  There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth The Salt Of My Tears. Skip this one but if you insist I'll gladly sell you mine at a discount.
B0061S073A|4.0|Very useful in preventing children from visiting undesired sites. Fairly easy and quick to set up and use on Android Tablets.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|All I can say about this album is wow. For her debut album as Lana Del Rey it is so different from her material as Mary Jailer or Liz. Its all just so mesmerizing, I am in love with her and the album. She's a siren and I'm a sailor without wax... but why would I want it!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this CD, which was an early Christmas gift to myself, and think it is Susan Boyle's best yet.
B0060D3B5M|5.0|The movie is typical 90's artwork and voice acting, while the writing leaves you quoting off humor segments and the storyline shows more emotion than most animation from the period.  It's a good watch for all ages, especially with young ones starting to want their space or get away from their parents.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Once I let go of my need for a linear timeline and a &#34;believable&#34; story, I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I found it to be a bit of a cross between Harry Potter, the Hunger Games and Water for Elephants. It was really a delightful story, full of interesting and compelling characters. I found some of the character development to be lacking and many many unanswered/unanswerable questions, but it was a book I had trouble putting down.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I don't watch much TV, but I love The Big Bang Theory.  It's funny in a nerdy way.  The characters are so well played, there are times I forget Sheldon Cooper is not a real person! The writing in this show is amazing - I am constantly wondering &#34;how do they come up with this stuff&#34; as I'm laughing hysterically.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|Pretty run of the mill type series, starts well and then takes on the usual TV formula, doesn't really develop credible characters. just another pulp series aimed at the average simple minded US TV consumer, why can't they learn from the Europeans?
B009E3EY38|5.0|I listen to the DVD everyday. It is almost like being there. Being an older fan and going to Led Zeppelin concerts in the 70's it reminds me of my youth.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|This was recommended due to another purchase I made, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how fantastic it sounds.  Van Morrison still has a great voice and the musicians are top notch.  Is more on the &#34;jazz&#34; side of the music spectrum (which I like) - but I thought I would mention it for those thinking of obtaining it.  The name of the album/cd also says it all.
B001ANYDAO|2.0|The blurb for the book says, &#34;In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of &#34;outliers&#34;.&#34;<br /><br />'Stunning' isn't the word I would have picked, unless an ox is somehow involved. The guy's a good writer. But an interview I saw (Colbert) confirmed my suspicion that he takes huge enjoyment in jerking us around.<br />Of course, maybe I'm just jealous that 'tipping point' is on the lips of every brain-dead commentator. A simple idea, straight out of Statistics 1, surrounded by 200 pages of breathless hyperbole. Outliers seems to follow that model.<br /><br />So, OK, I get it. Canadian hockey players excel because ... Wait a minute, they're not outliers at all ... they're members of a small, well-defined group. And all that business of why the Beatles got 'so good' Hours and hours of playing?? The songs had nothing to do with it right? Isaac Stern got good at playing the fiddle by hours and hours of practice, but anyone that's picked up an instrument knows that it takes practice, a lot of talent, and some soul to play well.<br /><br />Oh well, presumably Gladwell will continue quite successfully to blow warm wind, with a whiff of science, up our skirts.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|I purchased this to install on my son's Nabi 2 tablet.  It installed easily and works great to shut down all open apps!
B00AGE20ZI|4.0|A standard for us at holiday time. Cary Grant and David Niven are fabulous as always. The boys choir scene was especially moving for me.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Easy to use and very quiet for quality recording.  I have purchased many Behringer products and this one fits the bill.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I am enjoying the Album, you can see where MJ is a huge influence on his music.. Like it more each time I listen to it.
B009B51K9U|4.0|I love Green Day since the first album way back when. I enjoy hearing them evolve into a different sound with each new album. Sadly, I purchased this album through a deal on their website and it didn't label it as edited. Other than that, it's awesome.
B00581BQG8|5.0|Makes you laugh over and over again. Bathroom humor at times, but definitely worth watching at least once. Great movie.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|WRONG PRODUCT - KEPT IT.Great price, fast shipping, just what I wanted.<br />Not much more to say great item, and works great.<br />would buy again
0375703764|4.0|One thing I will say about House of Leaves: it's ambitious in its experimentation. Maybe too much. It has a unique quality, is different than anything I've ever read, or ever will read. It's also a difficult book to put in one genre because it has many elements: it has horror, a bit of humor and satire, erudition, research and footnoting, has building suspense and elements of the supernatural, contains a romantic story, has shifts in time, place and narrative, and skews the line between reality and illusion. It's structure that not only moves from different vantage points of narrator and time, but also forces you to turn the book upside down and sideways to read, flip to the appendices at the end of the book, and puzzle over ambiguous clues. In many ways, the narrative flow of the book mirrors what takes place. In short, this is one bizarre, but entertaining read.<br /><br />There are several focuses in House of Leaves. We learn of a mysterious Navidson Record from one of the narrators, Johnny Truant, an aimless, slacker type, a bit of an unreliable narrator because of his reckless, wild, and somewhat erratic state of mind. The Navidson Record, discovered in an apartment that Johnny is renting, is an account of a perplexing documentary of the Navidson family, whose home is the basis of some bizarre happenings. The Navidson's home has a mysterious space where there was once a wall. As Will Navidson begins to explore and discover this, this odd phenomenon takes on a life of its own (in both the story and the pages), and becomes the source of inquiry from Navidson and a few others. This account is all documented extensively in research that is included in Zampano's manuscript, which is a source of Johnny's narrative. The new dimensions of the home, and the subsequent explorations that take place, have an emotional and physical toll on those who are involved. As Truant gets further and further into the details of this manuscript, he also details his own instabilities--past and present-- and the many issues he deals with: delusions, drug abuse, depression, alienation. Within the framework of the narrative, we have details told from Johnny's point of view, but also from Zampano's document. There are also letter from Johnny's mother as well as interviews about the infamous house and the Navidson Record. At many points, things become a little muddled as we try to put many of the pieces of this account together; we are even sent on an occasional wild goose chase moving back and forth through the book.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this can be classified as pure fiction or literature, as there is a certain level of artistic quality (some may see this as gimmickry) that overrides aspect of the plot. I'll admit that I was a bit annoyed at points, especially with all the erudition and overblown research that had me using more than one bookmark while reading, flipping back and forth from narrative to appendix.<br /><br />Still, though, somehow this all is fitting and appropriate for House of Leaves. In House of Leaves, format is as important as its story, and both are reflective of each other.<br /><br />What the author does exceptionally well is make all aspects of the novel work, both the structure and mutli-layered storylines.  Another positive is simply the level of mystery involved that we have to carefully follow--the author is adept at withholding key revelations.<br /><br />For sheer inventiveness and creativity, House of Leaves is an interesting read, one that will make you think (sometimes too much). Ultimately, House of Leaves has many levels of storytelling and is very experimental. In the end, I found the payoff to this bizarre, poetic, inventive ride to be a rewarding one.ast and present-- and the many issues he deals with: delusions, drug abuse, depression, alienation.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it was the best app I ever got and It was free! also I heard other people talk about it that made me want it but it was only in the apple app store so I waited like five months for it and espesially for kindle user's.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|excellent , just like the show is.<br />all the songs are god not just a few<br />i highly recommend it
B0027BVMSY|3.0|as the embodiment of his creation. However, I'm not so certain that he'd be thrilled with some of the ongoing adventures penned and produced by others that have crossed from the sublime well into the ridiculous. Great escape viewing but there was about as much believable action here as in the Marvel Comics films of today. Perhaps the Brocolli family can enlist Stan Lee for their next adventure.
B008J34466|4.0|The new Pink album \\"The Truth About Love\\" is a funhouse of pure pop with a streak of sourness to it, Think Katy Perry's potty-mouthed sister, or maybe Joan Jett with considerably less attitude. Every song is a hookfilled manifesto that ruins its chance for mass appeal airplay without some serious re-work. Even the first single (\\"Blow Me One Last Kiss\\") had to get some substantial rerecording before it was ready for the radio. If you're adult enough to handle it, fine, but Mommy and Daddy might be disappointing if the kiddies get this version.<br /><br />For the discerning pop ears, however, Pink still can't kick those pop-diva thrills. \\"Try\\" is a song of getting back up when life has you down, and the defiant \\"The Great Escape.\\" The guests line up, like Lily Allen on the sarcastic \\"True Love\\" or Eminem on \\"Here Comes The Weekend.\\" Best is the intimate duet with Nate Ruess of .Fun on \\"Just Give Me a Reason.\\" Pink can hold her own with all the friends that came on board, but she's just as excitable on party tracks as \\"Slut Like You\\" or the deceptively perky cautionary tale \\"Walk Of Shame.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Truth About Love\\" is state of the art modern pop. Machine ready songwriting (on which Pink shares most of the credits) and sweet/sour disposition that reflects on modern relationships without getting too serious about it. Don't think too hard about it and you'll be rewarded. Overthink it and you'll miss the point; this is candyfloss with a sourball tucked in the middle. Let the sugar give you a buzz.
B001BANK32|5.0|Much better than the movie.  As usual Stephen King does a masterful job at pulling you in and then scaring the living daylights out of you.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Playback was slower and more laggy then the native pictures/video app that came with Kindle Fire. I do not reccomend this app.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|This movie is Seth McFarlane having fun with levels of raunchiness that he can't get away with on TV.  Sometimes that leads to hilarity, sometimes it just gets old.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is a lot of fun!!! Who could ask for more from a free game.  Kids really like it!

B009GN6DT4|1.0|There is sound distortion.The picture is distored and it is hard here it. Therefore it makes for a bad entertainment
B0053IOZBE|5.0|I bought this for my ten year old daughter and she loved it.  It is age apppropriate and the entire family enjoys it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I got this movie on Amazon because I had heard this is a really good comedy.  I tend to like Seth Macfarlane's output. I had high hopes and this movie didn't exactly meet them.  It wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />I liked this film really explored having a live talking teddy bear in the film.  Many comedy films so unconcerned with their underlying fantastical premises that it's weird to see a movie where the screenwriters obviously had at least a fifteen or twenty minute discussion about it.<br /><br />Still, I wish it had been a funnier movie but it's still plenty funny and a good movie to watch after work.  Look, you know what you're getting into if you watch this movie you watched the same billion trailers I did back when it came out.  Just rent it or don't.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read, recommend this to everyone who liked the Grry's series. Can't wait for the next book to come out
B0064NTZKI|5.0|Hi Folks,<br /><br />enough has been said about this superlative work on Woody Allen and I wanted to weigh in to say if you want it on Blu Ray amazon UK has it and its region free. I just had my copy delivered and it works fine over here and it also has several splendid bonus features so If you want to know how to make a five star documentary even better.... there you go.  The bonus feature of Woody's trip to Brooklyn merited the purchase alone!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|As long as you are not easily offended and are able to view a book as a whole instead of based upon a few scenes that may offend a more conservative reader's delicate sensibilities, you will enjoy this series. You also need to be able to scan through some of the initial financial journalism explanations which are, admittedly, boring. The series as a whole is worth reading, especially since it is different from any other series. For those of you who are insatiable readers, you know that most books are strikingly similar to each other; this series is not.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Christmas gift for my wife. Know she will be very happy of the DVD. Think she love him more than me. Ho ho ho.

030758836X|2.0|I had put this on HOLD at local library when it first came out but with all the \\"hype\\" - I decided I would purchase it.  I should have waited for it to come in at the library!<br /><br />It has taken me over 2 months to finish the book.  In the meantime I have read 3 other books that were much more interesting.  Gone Girl just seemed soooooo long and drawn out - especially during the \\"first days\\" of missing.  Then toward the end the time frame jumped into weeks - which the whole book should have been.  Are there really people like this?????  Yes, there are people like this but it is so sad.

B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great extension of Bourne series. Excellent movie. Jeremy Renner was great. Jeremy Renner was awesome. He rocked it. Is that enough words.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This movie was pretty boring-watching the action scenes reminded me of watching a video game when someone else is playing it. The characters were pretty unconvincing and there was a bit of over-acting by Kate & Collin. Definitely a made for cable movie.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Tried with adults and kids but the system does not get the outlines of the players. So it's doing something now, gathering dust next to my normal clean kinect sensor.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|Like this game. Fun to play when you want something  mindless to do. Kind of relaxing. Doesnt require deep thoughts.
B009329ZF2|1.0|GUESS THE ALIENS NEEDED GLASSES . CUZ THEY COULDN'T HIT THE SIDE OF A BARN IF THEY WERE STANDING NEXT TO IT .
B000JQUKKU|5.0|So glad I read it again. Christmas hope, renewed. Dickens was marvelous. So much imagination in one little story. Now I plan to read his other Christmas stories.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark Arcana is a blast. Graphics are great, storyline fun. Puzzles are challenging. HO scenes are easy and few in number, but I have never been a HOG fan. The monkey is a great idea.<br /><br />I did have technical problems which did not allow the game to load in the middle of the game, but once I contacted G5 tech support,  they replied within a day.<br />I would have given it 5 stars if not for that one issue.<br /><br />overall,  I love this game and look forward to more!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|So much potential wasted as characters and story line disappoint all the way to an ending that should have been rewritten.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is a strange, but thoroughly entertaining show. An unpredictable, wild ride from start to finish. I love it!<br /><br />Julie Foltz
B004XVN1T4|5.0|A very good book as usual from Ken Follett.  Held my interest from start to finish.  very factual about this area.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Just like the first one, it's totally unbelievable and the action scenes are totally overdone and hard to believe, but its all about seeing all the guys together in one movie.  It's like you take all the hard to believe parts from each of their movies, and when you combine all of that together will all the actors, it just gets super-hard to believe, but they make light of famous lines each of them have in the their movies and it ends up being fun still.  I'm not sorry I rented it, but its more of a guy-comedy than a true action adventure.  Good times.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The story is taken to new levels as the characters evolve as tensions in the district rise ending in a dramatic rescue from an even deadlier game.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it's a great book. I would recommend to anyone trying to read a good mystery book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Taking the family through the War to End All Wars and the consequences of their choices over time was fascinating.  As usual, beautifully acted, magnificently staged and gripping to the last minute.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is a great read.  Gives some insight to life in Afghanistan and the plight of women in this country.  An important book, I think.
B00000634J|5.0|nice product, delivery was fast, I like the CD, music is nice and heart fulfilling, it is as described, I recommend this product
B000AGTPUK|4.0|My 2 year old niece and I enjoy this movie.  It's magical, fun and of course, it has Santa Clause.  I like this story because it actually has a good plot to it.  It teaches kids lessons about what Christmas is all about without the mention of Christianity.  I'm Catholic but my sister (niece's mother) is no longer religious.  So this movie helps because it's teaching my niece to be caring, respectful, \\"good,\\" and most of all, that Christmas is a time of love, family and magic.<br /><br />Polar Express is motion pictured COMPUTER animated (different than pixel).  But I think that this gives the movie a dream-like state and really able to give nice colorful imagery.  I'm not sue how accurate this is to the children's book (getting that through Amazon - expected in fed-ex on 12-19).<br /><br />The characters are very entertaining and helpful to teaching kids about bravery (hero boy), manners (protagonist girl), shyness (Billy), and to not be such a know-it-all. Also the girl helps teach kids the true meaning of Christmas Spirit.  The plot is about the hero boy who questions whether Santa Clause is real (nothing else religiously).  He wants to see for his own eyes this Santa.  And after he falls asleep, the Polar Express Train arrives to take him to the North Pole and Santa's Village.<br /><br />My 2 year old loves the train when it arrives in front of the boy's house.  She enjoys the boy's journey on the train, as well as his new friends.<br /><br />She's not so keen on scenes that introduce the hobo.  And there are some parts where the hero boy seems like he's in danger (she says \\"Oh no. Oh..\\").  So to my young niece's perspective, there was some scarry scenes.  But I assure her that the boy is brave and that he can do it.  I felt that the hint that this was a dream was too small.  I liked that hero boy answered that it didn't matter that it was a dream.  But we don't really get that dream acknowledged in the beginning.  It might have helped a little.<br /><br />The 2 year Old's favorite part is of course Santa.  There are times where she'll actually cheer along.<br /><br />I enjoy the whole movie and I recommend this for the Christmas Spirit Cheer.year Old's favorite part is of course Santa.  There are times where she'll actually cheer along.<br /><br />I enjoy the whole movie and I recommend this for the Christmas Spirit Cheer.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book.  It's the story of how someone grows up with no understanding of what it means to love someone, and how she learns to love.  Great
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible download.  You can listen to it on the Kindle and I do every night before I go to sleep.  There are so many variations and options with this download.  I love it!
B008476HBM|3.0|The plot is good...but they don't tell you what each character is thinking, the don't give you an insight into each person real personality
B000002OTL|5.0|Great tunes, especially the surf tunes! It is a great move too! Tarentino's movies are the bomb! Buy or Rent them!
0756666937|5.0|Ordered these for my grandson for his fifth birthday and he was so thrilled. It was a hit !  YEAH !
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was an amazing book. I truly loved it! I would recommend this book to everyone I know. Beautifully written.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Always and forever a good read! I have read this many times and always enjoy it...everyone should read this every year
B001PNHI88|5.0|My grandparents owned this. I love listening to this and remembering listening in their old house. Good album for meditation and relaxing.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I always love Taylor Swift.  There are two songs, I don't like, but the rest make it all worth it!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Another great tale of Harry Bosch.  Harry's character remains as dogged as ever in his pursuit of justice.  Great read.
B00005LOUS|4.0|I got the movie in good order and quick, But, I did not readily see that is was VHS and not a DVD. That information needs to be on the the very beginning of the information about the movie. Other than that, I was satisfied.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|The first transformers movie will always be the best one, and its just ok.  The movies too long jumping back and forth, very poorly constructed.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I love thes kind of movies;  just like wondering what's next and how it's going to end.  Just what I expected.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a great book. It really gives you a fill for what the governments would do if something like this would happen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While a reader of YA, I am by no means a young adult now, being in my mid-fifties.  This book does so much with so little.  Spare, clear writing.  It wasn't until I'd read it the third time that I realized it was written in present tense. I doubt the major premise, that humans would let children be taken and killed in this way, but it is metaphoric in that we =do= let children be taken by hunger, disease, and other kinds of violence.<br /><br />I have purchased the sequels but I'm reluctant to proceed, concerned they won't be as good as the first.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This was a sad legacy for the Bourne series.  The action was mediocre, and the ending left a lot to be desired.  I give it about 2.5 stars....
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It is appropriate for younger audiences which is important. I don't like violent movies.  So that my grandchildren can watch my movies.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I have used this app many times.  Sometimes when it comes to balancing the check book.  The numbers are large and clear.
B000S88JTS|5.0|Motorcycle enthusiasts, hard core bikers and even those with only a passing interest in bikes will appreciate this DVD. Especially loved the bonus features with Steve McQueen on the making of the movie. Fascinating and fun.
B009O2XY12|1.0|You can only play for a very short time before you have to pay to continue.  Don't offer a free app that is not free.
B009YU62H2|3.0|You will enjoy this album more if you forget that it is Soundgarden. They have grown as people and as artists.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Possibly John Grisham's best book yet!  The first half of the book was the setup and the second half was the action.  I never had it figured out.  Great ending.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game will keep you occupied. Cute story line. Well use a lot of battery life. I recommend this game. This company has similar games
B0011EU0NG|5.0|i would recommend this movie to everyone. it is as good and funny as I remembered it. Dick Van Dyke is so great.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great story and animation is completely uncanny. We have never seen anything like this before in a Disney style film.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|The record came with a MP3 download card and an extra 45. The vinyl is in perfect shape, sounds better then MP3,  looks like a big black thin Frisbee.. So if you hate the music, I bet it would still be fun in the backyard!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was a great movie... really unsure why some people are saying it's not good. It does start out slower but I think it was necessary to set the scene and understand what was coming next. The back half is all action and it's pretty darn good. They should be able to build on this new character for a couple more films; Jeremy makes a good spy.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The tiles are a bit small for my old eyes, but love doing the problem solving.  The tile designs are so similar it makes the game challenging.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book wasn't anything I thought it would be but I really enjoyed reading.  It was a real page turner and quite a surprise twist near the ending.  Very well written.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|All the grooves worked, right out of the box! :-p<br /><br />Side 2 is better for me then Side 1 .. umm what else to say? It's really round.. fashionable in black.. if you look at a spot on the record as it goes around, you may get dizzy.. Came w/ MP3 download card++
B0090O07S2|4.0|I saw the DOOR's Twice in my early years, and this video show the crazy-burned out JIM as he was, plus some good music
B009VYF5E2|2.0|I really enjoy Season 1 & 2, and believe they are a must own. Unfortunately, the progression of these characters are really not going anywhere. It feels like at this point now, they are trying to reinvent the wheel so much, that the legend everyone is so familiar with, now seems stale and less magical.<br /><br />If they just side a little more towards the original legend or write some better material, I don't see the show progressing well.<br /><br />Sorry, but sadly true :(
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed the main character and the need to get back at those who didn't believe him.  We always assume that prisoners get what they deserve but that is not always the case.  John Grisham is wonderful at spinning legal thrillers and this is no exception.  GinnieLee
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. While I wasn't riveted to find out what would happen, it held my interest and I enjoyed the ending. Sylvia is an excellent writer.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I love Bosch and have read all. This, however, is not one of my favorites. Doesn't have the Bosch humor and it moves slowly at ties. I miss the older characters - especially the in fighting with Chiefs and Councilmen.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|My HP Photosmart printer to too old.  The problem was how difficult ti was to find a list of printer models that this AP will work with.  The list of printers should be up front and very easy to find but it took real searching.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Enjoyed the way Sylvia Day developed her characters and the depth she gave them.  Couldn't wait to find out what was coming on the next page with Gideon and Eva.  Looking forward to Entwined With You and sorry it won't be out until May.
0060989157|5.0|I wouldn't say I loved this book - it seems wrong to love it - but, it was a total page turner. I never have considered myself prude, but these boys make me look like a nun. Jaw-dropping. Excellent writing. I couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just my kind of suspense. Couldn't put it down and the pages just kept turning. This book will not disappoint.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Amazing sets, love it. been a lego fan since I was 7 and this set hits home. vintage and modern and still not sure if i want my three boys to play with it!
B007SGM084|4.0|I am still working on reading the first book but i have really enjoyed having this bundle. I really liked the price for all three books and the convenience of them being on my kindle.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A really good read for this new line and quite funny as well.  hope the other titles are just as good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know lots of people love this book series, but I honestly could not make it half way through the first book. Just seems like garbage to me, but obviously I am the minority considering these books have been such a success. Just don't see what everyone else does.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Stumbled on this when I had a weekend to kill on a business trip to Melbourne, Australia.  I hadn't heard of it, but I absolutely loved it, the way they handle flashbacks to his childhood, the charm of the vineyard in France, the music and his gorgeous leading lady.  Also, as I think back, they have assembled some truly great voices (how often do you notice that?) in this cast, with Albert Finney leading the way.  Critics trashed Crowe trying to do comedic scenes, but I thought he pulled them off well.  Besides, this movie has little to do with Crowe doing comedy.  It is a very, very, very good \\"feel good\\" love story interlaced with a person changing for the better.  You leave the theater feeling great and wanting wine.  Win-Win.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Hey yay yay yah! Great singing, great energy, pretty cool movie. Good cast, and good story line, simple n catchy.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|This is truly a classic. It doesn't matter how old or young you are this is a great movie all will enjoy.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I not only have seen the series videos but have read 4 of the book.  Very interesting and you can't stop watching and reading, to see what will happen next.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|You can't help but sing along with all the songs and it brings back so many memories. Should bring joy to anyone who lived through the 80s.
B0013KTGAG|3.0|It is worth the rent when there is no football on TV. The acting is better than the plot so just go with it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|By far one of Will Ferrell's best movies! You will never stop laughing and it never gets slow. It is a very well written movie with a heart warming ending.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a tale!  I could not hardly stop reading it once I started reading this book.  A very interest fast read.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|The movie was in great shape and shipped well.  I really hope that my friend enjoys it as an xmas gift.  I wished it was gift wrapped.
B009ZM7BEC|5.0|This is a great movie perfectly suitable for the entire family.  I like that it shows the progression of technology over the years as well as the attitudes regarding Christmas
B009SQRL4U|5.0|A great movie! My 6-year old daughter loves this movie and can watch over it even when it is not Christmas time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Now I can use this app anytime without having to have a table to lay out the card.  I play it on my pad without wasting time setting things up.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Great shape.  This movie is hilarious.  I recommend it for anyone - adult or child.  Will Farrell does a great job being a dorky villain.
B0086700CM|4.0|Kids  like it fine. I didn't load it for myself. Kids like it fine, I didn't load it for myself.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love it my son who I got it for loves it awesome fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It is quick to find books of the Bible, chapter and verse.  A great help when following along in church worship.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Having read Born to Run, tried barefoot running, and heard of Scott Jurek for years, it was fascinating to get inside his head for feats of endurance I can't imagine.  I had trouble sleeping at night after reading, the descriptions of his runs sending my heart racing as well.  I made a few of his recipies, and he has turned me on to vegetarianism and even veganism.  But not ultras.  Yet.<br /><br />But seeing the damage his obsession causes to his personal, physical, and professional life, he never really answers the question that runs through your mind through the book: Why?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This Grisham was a little different, written in first person.  A few twists kept me turning the page.  I never knew until the end what would happen.  The ending, to me, was satisfying.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|One of the greatest family films I've ever seen; there are few, if any, movies left that have no questionable content and also promote a faith in God without being overtly religious or trying to push an agenda of specific beliefs on those who watch it. Its core message simply reminds us of what our nation was originally founded upon and helps us to put Christmas into the right perspective.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|For those who grew up in the eighties as big fans of Duran Duran, you will enjoy this book.  It lends a personal side to fame and shows in places the emptiness that can come with all the glamour.  I would have enjoyed a bit more detail into the conflicts among the band members, but to John Taylor's credit, he was discreet and unwilling to share what, frankly, is none of my business.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The fact that they had to use the &#34;pills&#34; to enhance the subjects was lame.  Other than that thought the movie was ok until the ending which sunk it for me.  How do you activate the guy from the Larx program and the don't even have a badass fight?  The girl kicked him off his motorcycle!  Really?!? Disappointed!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love the gradual increase in volume with the snooze alarm feature...wakes you up softly not abruptly like most alarm clocks. It makes waking up that much more easy. (I didnt say easy)
B002R27J1W|5.0|This is a true thriller - one that thrills the viewer through good acting, a superb plot, and dramatic screenplay, which is what many suspense &#34;thrillers&#34; today are missing, merely substituting them with special effects...Hepburn is incredible, and so are the villains. I'd recommend this to anyone who appreciates old-time, true cinematic quality!
B000YHG72E|3.0|I heard lots of people talking about this movie and finally rented and watched it.  It wasn't as funny as anticipated, but it was good enough to rent and watch!
B003NTSBUG|4.0|What starts out as a typical crime investigation turns into a maze of confusion and cover-up. The movie pulls you into a sane person's outlook of a standard crime scene and then shatters all concepts of what sanity is through the eyes of the insane.
B000001ELR|2.0|I CANT REALLY COMMENT ON THIS RERCORDING BECAUSE WHEN I RECIEVED IT ALL IT DID WAS SKIP ALL OVER THE PLACE I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED BECAUSE I HAD THIS ON VINYL AND LOVED IT! I GUESS I HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT AGAIN.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|interesting thinking game.  but can be rather irritating too. very addicting and i have to force myself to quit or run out of battery power.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|MIB 3 was very good.  It was better than the second and a good way to end the series.  It gave some good background information that helped to understand the story of both Agent J & Agent K.  Good stuff!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The Heist is a great culmination of Macklemore and Ryan Lewsis' work in the Seattle Hip Hop scene.  Its nice to see that people with real talent are finally being rewarded in an industry and genre that seem to mainly promote the people that don't have it.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I enjoy all the Christmas movies that Hallmark has shown since November 9.<br />This version of Miracle on 34th Street was great.  I love the original Miracle on 34th Street with Edwin Gwen'<br />that was great too.  I don't think the two should be compared, because each of the<br />Santa's were sooo believable,  and the two little girls were marvelous.  If you have<br />a child who is wondering about Santa Claus, this movie might help him/her to give<br />Santa, the benefit of the doubt.<br />I heartily recommend watching the Miracle on 34th Street.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I love Family Guy and American Dad so my expectations for this movie were very high.  I guess I expected more than a movie about smoking pot and being irresponsible.  There were some good moments but in general I was very disappointed.  I rented the movie, via streaming, with the intention of watching it more than once during the rental period but ultimately I had difficulty getting through it one time.  Although the main characters had some good characteristics, I was generally unimpressed with them.  They seemed very basic and undeveloped and not entirely likable.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This series is fantastic.  I am totally addicted to Supernatural!  There are so many good actors in this series, I can't decide who is my favorite
B009FZHYKU|5.0|hurry up and show more . Can't wait to see what happens next, Great action and suspense each week it is on.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is an eye opener and turns nearly all my previously learned facts on nutrition upside down ..... if we  deny scientific evidence then we will never learn!
B00AE2J93I|5.0|I really enjoyed this hybrid animation/movie.  It was fully of funny quips and had an overall solid message for the younger viewers with out being too boring for the older kids.  My only beef and perhaps this is because I got the HD version, but it wasn't full screen which bummed  me out a bit, but I still would recommend!
159562015X|5.0|I bought one for each of my team members at work, and we all found it interesting and insightful. Sure, maybe it's like horoscopes and everyone can read something they believe - but in this case, the 2.0 version weights the top 5 strengths somehow, so the combination of your own top 5 seems to lead to a different descriptor than others with only one of them. Anyway, however it works, it is a great tool for team building at a FAR cheaper cost than other assessments such as MBTI / Myers Briggs, Birkman, etc.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This was not at all what it was cracked up to be. The villian, especially when compared with the Joker, was just not very dislikable. Sure he was evil but he didn't really get under your skin and make you wanna see him die. Plus the way his voice sounded made him seem like an idiot with headgear.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because Tim Burton and his wild imagination are highly entertaining.<br />Such a different twist to Christmas Movies! :)
B0095R64AO|2.0|I can say for 100% certainty what I was expecting when I chose this one, but I found myself a little annoyed going round and round with the plot.  it felt just a bit like they needed to stretch it out so they kept painstakingly adding more dramatics.  the end was cute and very welcome.  subtle hints of funny, but the majority is a bit challenging to watch.
B009S33I68|5.0|This is the battle that changed the way the Army used the helicopter forever and helped in the process save a lot of lives.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|A true holiday classic along with &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;.  Watch the original black and white version.  The colorized version is odd looking.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|I am unsure of exactly how good this DVD is yet, as I have bought it for my 2 sons (age 7 & 9) for Christmas...They have yet to open and watch it! I do imagine that they will love it though...
B0081L391C|4.0|I actually purchased this one I liked it so much.  I've watched it several times just for the laughs.  It's MUCH funnier than you anticipate if you are on the fence for watching.  It's good mindless entertainment.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|You quickly learn to love these characters and how their lives are entwined. A must read for history buffs looking for that personal connection.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is the best it is there when you need it .Great when you travel.you can work with your bills. the large numbers are great.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I am unsure of exactly how good this DVD is yet, as I have bought it for my 2 sons (age 7 & 9) for Christmas...They have yet to open and watch it! I do imagine that they will love it though...
B00846REIS|5.0|both books are super, compairable to fifty shades. i can not wait for the last one to come out, when is that by the way!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|With the original illustrations, this a thoroughly delightful edition.<br /><br />I make the habit of reading A Christmas Carol every year and from now on, this will be the edition for which I reach.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Great entertainment for the family movie night or to watch over and over again...because you have always been a fan of Iron Man.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|The product arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the quality of the DVD itself was simply fantastic. Zero regrets.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the books, great story line i can not wait until the last one is released! I could not put them down.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I was not expecting this to be so good, but it is. Thomas Newman brought back the music we've been missing since Sean Connery's, Moore's and Dalton's Bond. It really gave it a classic feel right from the very first track with a blast of horns.  Such a great soundtrack. Thomas Newman, well done.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This movie had it's highs and lows but enjoyable...at times it brings other moives to mind! Makes you wonder, what?
B000YHG72E|3.0|I love the movie!!  We've owned it for a while and I purchased this as a gift.  Definitely a must see - a personal favorite of mine, even if its not Christmas time!<br /><br />My complaint was that it was shipped in a plain envelope and the DVD case was bent in the process of shipping.  I haven't unwrapped the DVD so I assume the disk isn't broken, but it should have been shipped in a small box or with padding surrounding the DVD.  Amazon should know better than to ship something without proper protection during shipment.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This is one movie worth buying. In fact all of his movies are a fun roller coaster ride. I will rent this movie again.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Very long, less funny, episode of family guy. Boring. Predictable. Ted sounds just like Peter griffin. I fell asleep. Had potential, didn't meet the hype
B003UESJHY|3.0|I think Christain Bale did a really good job getting into this role...the content shows the struggles of addictions and hope.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this movie a week before it came out because I won advance screening tickets and I have known the song I Dreamed A Dream my whole life but I have never seen the musical on stage or any of the adaptations before. I went into this with no expectations at all. At first I thought the movie started off kind of fragmented and I figured because it had to introduce everybody and I was right. The film ended up as it went on drawing me in more and more and making me fall in love with it and by the end i was mesmerized with how wonderful and amazing the movie is. I believe they picked perfect roles because after i saw the movie i listened to the broadway soundtrack and i believe they did very well on picking out the cast for their vocal ranges and capabilities. I think anyone who loves the musical or is a musical person should definatly see this movie because they will not be disappointed one bit by how amazing it is.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Greatest adventure ever.  This one is an instant classic that the kids ( and adults ) will be enjoying until the end of time.  Spielberg and Donnor knock it out of the park.<br /><br />Watch out for Booty Twaps !
B004W2UBYW|5.0|5 stars! It exceed my expectations.<br />It's by far the best and most complete biography of Steve Jobs that I've read so far.<br />I highly recommend it.
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book so much that I've read it multiple times. The mystery is intriguing and the characters are well developed and realistic enough to make you almost wish that wiches, vampires, and daemons actually exist.Definitely leaves you wanting more.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|always on the edge of your seat. The anticipation will keep you up all nite watching episode after episode. Dexter is my favorite show as I am awaiting season for season 7 to be available on digital format!!
0316228532|5.0|bought this book after watching the JK Rowling based on reality movie. Have not read it because it seems so far off from magic and Harry Potter. Wish it was based on a distant aunt of Harry Potter having tea with her friends. Dony=t quite see how this is a book with the same passion as Harry Potter. Not super interesting even from the cover but maybe I was expecting magic?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun to play.  Everyone can play, toddlers and senior' s like me!  Six year old grandson has been playing for awhile so he was excited about teaching me how to play.
1423140605|5.0|I really enjoyed the Percy Jackson series, both for myself and to read to my children, so I was very happy that Rick Riordan continued writing about Percy and his fellow demi-gods. These books are a wonderful way to introduce Greek and Roman mythology to children. I love the humor involved as well as the adventure/drama. I grab these books as soon as they come out and always want more once I've finished. Even though my kids are 12 & 9, and can and do read the books themselves, I still read to them at bedtime. And I'm glad they enjoy these books as much as I do. Please keep writing Mr. Riordan!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Some good acting, but the script wanders off into the deep blue sea. Lost in the storm. A waste of money to rent.
B003DCPGNS|1.0|I like Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. However this movie is silly and boring.  The reason I rented was because in the mood for a screw ball comedy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The &#34;human reaction&#34; to the unusual is common to all. Getting past the unusual to the person is not always easy. Moving beyond your reaction is presented from several points of view in this wonderful book. It is a young adult book that pertains to all. A must read!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Just learning to play Chess this has been a helpful tool. I play this quite often. My son is a experienced player and he also enjoys it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Every single song is great! Favorite song is Ghost Who Knew. I knew I had to buy the album when I heard them on SNL playing I will wait.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|What a bore!  I thought I was back in 1980!  Plenty of hard bodies if that's all your looking for, but otherwise, don't waste your time!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|When usign my Kindle devices, I was constantly checking the level of the battery by doing a three or four step process.  This was slow and and took more time than I wanted to devote to it.  With this app, I can quickly check the battery life on any of my Fires or Kindle tablets but it also tells me how long it will take to recharge to 100%, how much time before I run out of battery if I am playing a 2D game or 3D game, listening to music, reading a book etc.  This is all done quickly and easily.  Just a great tool.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's a controller, so not much to say.  Same as one that came with PS3...nice to have a second controller for back-up/multiplayer games.  Wireless function works very well.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Haven't read through it all yet, but so far, I can't leave it.<br />I guess everyone who appreciates pure writing work should read it.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|great movie for the kids and family. They loved it and it was fun for my wife and I as well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is by far one of the best books ive read in a while. Filled with great emotion, i couldn't ask for more.
B004A8ZWWY|5.0|Got this on a steal (thanks Amazon) so it was a good movie to pick up...not one of my top films, but it is a fun one to pass the time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My children have also gotten this. There are so many, many aids  in this Bible, sound where you can learn to say the names, where it will read it to you. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL WHO SINCERELY WANT TO LEARN
B004EKCNMA|4.0|Great move but it may be a bit much for some of the younger kids. But for adults its a great movie!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Thoroughly delightful. . .At first I couldn't see what about a raindrops could possibly hold the interest of oh so many people.  But after playing it for only 20 minutes I was hooked!  Great game and totally addictive.  If you don't already have it; get it.  You'll be glad you did.
111846446X|5.0|I am very pleased to have a copy of this book. My copy is on a Kindle but ordered one for my grandson that is just getting started with a unit as well. Easy to read, well organized and great index. Good basic instructions.
1451688091|5.0|the book was well researched and concise.  the info was interesting and often was new to me.  I highly reccommend it.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|I guess I should have read the reviews before getting it for my preschooler. It's more for older babies/toddlers as it is too easy for my son who is almost 5 yrs old.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This movie was a Christmas gift for someone who likes this movie. It came in good condition as far as I can tell.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I wasn't sure about this one when i picked it up. The premise seemed a bit far-fetched. But I fell in love with the characters. Also there's a lot of 'guy thinking' in here that (as a guy who reads romance) I could identify with.
B000IZA9PI|3.0|Unlike the other Patrick Stewart Star Trek movies, this movie has the most coherent theme. It, however, fails to penetrate beyond a superficial exploration of the real final frontier, &#34;self-knowledge.&#34; The movie focuses more on absurd twists and badly done fight sequences than on depth of character and sincere emotion.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is an excellent show, watched both the first two seasons in two days. If you are a Hobbit fan and Trek fan, its a must see.
B005APT8A8|5.0|For those not familiar with most of The Byrds catalog, they are like The Beatles whipped up with a little Beach Boys and some Eagles thrown in.  A group that was very sadly underrated and underplayed in their time.  That said they never copied anyone, but were their own genre.  Their problem was that they would have success and then totally change gears.  Kind of like if the Beatles went from Rubber Soul to The White Album with no breaks and then went back to Revolver and then to Abbey Road.  But a Great band and for the price you can't go wrong.
B000OV85AW|5.0|I've watched quite a few movies from Steve Mcqueen and this by far is my favorite ! A+++. You will not regret it. Great film.
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|this was a great movie for adults and kids. It was great to rent on amazon prime and stream right to our tv at home via our sony blue ray player.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Lots of twists and turns.  Easy read and pretty easy to follow the story line.  Looking forward to next book.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was kind of similar to Fifty Shades of Grey...but it definitely kept my attention!  Is there a sequel??
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I love Green Day, the best band since 1990<br /><br />Thank you for sending me this album in good condition. Thank you
B009JBZH54|5.0|I could not wait to add this movie collection to my library.  It did not fail to be exactly what was expected.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This novel will hold you glued to the pages until the very unpredictable end.  And then you wonder: how could it end this way.  But that is the genius of Lee Child.  Jack Reacher, the hero, does the &#34;impossible&#34;.  And it is a great read
B004GYY714|5.0|I love it !! Really can't complain as a free ware , great product and I will tell my friends to get it !!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Just finished the first season, amazing!  Well written and acted out.  The cast is perfect for their roles and we're keeping up with Season 2. Now we can't wait for Season 3, addicting!  We even have a Wed night party every week and watch the new episodes out, I'm not joking.  The best series out since the Sopranos!
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loved fifty shades of gray. Loved the characters and their story.  Definitely worth reading
1451620829|3.0|He is pissed off with Paul, Gene, Ace, Eric Singer, Tommy, and Doc.  Damn, he just survived breast cancer now, he needs to get anger management.  I can understand his discontent with Paul, Gene, ands Doc but, Ace?  All in all, it is an entertaining read.  I just did not like the mud slinging.  Such a shame.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Bosch connects with the dead and brings justice once again.  Another suspenseful thrilling hunt. You can't put this bookto down. When you get to the end you still want more.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Initially I was surprised to see that Anker had entered the gaming mouse industry, as they seem to be more of a peripheral company. However, I was quickly surprised at the quality of the mouse at it's price point. The build quality is up to par with other manufacturers, it has features that I've only seen on the very high end Logitech and Razer mice, and to top it all off, a surprisingly good software package.<br /><br />The Packaging:<br />You'll receive a fairly standard blue box with the mouse itself placed between layers of plastic, and the braided thick USB cable tied in the back. (Previous Razer customers will notice the similarity to the packaging on their mice.) Behind all of that you'll find the documentation as a silver tube with the weights inside it. (More on that in a bit.) Please note that it doesn't include a disc with the software on it, you'll need to go to Anker's website to download that. Overall it's fine packaging that keeps the mouse safe during transport, which is a tad unusual for budget mice.<br /><br />The Mouse:<br />Once you've plugged in the mouse, you'll see all of the LEDs light up and the Anker emblem on the back start to \\"breathe.\\" The next thing you'll notice is the ergonomics of it. If feels sort of like a Logitech G700 and a Razer Deathadder had a child. Let me tell you, this child is awesome! I'm honestly surprised that it feels this comfortable. Usually budget mice just feel a bit off, like it was an idea that just wasn't fleshed out completely, but not this. Anker did their homework on this one. You'll also notice that the three buttons near your thumb are also very comfortable to use. (More so than the two on my Deathadder.) Once again, kudos to Anker on the ergonomics. The clicking is as expected on any mouse these days. It's crisp and solid, not much else to be said. The tracking is also surprisingly great, and is definitely on par with my Deathadder 3.5g. Finally, these really surprising feature is the weight system included. I've never even heard of a mouse in this price point having a system like this, which is really awesome. I personally love heavy mice, so this was a dream for me. However, there are 8 individual weights, so you can easily pick your favorite amount. Honestly though, there aren't any glaring flaws with the product itself. I just can't think of anything that I don't like about it.<br /><br />The Software:<br />I was surprised that they didn't include a disk, but that probably would have driven the price up, so we'll give them a pass. After loading up the software you'll notice that it is very professional looking, and has many features. Most of them are the standard fare (Acceleration, sensitivity, scroll speed, double click speed, polling rate and DPI), but you'll also notice that the DPI tab has sliders for each of the four 'steps' available, these let you scale the DPI for the X and Y axis which is a really cool feature. Even more so, the mouse itself has a DPI selection button on it, which lets you choose the step you want, whenever you want. It also has a nice little tab for controlling the color and intensity of the emblem on the mouse, which is nice a feature missing from the Deathadder software. Finally there is a tab that handles updating the software, which is always handy.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, this is a very interesting mouse, that feels very similar to some other, much more expensive mice. I was shocked at how good it was, and definitely won't be buying any more Razer mice if Anker keeps putting out quality products like these.<br /><br />TL:DR Razer/Logitech quality + good software + great ergonomics + budget price point = Big winner! Highly recommend!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Always a fun game to play.  I am not very good at it, but I do keep coming back to try again.
B005RJI67I|4.0|My daughter loves Harry Potter so i had to get as much as I could. This made a great stocking stuffer.  Came exactly as described and shipped fast.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Heard about this movie from friends and it turned to be surprisingly funny yet touching all the same.  Lots of surprises!
B007HACDLK|4.0|**Spoiler**<br />This one was your fairly standard Rapp story line with a little twist thrown in with his injury and resultant temporary memory lost.  I liked the temporary change, it'll be interesting to see if Flynn allows/maintains some aftereffects of this into his future works that showcase Rapp.  I do have to say Flynn's last group of novels have been a bit abbreviated.  Given the level of intelligence Rapp's opponents are having the mop up really shouldn't be so quick.  Where's the underlying nemesis to Rapp?  Some variety of OBL type macro planning antagonist would add a dimension Flynn has lacked.

B0042FZOFU|4.0|I am happy with my box set of Toy Story 1-3 Blu-rays.  My only complaint is that one of the Blu-rays had come loose and was scratched in transit.  Not sure if this was done before it was sent, or while it was being sent, but as it was a gift, it  was frustrating to hear it rolling around in the box and not be able to open it up and correct the problem.  Fortunately, the scratches were minor, and didn't affect the playing.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Very long movie. Seems they found of cut out a lot in the beginning to make it shorter and more enjoyable. The game did not start till 1:10 into the movie.

0525953728|3.0|I was a bit conflicted on the rating for this book. As far as pure enjoyment, I would have given it a four. It's a fun read, and the subject matter is obviously of interest to almost everyone. But it isn't as well-written as other, similar books, it didn't seem to flow particularly well and I found the backstory lacking. That may not be an issue for some, but to me it seemed a rushed product for the sake of being the first book on the bin Laden raid.<br /><br />The aforementioned raid is the central point of the book, and as such it dominates the narrative. There is some basic backstory, focused especially on the author's experience in passing through Green Team and various previous deployments. But the backstory seems to exist more as background noise en route to the OBL raid than as a cohesive, engaging narrative.<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by the excellent books I've read just before this one, including Brandon Webb's Red Circle and Howard Wasdin's SEAL Team Six, but I've come to expect a story that does more than provide an overview of a handful of missions. I don't feel drawn into the experiences of the author as much as with the other books. I don't feel as compelled to care what happens to the author and his team. For a book of this type, that's a problem.<br /><br />The writing, too, is not as well-polished and cohesive as other, similar books. It's not bad by any means, but I can't help feeling that the author(s) could have used a more attentive editor. It's not difficult to read, but again, it's off just enough that it's difficult to be fully immersed in the story. The content itself is very interesting and the author certainly has some incredible stories to tell, but the execution could have been better.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because it was an easy and informative read. I read it because my Book Club was reading it. I would never have selected it myself, but I am glad that I read it because I feel that I am better informed. I have no way of knowing whether or not the author's account of the events is accurate, so I cannot comment on that. There were some political undertones, but not enough to detract from the reporting of the events of that fateful day. The author stated that he wanted to write the book in order to report the truth about the killing of Osama bin Laden, but should Navy SEALS be sharing such sensitive information?
B000MDDSB8|3.0|Like many of the movies i rented on here it was for a class. The movie wasn't good but it wasn't terribly bad either. Still if it hadn't been for a class I never would have spent money on it.

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|While I love this show and think the acting is great I don't think its as good as last season. This season is way more focused on sex and less on the creepy vibe. I do think however, that Evan Peters, Sara Paulsen and Jessica Lange deserve emmy/golden globe nominations if not wins for their work here.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I think this movie had to much profanity. Too much swearing, more than comedy. I guess may be I didn't find swearing combined with comedy funny.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Excelllent series. It kept my interest from first page to last! I highly recommend this series of books! Thoroughly intertaining.
B00AGH5LF6|4.0|This is a copy-cat sequel - but the best kind!  It brings all the fun of the original with the continued heart as well.  Sure, the first Home Alone will always be the best.  But change the background from suburbia to New York City and it brings a completely different spin.
B006RXSBS2|4.0|I like the movie and all but there are some flaws to it. Cameron Diaz's accent wasn't that fantastic. Neither was Leos but over all a decent movie.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I think this movie is very funny. I found it very funny when Steve Carell shows up for his kid's parent teacher conference only to discover that the teacher is the girl he slept with. Great story and funny.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Yes, I admit it!  I am a Sci-Fi freak!  And probably my favorite Sci-Fi movie of all time is Aliens.  So this movie was certainly no disappointment, being the prequel that explains where the aliens came from.  It is visually stunning and artistic as well.

B005FHXB0O|4.0|A delightful modern odyssey, if you can tolerate periodic over-the-top scenes of violence. Terrific and extensive cast bring to life a dazzling array of characters.  Memorable music score.  And, our hero and heroine make it through in one piece.

1400049628|1.0|It's really difficult to know where to begin when critiquing a work of fiction so commonly lauded as Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide. I first read the book a few years ago, but recently I got a copy (probably the same one) from the library, and since I already knew the portions I liked (and the far more numerous ones I didn't), I was able to do a far more concentrated analysis, rather than a more thorough slog. As such, this review isn't going to be as thorough as some others available, but it will still hit what I think are the highpoints, as well as the more major low ones.<br />First off, there's Brooks' assertion that bladed weapons are better suited to fighting the undead, because blades don't need to be reloaded. Ignoring the fact that machetes and other sharp melee weapons (especially Brooks' favored katana) dull and break, there are other concerns as well. First off, you're closing with an enemy that can only hurt you from about two feet away, whereas a gun lets you stay at a safe distance. Then there's the fact that it takes a lot of strength to sever a human neck (to quote Frightnight, \\"Bone is a mother\\" lover). We can also bypass the obvious psychological difficulties associated with decapitation, and go right for the meat of the matter: this method is irresponsible. Which, after all, is easier to keep track of? A full body zombie, or a single, reanimated but disembodied head? You aren't actually stopping the infected, you're just leaving it behind (something like a landmine) for the next poor fool to stumble across. And unlike you, he won't know it's there.<br />Brooks is a major proponent of melee weapons, although he does allow for the use of guns. Since firearms aren't readily available, I'll grant him this; I'd advocate carrying both two firearms and a fire ax, pick, or hammer. However, the chapter on guns is so poorly researched as to boggle my mind. Breaking weapons down into categories, Brooks starts off with heavy machine guns, which he rejectsout of hand for the logical reason that headshots are difficult to get on full-auto. Unfortunately, the weapon Brooks uses as an example is the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, a 5.56mm (.223 caliber) Light Machine Gun, and nowhere near as powerful as Brooks makes it out to be. Equally baffling is his summary rejection of assault rifles, due to the temptation of going full auto (apparently Brooks leaves in a world where automatic weapons are easy to come by in America). Brooks cites the M16A1 as the worst assault rifle in human history (further stating the M16A2 isn't much better), while the AK-47 is the best weapon ever made. This is hilarious, since, while the AK is surely a rugged weapon, it's also a supremely poorly designed weapon when it comes to accuracy (the Israeli Galil, which Brooks cites as a perfect copy, has its iron sights situated better for aimed shooting, rather than massed, automatic volley fire like the Soviets originally went for). Semi-auto rifles and bolt actions are given the logical thumbs up (although oddly enough, Brooks rates the M1 Garand the best of this class, rather than the newer and more common M14 and AR-15 series rifles). Shotguns are just about as useless as assault rifles (unless you use the strategy Brooks ripped right out of Resident Evil and mass multiple zombies together, then decapitate them all in one shot, something which is impossible in real life). SMGs are also dismissed, despite both the fact that they fire, by definition, pistol-caliber ammo (and are therefore fairly easy to keep loaded), can mount lots of optics, tend to have higher capacities than rifles, and are also illegal to own in automatic (at which point they become a semi-auto handgun with a stock). Handguns are relegated to being last-ditch weapons (something I would switch with the machete). Even more confusingly, .22 Rimfire weapons are treated as not only a separate class, but are in fact preferred, due to the relatively small size of their projectiles making for more carrying space. This ignores the fact that .22s are horribly inaccurate, extremely prone to misfires and duds, and on top of that are extremely loud (something not so great for evading the undead). Given that Brooks dismissed the 5.56mm M16 (because ammo for the American assault rifles so prevalent in America is apparently sold only to the military in Brooks' world), even though the 5.56 cartridge is .001 inches bigger in diameter, extremely reliable, and accurate to over a mile. Personally, I'd have recommended a 9mm carbine (like Beretta's Rx4), since they offer all the advantages of both a semiautomatic rifle and a handgun, but Brooks clearly didn't actually put much thought into this or he'd no about such weapons.<br />Shifting gears wildly, let's discuss the bizarre origin Brooks decided his zombies needed to have. It isn't especially necessary to come up with an entirely new virus, when he could've taken the Romero approach and simply accept the audience has suspended its disbelief, or better yet, come up with several different approaches to dealing with different zombies (from Romero to voodoo to genetically engineered infected). Instead, we get an extremely boring chapter that has no bearing on anything, on top of which introduces a zombie virus with a completely asinine name (Solanum? Seriously?). Dull. Keep in mind, too, this is coming from the guy who loved reading the Star Wars Incredible Cross Sections books as a kid. The idea of taking something fictional and giving it a plausible explanation fascinates me, but you can take it too far. Coming up with a reason Godzilla can breath fire using science is one thing; forcing Godzilla to be twenty-feet tall because of the scientific principle about mass to bone structure is another. This book is just badly executed.<br />Brooks' zombies themselves are even duller. Solanum only infects humans, thus removing the possibility of Resident Evil style infected animals. On top of that, Brooks zombies arewhat Romero's zombies claim to be: mindless, shambling (\\"slouching\\" as Max Seuss likes to say) corpses that stumble around slowly and about as intimidatingly as an 80-year old man. Whatever terror Brooks was going for with these things is pretty easily lost, especially when he describes a character running from one. I mean, taken to its fullest conclusion, the guy was already two blocks away before the zombie had finished stumbling down the front yard. While super strong zombies are stupid (as the remake of Day of the Dead showed us), equally not scary are these shambling fly magnets, yet Brooks consistently treats the undead as if they're a major, intimidating predator, not the minor inconvenience they'd surely be in real life.<br />What could've potentially been the most interesting part of the book is the historical accounts section, since it purports to recount various zombie outbreaks throughout history. A few are truly interesting (probably the best being one featuring the French Foreign Legion), but the bias prevalent to Brooks' writing truly becomes apparent here, as is his general lack of historical knowledge. All white people are inherently racist, and any outbreak where whites and other ethnic groups are divided, whites will be the first ones to succumb, the first ones to hide, and the first to start stringing up the black and Hispanic survivors once they (the non-whites) have killed all the zombies. Roanoke was destroyed by zombies; oddly enough there's a fairly detailed account of what happened there, despite there being absolutely no survivors. An outbreak in early 20th Century China involves Nationalist troops (even though the Chinese Civil War wouldn't start for another twenty years). Japanese scientists code-named BLACK DRAGON (rather than the real-life group Unit-731, which doesn't sound as cool) experiment on Japanese dissidents during World War II (no such groups existed; they'd have used Chinese peasants instead) to breed an army of zombies foruse against the Allies (which goes about as well as you'd expect); as the war ends, they eventually parachute (that's right) zombies onto Communist guerrillas (since Mao's forces disengaged the Japanese long before America entered the war and allowed the Nationalists to bear the brunt of the fighting, this is the rough equivalent of Hitler's last act of defiance being the dropping of an atomic bomb on English-allied Brazil). A survivor during a Canadian outbreak uses an M1 Carbine, and specifically fires 15 shots from the clip she put in a weapon capable only of accepting eight-round box magazines. Another survivor wields a .44 caliber machine pistol in the late seventies (no such weapon exists, then or now, though a misidentified Desert Eagle or .44 AutoMag is possible, albeit neither weapon is automatic). Probably the most hilariously idiotic are a series of outbreaks occurring along the West Coast, including one in the middle of Los Angeles at the turn of this Century. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but I seriously have a hard time buying a zombie outbreak in the middle of the LA barrio without anyone being the wiser for it.<br />There are other things to poke fun at (such as Brooks' advice to destroy the staircase when holing up in a two story house, although he's never very specific as to how exactly you're supposed to do this, or a mention of police carrying \\"sighted\\" rifles, as opposed to the ones without sights they usually use), there's really no point in going into all of them. The last assertion, probably the most hilarious in a book so mind numbingly stupid as to be beyond ridicule, is that this is a work of comedy. Simply put, it isn't funny(or at least not intentionally), and that ought to be the final nail in the coffin (or bullet to the head) of this truly worthless book.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed it. Will look forward to seeing the movie when it comes out. Interested to see who they have casted.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has an incredible voice that goes well with singing these classics.A treat for anyone to listen to.:)I highly recommed it.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I just don't get it. When you do please reply. I love all things comedy, but didnt get this film.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This item is small yet very effective. I bought this after researching a few others and determining this was the best for the price. I can also sharpen serrated blades which is a plus. Under $10, you can't go wrong with this purchase. Would recommend to anyone out there reading this.
B00007E7K0|5.0|Canon lens cap came just as described. Fit well and seems like OEM. Might be hard to mess up lens cap but glad it fits!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows. Getting preview of this nature was really nice.  It's much better than trying to catch highlights on TV!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Overall a good time. Funnier in the beginning and sometimes you feel like your in a episode of family guy, which is makes it even funnier.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always, King delivered a story I couldn't put down, even when reading it for the second time. I loved it.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I have almost all of Van Morrison's albums. This album is just what you would expect from him. I enjoyed listening to it.
B00136RUN0|4.0|I've heard of the Outlaws before but never was a fan; that all changed last month when I got to see them live at BB Kings in NYC. This album highlights many of their prior hits and gets a new fan acquainted with their large body of excellent work !!!
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults!  Kids stay very interested in the story - lots of action.  Enjoy it today.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Ted's premise seems absurd, however the story and actors allow you to put that aside.  There is definitely tons of vulgarity and crude humor, but also some heart.  If you are a fan of Family Guy you will also get a couple running gags thrown in there.  I genuinely enjoyed it.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Yes, it sounds familiar, just like old Steely Dan albums. I think that's a good thing! Donald Fagen is talented and his voice & song writing is still addictive after all these years!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Second only to Tai Pan. If the culture of Japan interests you hold on tight for one heck of a ride. Plus action, adventure, love, hate, greed, and so much more. Like a very good meal, this one will leave you satisfied. no need for 3,4, or 5 books that the author may or may not complete
B000HL09MG|3.0|Amazon needs to update its description of this movie.  Kidman is not just a golden globe winner. she is an academy award winner.
0345803485|1.0|This is Twilight fanfiction with the names changed. I'm not kidding either. I found a PDF of the original work initially posted on FF.net and it's almost the same thing as what's published in this book. It's so poorly written and the plot is pretty much nonexistent. How this became a bestseller, I don't know. Wait, I do know. It's riding off the coattails of the Twilight series.
B00A0SLTCU|2.0|Fight sequences are top notch along with special effects. The story line is quite weak and lacks direction. The original is worthy of purchase. The remake is worthy of rental.
B000784WMW|4.0|Loved it!  Will watch it many more times as Jane Eyre is a classic, and for a very good reason.
0802130208|5.0|This may be the funniest book I've ever read.  The protagonist is one of the most well written characters in history.  A great, funny read.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|This are great versions of your favorite songs. Michael has that distinct voice that just stands out. Been listening all season long.
B008602KQI|4.0|Loved the books.  The movie is pretty good but they should of made it a series. Two and half hrs doesn't cut it when you make this book into a movie.  I know the book is always better than the movie but the is just too much more story to condense into a short period of time.
0751538353|4.0|It took more time than expected but  I am really satisfied with the book, it was what I was hoping.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I thought Hope Springs was an entertaining movie.  I'm a fan of Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  Good rental.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy the frustration!!!  In learning how to maneuver each of the birds I am moving along the boards quite well.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The title of my review says it all- Morgan Rice is one of the best young authors of fantasy out there today because he can take a genre that is pretty common in fiction (vampires, Sword and sorcery) a give it a unique 21st century spin...<br /><br />A delightful adventure that should be the beginning of a great series!
B009ZE27US|3.0|Lol. Your getting mad over a game the scans your finger? It's suppose to bring out some humor, its not suppose to be accurate. This app doesn't know you. :D
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love trying to beat the clock!  Mahjong Deluxe HD free is an addictive game!  I think it is a lot of fun.
B002HNAAZ8|5.0|wow! so i LOVE the first DD album, probably my favorite....the second album Screw It was pretty damn good too, i really liked it but i just think that it had a few too many 'filler' tracks on it, just my opinion though. Not a bad song or 'filler' to be found here thats for sure!!!! this is an incredibly solid contemporary rock album.<br />musically you can tell its a little more mature and relevant but they NEVER loose track of their 'classic' sound. If your a DD fan or only had their 1st album and liked it, i gaurantee you will love REVOLVE, if you done then there is something wrong with you!!<br /> i first saw DD almost 2yrs ago at the M3 Rock Festival in MD. they were the first band on that day on the main stage, they blew me away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sounded amazing, looked great, and played flawless!! they without a doubt set the bar pretty high for the following acts that day/night. Rob Marcello killed it on guitar and the whole bands energy really came through!!!<br />a few months back they played a small club in RI close to where i live. again, nothing but a kick-ass amazing show!!!<br />they played a few songs from Revolvewhich i werent familiar with not having the album yet, i knew as soon as i got home that night i would be ordering Revolve without hesitation! i dont know why i waited so long to pick this up!!  i love it love it love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the songs are strong, well structured, very melodic, amazing production too...the bass is deep and silky, everything about the mix is spot on and sounds amazing on a good stereo system/speakers!<br />TRACK #1 GREAT opening song, really sets the tone for the rest of the songs that folllow...new and mondern but still the DD sound i always loved!<br />TRACK #2  tempo picks up slighty, rob's guitar shredding opens the song, bass/drums flowing and ted sounding great, a melodic rollercoaster ride, makes you wanna re-play the track when its over!<br />TRACk #3 oh boy, make sure your volume is cranked for this slow/mid-tempo heavyish ballad of sorts, the chorus will suck you right in!!!!!! may be my favorite song on here and i love EVERY song!! i blasted this track over and over in my car, sounded soooo good!!! this was one of the 3 tracks from this album they played live which i heard for the first time that night, what a rocking song!!!! coudlnt get it outta my head for days!!!<br />TRACK #4 ahhh, classic DD with this track, love it!!!!!!! played this live and the crowd LOVED it!<br />TRACK #5 a pretty down-temp acoustic ballad, the girls like this one lol<br />TRACK #6 catchy, riffy classic DD feel good song!!<br />TRACK #7 wow! this song has a very modern sound to it, should have been a radio single, great rockin mid-tempo song!<br />TRACK #8  jamazing song, album just keeps getting better and better....they played this live and it just blew my away!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />TRACK #9 all i can say is yet another great song,<br />well written, catchy, melodic and memorable! one of the many songs on this album that should have gotten some radio play!!!<br />TRACK #10 a classic Ted Poley ballad and great song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />TRACK #11 last song to take you out, great song to end the album with, reminds me of something from Screw It!<br />all in all an AMAZING album imo, not a bad song on here!!! its been a while since anyone has put out a good, solid rock album beginning to end, these boys did it with REVOLVE!! i feel as though its much Under-rated, there's def. a few really standout tracks that should have gotten some radio play! every musician in this band is killer!!!!!! see them live if you get the chance!!!!
B0033807E0|5.0|Once again, Rick Riordan has made a masterpiece. The writing is good, the characters are convincingly realistic, and everything is woven into a great story with amazing skill. The storyline and plot seems very realistic, and, although I would usually say it's impossible, Riordan managed to make the plot so obvious that the reader have some idea of what's going on, but still hidden enough to surprise you. It was impossible for me to put this book down, and once finished, I was happy there was more. This series craves an ending, but at the same time, you wish it wouldn't come, because the book is so good, and Riordan is a great writer. For fans of J. K. Rowling and Eoin Colfer, this book is amazing.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I enjoy revisiting the days of yester-year and attempting to play Pac Man.  I am still having trouble maneuvering the chomper but I am sure in time I will get good at it again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!!! The only thing that sucks is waiting for your energy to build back up so you can keep playing.
B000L53D4O|3.0|We got this for our daughter when she was almost 11 mos old.  She really enjoys it and I think it's helped her walking practice tremendously.  However, it once tipped back and she somehow managed to fall over with it and the walker was underneath her and upside down.  She didn't get hurt, but she was frightened.
B009CPES4I|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Second time seeing movie, need more like it.  Warm and funny, highly recommend, would see again.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book.<br />My kids and I really enjoy listening to this book.  We like the audio read option. Great story.
5699214127|5.0|Great book, great gift for Russian learner. High quality print, layout and covers. Artwork clear and bright. Great translation and lots of fun.
B005ZUR724|1.0|like everybody say the game is good until the update for the fire, if anybody knows HOW to update it then tell us so pleases. I try uninstalling the game and reinstalled but that did not work for me. I'm not even going to try talking to gameloft because they won't make any sense, but they really need to fix this problem.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I really enjoyed this album.  A great balance of smooth and upbeat tracks.  Just an all around good follow up to his last cd.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|so happy I can access on my Kindle Fire too...thank you thank you for letting us access our apps ...!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|my desktop was having problems with the stock intel 775 fan and would overheat and shut down. even when its only running at 25% load. i install this bad boy and now even at 100% cpu load it is hovering around 55c. like others have said this thing is huge. i had to remove a side panel fan in order to close the case.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I really like this app. I have noticed tho that I really didn't need to buy it as my favorites are on the free version. the positive to buying is that it will play in the background as u use ur device. that is a plus!!!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|what can i say about this that everyone else have not already said. hmmm nothing. this product is as good as advertised and i would not build a computer without it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an all consuming book. From the first page to the last. In a way I wish ALL books were.<br /><br />Such a realness to these characters that each paragraph controlled my breath. From the moments that had me laughing hard, to the ones that gripped the pit of my soul, and my favorites??? the ones that actually stopped my breathing while I experienced Holder and Sky's intoxicating relationship.<br /><br />Never has an author had me literally panting when the couple hasn't even kissed yet. <deep breath><br />\\"I'm pretty sure we just broke the record for the best first kiss in the history of first kisses- without even kissing.\\" (38%)<br />Agreed. And since when has pinky holding brought tears to my eyes? Since Hopeless, that's when.<br /><br />Without a doubt this book just fell into my top 10 list of favorite books ever. What an amazing gift Colleen Hoover has.<br /><br />Her characters are real. At least you sure as heck wish they were. And lived in your house. And were your only friends. ;) I loved Sky from the 3rd sentence. Sarcasm and quick wit~ two things I can't get enough of. And Holder? Holder had me at \\"Hey.\\" I dare you not to fall in love with him.<br />Perfectly imperfect characters. And I could.not.get.enough.<br /><br />May I recommend blocking off your day when you buy Hopeless... as you will not want to put it down. Not even to pee. And make sure your kindle/iPad/electronic-device is fully charged or you will sit on the floor next to the plug to read because back pain will be completely worth it. Lack of sleep will be worth it. Ignoring your children will be worth it. ;) Ok, I need to stop. But only because I need to go re-read it. Now.<br /><br /><to whomever designed the cover~ LOVED it!><br /><br />**Warning ~ If you are a Slammed fan that wants to read this, please know Hopeless is of a more mature nature than Slammed and it deals with a dark subject mater.to say this is a Romance.<br />About Teenagers.<br />It's a Teenage Romance.<br /><br />I just noticed negative reviews from people who bought it solely on the fact that it's a #1 best seller yet had no idea of it's genre. So I wanted to help you out.<br /><br /> Shocking to believe there's so many of us that read that genre, huh? Boy did we fool you middle aged men. ;)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It lives up to the Horror!!  They did a fantastic job of freaking us all out!  Can't wait for more to come!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved this book :)<br /><br /> I didn't see the ending coming that way :o but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone ^_^
B002PNDEXK|4.0|This beautiful classics comes to life on the screen with the help of an outstanding cast of British actors.  Most enjoyable!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Adictive game. Good to pass the time. Do not spend all your coins or you will regret it. Not much mor e to say.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This age scanner app is very unrealistic.  First it said I was 47, then 38, then 32.  I am really thirteen you *****!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|This reader is such a disappointment! I use IANNOTATE (by branchfire) on my ipad, and I was hoping for a similar, excellent pdf reader (including highlighter, emailing notes to one's self, and more) for my new kindle fire.  No such luck. This app is not user friendly, and it's definitely not the quality I was looking for. So disappointing.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|All new people.....why, I need more story! Lots of action....new guy is good, but I was not able to pick up easily the point of this movie.
B0035KGWR2|4.0|wikipedia describes Young Lovers \\"as b-side\\" on the amy's A Curious Thing. i cannot find it anywhere, not even for mp3 download  [...]  would be nice to have had Dancing in the Dark as a separate tune rather than 'hidden' with With Happiness Means to Me
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I loved this book, but I do wish the author would have given more insight into Emily's mind and why she felt the way she did. All in all I enjoyed reading it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I, personally like my sf about deep space mysteries but, this was a great near future story and humorous also.<br />This book could be made into a good movie!
B00943SQCI|5.0|I just love Johnny Depp and this film is definitely better in HD! It was delivered fast to my TV and in HD. I would recommend this to ALL my friends too!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|on the main page, the news only goes down a couple of stories before it ends.  just a big hassle
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|what's not to like? btw - this film is definitely better in HD! It was delivered fast to my TV and in HD. I would recommend this to ALL my friends too!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher is another novel superman; just not a believable character or plot. Still, it wis entertaining. Can you believe they selected Tom Cruise to play Reacher! Talk about Mutt & Jeff!
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Alright! This movie has to be the surprise great movie of 2012!  This film is definitely better in HD, also! It was delivered fast to my TV and in HD. I would recommend this to ALL my friends too!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is a very believable character. A pleasant change from the supermen, like Mitch Rapp and Jack Reacher; though all are entertaining.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I was able to kill several hours on this cold snowy afternoon. I also have this game on my computer and this version works every bit as well.
0205191584|5.0|This book is truly a great resource for any level or type of writing! It is short, concise, and easy to read, plus it will greatly improve your writing. I highly recommend this book.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It needed more lens flares but other than that it was outstanding.  It's good enough for a Blu ray purchase.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|A terrific mooV. One of the best explosions I have ever seen. Cool concept and great ideas Who da thunk<br />came up with this notion?
B001706I5I|5.0|OMG I love this movie!!! Such a great story, so inspiring, perfect reflection of our society. Love Dr. Seusse!! &#60;3
B004GHNIRK|3.0|IT'S LONG - I have only read 110 pages and Hugo is quite verbose.  There were a lot of &#34;&#34;extra people&#34;&#34; so far and an over abundance of details.  I think I tried ready Les Mis in college and had the same result - TOO MUCH STUFF really insignificant to the main plot.
0425220931|5.0|Amazing book - great story and so spiritual. Written in such a beautiful way, The Music Lesson tells a special story about our wold and how we are all connected and what a amazing part of that music has. So wonderful.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I have to admit, the MIB series continue to get better with each addition. A good SiFi movie to sit back laugh and enjoy.
B00881PPTO|3.0|Works OK, but takes long to post a new trip.  Does not seem as robust as Tripit.  Will keep a careful eye on this to see if I will keep it.
B00377E5SG|4.0|Need I say more... Makes a great gift! The women in your life will love you for it... That about says it all.
B007N9FKCY|2.0|I like the design of the game, the little bean is cute and the levels are colorful. But I just don't like the constant bouncing. Items you may want to get are put specifically in places that are really hard to get to because there is a shelf there that you can't avoid. It's like Mario, only you can't really control where you're going. Definitely wouldn't buy it, I didn't even keep it thought it was free.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|movie was good and all but they played it up way more than what you would have expected. as far as acting goes that part was great, but if your in a game called hunger then please by all means at least be a little more offence than defence
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Funny, a bit cheesy, but a good kids Xmas movie all the same. It starts slow and ends up at a fast and funny place.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Wonderful read.  Love the descriptions of the primary characters, the depth of their personalities and their interrelationship.  Reads like a novel, not a history book.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Well, I'd LIKE to play the game but no matter how many times I delete and reinstall it on my Kindle Fire HD the screen flips itself so that the game is upside down no matter what I do. I want my money back, or a solution to this issue.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|There's a leaning curve, but not so much that you cannot play the games. I've been using it for COD BO2.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|I would've like to see some of the statistical data presented as graphs - a visual comparison.<br />This book reference many others, it would be nice to click on them as you read, with the option to buy now or later.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have not read John Grisham's recent books.  Any book has  to has to draw me in if I am going to finish it.  I purchased the Racketeer because of the favorable reviews.  I was not disappointed.  Not at all what I expected - minimal action / but a lot of unexpected twists and turns in the plot - and that is good - because I enjoyed this first person narrative (best I can describe it) story.
B0019M2ITY|2.0|everything is fine the same as the picture.<br />It is a very cool watch and very nice.<br />with all its papers.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|We saw this in the theatre and we loved it. Couldn't wait for it to be released. Highly recommend this sweet, funny and poignant film. The script is wonderful, the acting was great and the cinematography is fabulous. All with no violence to speak of and no swearing either
B001BZE82E|2.0|everything is fine the same as the picture.<br />It is a very cool watch and very nice.<br />with all its papers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a character study, portrait of a marriage, and a mystery all rolled into one. It's a very satisfying read. Pick it up if you need a &#34;page turner!&#34;
B003YL4LYI|5.0|An action-packed, page-turning continuation of the excellent epic &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; that is not to be missed. I couldn't put it down.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|So far so good. Makes easy selling! Take a picture and post right away. I reccomend this app. Very easy to navigate.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of the best holiday movies out there. Will Farrell is hilarious, but more so, the movie really helps to get me into a cheerful holiday mood! Love it!
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you are a fan of Family Guy then you won't be disappointed with Ted. You definitely know that it's a Seth McFarland comedy.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|VERRRRYYY GOOD BOOK<br />GREAT CONCLUSION<br />VERY DIFFERENT<br />SEMI SAD<br />TOTALLY AMAZINGG<br />CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK IN THE SERIES TO COME OUT!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys old Sherlock Holmes, the new SH movies, or Lucy Liu. I would say the banter and the mystery is what draws me to this show the most but I also enjoy the sets, the costumes, & the writing of every scene.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|y is it good you may ask yourself??<br />welll continue to read this review<br />-well written<br />-very awesome LIKE A BOSS plot<br />-awesome characters<br />-recomended to read if your at least 14<br />and last but NOT LEAST<br />HAVE YOU SEEN THE ACTOR WHO PLAYS CHARLIE??? -_- hehe
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|The action was great. I was disappointed that he didn't go after the bleep who targetted him. Also, some of the principle goons were killed by Jason Bourne in the previous movie (I thought).
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I think my 3 year old daughter has watched this movie at least 8 times! We LOVE this movie!  A great addition to our DVD collection.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Well done!  It's a two bags of popcorn movie.  Glad to see it they will continue making the Batman movies.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie was really good.  My children enjoyed watching it..would definitely order it again and will order from this company again...received quickly and was very pleased..thank you
B009ZE27US|3.0|its ok. the ages are different and can make you feel old. its totally a waste of space on your device. the screen is black on the app and boring.
6305428042|5.0|My daughter loved this movie.  After seeing it numerous times she still laughs.  She would recommend it to other teenages.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|For those that actually understand our current society and the real definition of what some things mean; this movie can be a little chilling.  It is an entirely possible future because of our clinging to current popular myths.<br /><br />For those that don't care about such things, or don't (want) to understand them then it is another in a long line of mediocre action movies you will likely soon forget.<br /><br />There are some technical aspects of this movie that I can imagine being overlooked; the most popular item I could envision would be a Faraday bracelet - but overall its a good movie.
B00006JDVV|5.0|This movie was really good.  My children enjoyed watching it..would definitely order it again and will order from this company again...received quickly and was very pleased..thank you
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I won't spoil the plot.<br />Visuals are stunning<br />Music is top notch (much better than most movies where you cannot hear the dialog because of the music)<br /><br />The story line lacked the punch in the gut that the other movies had.  There are spots where the plot is way too thin and predictable (for most) and other places where it needed more detail (obtuse).  Overall though it is a very good movie, one that I would (and have) watched again.<br /><br />For those picky types, there are inconsistencies between this movie and the first (glaring in some spots)  - the cut scenes should have been in this version they are WAY better than the final production scenes (but that has been true to all the movies).
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's fun but it needs better joy stick control to make it feel more like the original game. Good first step.
B008NB0SQO|3.0|I love this movie, with a great script, outstanding performances (Michael Caine does a brilliant job playing it straight), and wonderful songs. Unfortunately, a song that made it onto the old VHS version isn't here: &#34;When Love Is Gone&#34; (it's sung over the end credits, but not in the movie itself). How can a Blu-Ray edition not include this song, at least as an extra? Frankly, it makes me Scroogey: I'd wait until Christmas Eve, then fire the idiot executive who made this decision.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I was expecting it to be good. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. If you liked 28 Days Later you will like this book.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|some great moments, nice camera work and great locations. not as action packed as the first 3. maybe they will inprove it next movie. They have the right actor, just need a better script.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|As a Castle fan, I enjoyed reading the Niki Heat series.  The series provides some insights into the feelings that cannot be conveyed in the TV series. Different names, similar characters, but more depth.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|\\"The Five Love Languages\\" is the best book on marriage communication I have ever read. The brilliance is in its easy to apply simplicity. Mr Chapman has really discovered a tool for marriage that can and has saved thousands of marriages. It has definitely been a savior to  my marriage. Thanks to this book I've rekindled the love and romance in my marriage that I thought might never come back. My wife and I feel truly blessed.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|As a Castle fan, I enjoyed reading the Niki Heat series.  The series provides some insights into the feelings that cannot be conveyed in the TV series. Different names, similar characters, but more depth.
B001KWR3PM|5.0|This WAS great until I screwed up and deleted it from this new \\"magical smart phone\\". Tried my best to get Amazon's help but got a bunch of demon mailer email addresses. I highly recommend buying the album but next time I purchase it, it will be in actual CD form.
