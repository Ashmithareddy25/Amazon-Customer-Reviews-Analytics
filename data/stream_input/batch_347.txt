B0000508U6|5.0|I can say that this is my favorite album ever so far in my life. I have listened to A Rush... and it just doesn't get to me as much as this one does. A rush is to incoherent, they're good songs on there but parachutes flows so nicely. It is more simple than A rush, and sometimes simple is better. Is it just me or is 'We Never Change' the best song ever! The song is so chill and so down. Personly I don't know why people are more on to it. It's better than any track on A Rush including the scientist. 'Sparks', 'Don't Panic', and 'High Speed' are greatly unappreciated. Relax and let these songs take you. The whole theme of wanting to sort out life through relaxing songs just makes this album absolutely perfect. A Rush may be good but Parachutes is better and it's where it all started.
B000002H33|5.0|Amazon.com thank you for giving me the chance to talk about Metallica, THE GOD SENT MUSIC ANGELS ON EARTH!!!!!!!!!!<BR>Iam a 60 year old woman and have loved Metallica since the early days and still love them ever since and why would you think? I love them for being Metallica,true to them selves,lots of guts to keep presenting something new again and again,without loosing their identity and dare to take critics either from fans or media, but yet they stand firm in their beliefs and i think you need A GREAT DEAL OF CHARACTER FOR THAT!
B000069AUI|5.0|Great album. I kind of miss the mellowness of the Parachutes so it took a little while to get a hold of this one. Song's are all extremly unique as radiohead and are as catchy as beatles. If you think that this is good than you should hear kent. They're just as good, if not better, than coldplay or radiohead, except their swedish with a couple English albums. Coldplay is good.
B000060P79|4.0|I jus bought their CD yesterday @ target for 11.99 its an okay CD so far. The guys voice does tend to get annoying. Hehehehe and their lyrics are kinna uhh....dumb... Some of the songs are okay tho. I recommend you burn it from a friend.
0553277472|1.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a perfect example of how not to write a book that is supposed to make the reader think.  I felt as if the story that this book had to tell could have been told in 200 pages, maybe.  I'm not sure why the book had to drag on for so long.<br />I'll grant this to the people who think that this book is the greatest thing since sliced bread: the discussion of Quality was a good thing that Pirsig brought up, but it went on for far too long.  Before long, I was so sick of Quality that I would probably have burned the book after Quality was next mentioned.  After the discussion of Quality finally came to a close (the end of the book), I was so confused by what Quality actually was that I now start to wonder what Quality actually is.<br />The rest of the book also proved confusing.  I won't try to blind myself to the fact that this was a tough read.  I consider myself a very intelligent person, and I had to read and re-read passages and then re-read them again before I could really understand what in the world Pirsig was trying to say.  Maybe this would have been a better book if Pirsig had used a slightly less complicated vocabulary and tried to better explain Quality, but Pirsig didn't do this.<br />The main reason not to read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is because Pirsig does too much to confuse the readers.
B00005JLKB|1.0|I was an avid comic collector (and I still collect some now) and Superman has always been the most monkeyed-with character. But &quot;Smallville&quot; has gone too far. <br />  Maudlin and silly, this continuity-busting show is simply &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; with teenage Superman thrown in + 1 black helper character (all the networks got in trouble for color-less programming so I thought that I would mention him). You can almost hear the female teeny-boppers go &quot;OOOOH!&quot; when they see Supes in his flannel shirt; too bad that he is such a TERRIBLE actor.<br />  To keep the young, male demographic interested, the show parades some 25 year old looking &quot;teenage&quot; girls around the set and has them pout their lips and whine out some insipid dialog every once in a while. Then their performance stops when Mr. Boring, the  teenage Superman, starts giving the beat-down to the villian-of-the-week. <br />Just awful.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Tom welling is a great actor and so is/are(I don't know what to put) the rest of the crew. Smallville is a great show and the DVD actually works and its something everyone should at the very least watch, Superman fan or not!!!! : )

B0000BWVCM|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie see it! It rocks!!!! Sure it's voilent ,but hey, it's rated PG-13 for a reason you know! Some parts are ,shall i say, kinda odd ,but the rest is better than the first ,and the whole thing is way better than the Lord of the Rings movies. The Harry Potter movies are close to being as good ,but they aren't quite there yet.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I thought this movie was really good. The car chase was kick ass. But I actually want to respond to a review I just read. This person goes through all the problems with Matrix Reloaded. Fine. But the one thing I had a problem with was the fact that this reviewer was basically wondering how Zion can run on &quot;phenomenal&quot; technology but the people are dressed in rags and couldn't figure out how to make shoes. Well damn near all mankind and earth was destroyed by computers and they had to find what they could to wear. I am sure in the middle of this war, when these people didn't know if they would make it out alive, they were really thinking about some damn clothes and shoes and looking good! C'mon! Survival was the first thing on their mind. And yes they run on great technology, but there was nothing for them to possibly make f*ckin' shoes with, being that they're hundreds of miles below the earth. Did you see any sheep they could get wool from? Alls I'm sayin' is think before you write something stupid like that. Honestly, if you were in their situation, would you really be thinking about your wardrobe?
B000000W5F|4.0|And as usual, Mick is behind the wheel of the whole thing.  It's funny - if any other Stones album were organized like Tattoo You (rockers on side a, ballads on side b) I would probably hate it! Yet, oddly enough, by this point in their career, the stones have given us so many well crafted albums - that this \\"concept\\" isn't really a problem to me. It's actually really convenient. There are occasions where I only want to hear stones' ballads - and Mick made it so easy. These songs sound so good next to each other. The production is crisp, there is no unsuccessful experimentation - this really is one of my favorites.    Now, a lot of Nay-sayers may protest that an album without any experimentation is just a retread - too safe to be good. I disagree! The funny thing about these songs is that they started out in a variety of different styles (Start Me Up - Reggae) but were refined and reworked to create a coherent whole. Each track dates back from prior sessions (which many other reviews here have pointed out) but together they are in perfect company. This isn't just an outtakes collection, it's more like a carefully constructed collage.    Anyway, my favorite songs off this one are 1) Tops, 2) Waiting on a Friend, 3) No Use Crying. I definitely prefer the ballads here - these ballads are sentimental with a sleazy edge. It that makes perfect sense with a band that's been together at this point for almost two decades. Just picture Mick in seersucker pants rolled up at the ankles walking on the cape thinking about his stock portfolio. Yikes - is that the stones? Yes! And it is glorious! The stones are acting their age on this one, and that is why it works. Trust me, \\"Tattoo You\\" will look so good next to all your other stones albums.
B000092Q4U|4.0|I decided to take a chance. I bought the first Lamb Of God CD and thought it was alright but overall, very cookie cutter and uninspiring. I think part of what sold me on them originally was the production of the evil genius known as Steve Austin of the marvelous Today Is The Day. Much to my dismay, LOG, didn't match up to Mr. Austin's trio of death. Well, album #2 should always be a step above the first. Fortunately for Lamb Of God, it is a staircase above.<br />Unlike some bands newest offerings, this album DOES NOT pick up where the last one left off. It almost starts anew with a fresh retro feel (sounds weird, but I'm sure it'll make sense to those who've listened to more than Disturbed and Mudvayne), blending the obvious Slayer influence with a more subtle Pantera feel as well as some lesser known (at least to the dreadlock-sporting nu-metal crowd) influences from the golden age of Bay Area thrash.<br />The lyrics have a discontent, somewhat-socio/political bent to them and are backed by rabid, biting vo-kills that make you take notice from the opening verse. Once again, the drumming makes it presence felt heavily with a combination of bombastic rhythms and aggressive improvisation. The most obvious influence comes from &quot;school of king/hanneman&quot; guitar riffage that would normally come under heavy scrutiny but it's clear by the second track that these guys have studied the masters very well, even so much as to get a nod from the legendary Slayer themselves.<br />Nu-metal, this is not.<br />For those &quot;nu-bies&quot; looking to finally shed themselves of their Disturbed rags and are having some trouble finding a copy of Dark Angel &quot;Leave Scars&quot;, &quot;As The Palaces Burn&quot; is a good place to de-virginize yourself unto real metal. As for me, being a fan of the genre since the late-80s heyday of thrash, I find it heartening to hear new bands coming out now and daring once again fly the flag of real metal without hesitation. Anyone who still finds enjoyment from the old Combat or Noise releases will find something to like here.finds enjoyment from the old Combat or Noise releases will find something to like here.
B00009XITP|4.0|Sometimes it's worth your time to tune into a film that is simply charming and makes you laugh out loud.  Like many of the other reviewers, I didn't plan on watching this, but ending up seeing it with my mom. I should have know that you can never lose with a Colin Firth film!<br />This film is about a girl you can root for from the beginning who is attractive without wearing revealing clothing, who is smart and witty without putting others down, and who charms a guy simply by being herself.<br />It looks like a teen flick, but is definitely worth the time of women of all ages.  Grab this film for good, clean fun!
B00005JLTN|4.0|the movie was cool, it had awsome seens of neo kicking ass and not taking names, but the story line got very confusing, if I would explain it, I would be hear all day typing, so I'll just say this, rent it first, and then if you like it enough, but it if you can, I bought it the first minute it came out on DVD and don't get me wrong it is a awsome movie to watch, but it gets very confusing, you would have to watch it more than once to get the full feel of the movie like the x-files.
B0000019PA|5.0|Length - 40:11<BR>Much has been said about this album. It's one of the biggest underground records of the decade. There are wild, brilliant lyrics, horns, harmonies and crunching guitars all sparked by a blazing fire at the crux, scorching all listeners. I think one thing though, which has been implied by many but not directly stated, is that this record really really rocks hard. And in my humble opinion, that's what has really given In the Aeroplane Over the Sea its legendary status. These songs all rock in the traditional rockout-airguitar-goosebump fashion. I still shiver with delight each time I listen to Ghost, Holland 1945 and The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1. This album seems so twisted and bizarre, but I think it's very accessible. Anyone looking for a REAL rock record should definitely get this.
0446530891|5.0|Baldacci's great gift is his involving characters and plots that keep you guessing until the end.  But they are never cheap or contrived -- every revelation has been planted in the plot.  I love his work and this book does his reputation justice.
6305603847|2.0|Ok, just like the album, ive watched (listened in the case of the album) this several times, both sober and not-so. I must say, although many people like it, i think it is pretty boring. Just like the album there are spots of absolute genuis, but there are plenty of times that you would kill for a fast-forward button. Some of the acting, and all of the animation, is riveting, thought provoking, and just plain intense. But after is all said and done, youre left with the feeling of... &quot;what a waste of time&quot;. Rent/Borrow it to check it out. Then buy it if you like it, but DONT  spend your hard earned bucks just because the hype says the wall is great.
0783240503|4.0|Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was a great movie that keeps you interested with all its classy music selections.  I thought it was a really neat concept how they started with all the teachers sitting on the stage and all those teachers had parts in the play.  I really enjoyed all the different kinds of music they played.  From Jazz to Elvis they were all very good!  This is a great movie for kids to adults.  I would recomend it to everyone!
0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six is a great book in my opinion.  I liked it because Tom Clancy makes parts with lots of action, which is what I like.  This book opens in Hereford, England where John Clark has setup a black-op organization called Rainbow Six which is an anti-terrorist organization that reacts against terrorist attacks.  John Clark makes two different teams in this organization which are lead by Peter Covington and Domingo Chavez.  Chavez and Clark are the most talked about characters and in this book their wives are involved.  Most of the characters in the Rainbow Six group are from Tom Clancy's other books.  Tom Clancy explains the terrorist attacks very well and how the characters would feel if this event really happened.  Most of the events are very surprising and exciting.  The ending is very surprising.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|If you're looking for another Mama's Gun or Baduizm, this ain't it.  Sometimes you just have to grow with an artist - wait and see where they're going to take you next.  A lot of folks don't seem to have the patience for that and expect everything to sound the same.  Imagine how boring and typical Erykah's music would be if all of her albums sounded the same - like a lot of mainstream music.<br />I love everything that she's done on this album. She's stretching on this record and you can hear it in her lyrics and vocal arrangements.  Her voice is getting stronger and she's taking risks and trying new things with her instrument.  I love that about her.  This album definitely has an old school sound to it.  Some of it reminds me of Chaka Kahn, particularly &quot;I Want You.&quot;  And I don't know what that was at the end of track 4, but I hope to hear some more of it in the near future.<br />So go git it and enjoy.
0441172717|5.0|I've been always a huge Tolkien Fan. I've never had the opportunity to get the Dune books, besides, since I saw the original movie... I did not care to read them.<br />That was until I bought this from a used book bookstore. The book is incredible, the history deep, and intelligent. Since last april, I bought and read all 6 Dune Saga books, the complete House trilogy and I am 2/3 on the Butlerian Jihad.<br />I would highly recommend these books.
B00007L4MJ|1.0|Like the last reviewer, I went through two bad pressings of this DVD with the same problems.  Having this great movie konk out halfway through on BOTH copies was a great disappointment.  Amazon ended up refunding my money but it was alot of hassle for myself (and presumably Amazon) all because of poor Q.C. at Kino.  I wrote e-mail to Kino about the problem and they suggested ordering directly from them and asking them to pre-view my copy before sending it to make sure I didn't get a bad one.  Nice to hear they are taking quality control seriously. Not!
B00009TB5G|3.0|I really enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring - moreso on DVD than in the theater.  But The Two Towers - snoresville.  There was about a half-hour worth of plot, and then two hours of filler.  The subplot with the walking trees was excruciating. So many critics fell all over themselves to rave about this movie - but it left me totally and utterly bored. I wish it had been as good as the first, but it wasn't.  The characters hemmed and hawed and talked and chatted and wheezed and voiced pretentious, pointless dialogue for way too long.  As a fan who liked the first moviejust fine and doesn't want to bash the series, let's hope Return of the King is a rousing finish to the trilogy.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|If you're not a science fiction fan, you may be looking at the endless string of rapturous reviews for \\"Firefly\\" and rolling your eyes. While \\"Firefly\\" certainly doesn't lack in geek appeal, its sharp writing, excellent cast and often-striking visual style elevate it into the ranks of Just Plain Great Television. After a somewhat bumpy start, this series found its groove with remarkable speed, and began cranking out hour after hour of compelling drama as if it had been on the air for years.<br />The Fox network employed a novel strategy to introduce Firefly to audiences in the fall of 2002-- sidelining its brilliant two-hour premiere in favor of a dumbed-down and hastily-written successor, airing the series out of order (with all its least compelling episodes up front), and frequently pre-empting the show in favor of the world series. Fox then proceeded to throw up its hands in feigned amazement when the series tanked in the ratings. While fans of writer/producer/creator Joss Whedon do tend toward fanaticism, in this case it's more a testament to the quality and intelligence of \\"Firefly\\" that the series has enjoyed eye-popping pre-orders on DVD and new life as a feature film.<br />Standout episodes include \\"Serenity,\\" the series' haunting, dryly funny pilot; \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds,\\" a sly mix of screwball comedy and crime caper; and \\"Objects In Space,\\" a nail-biting, beautifully shot game of cat and mouse between the series' most mysterious heroine and one of the more memorably whacked-out villains in recent TV memory.
B000002LVB|4.0|This might not have any lyrics about sex and drugs or noisy freakouts, and it may not even technically be a Velvet Underground album, but it's a really great collection of melodies nonetheless. Despite complaints to the contrary, it's not even that far of a stretch from some of the previous material; sure, the noise is gone, but were you to take some of the more melodic songs from the previous self-titled album (&quot;What Goes On&quot;, &quot;Candy Says&quot; and &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; for instance) and slicken the production, they'd fit in just fine here. &quot;Who Loves The Sun&quot; is cheerful sounding Turtles folk-pop nicely contrasted with quite bitter lyrics, &quot;New Age&quot; and &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&quot; are beautiful and contemplative ballads, and of course there's the classics &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; and &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;. I can definitely tell how the accent on poppy material could turn off people expecting it to be in line with the more avante garde sounds of their first couple albums, but if you're new to the band, or don't allow their reputation to precede this album, it's quite enjoyable.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Brought it with me to Mexico, listened to it for a week straight, and I can't get sick of it.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|all of the negative reviews i have read focus on the most superficial aspects of the film -- acting, rave dancing, and colonel sanders. too bad none of these things actually have anything to do with the film itself.<br />'reloaded' is most decidedly a second installment worthy of its predecessor. much like 'the empire strikes back' and 'the two towers', it ends quite abrubtly and leaves a sort of nebulous feeling. uncertainty abounds. for anyone who panned 'reloaded' for its ending, i bet you can't look me in the eye and tell me that you won't spend $7 on seeing 'revolutions' next month. you just can't.<br />anyway, beyond the weird scenes and acting is what is at the very core of the trilogy -- oodles and oodles of the wachowskis hitting viewers over the head with philosophical viewpoints from human history. it speaks volumes about the filmmakers that they can create a character in neo who can be interpreted as the central figure in most of the world's more popular religions. you can see neo as jesus, or even as buddha.<br />beyond the obvious religious and philisophical parallels the film contains are its mathematical attributes -- some simple like the recurrence of 101 and 303 -- and some not-so-simple ones, as in the many, many references to computer programming, loops, anomalies, string theory, axioms and their definitions, and just about anything else you would need to know about how the matrix is built.<br />if you want to read what 'the matrix' films may really be about, i suggest \\"godel, escher, bach: an eternal golden braid\\" by douglas hofstadter. its kinda tough to read, but once you pick up on it, you may as well believe you are reading right out of the script, only now it makes sense.<br />get past the superficial elements, and see what this trilogy really is -- a work of art meant to question, and perhaps solve some of life and the universe's many 'strange loops' made by two very brilliant men.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Star Trek V is not a great movie, but it isn't a disaster either.  It's a good movie, and probably would have received better acclaim if the climax were more satisfying.  Once you understand the problems behind its makeshift ending, you can better appreciate William Shatner's original vision for the film.  If anybody cares to recall, the critics were already slamming this movie long before it was actually released, and I think many, many people -- especially other critics -- viewed the film with pessimism in mind.  I enjoy the film just as much as most of the other Trek films.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Blah blah blah say what you want but this albums not bad.  Although all the old grunge bands still get an A, this album is a comeback whether you want to except it or not.  If you have never listened to grunge you need to check it out but Audioslave harnesses what people like and pulls it back into grunge.  Although it might not be full out good ole' grunge it they may be bringing back a long dead scene.  Check out Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Melvins, and Chris Cornell's solo stuff.  Check this stuff out and if you like it... Start a band.
B00008XEOI|5.0|Would anyone who bought the &quot;Collector's Gift Set&quot; like to comment?  No doubt the movie is a masterpiece and I am going to buy, but is this &quot;gift set&quot; worth getting or should I just pick up the regular version?  How are the items other than the DVD itself included in this set?  What is the &quot;book&quot; like?  Is it a picture book?  A word book?  Is it about the making of the movie or just a storybook about the plot?  Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you very much.
0553277472|4.0|Who knows what good and quality is after weeks on a complex Chautauqua with Pirsig in his widely recognized creative biography, Zen and the Art of Vehicle Maintenance.  This voyage into the fundamentals of classicism, romanticism, technology, anti-technology, Zen, quality, values, history, and relationships is definitely worth the experience despite times of ambiguity, brusqueness, inconsistency, and boredom.  Pirsig is an intellectual man, and he provides challenges and has expectations of at least a certain mental caliber for his readers.  I believe that few can truthfully claim that they completely enjoyed this book, but many of us are mature enough to understand that this book is certainly positively unique and rare to the literature genres and styles provided today.  Certainly, a book as rejected by editors prior to its publishing and as ironically internationally recognized and distinguished as ZATAOVM is today should be read with careful expecations and should be respected even by those readers who do not meet the par of its depths, complexities, and intellectual curiosity (and therefore, do not like the book).  <br />Even though I had fairly enjoyed the book, I found one thing very bothersome.  A major irony and drawback of this book is the central focus of relationship.  Till the end of the story, Pirsig convinces the reader that the voyage is a self-exploration (finding the self) through the filtering of unconscious memories prior to the conscious memories.  Phaedrus, an obsessive ghost, is in search of what is the ultimate fundamental right way of perceiving all things, how should we determine and prioritize our values, and what are the most important things in life.  It is he who reveals the answers to Pirsig and us, which concludes with a transitional focus back to Pirsig's relationship with his son, Chris.  Pirsig confuses the reader whether if his intention is to lecture on philosophy, connect the reader back to their old selves, or connect us back tothose who can help us find ourselves.  By the way, does he have any intention, emphasis, or purpose at all?  Or is intentionally providing us the freedom to extract according to our own capabilities and differences?  <br />Pirsig would probably not make a good filmmaker, but he is a wise man worth at least hearing about once in this lifetime.  It can be guaranteed that everyone who reads this book, whether if it is completely or half-way, will pick up not one but at least two beautiful wisdoms!  But again, everything is determined by mentality (perspective).  ZATAOVM is a masterpiece if you chose to see it that way, and it is trash if you chose to blind yourself that way.  Pirsig does not determine that but you.  You have the natural right of establishing and controlling your own reality, truth, and life purpose.  You can follow the crowd amidst your eyes, or be like Phaedrus -  create a third way to seeing things that are typically \\"black or white.\\"

Imagine my disappointment, indeed anger, at the incredibly stupid ending.<BR>I suppose etiqutte prohibits my revealing it but it both denies history and denies science. It was equivalent to a premise that, contrary to popular belief, FDR wasn't actually the president during the Second World War. I just couldn't beleive that Brown actually used this mindless device to end an otherwise enjoyable book.
0783240503|4.0|Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was a very entertaining movie. I really enjoyed the way they displayed the scenes and the costumes of each character. The actors were very creative with their lines and parts in the movie. I also enjoyed the way the actors brought other people from everyday life into their parts as their specific character. A big example of this was how the pharoah had many Elvis qualities in his character. In conclusion, I really enjoyed this movie and it will always be a classic.
0380018179|2.0|If you're looking for a long, romantic yarn, this is a pretty decent one.  The writing is quite good--you can feel the dust and heat of Australia, as it works its way under your skin.  And you feel for the protagonist; you feel for a woman who has few options in life, and who's life is inevitably chained to one man or another.  <br />Although I'm very sympathetic to this position, I felt a little bit lost inside of this woman's mind, and felt that her men were caricatures, rather than developed characters.  I wanted to be a part of her thinking, but this bias in the writing threw me off. <br />In the end, after hundreds of pages and a bit too much saga, we are to rejoice that her chains have become easier.  It's a little hard to swallow.  I don't think this qualifies as a feminist work.  I'd tell men to skip this one altogether, and advise readers that this is, ultimately, just a well-written romance novel, for better or for worse.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This is the true story of one of the greatest horses to run on American tracks.  The movie includes short overviews of society at the time.

In this book, Hemmingway tells a story of group conflict and romance.<BR> <BR> In this novel, Hemmingway tells the story of a man named Robert Jordan and his life as a guerilla soldier in the mountains of Spain in the year of 1937. In his journeys, Robert Jordan is allied with another soldier, Pablo, his lady, Pilar, and a girl named Maria. Robert Jordan is sent to these mountains on a mission to blow up a bridge. In his time with his these people, Jordan deals with conflict within the group and his growing interest with Maria. <br /> Ernest Hemmingway is very effective in telling the struggles of Robert Jordan when he is trying to blow up the bridge, and the romance he has with Maria. Hemmingway's descriptions of the bridge and the mountains of Spain creates a crystal clear image of the setting Robert Jordan is in. \\"The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass.\\"<br /> Hemmingway's character description in this novel is terrific. Each character is described with vivid details of their personality and physical characteristics. When talking about Robert Jordan, Hemmingway says, \\"The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes..\\" Hemmingway provides each character with their own individual description and background in this book.<br /> The plot of this novel is one of courage, loyalty, and romance. Hemmingway tells about an American man in an International Brigade who shows bravery in his mission to blow up a bridge. Hemmingway also describes his loyalty to his comrades in his time in the mountains. Most of all, Hemmingway tells of Jordan's growing love of the girl Maria. \\"Her teeth were white in her brown face and her skin and her eyes were the same golden tawny brown. She had high cheekbones, merry eyes, and a straight mouth with full lips. Her hair was the golden brown of a grain field..\\"<br /> Ernest Hemmingway uses wonderful diction throughout the entire novel. Hemmingway uses Spanish words and phrases often in this book such as, \\"Hola\\", \\"Salud\\", and \\"Dentro de la gravedad\\". All of these examples give more detail to the characters, and the Spanish culture as well. Hemmingway also uses imagery very well in this novel, always trying to give you the best mental picture possible of the situation. \\"..and the four knelt, looking very awkward with their heads against the wall and their hands by their sides, and Pablo passed behind them and shot each in turn in the back of the head with the pistol, going from one to another and putting the barrel of the pistol against the back of their heads, each man slipping down as he fired.\\"<br /> For Whom The Bell Tolls is a fairly easy-reading book and tells a very good story. This is a perfect example of Ernest Hemmingway at his best. He delivers a great account of one man's adventures in the civil war of Spain, while tying in romance and the brutality of war along with it.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Okay, so Keanu Reeves may not be the best actor in the world, and the Zion scenes may have needed some working on, but altogether, I thought this was a kick-ass movie!!!!It had plenty of action, which is probably 70% of the reason of why people love the matrix so much. If I can't tell a good movie from a bad one, then I guess I don't really want to, because otherwise I'd be watching movies like Titanic. Open your minds to new things!
B000089RVR|5.0|Of course one would compare this album to No Angel given that it is a sophomore release.  Even so, it is best to try to separate yourself from the previous album and not make a naturally possible comparison.  I think this album is amazingly well put together in such a way that it has a 'delayed' effect on the listener.  Most of the songs exist 'within a moment'.  In white flag, it is a happenstance meeting on a street, don't leave home exists within a blowup with your lover, sand in my shoes is in an apartment when you just get home.  Every song is a little chapter or story and the disc tells a message of love lost, wisdom gained and moving on into some great unknown.  There is such emotional impact on this disc that really can only come from someone in their late 20's or early 30's when life is taking off in many different directions, only amplified by the touching and natural ambience of Dido's voice.  I can't get off the silent echos of See You When You're Forty and the &quot;wouldn't have picked you out&quot; windy ending that literally puts you in a trance and carries you away in a complete moment.  <br />This disc is a sleeper like No Angel and is best sampled over time because the impact of the themes and various complexities are what make it great.  Otherwise, you might just pass this disc over and say it is boring.  Don't compare it and give it time.  It really is a touching piece of work...
B00001OH7P|5.0|As part of my growing interest/fasination/love in glam rock/proto punk of the 70's, I asked for Ziggy Stardust as a Christmas gift sometime last year. I got it for Christmas, thankfully and now truly charish it. Not only does it raise my status of David Bowie(who thanks to his cult classic Labrynth and his guilty pleasure 80's material such as &quot;Let's Dance&quot;) he has been placed in my mind as one of the few true visionaries of the music industry, even till this day.<br />As if to take cues from The Beatles, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust is a densely layered, compositional masterpiece. Each song is loaded with catchy hooks but meaty composistions that have so much going on in them its near impossible to catch everything the first listen. Which goes back to the reason Ziggy Stardust is such a blast to listen to, you can listen to it so dozens of times can still come back to hear more. Plus, just from listening to it, you can hear the impact that he would have on music to come(my first impression of this album was something of &quot;Before And After Science&quot; Brian Eno meets the early days of Talking Heads). Wirey and nervous, David Bowie's vocals are the key component in each song. He brings them together with surreal lyrics and adds tension thanks to an emotive delivery and suprising range. David Bowie is definitely one of the best frontmen in the history of Rock.<br />Unlike alot of so called classic rock, David Bowie(or Ziggy Stardust and his Spiders from Mars) truly does withstand the test of time. Crisp production is part of it but also fantastic songwriting keep it afloat and will forever make it a classic in my boat. While my tastes these days may lean in a more dance/techno/electronica direction, Ziggy Stardust will always be a welcome addition to my collection of music. A classic indeed.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I was a fan of the original revival recording with Bebe Neuwirth, so when I went to see the movie in Theatres, I was a little skeptical on whether it would be as good as the original stage version.  In fact, the film is just as good if not BETTER then the stage version. All the acting is really good, and the plot is much better then other modern movie musicals (cough cough, Moulin Rouge). If you're a fan of the movie &quot;Cabaret&quot; then you'll love &quot;Chicago&quot; written by the same people (Kander and Ebb). Velma (Katherine Zeta-Jones) starts it out with the opening number sure to stick in your head throughout the show and when you leave. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) sees Velma on the vaudville stage and she is determined to become a star.  A warning to parents, this is a dark comedy not meant for children under 16. Being that the comedy itself falls around Roxie killing her husband because she's furious, most of it takes place in Jail where we meet Matron &quot;mama&quot; Morton (Queen Latifah), one of the show's highlights. The &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot; is sure to stick in your head, also featuring  a cameo by Mya (yes, the pop singer).  In the duration of her stay at the Cook County Jail, Roxie  manages to win the heart of lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who decides to help her win the case and get out of jail.  Rivals soon erupt between Velma, who once hold the spotlight and newcomer Roxie. Eventually, everyone is pleased and you end up wondering whether you are or not. As I said earlier, this is a dark comedy and it is made to question you. If you feel kind of confused at the end, whether you should feel happy or angry at them, it is perfectly fine. This comedy makes you think. It questions our judicial system and our society's obsession with Murders and Court Cases. If you enjoyed &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; check out &quot;Chicago&quot;--it will surely beat them all!
0375703764|2.0|I was enticed to read this \\"work\\" because of the rave reviews it has received here.  I hope that mine, combined with the several other negative reviews, will dissuade others from embarking on this monumental waste of time.<br />It pains me to think this book was published.  There are talented authors out there putting pen to paper and developing haunting, timeless tales.  Often, there is little chance that their works will ever be distributed, because publishing companies would rather seek out bloated, self-absorbed material like \\"House of Leaves,\\" which can be marketed as \\"post-modern.\\"<br />I've been told this book is a \\"story-within-a-story,\\" but this much-used literary device seems lost in the quagmire.  Generally, such a technique only works if a) the stories can be logically connected and b) BOTH stories could more or less stand alone.<br />What I assume to be the main story in \\"House of Leaves\\" is about a house that I think appeared in some form in \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" and a myriad of [similar] works.  This story, while potentially an interesting, independent story, is lost because of a bizarre and totally uninteresting and unrelated \\"second\\" story about a young generation-nobody with all kinds of problems that sound rivetingly like an episode of 90210.  <br />This second story could never survive on its own without significantly more substance.  Oh, dear, Mr. Truant has phobias.  Well, isn't that remarkable.  Perhaps if the author had investigated the nature of phobias and derived a discourse about that mental challenge for a separate novel, this story could be interesting.  Here, it's written in the footnotes as a long-winded, pointless ramble about sex and isolation that has clearly been designed to create convolution in the thin plot of the \\"main\\" story.  <br />This book rates at several hundred pages, but the actual story could have fit in a collection of short stories.  Yes, like feces on canvas can be construed as art, random footnote placementand upside down text can be seen as a magnificent post-modern commentary.  However, to those who do not see art as merely a means to be bizarre, this \\"technique\\" is just an annoying, unoriginal attempt to extend the novel.<br />As a literary device, the text format does little to \\"lead you along\\" with the same confusion as the novel's characters face in their explorations.  I suppose stretching the phrase \\"and the rope snapped\\" onto several pages may work if a reader is so engrossed that he or she could barely wait to find out what happened.  Such is not the case with \\"House of Leaves.\\"  Before a reader can become interested in the story, the author takes another detour into his own pretensions, then returns to the other story after our interest has waned.<br />This book is simply not art.  It is not \\"post-modern,\\" or controversial, and most importantly, it is NOT a good book.  Basically, the book is mindless drivel most likely aimed at college students who still find awe in poorly articulated defiance.  For anyone else, you would find more post-modernism in Reader's Digest and more fright in an Anne Rice novel.
B000089RVR|5.0|She did it again. This is as good as the first album.<br />Now I like to see some Dido DVDs.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This film, in my opinion is a fantastic fusion of action and an excellent plot.  This movie uses groundbreaking special effects to compliment one of the deepest plots in any recent film.  The main character Neo(Keanu Reeves) is a hacker who is contacted by Morpheus and informed that he is &quot;The One&quot; who will save the &quot;Real World&quot; and that the world we live in is a computer program designed to use humans as batteries to use for energy for the robots that have taken over the world.  The rest of the movie chronicles Neo's quest to save the human race.  The plot in this movie keeps the viewer thinking, wile the action keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I would recommend this film to all action film lovers as well as someone just looking for a movie that is a technical masterpiece.
B00005N90N|4.0|I do really like this video, it has a great feel of 1988 and most of the songs are superb. My only complaint is the bass throughout, it sounds really clangy and you even hear Bruce complaining about it (I think he asks the engineer to turn it down a bit). Maybe that's how they liked the bass back in the day, or maybe if you play this video through a good quality sound system it wont sound so naff (I have a crappy TV set) but anyway it's not the end of the world, and apart from this, the video rocks. Recommended.
0425074811|3.0|Daniken has sold over 60 million copies of his 9 books worldwide. He is a man you can look up to, he rose from waiting tables in Switzerland to being a hack philosopher. But here is something for the teenagers going gaga over his work.<br />His basic premise was clever, that our ancestors were approached and affected by aliens, for the same reasons that X-Files has caught the fancy of our generation. Most of it however is unsupported and some of it plain screwball.<br />Basically his big breakthrough came when he found the critical piece of evidence to back up his theories -- the Palenque Stone in Mexico. He claimed that a large stone in the temple at Palenque had a carving of a creature sitting as if inside a rocket. In truth though, archaeologist and Mayan expert Dr Ian Graham explained his view of the figure on the Palenque Stone -- that there was no proof that this being sitting inside a &quot;rocket&quot; was a &quot;spaceman.&quot; There weren't any oxygen tubes for examples, which would have been easy to sculpt by even &quot;primitive people&quot; such as Mayans. It was a standard Mayan face as is seen all around in the architecture of that period.<br />Several quotes from the bible such as &quot;a celestial beam of light&quot; etc were spun to reflect space travel (tractor beams of a space craft for e.g.) After several spells of ups and downs (for financial peccadiloes) Daniken's credibility was finally undermined after he was unable to substantiate claims made in another book, &quot;Gold of the Gods,&quot; that he had photographed metal plaques containing the wisdom of extraterrestrials. In 1977, a BBC Horizon programme, The Case of the Ancient Astronauts, took a rational look at his theories and showed them to be pseudo science.<br />Several other such &quot;wonders&quot; cited by von Daniken as corroboration for his theories were similarly debunked. In the late 1970s he rapidly disappeared from the public arena, and in 1982 he could not find an English or American publisher for his 10th book.  As though this were not enough, the guy has been arrested several times for petty crimes such as defrauding his hotelier boss in Zurich, to more elaborate ones such as being in unpaid bad debts of up to Euro 350,000.<br />While his books make for a fun read, primarily &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; as this is perhaps the only one that comes close to credibility, it is not a great idea to go about bandying ideas contained therein with a delusional passion usually associated with farts.

B00004XOWM|3.0|Can't say that I am a big fan of Limp Bizkit, but some of their songs are ok. Some are completely horrible. Hot dog is a crappy song but the rest didn't seem as bad as some of the reviews I read. So I am going to go 50-50 with this album.
B0000065O1|3.0|After working out with Cindy's &quot;Shape Your Body&quot; workouts for months, I was thrilled to take the &quot;Next Challenge&quot;.  The leg work/cardio (first 20-25 minutes) is terrific, but I found that the abs and arms in the Shape your Body workouts did much more for me.  I now do her leg work and switch to the original tapes for the other sections.  If you don't have Shape your Body - skip this one and buy that instead.  That tape offers two 45 minutes workouts that provide overall toning.  Alternate the two workouts once or twice a week and you will see changes in your body that you never imagined.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I have seen it before, the running of 13-year-old girls to a britny spears concert. I felt sorry for them and scoffed then burst out laughing. That reminds me of this CD mostly. Think I have never listened to it? No, the radio plays this crap a lot and therefore, I switch the station to something better like... nails on a chalkboard. She can't sing, and she's the worst role model for anybody. She even called herself a [huffy] (I'm not going to say what she actually said for the fear of being edited.)<BR>If you like britny spears, and if you are 13, it is time to find yourself a band with real music.
0156027321|5.0|'Life of Pi' is an engaging and memorable book that I would recommend wholeheartedly. This is an amazingly creative, if not slightly gory, story of 16 year old boy called Pi and his 7 month pacific ordeal. The books religious themes and 450 pound bengal tiger companion allow 'Life of Pi' to transcend a typical castaway story that might otherwise have lacked the originalty and spirit that Pi shines with due to his unique experience of this planet. Ultimately without giving up on itself 'Life of Pi' allows itself to be examined while still remaining true to the reader and it's own heart. An amazing book for anyone who likes to read and for all those who thought they didn't. I commend Yann Martel for his excellent work and ingenuity.
0312962118|5.0|When I first saw the book, I thought it to be some silly James Bond-like novel, without any knowledge of history in general and Russian history in particular. But after reading the reviews I desided to give it a try.<br />Am I glad of that!<br />It recreates athmosphere of the era as good as Alan Furst, and the blend of fact and fiction is very intriguing. The characters are well-drawn and realistic (and believe me, very few American writers can write realistic Russian characters, and not Crazy Ivan stereotypes).<br />The characters are not in the way of the action, but the action also doesn't get in the way of characters. These people have reasons for the things they say and do, and these are personal reasons, and not just moving the plot.<br />I'm not sure in some of the geography of the novel (I think that distances between Moscow, Novgorod and Leningrad wouldn't allow the characters to cover them in the time it took them in the novel)- but that's the only point against the novel I can think of.<br />This is one of those novels that prove, that a great thriller, doesn't have to be &quot;as current as the headlines&quot; - great story and great characters matter far more!
B000002G87|5.0|After owning this album for 33 or so years, now amongst a collection of 2000+ others, there is no longer any question in my mind that it is the greatest rock album ever made.  Certainly there's other artists whose careers in total have surpassed EC's, (no not those boring Stones) but no one ever put together such a heartfelt, overwhelmingly powerful yet elegant collection.  It is a greatest hits collection yet the story and music are one very coherent whole.<br />What is it that makes it so great? First and foremost its the musicianship, the seamless call and response of the guitar and vocal duets, the feeling that every note that is there should be yet there are no unnecessary extras.  Whatever led to this, whether it was the players' mucical skills, the combination of personalities, the Florida location, the personal inspiration, or the drugs, I don't know, but something was created which is greater than what mortal beings should be able to produce.<br />It was a magical, unrepeatable time in music.  In fact I remember seeing the group shortly after the album's release on the old Dean Martin show (sans Duane of course) and thought the playing uninspiring and tired, although I'm sure its hard to put it all together for a few songs on a TV show.<br />What's dangerous about it? Make no mistake, every song on the album is great, but Little Wing has long been able to take over my mind and cut me off from the outside world.  Other songs have come along which can do this for a few months, but only Little Wing has been able to do this so completely and for so many years.  To me it blows Hendrix's original completely out of the water. I won't get into details about what happened this morning, but I'll just say I have to be way more careful about driving when this song comes up on the CD player.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Technically, this movie is brilliant.  Artistically, it leaves a lot to be desired.  The first movie was full of suspence, mystery, and tension.  This movie feels like an afterthought.  Honestly, if you cut out all the FX and unnecessarily long fight scenes, the movie would be 20 minutes long.<br />As for the DVD: no commentary, no deleted scenes, no interview with the directors... surely there must be something on here to make up for the glaring abscence of those features.  What's this?  some... commercials?  and.. Justin Timberlake?  Seriously, the DVD is one giant commercial for Powerade, Samsung, MTV, and other products in the Matrix series (the Enter the Matrix game, the Animatrix...etc.)<br />As hyped as this movie was and as much money as it made, it surely could've gotten the extended, collector's edition treatment.  I can only conclude that the Wachowski's were busy with the final movie in the trilogy and had no time for this release.  I sure hope it was worth it.<br />Of course if you're a Matrix fan, you've already bought this, so my point is moot.
B0000B3FCX|1.0|This type of music represents everything that is soul-less and wrong about Rock music today.  Do not buy this corporate spineless schlock.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is one of the greatest cd I've have every listened to. I'm not from Iceland but the instrumentals are enough to pull you in. Ever since I saw Vanilla Sky, I have listened to Sigur Ros and went out and bought all their cds. It's a great cd and everybody should listen to it once.
B000002MIB|4.0|Well, this mammoth double live album finally arrived in 1993 after VH fans had waited for so long.  I am also going to point out that I like Sammy and Dave equally, so don't expect me to get into that Sammy vs. Dave thing.  <BR>But many still feel (myself included) that this album could have been even better.  There are a few problems which almost ruined an otherwise excellent performance by the band.  First of all, the sound quality is somewhat poor, with the instruments warbling and echoing too much at times.  The loudest thing on here is Alex's crash cymbal.  Why the heck is it so loud?  Also, the song selection could have been better, unless you are a huge fan of every song off For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.  To be honest, I really felt that if the band replaced Man On a Mission, Spanked, and In N Out with, say, Runnin With the Devil, And The Cradle Will Rock, and Dance the Night Away from the Roth era, this would easily be a five star album.  Also, Sammy could have done without suddenly doing Cabo Wabo right in the middle of You Really Got Me, or stopping Panama so he could try to &quot;rap&quot; to the audience.<BR>How about the upside to this album?  Well, we can start with Eddie, of course. Although 316 does go on for a whopping 11 and a half minutes, his guitar work on here is simply amazing, as with all of the other songs.  He also includes Eruption within this track, it is at the very end of it.  Alex's drum solo is another highlight (despite the crash cymbal), and even Michael Anthony gets a chance to do a BASS solo.  Give him a thumbs up for trying but he's just not a good bass player.  Live versions of the few Roth tunes on here sound great, despite the fact that I really don't think Hagar wanted to sing them at all.  When Its Love and Dreams sound fabulous.  Despite it's highly overplayed studio counterpart, I liked the live version of Right Now.  And I also loved the fact that Poundcake, in my opinion one of Van Halen's most underappreciated songs, is played on here with the drill and everything.  Runaround is another good track.  And of course, the mother of all VH songs, Jump, is on here, although with the aforementioned poor sound quality the synthesizer can't even be heard throughout much of the song.<BR>So there you have it, a bunch of Van Hagar stuff and not enough Roth era tunes on here.  No disrespect to Sammy, but I think that more Roth era songs would have made this a better album.
B00005JMEW|5.0|It is a revenge film, and scorpios probably will love it.<br />It has nice details.<br />It depicted various human nature with the first woman that Uma found again.<br />Parts of it has the comic book feel... but it must be a nice comic book.
B00006V9A0|3.0|There's great Nirvana songs on here, don't get me wrong, and 'You Know You're Right' is well worth the price of the cd alone (in my opinion at least).  But they could've included so much more.  Tracks like 'Blew', 'Love Buzz', 'Big Cheese', 'Dive', 'Anuerysm', 'Stain', 'Paper Cuts', 'Scentless Apprentice', and 'On a Plain' are all missing.  Other rare tracks could've been included, namely 'Oh, the Guilt' and 'Sappy'.  If you really want to, you could buy this.  But other than that, just download 'You Know You're Right'
B0000027RL|5.0|Even if you're not into grunge (does anyone call it that anymore?) or PJ fan this is still a great album.  PJ has gone on to record other great songs but this one is still their best work to date and worth picking up if you're a fan of music, not just a fan of PJ.
078062999X|5.0|This is by far the best version of Hamlet and I've seen them all so I know this is the best. This version is the only one that I've seen that doesn't cut out any part of the play. It is performed in it's entirety, and even though it's a little modernistic it still holds the truest to the original play written by Shakespeare himself. Kenneth Branagh as well as the rest of the cast did an amazing job at conveying the correct emotions and staying true to the story. It is an excellent movie and everybody should see it.
B000002UZ4|4.0|Not only does this album contain two new tracks but it also contains PSB singles that were never released in the US.  If you like the PSB I recommend this.  If you're new this is a great place to start.  Highly recommended.

0471381985|5.0|This is a very lucid, practical introduction to the principles of value investing. It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold.
B000024ZLX|5.0|I want to say I really enjoyed the initial listen to this album but it left me intrigued and wanting to know why.  As with many PF tracks (esp the Waters solo albums) the listener goes through discover, learn, and participate phases with this music; the more you listen the more you are drawn in.  This album integrates the blues and real vocal themes as well as any PF release and sets the stage for Roger's solo material. The title track gives the listener real blues, real lyrics, and an invitation to really sing out. When completed you feel an emotional release just in time to rev up to Not Now John - Superb.  I cannot understand why the editors cut up the original release of The Hero's Return and removed the \\"trading human cogs for machines\\" verse.  They took a good portion of the soul of this music. C'mon folks, let the artist do his thing. While not my favorite PF album it remains one of my most listened to pieces.  It was worth the investment to discover and learn the lyrics and riffs.  On a sentimental day, this album delivers. Something changed when Syd left the band and Roger took over.  The same can be said for when Roger left and David took the helm.  This album reveals the advantages for Roger to go solo.  I love ya' David but compare \\"2 Suns in the Sunset\\" to \\"Dogs of War\\" and see the magic fade.  As for the critics so harsh on this release...Rolling Stone says \\"Combat Rock\\" was the best album of the 80s; please, enough said.
B0000524CY|5.0|They say films like They, Scream, and I Know What You Did Last summer are scary, and say that this film is boring. Well most of it is due to the fact that when it was advertised as the scariest film ever they went in with there buds with the intent on makinf fun of it. And the people like the ring? The Ring has nothing on this. For one this this movie actually scares you with visuals and psychological. That's right teens you have to allow it terrify you because gore just isn't scary. So go back to your black comedies, and us intelligent people will get scared. For all those that laughed at it I have to say they should have let it scare them because they mist out on a wild ride.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is an exciting and sometimes confusing adventure about a WWII bomber named Yossarian, and his atempts to get out of the war alive.  I read this book for pleasure. I recomend reading this book if you are looking for a great book about as crazy as a book can be.  The first couple chapters of Catch-22 and some vocabulary may be a little daunting to the reader, but the book is well worth the time to read.     <BR>     This book was amazing.  I do not think I have ever read any thing this funny one minute then horrifying the next.  The book is funny in how the world around Yossarian seems totaly absurd and impossible.  Unfortunatly in a military setting Catch-22 may also be shockingly closer to reality then first presumed.  I think more people who have been in the military at some point in time will enjoy reading this book than someone who has never been in the military
B0000524CY|5.0|Comically Horrifying, October 15, 2003 Reviewer: A viewer from San Diego, CA United States is obviously afraid of something that he can't control, like the fact that he was going to be criticised for saying what he said. I mean it's not this film's fault that it's the scariest movie. I mean Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, and Halloween aren't scary. I mean they have things that you can stop and control and defeat. They're living things. They can be stopped, but the supernatural have no rules, and they can do things like this. Oh and this is based on a true story, and rarely these days do they happen, because, if you believe in God, Satan doesn't want the foolish sheep of the earth to think he exists. The people of our time rely on science, but science has caused more the death and destruction, and hasn't helped man-kind that much, except it made him weak and greedy. I like technology, but it has turned our society into morally corupt people. Anyway to the film, Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his controversial bestseller, this shocking 1973 thriller set an intense and often-copied milestone for screen terror with its unflinching depiction of a young girl who is possessed by an evil spirit. Jason Miller and Max von Sydow are perfectly cast as the priests who risk their sanity and their lives to administer the rites of demonic exorcism, and the mother can only stand by in horror as her daughter's body is wracked by satanic disfiguration. Unfortunately this film has gained alot of flack recently, mostly because it was popularized and marketed as \\"The Scariest Movie Ever Made\\" and that did it no favors. There are always people out there who like to tear down the popular horror films, and support crap like 28 Days Later. I mean what's so funny about watching your own daughter be possessed by the devil, and basically being mentally tormented and disrurbed as you watch her desecrate and harm her own body. I mean these people who claim to laugh at this, could very well be the same people who laughed at all those who died in the 9/11 attacks. Viewing this film in there mindset is like watching Saving Private Ryan and laughing at all the soldiers who died. I mean why is it that you guys find real life attrocities like this funny? Do you think it makes you look tough or something? It's pathetic that people these days won't watch a scary movie with the intent on allowing it to scare them. That's like watching a comedy and watching it so that it won't make you laugh. This film won't only effect you if you allow it, and to do otherwise shows ignorance and the maturity level of a 5 year old who pitches a fit when his mother tells him he can't have a cookie. Stop making fun of horror films, and just let them scare you. That means quit watching them in broad day lights with all your buds, and watch it alone with the lights out. If the intent of the movie is to scare you, the let it scare you. This film's intent was to scare and it accomplishes it's goal effectively. This girl is possessed literally by evil. This is the only documented account of an exorcism. Other records have been destroyed. Out of respect to the people involved names and charcters were changed, but the events in this film are true, and if you don't believe, then you'll be in for a surprise when you die. Go ahead and vote this review unhelpful, that's what I expect from all you people, but that won't change the fact that I'm right and your wrong. Watch the film as it was meant to be watched, and take it seriously. Otherwise what's the point of watching a scary movie? we turn to science to make the puzzle whole what lies beyond those hollowed eyes we'll be defeated, destroyed by our own ghosts when the last grave has emptied when the last shred of hope melts away an endless swarm of damnation will swallow the last of humanity into the black. the soils of hell shall keep them coming our feeble planet overrun with the legions of the dead. May you all see the darkness that I have seen.ave seen.
B000075A8D|5.0|IT'S GREAT, FANTASTIC! THE BEST OF PEARL JAM EVER. THEY'VE REINVENTED THEMSELVES. BUY IT KNOW, DOWNLOAD IT, DO WHAT U WANT, BUT U MUST LISTEN TO THIS RECORD. OF COURSE, U CAN ALSO BUY A CD, BUT ITS NOT THE SAME................ U KNOW?<BR>ENJOY IT!!!
B000002UTY|5.0|This is without a doubt Quicksilver's best and some of the best rock that came out of 1960s San Francisco . I'll admit some aspects of the album are a little dated , like the twenty-five min. jam that starts off the album(and if you pay attention is edited down a little from an even longer jam)but is still worth listening to . Another high point is &quot;mona&quot; which at least I thought was over-all more interesting and done better than any of Bo Diddley's versions....Sadly though this album (and Quicksilver) are always over looked as a classic rock experience and for some reason QMS is always in the shadows of the Dead , the Airplane , and Janis Joplin/Big brother
0810160064|5.0|In the late 1870s, Robert Louis Stevenson needed cash to break dependence on his parents so he could go to the woman he loved (and they did not).  A chronic invalid, he also needed adventure.  He decided to do some travel writing and one such trip is recounted in TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY.  He headed off to the remote Cevennes mountain range of south central France and got himself kitted out nicely, so nicely, he needed assistance in carrying everything.  Enter Modestine, a donkey.  He might as well have attempted to harness and pack up a cat.  Thus, to a deft narrative that works in powerful landscape description, sketches of country folk met along the way, and a revisiting of the region's dramatic history, he adds the self-deprecating wit that would become a model for his 20th century counterparts like Peter Fleming, Eric Newby, and Bill Bryson.  Though his commentary moves along at a swift but casual gait, it builds a tension on the upside, beginning with the age-old legend of the murderous Beast of Gevaudan that haunts a neighborhood where he finds the peasantry by turns hostile and friendly and accommodations primitive.  Near the summit, a visit to a monastery introduces the religious theme that will attend his descent into the beautiful land of the Camisards, the friction between Protestants and Catholics that erupted into a tragic civil war in the first decade of the 18th century.  Stevenson does a fine job of sorting out the history and evoking the awe that comes with visiting the deceptively bucolic scene.  No wonder this book has continued to inspire: it often appears on recommended lists and it prompted Romantic biographer Richard Holmes to retrace the journey early in his career, a century later, complete with a donkey of his own (see his book FOOTSTEPS).  The critical introduction to this edition is worthwhile.
B0000797IO|5.0|'When you're a kid, you view life like a candy store.'<br />One could think of this movie as a candy store, with it's various asthetic delights.  The scenary, the actors, the script.<br />Let us not dwell on the magnificent display of talent Jennifer Aniston has in The Good Girl, with her slow way of speaking, her schlumpy body posture, her every being resonating the hopelessness her character, Justine, feels.  It's Oscar worthy and the Academy made a huge mistake. <br />But let us focus instead on the stellar cast that are just pitch-perfect to every line of Mike White's screenplay.  They round out the story perfectly, paralleling Justine's transformation to quiet brooding housewife/cashier to adultress. <br />The movie is also filmed beautifully, with vibrant scenes shifting throughout the various seasons, also mirroring the shift of Justine's character and integrity.  It's like Phil( Justine's husband)'s line. \\"The wind. It's blowing different.\\"   Justine undergoes a radical change in character, making poor choices and being anything but good. But at the core, she is 'the good girl'..she does what is right. What is expected.<br />'The Good Girl' is at best, a dark comedy that deftly drives the idea home that the choices we make are everlasting, and they affect everyone around us.
0375432302|1.0|Mr. Brown has gone on record saying that the assertions he makes in this book regarding the conspiratorial influence of the Catholic church are accurate.  His &quot;research&quot;, however, is<br />based almost entirely on dubious accounts. What scholarly information he does use is taken out of context and spun to support laughable conclusions.<br />I found Mr. Brown's suggestions concerning the repression of the &quot;sacred feminine&quot; chauvinistic at best and just plain goofy.<br />I am not a Catholic, but if I were I would be offended and troubled by this inflamatory hokum.  It strikes me as the kind of trash that fuels intolerence and persecution.
B000022TSY|5.0|The characters portrayed in this great film represent the very epitome of the 1960s baby-boomer mindset, along with the spirit of the masses who used the Vietnam War as an excuse to be bums.  The progeny of the folks who won World War II, these young boomer-drifters were aimless and lazy; the film opens with two of these bums equipping themselves with money via an illegal heroin deal (trashing, no doubt, the lives of the drug users and their families, not to mention the folks they had to rip off in order to fund their addictions).  We then watch this pair, one a sedated pot-head and the other a lunatic pot-head, drift toward New Orleans for a big drunk party, picking up along the way another equally purposeless bum (the great Jack, in a stunning role!).  The plot plays out in an appropriate fashion for people who live their lives in this repulsive manner.<br />This is a great film, don't miss it.  It's the anthem of a generation, the once-bums who are now approaching retirement, preparing to drain the life out of Social Security.  Always bumming off somebody else, these dudes.
6305428042|4.0|Thsi movie seemed to get a bad rap at the time of its release. I remember numerous people commenting on how stupid it is. However, I think that's unjust. The cast is a riot namely the three witches perfectly played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy. The plot revolves around these three witches coming back to life 300 years after being hanged. they then set off to take the lives of every child in Salem so they can live forever. As ludicrous as the plot seems, the three bumbling, wise-cracking and sometimes pitifully stupid witches are so fun on screen, that the plot isn't even really anything to focus on. And of course, Bette gets her chance to sing at an adult Haloween party, when at the same time she's cursing all of them to &quot;dance until they die.&quot; I always oddly find myself singing along. This movie is great fun not only on Halloween but year round.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is an amalgamation of everything it is I hate about summer movies.  It's lifeless, soulless, crafted without the slightest care towards genuine enjoyment, and serves as nothing more than a springboard for a charisma-free star.  I'm still flabbergasted over the irony that the inspiration for the existence of this movie was Indiana Jones, the trilogy that represents the summer blockbuster at its very best.<br />Tomb Raider boasts something of a plot, but actually deciphering it is a puzzle.  Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is apparently some sort of rich archaeologist, and her latest personal mission is to search for two artifacts that, if placed together, can somehow enable the user to control time.  Naturally, there are going to be a lot of villains who seek the same device.<br />General incomprehensibility of the plot aside, the aspect that makes Tomb Raider the turd that it is is Lara Croft, both in the way this character is written and through Jolie's portrayal.  Here is a heroine who thinks she's just uber-cool, riding motorcycles, wearing slick shades, acting cocky and arrogant, to the point of pure abrasiveness.  This is not to mention that she's also able to accomplish physically implausible to impossible stunts, and is also apparently invincible in combat, and almost impervious to pain.<br />What kind of a heroine is this?  It's hard enough to like someone who spends most of her time trying to act superior to almost everyone around her (the movie does give a half-hearted attempt to show her respect for other cultures, this brief scene totally overshadowed by her \\"coolness\\"), but the filmmakers do away with even the slightest bit of suspense by making Croft apparently invulnerable to harm in all her surroundings.  Part of what made Indiana Jones so charming were his numerous flaws: he was afraid of snakes, often got captured by the villains, and was vulnerable in combat (he got beat up a LOT).  This is in stark contrast with Croft, who's really nothing more than a superhero without the villain to match her.  <br />Some of this could be forgiveable if the movie were in any way fun or exciting, but it's not.  The action sequences are few in number, and what little there are are rapid-cut and packed with one impossible stunt too many.  The movie's adventure holds no ebb and flow, Croft simply gets from one location to another in a second of screen time.  <br />It's not impossible to make an enjoyable Indiana Jones knock-off.  Stephen Sommers' The Mummy accomplished the task with exuberance and childish glee.  But Simon West merely gave us little more than a case of eyestrain.<BR>1/2 out of *****
0800141865|5.0|What a great movie!!  Commanding performances by all, especially Courtney Love.  What a haunting and brilliant performance by her as the beautiful and damned Althea Flynt, in my opinion this role hit her close to home.. she is great!
630157401X|5.0|My personal favorite of the series, this is the most consistently entertaining of the bunch (which says a LOT). Except for the climactic tank chase, none of the action here really surpases what was accomplished in Temple of Doom in terms of sheer thrills (though a motorcycle chase and zeppelin battle come close), but that's okay. The point of The Last Crusade is that it intends to be a more mature and character-oriented addition to the trilogy, thanks to the addition of Sean Connery, who makes a wonderful dramatic and comedic duo with Harrison Ford. Ford, in particular, delivers the best and most difficult performance of his career. Difficult, you say, but he's just reprising a role he's played twice before, right? True, but this time he has to craft Jones as a character with his own flaws and demons (exemplified by his strained relationship with his father) while still maintaining the larger-than-life action heroics. He pulls it off with flying colors.
B000001FS3|5.0|I was first introduced to &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; as an awkward 14 year old plunged kicking and screaming into the depths of early-nineties grunge rock. Two worn casettes and one CD later, the album stands alone as a collection of the favorite music of my life. My older and at least somewhat wiser self now recognizes an important aspect of this work that my teenage self could not. Aside from the grand, desert sunrise opening, heartfelt lyrics, and unforgettable guitar work, one of the most endearing qualities of the album is its timelessness and likeability for people of all ages, ethnicities, beliefs, and values. The simple truth: I have never, in many hundreds of conversations over the years, had anyone tell me that they hate &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. Some certainly like it more than others, but it seems that almost everyone can find at least one track or piece of the work that they enjoy. For some it is the deep, thrashing guitar riffs in &quot;Exit&quot;, riffs that conjure images of later works by Pearl Jam and other staples of the nineties. For others it is the powerful simplicity and utter joy drummed up in &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;. Even my father, a lifelong country music fan, found alot to hold on to. Do I sound overly sentimental? Yup, but I don't care. Besides, any album that, upon playing, causes a normally shy singer to belt out its anthems to rock romanticism should have at least some value, shouldn't it?
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Wow.... This soundtrack is just amazing. It's on my top 5 list. I didn't mind the titles of the tracks being messed up as much as I did the length. The length is extremely short compared to the lenght of the movie. Usually, composers have to cut down their music drastically to be able to fit it onto a cd, but this one seems like it was thrown together in a rush. Also, the Cpt. Jack theme ran a little too much throughout. All in all, this is a wonderfull soundtrack. The score really adds emotion to the movie. Let's hope Badelt lenghtens the score for the upcoming sequel!
B00005R1N3|5.0|Before John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Sean S. Cunningham's FRIDAY HE 13th, there was a relatively unknown horror film back in 1974 called BLACK CHRISTMAS directed by Bob Clark. Actually one of the first modern style 'slasher' films after PSYCHO, this film clearly knows quite literally how to scare the hell out of anybody that watches it (and you don't have to be in the cinema for this one to scare you).<br /> Set a few days before Christmas Eve, a bunch of girls are about to leave a north American university sorority house for the holidays. What happens next is pretty obvious (psycho walks into house and starts killing the few innocent girls that remain including a young Olivia Hussey). The plot may be fairly simple but as the other reviews suggest, it is this movie not HALLOWEEN or FRIDAY THE 13th that came first and unlike its latter films, Bob Clark really knows how to pull out all the scares without having to resort to the tacky knee jerk tactics or 'fake' scares which most modern films now have to resort to. Instead, very effective techniques are used such as using lots of shadows, an unseen killers face throughout the movie and most importantly the menacing phone calls which are the most disturbing factor in this film.<br />Some of you may prefer the later 'well known' horror flicks but trust me if you want to be scared and I mean really scared, watch this film and you will really see why I have awarded it a well deserved five star status.
0807261785|5.0|My Amozon Review: Lemony Snicket has made a great start to an astonishing line of spell binding books. \\"The bad beginning\\" in my opinion is one of the greatest books I have read. The book begins at a beach in New England where three children named Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. They found out that there house perished in a fire and along with their parents. A family friend helps them along the way to a new life and a new family. But bad luck keeps following them wherever they go. At the first house they meet count olf. He is a scheming man with a hankering for the Baudelaire children's fortune at any cost! The details Lemony Snicket uses in the story make you feel the emotions that the Baudelaire children are going through. Count Olaf is nasty in more ways then one! Count Olaf treats the children like scum and makes them do all of his chores and some that he doesn't need done. Count Olaf is abusive to the children and even makes them cook dinner. Snicket has done a smashing job by writing this book and expressing the emotions of his characters and this book is a must read!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|My friend first gave me this cd to listen to acouple of days ago, and i cannot stop listening to it. It takes you on a ride you will not believe, this is an album i have waited years and years for, the kind of album you can get lost in. I did like their last cd , but this is way better. It has incredible songmanship in it. James iha does a wonderful job playing guitar too. If you want an album to dream to , zone out too , this is a must. Best album i have heard in at least 5 years
B00005NRO3|5.0|Movie Very Funny At Times Pretty Scary At Times!!!
B000002UAX|5.0|I won't spend much time explaining the music in here. The Beatles are simply THE MUSIC at its best expression and this is one of their best cds. Anyone who dares to discuss if they are the greatest band ever, will get in big trouble trying to prove their points. Buy any Beatles album, you won't never ever get dissapointed. The bad reviews I was reading about their albums couldn't be more IMMATURE. So there you go.
B000089RVR|4.0|Even at first listen, this CD really struck a chord. Although it has a slightly different feel than her previous album, it still shows growth. Only downside to this album is the crackling noise heard on a few songs, including &quot;Don't Leave Home.&quot;  Here's a rundown of the tracks:<br />1. White Flag - Her first released single, great song, probably the best on the album.<BR>2. Stoned - Gloomy, but a nice change.  Great driving music. A definite favorite.<BR>3. Life for Rent - Sweet song, listen a few times and you'll get to like this song a lot.<BR>4. Mary's in India - Slow song, but a good story.<BR>5. See You When You're 40 - Great lyrics, overall great song.  One of my favorites.<BR>6. Don't Leave Home - Could be her second single. Chorus is nice and her voice is powerful.<BR>7. Who Makes You Feel - Worst song on the CD. Has no substance.<BR>8. Sand In My Shoes - Summery song, it's catchy but not that great. <BR>9. Do You Have A Little Time - Another favorite. Great intro. I love the cool instrumental sounds in the entire song.<BR>10. This Land Is Mine - Didn't like this one.  Too country for me, but I guess other country fans might like it.<BR>11. See The Sun - Mellow song, average.<br />The only reason I gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the static/crackling heard on 2 or 3 songs. Overall, I would definitely recommend this CD to any Dido fan. You won't be disappointed.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles are simply THE MUSIC at its best expression and this is one of their greatest albums. Whoever dares to discuss if the Beatles are the greatest band ever, will get in big troubles to prove their points. <BR>The bad reviews I could read about their albums, couldn't be more IMMATURE so there you go, the difference between someone educated musically and not.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy is the most intelligent and beutiful sci-fi movies. DONT BELIEVE IN JEALOUS PEOPLE THAT ARE FANS OF OTHER MOVIES WHEN THEY SAY IT'S TRASH. If you don't understand the first one don't see the 2nd one, you're going to be confused and you will not understand it.THE MATRIX RULESSSSS!!!!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|I think this has to be the best Disney Movie ever, no matter how it was altered. I do think the new song &amp;quot;Morning Report&amp;quot; was a little corny, but it added a little something to the Special Edition. I think no matter if it had sex written in the cloud when Simba fell, or it didnt, this movie had a great impact on everyones life and will never be forgotten. Good Job to Disney and Keep up the Good work. Now, the next big project for Disney is to top &amp;quot;The Lion King&amp;quot; Let's see if they can do that!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I've bever seen the first Matrix, But when this one came out in the theatres we decided to go. There is no posible way to describe the realism of the special effects...i was littereally &quot;on the edge of my seat&quot; without realizing it. I have never, ever, seen computer graphics like these...in fact, i had no idea some of these things were possible being a fan of computer effects. it is just amazing weather you understand the story or not. I must add, there is this temporary boring part near the middle ,i guess that's from my lack of understanding of the movie..but then it picks back up again and there is this amazing highway chase sequence (one of the other parts in the movie that stick out are when Neo is kicking this guys @$$ who multiplies himself)and it's just continuously accelarating until the end of the movie where it cuts off and tells you to watch &quot;the matrix revelutions&quot; which was ok i guess-gives you even more reason to watch the next one. ANYWAY awsome, awsome i definatly recomend to all the special effects fans especially.<BR>I have not yet seen the DVD but plan on getting it...i really don't like widescreen versions very much unles they are used w/ a widescreen tv ,there's a concept!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I really enjoyed the Fellowship of the Ring, and found the Two Towers to be even more enjoyable.  I have read and love the books, and was mildly irritated (very at times) by some of the differences between the books and the movies.  I was particularly annoyed by the way the character of Faramir was portrayed in the movie.  I can't imagine how they plan to carry the Faramir they created in the movie over to the Return of the King while staying at all true to Tolkein's story.  That being said, I think what all fans of the books need to keep in mind when watching the movies is that it is not possible to stick to the story exactly - the movies would be both incredibly long and boring.  As much as I loved the books, there were parts of them that were slow moving.  This is acceptable for a book, even necessary, but not for a movie.  Everything needs to be more dramatic on screen.  In addition, Jackson has the unenviable task of appealing to both die-hard Tolkein devotees, of which there are many, and the general public at the same time.  I think we all need to cut the guy some slack.  So far, the movies are for the most part well-done, and I for one plan to see Return of the King on opening weekend!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|the series should never have been cancelled.  Buy lots of these sets in the hopes that they bring it off of hiatus!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I think is amazing how this movie managed to survive the hype created by the first movie (The Matrix). It has some weak points, but i think it is much bigger and better than the first one in terms of action and plot.<br />The producers really took care of the technical details, like how Trinity uses a well known SSH1 bug to enter in a computer system.<br />In short, enjoy the movie and judge yourself if is good or not (ignore the geek trolls than seek religion on a action movie :)).
0385512104|3.0|I loved the perspective from the 15 year old autistic boy.  However the plot went down some crazy avenues.  What started out as a very interesting light mystery turned sinister and nothing was really wrapped up in the end.  I ended up hating both parents for their lack of backbone.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I think some people need to relax here! I mean, come on, people, this is not an oscar movie! hello? Stop putting this film down. I think they did a good job here. This is just a very entertaining film. Something different. If u want real drama then rent/buy something else. The highway scene was very well staged too. Boring in some parts I agree, but overall this was fun to watch.
B0000931OG|4.0|There's something wrong with the album's consistency that's difficult to explain.  Various song styles are represented, but never for a lenghty duration, resulting in an overall unevenness.  Still, when it works, it's monumental, like when the bassline moves on the first track, or the isolating sound from 'On the way to the club.'  It's a grooviness that harkens back to their first 'baggy' album.  This may yet grow on me; having detested '13' when it was released, only to claim it as my favorite over a year later.<BR>Blur tend to operate beyond a measurable curve.
B00005JLYU|5.0|\\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" stars Drew Barrymore, who plays Dyaln Sanders the tough wild child.  Also staring Cameron Diaz, who plays Natalie Cook the girly girl who loves to have fun.  And Lucy Liu, who plays Alex Munday who is the class act, smart, and tough.<br />This is a great fun movie.  It has tons of action, and comedy.  This is one of the best movies of the summer.  Though it a bubbly fun movie does not make it stupid.  It is not suposed to be taken seriously.  The points is to have fun, and laugh.  If I could I'd give this movie a 10/5, just for taking a risk, and succeeding.  Trust me I wouldn't have gone to see it in theaters four times if it had not been a good fun movie.  This would have to be my favorite movie of all time, which is also tied with the origional \\" Charlie's Angels\\".  I cannont decide which one I like better.
B000060P79|2.0|Well these guys are not neccesarily good, they are just simple. Lets see, a melody here, a catchy little line here, and all the kids are GONNA BUY IT! Listen, don't buy this album, its simple, this band is not creative, they dont make interesting music. If you want a good punk album, buy the new NOFX album \\"War On Errorism\\" or their classic \\"The Decline\\". They are MUCH better albums. Please I urge you to not waste your money on this cd, its not worth the buy, alright? You'd be amused longer with a stick and a rock than with \\"No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls\\"
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought this CD a few days ago, and now I'm so glad I made my decision to buy it. Because this CD is really worth every penny! I have her debut album too, which is not bad. However this one is even better. At first I only loved her four hits, which are \\"Stripped\\",\\"Beautiful\\",\\"Fighter\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\". They are the songs you will find very hard to get tired of. But the more times I listened to the CD, the more other songs I found catchy. They just started to grow on me. For example there're songs such as \\"Walk away\\",\\"Infatuation\\",\\"Soar\\",\\"Cruz\\",\\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" etc. They're all as great as the hits. And now even her short talking tracks start to sound good! To my little surprise, she's a really outstanding and talented singer!  Not to think of her controversial new style, her voice is so powerful and full of undisguised emotions at the same time! Overall, this is an album you can't miss! If you don't like her and the reason is simply based on the way she looks and wears, then you might be wrong. Her music will absolutely change your mind.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I LOVE this album. It's by far the best album of 2003. Jet is a quartet out of Australia with a musical style all their own. They're style ranges from song to song, making this album never get old! This is a MUST HAVE for anybody who likes music, and is willing to try something new.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I liked The Matrix a lot. Who didn't, really? However, I've always restrained myself from the deification that is thrust upon it. I wanted more plot and ideas and less special effects and shootouts. I never found The Matrix completely satisfying because the Wachowski brothers managed to nullify their great ideas with Hollywood predictability. To quote Roger Ebert, \\"There's something disappointing about a movie that begins by questioning the nature of the universe and ends with a shootout.\\"<br />The Matrix Reloaded is an even bigger example of this. The \\"plot\\" being used as a tool for stringing along a series of action sequences and CGI effects. Lots and lots of CGI effects. How much? Just think of the most CGI you can imagine in a movie and then double it. That's The Matrix Reloaded. Perhaps it's appropriate since the story itself deals with computer programs, however to me The Matrix Reloaded felt less like a film and more like a video game that you are unable to control. <br />This coupled with George Lucas' Episodes 1 and 2 has made me wary of modern movie technology. Gone is the mystery of movie special effects. It's no longer, \\"How did they do that?\\". Now it's \\"What computer program did they use to do that?\\". I know I sound like an old fogey (I'm only 23) but they truly don't make 'em like they used to. If this is filmmaking for the 21st century, then I will happily stay in the past with my CGI-free copies of The Godfather and Casablanca.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is BY FAR the BEST album of 2003. The explosive first tracks wind down a bit in the middle of the album for some more suddle, pretty music and JET right back up to the max in the end. This album is a MUST BUY for any music lover and will make you want say 'Rollover DJ' and crank up the volume to 11.
B000002H1T|5.0|This is the best Cars album and the only one with strong songs throughout.  Their debut was great but it was downhill from there until they released this gem.  What a pleasant surprise!!
B00004VVND|5.0|I am not ashamed in the least to admit that the 1973 science fiction thriller \\"Westworld\\" is one of my all time favorite movies. I first saw it about twenty years ago and never forgot it, so when I had the opportunity to watch it again recently I jumped at the chance. I can easily say that I still found this picture still compelling with its mixture of futuristic elements and chilling suspense. Directed by big shot novelist Michael Crichton, the creator of \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" and \\"Congo,\\" \\"Westworld\\" may constitute his most compelling work to date in either print or on the big screen. Why? Because even at this early date Crichton effectively displays his concerns over technology and how mankind adapts to technical innovations. Not surprisingly, at least to anyone familiar with Crichton, man suffers plenty in \\"Westworld.\\" It is important to remember that this writer/director is not the only creative talent dealing with the seeming incompatibility of man and machine: writer J.G. Ballard and director David Cronenberg have been exploring these vistas for decades now. Crichton holds his own with both of these visionaries, and \\"Westworld\\" resoundingly proves it.<br />\\"Westworld\\" begins with a lengthy commercial touting the benefits of vacationing at Delos, a company that runs a most unusual theme park. For only one thousand dollars a day (in 1973 dollars!), the curious can star in their own version of the Wild West (Westworld), Medieval Europe (Medievalworld), or in the decadent splendor of Rome (Romanworld). A steep price to play for such diversions, to be sure, but Delos employs amazingly realistic robots and stylish props to completely recreate these eras. A visitor to the Delos amusement park can fight a knight to win the hand of a queen, gun down outlaws in the streets, or take part in a Roman banquet. The robot characters look so real that it is difficult to tell them apart from the other guests, a fact that adds a real dimension of excitement to the experience when you stand down someone at the end of a gun barrel. Obviously, Delos cannot have guests dying violently left and right, so they engineered the props, like guns, to only fire at \\"cold\\" machines. An enormous army of technicians runs the show from an underground control center where the worlds undergo constant scrutiny and where employees repair robots \\"killed\\" or \\"injured\\" in the day's activities. Despite a few worrisome problems, mainly regarding some sort of emerging computer \\"virus\\" that mystifies the techies, Delos operates without many serious hitches.<br />Enter the main characters of the film, two business types looking for fun played by Richard Benjamin and James Brolin. Both decide to go to Westworld, and after donning western style clothing complete with firearms, they start their adventure. What follows is every western film clich&eacute; imaginable. The two take part in a bar brawl, share special relationships with the local ladies, and orchestrate a jailbreak. Moreover, the two soon earn the enmity of the local gunslinger, a sinister, shining eyed figure clad in black played with frosty efficiency by Yul Brynner. The shootouts involving the gunslinger look as though Crichton lifted them from a Sam Peckinpah movie, with blood spraying in slow motion splendor. \\"Westworld\\" even includes a nicely done \\"guy on fire scene,\\" one of the best in cinematic history. The movie occasionally shifts to Medievalworld to follow the exploits of one of the park visitors there, but most of the action involves what is going on in Westworld. Look for Dick Van Patten in a smaller role as a white bread businessman who soon learns a thing or two about manhood at the theme park.<br />The last part of the film, after the computer virus causes the robots to rebel against their human masters, shifts the focus of the film from science fiction fare to a harrowing thriller. I think one of the grimmest, chilliest sequences in film history involves Brynner's single-minded pursuit of Richard Benjamin through the desert and mountains surrounding Delos. I can still hear the sound of the gunslinger's boots clicking down the long hallways of Delos's control center as he marches to the final showdown with his prey. Who will win in the battle between technology and man? Benjamin's character must apply the lessons he learned about being a man during his stay at Westworld to save his own life at the conclusion of the film, but it won't be easy triumphing over an unthinking killing machine.<br />Flaws do abound in this movie. How does Delos insure that swords and similar weaponry in Medievalworld won't hurt real guests? Why do the hands on two immobile robots change position in various shots? How can the gunslinger detect the heat patterns from Benjamin's feet on a sunny day, especially considering Benjamin was wearing boots and had left the tracks at least ten minutes before the gunslinger saw them? These are minor problems, but they are noticeable after repeated viewings. Overall, \\"Westworld\\" is a grand slam homerun that every science fiction fan must watch at some point. Regrettably, the movie did not receive a worthy DVD release. The film's transfer quality isn't bad, but it isn't great, either. A trailer is the only extra, so forget about listening to a commentary or seeing any production stills, cast bios, behind the scenes footage, or deleted scenes. Oh well, at least \\"Westworld\\" made it to DVD. For that, we can all be thankful.pursuit of Richard Benjamin through the desert and mountains surrounding Delos.

B000088E6D|5.0|This is the honest to goodness truth. I had never heard of Michael buble's before 10/11/03.I turned my tv on that sallite music station.   There was nothing on tv I wanted to watch,so I switched it on the smooth jazz station.And I heard this song &quot;The way you look tonight&quot; I said to myself &quot;who is   that?&quot; Its not Sinatra,but it sure  sounded good.The next morning I     forgot the name of the artist.I     tried finding it by the song I heard,but there was several hundred listing for that song.              That sunday afternoon I found in the record dept. of a well know     store and immediately bought it     without giving any thought as to    what else was on the CD.That song   &quot;the way you look tonight&quot; was enough for me.                      When I saw the name Paul Anka and   David Foster as having something    to do with the CD,I knew it had to  be good. And I can truly say I was  totally blown away to hear such a   refreshing voice.I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves good    vocals.
6305364648|5.0|This movie has it all, comedy, great cast, and over the top action!  You get the feeling that everyone involved with this project had a great time, and I consider it one of Schwarzenegger's best films, if not the best!<br />From the 007 spoof beginning til the tango at end there is never a dull moment in action or comedy!
B00007AJF9|4.0|Elizabeth is a great movie which accommodates both the world of facts and history with the world of entertainment and Hollywood.  The movie is a relatively accurate historically, but overall it focuses on the way it really was back then and is an exciting film.
B00005JLTN|4.0|I'll admit that my expectations were extremely high and I was let down just a little, but I thought this movie was very good. I like The Matrix a little better but I thought Reloaded had enough drama and action to appeal to all Matrix fans. On the eve of their fight with the sentinels, the people of Zion celebrate the only thing they have left, their humanity. To keep their humanity, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus must somehow defeat the controller of the matrix. The movie ends with a cliff-hanger that had everyone wondering what's going to happen next. Forget the bad reviews and see it for yourself.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I really curious about this one: I love rage against the machine. But then... I started to listen to it...<BR>F***, it is Soundgarden stuff! Lyrics with no meaning at all, that super-solos of Morello just ripped apart and it's kind of a agressive-free music with the lighter-asking songs.<BR>I can't believe that Chris Cornell could just change a work of a lifetime, Rage Against the Machine is now a legend. Audioslave is just a regular band that would be a garage band if the elements weren't VIP's.<br />Just buy Battle of L.A. if you want some real stuff.
0783225733|5.0|There is plenty of praise worthy of this film, &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; directed by Ron Howard.  Not only is it surprisingly attune to the facts of the ill-fated moon mission, it still makes you care about the astronaunts who flew:  Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swaggert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton).  The film also features Gary Sinese has Ken Maddingly, the astronaut kept out of the mission.  Their woes began when an oxygen tank exploded and they had to rely their lunar lander in order to get home.  But they were aided by NASAs' impassioned crew back on the ground led by team leader Gene Kranz (Ed Harris).  Plenty of risky improvising insues to get them home, such as using socks and suits to help make an air filter and turning off their navigating computer in order to save power.<br />Even throughout all this tenchnical and historical clutter, director Ron Howard still keeps the filming flowing fluidly with white-knuckled scenes aboard the spacecraft.  And the production design is incredible.  Most likely modeled after the actual Saturn 5 rocket, the exquisitely detailed sets serve to give the film an added sese of realism, and isn't the truth more interesting than almost any fiction?  It should be said however that the film is also augmented by a sharp script that keeps the movie exciting as well.  However, more importantly Howard instills a tangible human element that lifts the film even higher.
B00008EY9G|5.0|While watching the beginning of Identity, I figured out who done it in the first few minutes. I watched full of arrogance as my theory was supposedly proven over and over. But this film proved me wrong in a delicious way. I love a movie that keeps me guessing and can surprise me. This is an excellent thriller with twists and turns. I loved it!
B0000AM6LY|5.0|A little radio station near Columbus has been playing &quot;Sunrise&quot; and for the longest time, and i didn't know who the artist was. then i found out and couldn't believe it.  then i thought i'd buy the &quot;Home&quot; album.  i have never pruchased a Simply Red album, even though i loved them in the 80's.   i love this CD and think it's one of the best ones i have purchased in quite a while.  &quot;Home&quot; is a nice rainy day song and of course &quot;Sunrise&quot; gets you going. mick's voice is a little strained on &quot;you make me feel brand new&quot; but is still a grand effort.  &quot;home loan blues and positively 4th street&quot; are real good songs that do not insult my intelligence.  i highly recommend this CD if you want to hear good music from a singer and group that has talent and professionalism.  It Would Be Nice To See This Album Get More Airplay In The States!
B00001IVQT|5.0|... i am just going to add a few lines to those reviews already here for this cd... yes, rachmaninov takes a nobler approach than most pianists and to me this is rachmaninov... melancholy and general flow of music, two traits emphasized by ashkenazy in this recording (a fact also confirmed by his choosing of the simpler and more lyrical cadenza in no. 3 which rachmaninov himself played) make this a top notch performance in the market today (i would also add earl wild on chandos, argerish on philips, rachmaninov himself on naxos, janis on mercury living presence, and richter on dg)
0671027344|5.0|This book is written in an amazing style the characters are unforgettable and believable. If any one thinks that dumb catcher book is good. I implore you to open you're eyes to this book.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I think the only real problem with Matrix Reloaded is that as Neo and the rest gain their humanity they seem to become stiffer and more mechanical... kind of ironic I think...or am I mixing being 'cool' with my ideal of humanity? I thought the movie was good, the rave was silly and I was majorly amused by the people who hated the film. After all, what people don't seem to realize is a middle film in a trilogy is just that, the middle, they can only do so much without ending the story. Most of the story plot action is the first film and will be in the third film. So why be hard on the film? Now that you have the DVD you can skip through the Rave and enjoy the rest. I admit I didn't see this film more than twice when in theaters, and one of those times was when it was re-issued on IMAX screens (Matix I must have seen 6+ times) But I think the movie does what it is suppose to do. Moves the story line along (dangles a few new things that will explain the last movie installment to come) and surrounded it with kick-ass chase and fight scenes. I try to see the movie on it's own and not have it conform to past memories and feelings of the last movie (though I am sorry they got rid of the operator...he was a cutie). Past that I would add this to your collection, or wait for the Super Duper Kitchen Sink Edition that includes even more.
B000063DI8|5.0|Everyone seems to hate this album...Why? I think it is one of the best!<br />Most people think that Janick Gers is not as good as Adrian Smith, but still Janick is good enough. He had pretty catchy solos in &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; and &quot;Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter&quot;.<br />&quot;Tail gunner&quot;, &quot;Holy Smoke&quot;, &quot;Bring your Daughter...to the slaughter&quot;, &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, &quot;Run silent run deep&quot;, &quot;Hooks in you&quot; and &quot;No prayer for the dying&quot; are excellent tracks. The rest ain't THAT good, but they still are very listenable.<br />A true Maiden fan should love this album...
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code begins with an engrossing prologue that sets up all the elements of a swashbuckling mystery thriller, but the book deteriorates immediately afterwards. Despite the interesting subject matter, author Dan Brown flounders at writing suspense and creates characters too stale and clich&eacute;d to carry the story forward in an engaging way. Following the successful opener, Brown begins the action with a corny formal introduction to his protagonist, Robert Langdon, a debonair academic recycled from an earlier novel whom Brown clearly plans to parlay into a franchise of future bestsellers. Brown isn't sure how to characterize Langdon or the supporting cast and prefers to typecast, simply namedropping the Hollywood leading man he imagines playing his hero in the movie adaptation. (Hint: it's no coincidence that Langdon seems a crude knockoff of Indiana Jones, minus the gritty personality and rugged wardrobe which make the latter interesting.)<br />None of the book's literary flaws are as grating, however, as the dialogue, which Brown renders so clumsily that it reminded me of nothing so much as a story submitted in college creative writing by one of the dimmer bulbs in the class. Readers will quite literally cringe during most dialogue and especially during two flashback scenes whose inclusion in the book is downright perplexing, one in which Langdon lectures college students on pagan sex (or something) and another in which Langdon visits a prison to conduct an advanced seminar on Leonardo Da Vinci with the hardened inmates. The words Brown puts in their mouths positively fail the laugh test. Let's just say Brown is quite clearly not a dutiful researcher of the relevant vernacular. These scenes thankfully end quickly, but the awkwardly constructed dialogue between Langdon and the female lead is relentless, inducing Richter-scale cringing at the mere contemplation of the inevitable sex scene (which Brown mercifully leaves to the imagination but which shall certainly figure more prominently in the movie, should one be made).<br />Yet the dialogue is for the most part not at all flirtatious and is most frustrating when written in the same formal narrative tone as a history textbook. This is the device Brown uses whenever he must give readers some background on Da Vinci or early Christianity. Rather like the know-it-all scientist figure in every Michael Crichton novel, Langdon or another character appears periodically to succor readers with dry soliloquies that also serve as the Cliffs Notes to the stale revelations of the upcoming chapter. Despite the bad writing and deus-ex-machina quality of these diversions, some are actually fairly interesting and probably the only motivation available to actually finish the book, since the \\"suspense\\" is largely illusory. Each of the numerous plot twists is predictable fifty to a hundred or more pages in advance, so much so that it would be hard to identify which developments Brown intended to be surprises but for his narrative intervention: Brown kindly informs us that a character is \\"stunned\\" or \\"speechless\\" whenever he unleashes such impotent bombshells, apparently to compensate for his failure to arouse these emotions in readers.<br />Worse still, when one looks to the supposed mystery at the heart of the novel, one realizes that \\"there is no there there.\\" So much of the mystery unravels from the characters talking to one another -- and so little from their actually doing anything -- that by the end it seems the book would not have been substantially different if Langdon had simply stayed in his hotel room and conducted a lecture into a Dictaphone. Most of the lectures concern the secret society bearing the ominous appellation \\"The Priory of Sion,\\" but if the plot has any credibility the Priory utterly failed to keep anything secret, since every character knows all there is to know about it (and constantly tells us). That's adequate if one approaches The Da Vinci Code as a fictionalized historical essay, for whatever that's worth, but as a suspense novel it fails. By the end Brown has little to reveal that he hasn't already told us, and the suspense concludes not with a bang but a whimper.ed historical essay, for whatever that's worth, but as a suspense novel it fails.

B000005H7D|5.0|This is not  quite as startlingly 'original' a Coltrane recording, perhaps, as some of the later ones which many, myself included, see as probably ultimately more 'important' or 'innovative'. But is that the way we should look at things? Here, Coltrane is already masterly, and with a clear discipline that is often more inviting and accessible than his more difficult and yet brilliant music still to come. Moreover, he wrote some great themes for this album, not the least of them 'Blue Train' itself, which is both hauntingly blue and Trane indeed, and exciting in each of the versions presented on this CD. But ALL the tracks offered are good. The sound is superb. The other musicians are also very, very good, with Lee Morgan and Curtis Fuller excellent on trumpet and trombone, and a hard-driving but richly varied performance by the &quot;rhythm&quot; section. In some ways the thematic material is perhaps more revolutionary (listen for some things not unlike those subsequently found in 'Kind of Blue') than the solos, but those are nevertheless uniformly great and super-duper listening, sometimes more in a funky Horace Silver/Jazz Messengers mode. A good record to own!
0679720200|5.0|This is one of the most disturbing books you can ever read. Basically, it can be interpreted from two extreme points of view: either you think that Meursault is a man minding his own business and focus on how people who don't even know him judge him morally, or you think that he is a hollow man, devoid of any feelings and so barely human. I personally think that the first stance is almost impossible: Meursault DOES fail to care for his deceased mother who dies completely lonely in a nursery, and he kills a man without feeling any remorse. Plus, he goes to bed with women without giving any further thought to the experience. I am not a person proned to moralizing about other people's lives, but here it is impossible not to be astonished at the total lack of empathy Meursault has towards his fellow human beings, including his mother. <br />Don't get me wrong: the book is not only a gem but also a very important one to be read, especially by young persons. It is very good that someone took the effort to face this modern attitude which many young people have been compelled to adopt during the last two centuries. One could go on rambling about how the modern world has dehumanized us, how individualism has depraved us from a sense of community, etc. etc. In the end it all comes down to the human being and the moral courage we need in order to survive this admittedly hard world. The fact that the story is so appalling shouldn't discourage anyone from picking up this short but important book and give it a minute of reflection. Are you living your life the Meursault way?
0316666343|5.0|Annotation: The story of 14year old Suzie Salmon who on a cold winter day is on her way home from school when one of her neighbors talks her into seeing his underground den he made in an old cornfield. There he brutally rapes and murders her.  She goes to heaven. From heaven she watches life on earth and her family cope with there loss.<br />Author Bio: Alice Sebold suffered a terrible rape during her freshmen year at Syracuse University. After when she went to the police she was told that a women before her was raped and murdered. She was then considered \\"lucky\\". In 1999 Sebold published the memoir Lucky  which told the story of her brutal assault and her struggle to survive.  After graduating from Syracuse in 1984, She spent some time at graduate school in Texas before she ended up living in projects on the east side of Manhattan. She then began to pursue a career in writing. After she spent 10 years living in the city she moved to California where she got a job as a caretaker of an arts colony and lived in a cabin with no electricity and had to read and write by candlelight. In November 2001 she married Glen David Gold. Gold says that Sebold would rather sit in a corner and read Harvey James then make small talk. She has now put some distance between herself and her anger and is able to move on with her life. Sebold says she has always thought she was extremely weird but she is happy with her weirdness and she thinks others should be happy with theirs too. <br />Evaluation: I was told about the book The Lovely Bones in my College Reading Class. It was a highly recommended book so I decided to read it. After reading the 1st chapter I was drawn to the book I couldn't put it down. It is just one of those books that you have to know what happens next. I was amazed by Alice Sebold's style of writing; she mixes her personal experiences with the experiences of the main character which makes you look at the book at a whole different level. The Lovely Bones is different from books that I have read in the past. It kept me interested throughout the whole book. I thought it was amazing that something like that could happen to a 14 year old girl. I was actually reading a book that kept me so interested that I recommended it to everyone I know that reads a lot. It is a book that I will never forget and could read over and over many times because it is that interesting. I can see why the book was the 2002 top seller book it is truly one of those books that everyone should read. At one minute you are laughing and at the next crying. There are just so many emotions tied into the book. It's so exciting to read what happens to Suzie's family and to follow the tracks of her killer. I would definitely say this is the best book I have ever read. Sebold is just such a wonderful writer. I am reading the book Lucky another book by Alice Sebold her memoir of her personal experience of being raped and surviving. I think that Alice Sebold has become my favorite writer she actually makes you feel how the emotions that Suzie and her family feel it makes you want to read the book over and over so that way you don't miss anything. Sebold goes into every detail that it actually makes you feel like you are in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a definite page-turner and it will inspire you to read more of Sebolds books. Trust me you wont be able to put it down.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix was one of the most original movies ever made. It breathed a fresh breath of air into movies and especially the sci-fi area of it.<br />The Matrix Reloaded picks up where The Matrix left us. Neo(Reeves) is now the one. He realizes he is different. The machines are drilling towards Zion and the people there are worried. Morpheus(Fishburne) takes Neo and Trinity(Moss) back into the Matrix to see if they can stop the machines all together.<br />There is more to the plot and story than that, it's just very complex and has to be seen to be understood. The story is just like the Matrix in that it is very original. It's an awesome script and everybody does well with there character.<br />Keanu Reeves deserves an Oscar for his work as Neo. He had done an awesome job playing the character. Neo is a very complex character that has many sides to him and Reeves has shown us the sides and emotions, and it can only get better with the next Matrix movie.<br />Laurence Fishburne once again continues to be the Obi-wan Kenobi for a new generation. He deserves an Oscar as well. He's such a great actor and Morpheus is a smooth character.<br />Hugo Weaving is back as Agent Smith in the movie. He does such a good job making you hate him. He has an important part in the film, and his fight with Neo when there are tons of him is cool. One of the best fights in movie history. There final showdown should be even better.<br />The special effects are one of the best reasons to see the Matrix Reloaded. The first Matrix movie brought us the most advancement in movies since T2 Judgement Day and Reloaded continues with some of the best effects ever seen. The CGI fights look real. Once again we have bullet time shots which really look coo. There is also a 15 minute car chase with two really cool bad guys. A must see.<br />Monica Bellucci also has an important part in the movie. The Italian model will be a big thing in the U.S. one day and this series is whats gonna make her huge here.<br/>Overall the Matrix Reloaded is one of the best films of the year. It's a must see. The DVD is spectacular and a must for any collection. Don't miss out on the Matrix phenomenom.
B000005H7D|5.0|This album (CD) is without a doubt my favorite all-time Coltrane work. I can't seem to get enough. The greatest Coltrane song ever written - &quot;Blue Train&quot; - is on this CD. This song has been featured in several movies (e.g. 'Singles')and has a style and rhythm that is like no other jazz song in the history of jazz music. In fact, 'Blue Train' is the consummate jazz song.<br />What's even greater than the above is the fact that every remaining song on this CD follows suit. 'Moment's Notice' has a nice friendly flow to it, and Curtis Fuller has some great trombone work on this song. Other songs like 'Locomotion' -which gives a locomotion feel to it - and 'I'm Old Fashion'- a lazy, flowing romantic melodious tune which draws the listener into the music - are also great additions. In fact, there's not a bad song on this CD. I Love this CD.<br />If you are a big fan of Coltrane's, a big fan of jazz music or just someone who would like to get introduced to Coltrane - this is the best album to begin your journey through the land of Coltrane (where many other great CDs exist). I highly recommend this CD.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I still like the original because it was original , cool stuff &amp; cool action . I think KEANU REEVES are THE ONE . He was born to be THE ONE . GREAT ACTION .<br />For MATRIX RELOADED , cool CAR CHASE but I wonder why NEO look like CG especially when he is fighting with AGENT SMITH clones . Am I watching MATRIX RELOADED or I was playing ENTER THE MATRIX ? <br />Anyway is still good for the action scenes but weak for the story plot . <br />For the DVD , why there are no DOBLY DIGITAL EX ? Picture quality are excellent with good detail &amp; color resolution .<br />Sound is aggresive in DOBLY 5.1 but seem to be too low level . I have to turn up the volume to feel the impact especially the dialogue scene which difficul to hear .<br />THANK YOU to WARNER BROS HOME VIDEO for changing their dvd packaging . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK . LOOKING FORWARD FOR T3 packaging .
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is one of the top 5 books that I've ever read.  I need to catch up on my reviews here at Amazon.com, but I've read all the John Grisham, Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum, Clive Cussler, Dale Brown, Stephen Coonts, Nelson DeMille novels to give you an idea of my tastes.<br />This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time - I had to take a break between mowing my front and back lawns to read another chapter on the first day, if that gives you an idea!<br />I simply could not put this book down.  The symbolism, history, religious background, the ideology of the theme really blew me away.  The book not only has inspired me to learn more about PHI, Leonardo Fibonnaci, Leonardo Da Vinci, the Crusades, and Western European history - but it has really sparked my imagination about historical events in general.<br />All-in-all, this is a great book.  I wish I could give this a rating of six stars!

0312263120|4.0|I was given this book before a business trip.  I'm not normally a reader of fiction.  Working in the IT field I find myself reading mostly technical books.  Digital Fortress was a pleasant surprise.  It was a fast and entertaining read.  I'd recommend it on its ability to deliver a good story.  Its technical details take some expected artistic freedom.  All in all, it is worth the read. MM
B00006ZCFH|1.0|What happened to the rich quality of Erykah's voice? Seems she bumbles along a lot on the new CD and doesn't ever explore her whole vocal range. The only good song was Danger, where she belts out her lyrics over a very nice track. It's hard to believe that we've gone from beautiful songs like &quot;see you next lifetime&quot; to what we have on this album. Maybe she's experiencing writers block?
B0000AXE8I|5.0|sorry to some of you above that could not have a real blast with this awesome film! it's incredible from start to finish! got my dvd yesterday and it really is a masterpiece-ok, it has it's flaws but overall, it is a truly remarkable motion picture! the highway scene alone will go down in motion picture history as one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed.
B000089CJI|5.0|its been a while since i have been truly excited about a cd...i love this cd...there are a couple of tracks that i think could be better, but the others more than make up for them.  I am highly impressed with the lyrics, and the orchestration on Nothing Better has me rewinding back to listen to the same ten seconds (if you have the record and are a complete nerd like me, you will know what i am talking about)
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I woudln't say this is a disapointment, but its just not as good as it should be. It's still a great album, very deep, and soothing and upsetting at the same time.<br />1. The Package - The longest song on the album, pretty calm and a strange way to open the cd, but this ones pretty catchy (4/5)    <BR>2. Weak And Powerless - First single off the cd and the reason I bought it, awesome song with powerful lyrics and great bass (5/5))   <BR>3. The Noose - More great lyrics, and a pretty good flow of music to go with them (4/5)<BR>4. Blue - Good lyrics again (see a pattern?) and a great melody (4/5)<BR>5. Vanishing - Another decent track with great lyrics and a steady melody (4/5) <BR>6. A Stranger - A good song with solid music and great lyrics (as usual) (4/5)          <BR>7. The Outsider  - THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM HANDS DOWN! Simple amazing. Great lyrics with a chorus that was worth buying the album for (5/5)         <BR>8. Crimes - The first of two little instrumental like things (4/5)          <BR>9. The Nurse Who Loved Me - The strangest song on this album, very... weird lyrics and a chilling and un-APC like singing... strange... (4/5)         <BR>10. Pet  - Pretty good song, with, again, good lyrics and a steady style, good for following up Nurse (4/5)         <BR>11. Lullaby - The other mini-instrumental, more of a Reprise for Pet (4/5)          <BR>12. Gravity  - A good song to end the album, melodic and chilling and a perfect sum up of the rest of the album (4/5) <br />All and all a good album, but it seems almost lacking in a way, still worth the money, and its worth listening too because it has heart and soul (something ALOT of music lacks these days) I hope to see another album from them soon
0812550706|4.0|This book has everything you could want:  action, mystery, feeling, and imagination.  It is about a seven-year-old boy, named Andrew Wiggin (or Ender), who is sent to a battle school in space where he is tought to be a leader, and how to fight fights.  Sounds boring?  The thing is this 7-year-old is the human races last hope against an alien invasion.  He gets to think up strategies for fighting in zero-gravity, and is tested in simulators.  But what happens when they aren't just simmulators anymore?  That is what this book is about.  So if you enjoy books you just can't put down, then go read Ender's Game.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|I myself am not a huge fan of Sandra Bullock, but I do respect her a lot more after viewing this film. Like most guys, I was made to watch this for the sake of a woman. I thanked her right after the credits.<BR> Bullock is forced, by court order, to under go detox after a series of bad drunk moments. She tackles a very sensitive subject head on in this film and really shows a side of her talent that is incredible. Of course, she has a superb cast behind her including Steve Buscemi and an always great Viggo Mortensen.<BR> Trust me this is not a &quot;chick flick&quot;. It is a funny and touching story that I never would have thought by the title. Pick it up, you can thank me later.
0385504209|1.0|I was in the mood for a very entertaining book to read over the weekend.  I wanted something that really kept me turning the pages but didn't require me to think too much.  I thought \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" would be the book to fill the bill.  It wasn't.<br />While every chapter did end with a \\"cliffhanger,\\" the plot is so simplistic and hackneyed (and improbable) that any intelligent reader knows what's coming next.  In addition, the writing itself was bad, making the book more than a little irritating to read.  I will give Brown this, there was no \\"fat\\" in his prose, but there were several glaring grammar mistakes that almost made me throw the book aside.  I don't care if an author isn't writing literary fiction; there's simply no excuse for a grammar mistake in a book.  It's an insult to any reader.<br />Where this book really fell short for me (as if plot and bad writing aren't enough) was in the area of characterization.  Both Sophie and Robert were despicable and totally one-dimensional.  And could there possibly be a more stupid member of the French Judicial Police than Sophie?  I don't think so.  This is a woman who probably couldn't have graduated high school, let alone work as a cryptologist.<br />The plot twists were way to easy.  I knew the secret bank number immediately and the identity of The Teacher is also quite easy to figure out.  Let's just say that you'll know him as soon as he's introduced.  No surprises there.<br />I don't know a lot about the Holy Grail, the Priory of Sion, etc., so if Brown got his facts wrong, it didn't bother me.  More knowledgeable readers might be offended, though.  Had I been knowledgeable about the Priory, I think I would have been.  I'm a Catholic as well, but this book didn't do anything to offend my faith.  Frankly, it was too silly to be offensive.  Ultra-conservative Catholics might be better off avoiding the book, however.  I was far more offended by the bad writing and terrible characterization.<br />The more I think about this book, the more time passes since my reading of it, the more I dislike it.  Shame on Dan Brown for not perfecting the art and craft of novel writing before writing one.  And shame on those who hyped this book to high heaven.  It's not worth it and I've sworn off Dan Brown for good.k about this book, the more time passes since my reading of it, the more I dislike it.

B00009W0U4|2.0|According to many of the reviews I read the film was &quot;better than Momento,&quot; which turned out to be false.  Though the camera work was somewhat original it was over done and really not necessary.  The story was far too obvious and many of the &quot;great&quot; scenes went on long past what was needed.  This movie should never be compared with Momento, they're completely different movies meant for completely different audiences, and I am not that audience.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Reviewer: G-Bowski from Monroe, CT United States<BR>this cd is an awesome. Linkin park has the ultimate mix between rock, techno, rap, heavy medal, and more<br />I am a huge fan of medal and rock...if you are too the youll love this album<BR>I dont even really like rap, BUT linkin park makes it sound a lot better then most of the junk on the radio, they make everything sound good... <BR>I loved this album...<BR>plus the meteora banner in the booklet is pretty cool...<BR>buy it, its worth the every dime...
B0000AXE8I|4.0|How do you top a global phenomenon? Easy, make 2. The Wachowski Brothers(directors) and Joel Silver(producer) first blew people's minds with 1999's the Matrix.  It really was something nobody had seen before. So to top it they went over the top, and possibly a little overboard.<br />Neo, now the One, and Trinity are lovers now and he keeps having nightmares of her.  In the middle of this, sentinels(those big bug-like things at the end of the first one) have been dispatched to destroy Zion, the last city on Earth and Neo and Co. are giving very little time to do so.  So Neo goes here and there getting answers and stopping the machines.<br />The problem with this? You can obviously see Silver and the Wachowskis took their budget and used it a lot on special effects.  Remember how in the Matrix the bullet time effect really only rotated around the central screen? Now it's going all over the place.  Remember Neo's brief but sweet fight against Smith in the subway? Well now he's facing 100 of them. Therein lies the problem: waaaaaaay too much.  More fights, more longer fights and more &quot;dazzling&quot; effects, and they do dazzle. But then they go.....and go......and go...... and so on.<br />Despite story shortcomings and an obvious penchant for bigger effects and fights, those fights are rather awesome to watch, seeing Neo doing all these inhuman acrobatics you wish you could do.  Well, a good thing about this movie despite the fights?  You know Revolutions has gotta be better than this
B0000AXE8I|5.0|the marrow of an intellectual playground!<br />There were just so many references to the Bible and Renaissance philosophical genesii.  The way the Wachowskis wove the passions of views together is so creative, this movie warrants so many repeated views.  My findings SO FAR after watching it twice...  <br />Similarities to the Bible are so interesting to reveal - first off since Neo is given the choice to save the 6th version of Zion (or humanity as is implied) - it's interesting that Biblically, 6 is the number of mankind.  The fight to know reason of existence is in it a truism compared to the a existence of causality (God's will > practical nihilism; Constant references in the movie to Reason > the Merovingian's short lived contribution of causality).  Life is based on choice (Josh 24:15a).  Locke lives on what he sees and we determine our fate; Morpheus knows that life is made up of what we cannot see, like molocules, breathe, the spiritual.(locke=huamnism; morpheus=Biblical concept of predestination).  In the Bible, Zion is heaven.  <br />It is almost a resounding harmony that underlies all characters (except Captain Locke) that a purpose or a reason is the stem of our existence (\\"former\\" Agent Smith plainly states this to Neo, the head councilman reveals this with Neo in the beginning as they watch the machinery, the keymaker references this whenever he talks).  But the struggle to know our reason of existence is to understand our daily fight(the Oracle's talk with Neo).  This parallels I Tim 6:12.  In the end, Love conquers and defies everything (neo gives trinity life in the end) I Corinthians 13.<br />But the humanistic converse to the supremity of choice illustrated by the Merovingian - \\"reality is causality, CHOICE is an illusion given by those who have control of power\\"- think of ADAM AND EVE - who were to choose to eat or not eat of the tree of good and evil, a choice given by God, the control of power, BUT is affirmed by Morpheus's response of \\"choice is the beginning\\" - a sneaky pacification somewhat polar views - good job Wachowskis!<br />Sequences parallaled to the Matrix: both movies begin with Trinity, part 1 trinity saves neo in the end, part 2 neo saves trinity in the end.  3 agents then 3 agents now.<BR>***in part 1 we suspect for a short-lived time that Neo is not the one until the very end.  we are supposed to believe that Neo will save zion but Neo chooses to save/love Trinity instead of saving zion (!aaahh note that his 5 predacessors chose to save Zion, so now Zion will be dependent on Locke's plan of defending against the sentinels.  To add to the sorrow Neo says we have to physically stop the sentinels and the Prophecy was a LIE.  ***a few moments after that we see Neo actually stop the machines in reality (not in the matrix) thus the Wachowski's have given us the clue that Neo will be able to control the Matrix physically - outside of the programmed matrix.  Thus he might actually be the savior of Zion (physically) and the almighty who releases the minds (in the matrix).<br />Difficulties understood:  OLDEST programs of the matrix - the Merovingian (forget about him), the Architect and the Oracle (the Father and Mother of the Matrix).  The Architect program exponentially programmed the Matrix, the Oracle program was designed to search all those living bodies for that 99.9999% that didn't buy into the world of the Matrix or \\"whose mind could not be contained by these boundaries of perfection\\" (Neo).  She (the program) gives all the right questions to cause Neo to serch and meet the Architect.  WHY DON'T OTHER PROGRAMS (like agents, twins, etc.)KNOW?  Because of different levels of \\"control\\" as the Architect states. \\"Control\\" is also referenced ALL over the movie. <BR>The architect reveals the matrix is designed so \\"the one\\" (the 99.999%) will choose to save humanity instead of some other circumstance.  But here Neo chooses love instead of humanity a choice that usally \\"overwhelms...one's senses\\", stated by the architect.  But hasn't been done by the previous \\"predacessors\\" (a term first revealed in the Merovingian fight scene! succeeded by his wife Percephone's references to her husband's body guards being from an older version of the Matrix!).<br />All in all, i have no job and i'm a grad student, i'm gonna go out right now, get some Burger King come back and watch this flick all over again.  <br />GREATLY SUGGESTED!!!!!!<br />p.s.  go to moviemistakes...[online] to see the mistakes in the movie! HAH!<br />Brian
B000002B1M|5.0|First off, we ALL know that this is not like Illmatic. Different producers, different style of production, but still the same old Nas. His sophmore cut is almost as good as his debut, but just a little bit short. And I mean a little. The only track I choose to skip is the Album Intro, but I still give it a listen once in a while. <br />The Message was the only diss to 2Pac that was actually worth listening to. 2Pac will always be my favorite MC but this is one of the best tracks that Nas has ever dropped, and the same goes for Affirmative Action. Like usual, Nas puts down a track with a real original theme. This time is the banga called I Gave You Power, where Nas writes a first-person account of a gun. Black Girl Lost is a real deep song that is probably my 3rd favorite track on the album behind The Message & Affirmative Action. You also got the 1996 anthem If I Ruled The World which is still a pretty hot track. Street Dreams features R. Kelly and is another one of the best tracks on here.<br />If you are looking for an album that follows Illmatic's blueprint (no Jay-Z reference intended), then this is not the album you want to turn to. This album molded Nas into what he was before he turned a little commercial-friendly. It Was Written is definitly worth owning, not just hearing. Even the tracks I didn't mention are bangers.<br />Below is my track rating (1-5):<BR>1. Album Intro - 3<BR>2. The Message - 5<BR>3. Street Dreams - 4.5<BR>4. I Gave You Power - 5<BR>5. Watch Dem Niggas - 4<BR>6. Take It In Blood - 5<BR>7. Nas Is Coming - 5<BR>8. Affirmative Action - 5<BR>9. The Set Up - 4<BR>10. Black Girl Lost - 5<BR>11. Suspect - 4<BR>12. Shootouts - 5<BR>13. Live Nigga Rap - 4.5<BR>14. If I Ruled The World - 5
630471193X|5.0|All I can say is &quot;wow&quot;.  I loved this film from the start through to the end.  I am a big John T fan and this was one of his best films, by far, apart from Saturday Night Fever (I loved his dancing!!).  I couldn't get over his great powers and I always wanted to be like him.  I was 15 when I saw this film but still have respect for his great film making.  I shed a tear or 2.
0385512104|4.0|After completing this book, &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time&quot;, by Mark Haddon, I realized fiction books can teach you more about reality then non-fiction books. Mark Haddon wrote this book from a point of view of a autistic teenager. This book did not have a lot of big words and sentences put together but simple sentences for the reader to understand better. Also, the author wrote simple idea's was because that was how the autistic character expressed him self. I enjoyed reading every page of this book. I recommend \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,\\" not only to high school students but to adults as well. This book gave me an idea of the hardships that autistic children must go through because it really puts you in the mind of an autistic child. It also showed me that if you really believe in yourself, that you can conquer your fears and achieve your goals without having to lie to get there. I have not read any other Mark Haddon's books, but I just might have to check them out after reading this one. <br />The book starts off with the death of Wellington, a poodle that was stabbed with a garden fork. The victim of this murder (the dog) is soon found by Christopher John Francis Boone, a fifteen year old boy that is autistic and has Asperger's Syndrome. The world around Christopher is everything but easy. He does not like being touched or talking to people who he is not familiar with. Christopher does not understand jokes nor does he like the colors yellow or green but he can tell you \\"all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057.\\" One thing that I thought was really creative about this book was that the chapters were all listed according to prime numbers! Christopher enjoys spending a lot more time with dogs, then humans because to him, you always know what a dog is thinking. Another good thing about dogs according to Christopher is that they can not talk; therefore dogs can not lieto him or be unfaithful to him, like humans can. He is very intelligent in math and uses his mathematical abilities to escape the harsh world. However, the murder of this poodle has brought Christopher more than just a name of the murderer, but gave him strength and courage to face obstacles he was never able to do before. For example, a problem that Christopher overcame was talking with strangers about the dog to get closer a suspect for the murder of Wellington. I felt that this book gave good messages and was extremely touching. If you pick up this book, you will not regret it but learn from it, like I did. <br />Christopher is living with only his father because of his mother's \\"death.\\"  As you read further into the book Christopher discovers family secrets that will change his life, the way he looks at his father and sets him on another journey he will never forget.
B00000F566|5.0|This is an all time classic film, loved by both young and old.  I have watched it thousands of times and don't know many people who haven't seen it.  I've always loved Patrick Swayze, but when he started moving the way he did in Dirty Dancing I loved him even more.  I've even started dancing lessons since seeing this film.  It's so good the way he picks Baby in the end to dance with him at the final show.  Her dad was so proud of her and that brought a tear to my eye.  As for the quote \\"nobody puts Baby in the corner\\"....it'll never be forgotton!!!  Well recommended viewing.  My video tape is all fuzzy from watching it over and over again!!!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I like many others have been waiting for the dvd version of this movie to come out. Sadly, the wachowski's skimped on the extras and instead put too much filler about tv commercials based on the movie and details about the horrible enter the matrix video game. Other than that the transfer is top notch.
B00008H2LB|5.0|ok well my friend burned this for me, and i loved it right away.  all of the songs kinda sound similar, but thats why it is good.  it gives a really rockin vibe out there.  i suggest you buy this if you liked the others, because it is the best yet!  i HIGHLY recommend Meteora!!!<br />all u LP fans email me at daledoggie@comcast.net  !!!!!
0060930187|3.0|As a psychologist, I believe that Sylvia Plath's novel accurately portrays the confusion and disorientation that accompany mental illness.  Unfortunately, while the main character, a young college student named Ester Greenwood, rings true, the book itself is as confusing and disorienting as Ester's life.  Plath's literary style seems to be to wander from scene-to-scene and present-to-past with little or no transition.  The book was so disjointed that at times I looked to see if there were pages missing; how Ester goes from point A to point B is often unclear.  Despite this, Ester is a real person undergoing a real struggle with a real disorder.  Her thoughts of suicide are described in a simple, matter of fact manner that is extremely honest, and both the positive and negative aspects of her treatment are exposed.  The book's ending, while optimistic, is overshadowed by Plath's own eventual suicide; it is the author's own experience and tragedy which makes this largely autobiographical novel a classic.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|i own all of her stuff and this is as fresh and vibrant and good start to finish just like her others... it's a rare talent to make a recording with more than just one hit<br />if you like her you'll love this too<BR>i'm on the verge of overplaying it
B00004Y7SF|1.0|This cd is nothing more than more product of a singer who wants to have more exposure than Britney and fails! I'm ashamed that my generation buys crap like this and thinks that wearing less clothes is what it takes to be a good singer.It's not!! Grow up!!
0380977788|3.0|The story of Coraline delivers horrifying images which stay with the reader, such as buttons sewed in place of eyes on the \\"other mother,\\" and the pathetic, emaciated ghosts of the dead children killed by neglect of the \\"other parents.\\" (Actually these reminded me of the images of the \\"poor unfortunate souls\\" possessed by the Witch in the Little Mermaid movie but more horrible, as they are neglected children faded away.)  <br />There was a flatness to the tale, a lack of dimension, like a bad dream, partially remembered, though lingering.  It was not meant for children, but I feel a cautionary tale to adults who are inattentive to children - showing how harmed mentally and emotionally children can be without a loving relationship with an adult.<br />Children's books which are scarey but have more depth/value are:  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where there is character growth and more hope even in difficult situations, and help from a Good Power; Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events which so eggagerates the characters' endless dilemas, it becomes ridiculous and lightens the tale, and also has goofy asides describing word definitions;and Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett, in which a girl, Tiffany, who finds she is a witch, has to rescue her brother from an evil witch invading from fairyland.  The fights in this last tale and the struggles between good and evil are intense and even frightening.  But, again, there is more depth of character AND comic relief, as well.<br />I would not recommend Coraline for any sensitive child of any age.  Look at how frightened many of the adult readers were.  It is not worth it.<br />cz
B0000DBJDM|5.0|If you are a pink floyd fan, then this a must have especially for the behind the scenes during the making of darkside of the moon.

0316666343|5.0|The first time I heard about this book was in my senior college reading course. My teacher recommended this book to the class, so I decided to read it. After just reading the first three chapters I was amazed. I loved the idea of a girl looking down from heaven; it was a different viewpoint than I have ever read. I couldn't put the book down, I felt grief but at the same time I was feeling joy.The grief came from such a young girl dying in such a cruel way, but the joy you will have to read to find out. The story makes you wonder about heaven and what really happens after death. Can the dead really look down on you?  I would recommend this book to woman and men over the age of 14. It was an awesome book, I would give it a 5!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|HANDS DOWN!!!!This is my ALL TIME FOVORITE Dylan album. To me Blood will always represent the greatest comeback since Ali KOed Big George Foreman in Zaire. After all, what had Dylan done since Blonde On Blonde? A handful of good, even very good albums John Wesley Harding, New Morning and Planet Waves. But these were uneven with glimpses of what Blood would reveal.<br />Here he truly is the poet laureate of his generation. This is the stuff legend is made of. But wait, Bob doesn't like to be compared to a legend. I remember a reporter asking him to comment on the legacy he's left behind. He replied that legacy implied legend, and that legend was a harsh, even demonic term and he wanted nothing to do with it. So don't argue with the man you'll just get tangled up in blue.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|... you'd think they could do better. The Matrix was an okay film in itself, though the ecstatic screams of its fans mask the fact that virtually everything they were going ga-ga over had been done before, and better, by a number of other films. It had one screamingly stupid plot hole, but that doesn't make it unique either. I thought that with the second film they might be able to come up with something interesting, having now established their background.<br />Sadly, the result is considerably LESS than its predecessor promised. I don't know if it's the direction or Reeves' interpretation, but Keanu is, if anything, more woodenly expressionless in Matrix Reloaded than he was in the first Matrix -- which wasn't at all his best work in the area of expression. There's a far too overextended and sadly uninteresting sex sequence (I understand the story point, but it's far too long just to make the point), and somehow the choreography doesn't quite WORK. In that, it reminded me of Tomb Raider (the first movie): here you have all these elements that SHOULD work, and somehow it's all falling completely flat.<br />Alas. Something interesting could have been done with this, but instead we just get lots of lackluster acrobatics and combat scenes.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I had never played any of the Resident Evil games before this movie came out. When I found out it was based on a Playstation zombie killing game I passed it by time and time again at the local video store.<BR>One day I'm kicking back on the sofa flipping channels when I come across RE on one of my movie channels. I loved it, went out and bought it immediately. <BR>The story deals with a virus that was purposely released in an underground work/lab environment and causes the dead to rise and mutate on occasion.<BR>A small group of survivors must navigate their way to safety.<BR>That's the plot in a nutshell.<BR>The storyline is good and original in my opinion and the characters are all likeable. You'll find yourself pulling for them and cringing when things don't always work out so well.<BR>Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are certainly easy on the eyes. I especially liked Rodriguez's performance. <BR>I've recommended this movie to several friends who've all loved it.   I hear &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; is in production. Milla Jovovich will be reprising her role. I'm really looking forward to it.<BR>After watching the movie I went out and bought &quot;Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 for my daughter's Playstation.  The zombies freak her out so she won't play the games but she loves watching me. <BR>it's a blast. A real stress reliever for me.<BR>Bottom-line: I'd recommend both the movie and the video games.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|You know if you cannot decide if you want the cd, just listen to maynards voice in weak and powerless.  I have never heared a voice so raw before.  its perfection.  Angelic.  Listen STOP READING THIS AND GO BUY THE CD...Think of it this way.  Its a life long investment.  And buying the cd, not burning will give you good karma!!!
B000067CPX|5.0|I don't know why anyone would give this album one star...seriously, you'd have to have done an entire notebook of acid to be tweaked enough not to like this stuff. Of course it isn't as hard and sex-driven as the earlier ones, but that is what makes RHCP interesting- I'm sure their next release will be totally different than this one.
B00009QG73|3.0|I fell asleep halfway through it.  It is difficult to understand the words.  What is Bryan?  He is not a strong singer nor is he an accomplished musician.  He's still pretty good looking though. There is one REALLY GREAT song in which the piano player let go with classical sounding music, which showed he had training, but it was overridden by the audience's applause.  In my opinion, these songs are not good enough to be eternal and they should be laid to rest.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Despite the mixed reviews by Matrix fans upon it's release, The Matrix Reloaded may not be as mind blowing as the original, but it's still a great piece of film.  The co-writing and co-directing Wachowski brothers upped the ante on everything in this first sequel: the Matrix mythology is expanded more than one could have ever thought of with plenty of brain teasing secrets revealed that purposely lead into the next film.  The action has been considerably upped as well (this is a film produced by Joel Silver after all), with the fight scenes becoming more elaborate scenes of fist fueled carnage, and the much talked about &quot;burly brawl&quot; in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) takes on hundreds of multiplying Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving) is a mix of real time fighting with overdone CGI effects that doesn't exactly gel together.  The highway scene is amazingly put together, and worth the price of admission alone.  However, The Matrix Reloaded just doesn't hold all the mind bending surprises and revelations that the original film did.  Monica Bellucci's much hyped about role in the film is nothing more than an extended cameo, and Jada Pinkett-Smith is criminally underused in her role.  All it's criticisms aside though, The Matrix Reloaded is still a great film, but if your expecting something as phenominal as the original, you won't find it here.  The DVD features are surprisingly (then again, this is Warner Bros. after all) not all that plentiful (not even a commentary) which in itself is a big disappointment for those hoping for a bounty of extras.
B00008MZ0O|4.0|great action movie with some nice car racing and stunts. Diesel fuels up the screen with his part and Walker lays the law down with his undercover cop role. both do extremely well. Ja Rule makes his acting debut and he is great. the sequel I recommend for fans but im a fan and the second one was lame
B00005RRG9|5.0|Oh my god as soon as i saw this film on tv i had to buy it, i even got the bus into town after it and bought the dvd then, its absolutely fantastic. I watched it with my mam and she loved it just as much. My favourite part is when they played the 'lets get together' song together, i've since learned to play that with my fried janet, she plays the piano, its so cool, we play it to our friends and family. Anyway dont want to spoil it by going on about it, just hope you get it soon.  C ya x
0553213105|4.0|\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possesion of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or so begins PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most highly regarded classical novels of English literature.  More than likely, throughout high school and college, you will read this book.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is relatively short for a classic, only around 350 pages.  It is a medium-difficulty reading though, as the dialouge is a bit hard to keep up with and the language can be a bit \\"sophisticated.\\"<br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE tells a tale of a tangled love story.  The book centers around Elizabeth Bennent, the second oldest daughter of the Bennent family.  Her eldest sister Jane falls for Bingley, a rich and polite gentlemen.  Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, Darcy, who is even richer but has horrible manners.  When Bingley departs suddenly, Elizabeth finds out it was Darcy's doing.  Elizabeth finds herself falling in love and hating Darcy at the same time.  The novel concludes the love tales in a brilliant conclusion that makes everyone satisfied.<br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE isn't the most exciting novel, and it might be questioned why it is better than today's novels made by King, Grisham, or Sparks.  It is because it is a classic, and that there is a multitude of messages in the novel.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE criticizes the social class system, as Austen also criticizes the marriage process which can be a non consensual process.  The book is an excellent example of a satire.  The book has lively characters, and about 70 percent of the book is the well thought dialouge.<br />The book falls short of other classics though, i.e. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, OLIVER TWIST, CALL OF THE WILD, and a few others, but altogether a brilliant work.
B00009QG73|3.0|I fell asleep halfway through it.  It is difficult to understand the words.  What is Brian?  He is not a strong singer nor is he a strong musician.  He's still pretty good looking though. There is one REALLY GREAT song in which the piano player let go with classical sounding music, which showed he had training, but it was overridden by the audience's applause.  In my opinion, these songs are not good enough to be eternal and they should be laid to rest.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Some people do not understand that The Matrix: Reloaded is only half of movie, the other half being The Matrix: Revolutions.  Of course, when the movie is over you are going to feel bad and incomplete, because the story is incomplete. The scenes that people thought were pointless were interpreted like that because of two reasons: 1) the movie is not over and all of the &quot;pointless&quot; scenes will be connected somehow with the Matrix: Revolutions 2)that is one of the points the movie makes, (SPOILER) the prophecy is claimed to be false, so the journey that Neo, Morpheus and Trinity went through actually had no purpose for them.  The purpose of the journey was for the machines to get Neo to reload the matrix and end the human threat, another trick and a form of control by the machines.   That did not help the Neo's purpose, and it has actually stripped Neo's purpose, along with everyone else who believed in the prophecy.   Purpose is one of the many themes of this movie,(Smith talks extensively about purpose and how we need it) and after watching the movie, a person is left wondering, what is the purpose?  It strips away all purpose and you are left with nothing but a bunch of empty people who look like they are going to die by the machines digging into Zion.  It makes you think how we need some kind of purpose in our lives, because without it, we feel empty, which is what the end of the movie is intended to make us feel.  But we all know there is another movie coming out in three weeks, and it will deliever what everyone needs, purpose.  This is just one of the major themes of this movie, look into the others and see what you can find.  There is much more here than what meets the eye.  Great movie.
B00000K2SC|5.0|story and action set this one a masterpiece of sci-fi galore, Neo(played by the suave Keanu Reeves) enters the matrix and learns hes part of a computer program and the real world is controlled by Zion and there are sentinels who find ships and destroy them, all along there is a evil Agent Smith trying to hack out of the system and try to conquer Zion. pure pulasating rock music and fight sequences blend together to make a grand stand of a movie. one of the best of 1999
0345451325|5.0|I really like this book because it was like I was I was really on the planet Halo fighting to survive the from the evil aliens.It was confusing at first because the words where kind of big and I didn't understand,but thats what the dictionary is for.Hehe.<BR>    This book is also exciting,because you get to read about killing aliens.The book's main character is named John who is a super soldier and one of he best.He has a steel suit that makes him stronger and faster.What I liked the most in this book was the action and the new words in it.I got to learn some new words that i didn't know before.<BR>     I recommend this book to all ages because it is soooooooooo cool.In fact it's so good i'm reading it again.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I've read the LOTR trilogy several times, and although the last time was many years ago, I can still remember most details of the storyline and the overall spirit of the books.  I've purposely put off reading the trilogy again until after ROTK debuts in December, to avoid being distracted by minor changes in the storyline.<br />The major departures from the storyline in TTT are noticeable but minimal.  Most importantly, none of the changes violate the essence of Tolkien's world, or the spirit of the characters, or the heart of the conflict that rages in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age.  So what if there are Elves at Helm's Deep (other than Legolas) in the movie?  So what if the trees of Fangorn never make it to the Deep to take care of the fleeing host of Isengard?  So what if Faramir takes Frodo to Osgiliath before letting him go?  None of these changes wreck the story or make the movie any less enjoyable.<br />I suspect that these major changes were all driven by cinemagraphic factors.  I look forward to the Extended Version to see what comments Peter Jackson makes on these changes.  I thought his reasons for changes in the FOTR storyline were satisfactory.<br />The amazing thing about Jackson's work on LOTR is that he manages to keep Tolkien's overall epic AND his development of all the main characters in a format that only allows him to use a fraction of the LOTR text.<br />And the movie itself is awesome in its own right.  I saw FOTR twice at the theatre; TTT brought me to the big screen three times.  The special effects and panoramic views are without equal.  Howard Shore's score is phenomenal.  <br />I don't understand why anyone (including the LOTR purists) wouldn't at least appreciate this film.  If you love Tolkien and can't stand any deviation from his original work, then I suppose you shouldn't consider buying this.  But if you love good movies, you should be able to enjoy The Two Towers whether you've read the books or not.
0316776963|5.0|Annotation: A humorous autobiographic novel by David Sedaris outlining random events in his life.  His unusual life stories tell of his childhood lisp troubles and speech therapy classes, his guitar lessons taught by a midget, his struggle to become an artist and trying to learn and survive the French culture and language.<br />Author bio:  David Sedaris was born in New York and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. He's openly and happily gay. He lives in Paris with his boyfriend Hugh Hamrick.  He has worked as a housecleaner and, as a part-time elf for Macy's.  Many of his plays have been produced, and his essays are featured regularly in The New Yorker, Harpers, and Esquire.<br />Evaluation:  This was a very very good book.  My sister had read it and recommended it to me.  This was the first book I had picked up in a long time and was pulled into it by Sedaris' humor.  At times, especially during class, I would find myself trying to hold in my laughter as to not make a scene. I usually have a hard time getting into a book when I first start reading, but this book started out with an interesting and of course humorous tale of Sedaris' speech therapy classes.   I finished this book in about a week because every time I picked it up, I didn't want to stop reading it. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs a good dose of laughter.
B0000AMJEH|2.0|Vin Diesel was right to stay out of this one. It flopped big time when I watched it in the theaters. I was so bored. yeah, ok, cars speeding there, he jumps a gap in the bridge, ok. lame action. not even close as better to the first one. the first one had style and ok Ludacris is in this one but who cares about him, hes not a good actor. Ja Rule outacted him in the first one, Ja Rule was way much better then him
B0000AXE8I|5.0|A pox on the critics who loved ponderous turkeys like Gosford Park and The Royal Tenenbaums and missed the point about this explosively over-the-top kaleidoscope of special effects and deeper intellectual content than they recognized. The fight sequences and the spectacular car chase (actual California commute footage, by the way) are state of the art, and the plot actually is not as simple-minded as the critics contend. For example, when the Oracle tells Neo that even the crows have an elaborate program code written to govern their actions, one is reminded of Biblical and literary references to no sparrow falling without God's notice. Although the underlying plot device of comatose human slavery powering the Matrix is awfully hard to buy on a literal level in the first movie, this second movie sucessfully raises questions about choice, free will, and predestination. Up for grabs are the cosmologies of the Bible, Darwin, and William Gibson. Admittedly, there is a certain garbled quality to the revelations offered at the end, but they hook you into the last installment, don't they? I suspect much of what we are told will probably be refuted in Matrix Revolutions, but that is part of the intellectual fun of the entire concept. It does some good for those of us who habituate a two-dimensional electronic environment to remember that the boundary between the real and the perceived is subject to survey.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Star Trek V has got to be the most frustrating of all the Trek films.  It is on one hand the most ambitious of all the Trek films in the scope of it's story, while on the other hand is marred by some terrible set pieces and gags during the first third of the film.<br />I've watched the DVD a couple of times now to catch all the commentaries and I've come away with the impression that on a whole, Trek V is far more succesful than I gave it credit for when it was originally released.  Once Sybock has Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew right where he wants them on Nimbus III, the film hits it right on nearly all the marks.<br />Lawrence Luckinbill is extremely charismatic as Sybock.  He hits the right balance between fanatic and compassionate self-help guru.  The scene where he allows McCoy and Spock purge themselves of their greatest fears is a wonderfully staged and directed scene, much to Shatner's credit.  Kirk's rejection of Sybock's &quot;gift&quot; rings true.  Now we understand why Starfleet wanted Kirk on this mission and not just any other starship captain.<br />There is much to recommend in this film.  Firstly, it has the grandest scope of all the Trek films.  The number of real locations used was a welcome relief to all the studio-bound outings prior to Trek V (especially the rather unconvincing Genesis Planet in Trek III).  And the fact that we are on a space mission, once again exploring stange new worlds as they did in the original series, makes the film feel like almost nostalgic.<br />The cinematography is crisp and exciting to look at.  With the exception of the first third of the film, the acting is great, even though there are the odd character moments that crop up throughout the film, mostly at our beloved character's expense.  Also, the new bridge and shuttle bay sets are far more convincing than the Christmas tree light-laden Enterprise sets of Treks I, II, and III.<br />Finally, the story bravely deals with the themes of God, faith, pain, love, redemption and sacrifice in an interesting and positive way rather than the existential viewpoints in much of contemporary cinema and literature.  Being of a religious bent myself, I find this very refreshing.<br />Of course, much of the criticism leveled at the film is very warrented.  A good deal of the humour in the first third of the film feels forced and falls flat.  The special effects, with the exception of a few shots look less than stellar.<br />Even these short-comings give Trek V an almost &quot;retro&quot; feel to it, as if it were like a lost episode of the original series instead of a feature film.  The way McCoy hangs out on the bridge, casually sitting on a console...the way everyone gets a little piece of the action (though in some cases, in some achingly embarrisingly ways)...the way the view out of the windows in the officer's lounge gives an awesome feeling of forward momentum through the cosmos and into the unknown.<br />As far as the extras are concerned, I found both the text and audio commentaries to be less than thrilling.  Shatner and his daughter recount stories on the set and pranks that were played, finally lamenting a great deal about how short changed they were regarding the budget.  I would have preferred to hear more about the philosophy behind Shatner's desire to make this film, about his religious beliefs and how he views our place in the cosmos.  The extras on the second disk are a grab bag of interesting and not so interesting material, depending on your tastes.<br />On a whole though, as long as you can sit through some really terrible gags and set pieces in the first third of the film, Trek V has an awful lot going for it.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I really dont konw why this album opened up to so much criticism (despite selling 5 million copies). Unlike most people, I never expected this album to be better than 'Play' , Moby's album which completey took the world by storm from mid 1999- mid 2001 selling 12 million copies. People expected too much from this album and in their state of high expectations they failed to engage what '18' really is about. 'Play' was much of a wordly album, full of funky beats, eloborate messages, funky vocal samples etc. '18' is much more of an introverted, personal album that doesnt suit being blared from turntables in a nightclub, rather being listened to over a hot cup of chocolate milk on a rainy day. There are too many good songs for this album to be calssified as 'crap' from the pseudo-70's rock title track 'We are All Made of Stars' to the sombre 'Signs of Love' and the sweeping electronic orchestrations of '18' and 'Look Back In'. What people failed to realise is that Moby never changed his sound, and never intended to ,but changed his mood and emotional imput into his songs. '18' grows on you constantly, the more you listen, the more you realise its an album that you are hooked on.
6304140711|4.0|Wahlberg goes all the way in this one and thats what makes this movie so intense and creepy, hes so creepy. He's Reese Witherspoons new boyfriend David and he seems a little off put, well maybe thats because hes a total psycho. William Petersen is Witherspoons dad, Amy Breneman is Witherspoons step-mom and Alyssa Milano is Witherspoons friend. some intense moments include where Wahlberg follows the kid and snaps his neck, that looked so real and where him and his friends invade Witherspoons house at the end and kill her dog. some parts may be sdisturbing for parents. the climactic battle at the end with Petersen and Wahlberg is intense also as Petersen throws Wahlberg out the window and he hits the rocks below
B0000DF3PN|5.0|If you think Celine Dion is fabulous in English, you should hear her in French.  Her sound is much more original, less commericial.  1F4T is a fantastic album.  It has an organic, rock sound.  You don't need to know french to love this album or any of her last few french albums (d'eux, s'il suffaist d'aimer, chante plamodon).  I don't know any french and i'm not some obsessed fan. but i love the french albums anyway because they are the best of an incredible artist whose english output can be quite bland and uninspired sometimes.<br />The track listing:<br />tout l'or des hommes<br />apprends-moi<br />le vol d'un ange<br />ne bouge pas<br />tu nages<br />je t'aime encore (english version with french title is on \\"One Heart\\")<br />retiens-moi<br />je lui dirai<br />mon homme<br />rien n'est vraiment fini<br />contre nature<br />des milliers de baisers<br />plus the bonus \\"ghost track\\" not listed anywhere on the cd:<br />valse adieu

Bartleby(Ben Affleck) and Loki(Matt Damon) are on their way to Jersey to go home and in doing so create chaos and they have the help of Azerl(Jason Lee), 3 skatepunks and a crap demon.

B000089RVR|4.0|When I first listened to this CD, I thought it was really dull.  But when I listened to it for the second time in my car, I enjoyed it.  Dido's music is so calm, and that's what I like.  It's great to listen to when you're looking out the window and seeing what's out there.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I've been a fan of MC and Enigma for many years, now.  I bought this CD with moderate expectations because of all of the forward press about how the album would be a &quot;vast departure&quot; from the old Enigma sound.  And, of course, upon first listening to it I hated it.  After the third listen I &quot;got it&quot; and now I really love this CD<br />Cretu's genius can be attributed in part to the fact that his music constinually evolves.  He is in tune with his audience and with himself.  On one occasion in the past I was convinced that I had outgrown music from Enigma... until E4 came out.  E5 is no exception.  These days, I never spin the old stuff.  I just hope this artist keeps up the good work and continues to out-do himself.<br />That said, I'm glad to see the marketing geniuses over at Virgin are releasing a promo of &quot;Boum Boum&quot;.  Say what you may about the song, it is one of the few that has any mass appeal.  And, to be frank, Enigma needs a hit to keep record co. support.  I could not believe that Virgin execs had E4 in their hands and did not promo &quot;Silence Must be Heard&quot;.  The last track on this new album may have some mass appeal, but &quot;Voyageur&quot;?  Give me a break...<br />Cheers
B00005Q4GA|1.0|boy, oh, boy they really blew the hell outta this franchise and they shouldnt of made this movie at all. Angelina is really annoying in this part, its antiedupped by the butler who is played by Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie who portrays Rimmer on the show, he is the only thing likable in this fishy smelling film. the action scenes are a yawn and the ending with that globe thing is just a total waste of my time. its dead in the water for me
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Talking about the movie, the first one was quite a bit better. I would still recommend it though, just because it is better than many of the movies out there. Its a good dvd copy.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Alright, listen up.  Truth of the matter is that Neo is AI just like the other computer programs.  The Zion world is not truly the real world.  Neo is the \\"one\\" that will be able to set people free unto the real world, this will include sending trinity, morpheus and the rest of the gang to the real world to fight those machines. Neo will stay inside the two matrices to free people sending them to the real real world .  Once trinity and morpheus are set free for real, they will never see Neo again because they will not be able to reenter the matrices once they are free for good.  Neo will never be able to go to the real real world since he is AI. So the love between trinity and Neo is that of a human and a machine.  THAT IS ALL.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Godspeed you Black Emperor! have been a band that has impressed me with every release that I have heard. Beginning with first hearing &quot;Broken Flag Blues&quot; on a friends mix tape, I was intrigued by this wierd and wonderful music, with its long extended forms and crescendos. Reading up about it, I have found post-rock to be a most enjoyable music, one that takes elements of rock in its made-for-radio original format and trasnplants it into something new, something that follows instead a more classical bent with churning guitars and lush strings creating a new avant-garde style of classical music.<br />This album is probably the best Godspeed album. It features some of their best work and is also a very varied and unpredictable listen, especiall compared to their earlier work with its 'rise-and-fall' predictability of its crescendos. Those of you familiar with other bands in the post-rock field may know that many of these bands are more electronic and a word of advice; these guys are acoustic apart from reverbed guitars. <br />I highly recommend this album to people who are interested in experimental music, not simply because it is 'hardcore' (which this is not) but because it is good music. This music is very beautiful and with patience to listen to the lengthy pieces, it is a highly rewarding experience.

Williard is not the strong character of the followons, but equally good here.<br />Too bad Levy isn't here, maybe as crazed drummer?
B000002BE9|4.0|Yeah, I know I've arrived late on the Fiona Apple band wagon. But I just purchased this CD a few days ago and I can't get enough of it. Firstly, I must point on that my taste in music is generally of a soul/jazz orientation, although I have been increasing my listening habits to include singer/songwriters. I am a fan of honest and personal music, and just as soul and jazz is expressive and personal, so too is Fiona, and the singer/songwriter genre in general.<br />Fiona's Tidal is an album that is mainly in the spare singer/songwriter style of many '70s efforts. However, on a few tracks she does add other elements such as a more funky beat on &quot;Criminal&quot; and a latin-tinge to &quot;The First Taste.&quot; Musically, the album has the under-produced and acoustic feel of singer/songwriter albums. Lyrically, it is one that is very honest.<br />The lyrical content is highly poetic and cryptic, as you'd expect from this genre of music. Fiona definately seems to have been affected by her rape, as we witness on &quot;Sullen Girl,&quot; an explanation of why she is the way she is. The rest of the album seems to also be of a more inward uncertainty; reproaching herself in &quot;Criminal&quot; and talking about a love that is not so good in &quot;Carrion.&quot; While at times the lyrics can be somewhat juvenile as other reviewers have pointed out, my question is this; have you listen to mainstream R &amp; B? The lyrics are at times terrible and the songs are written by people who are 10 years older than Fiona. Give the girl a break!<br />This album is a one that I would recommend to people who are fans of singer/songwriters as it is one that is as confessional and honest as the best of the genre's hey day in the 1970s. It is probably the best album I have purchased since Blackalicious &quot;Blazing Arrow&quot; (underground hip hop) and John Mayer's acoustic first album &quot;Inside Wants Out.&quot; And at my rate of at least a CD a week, that says something.

Corey Haim and Corey Feldman dont play brothers in this but new friends who help Michael defeat the boys. the grandpa is way awesome and that bit at that end where he says, &quot;the one this I hated about living in Sante Carlo, all the damn vampires&quot; or he said something like that and thats classic.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Don't worry. This DVD is great.It had an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen tv's. At least the region 2 edition is but I'm sure that Paramount wil release an indentically same edition in the USA. The picture is of amazing good quality, as is the 5.1 remastered sound. A complete version also and including a second disc with many extra's.One of the best dvd re-releases of all times!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Being an avid music fan, I often catch myself in the 'heard it all before' mindset. It could be that my teens happened to be in the early to mid 90's. Then we had Pearl Jam...now...Creed. Needless to say, there are too many cheap imitations floating around (especially the ones with a Messiah Complex). Which is why I was absolutely floored by this album. Vocalist M. Shadows has a range that few in the game can claim to be in the ballpark of. He can switch from a Dani Filth-esque  scream, to a Greg Graffin-like elder statesman croon on a dime, and that's just the bookends.. he goes everywhere in-between as well. Guitarists Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates are a tandem of guitar hero encyclopedias. Yet they never come off as plagerizing, rather it's honest to goodness homage. You can hear the influence of Dimebag Darrell, Slash, and the dueling  harmonies of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest all blended to a perfection that Yuban brags of their coffee. Drummer The Rev. beats his kit like a red-headed stepchild, and while his double bass patterns are frequent, he never hides behind them (a rarity in this genre). Optin to serve the song as opposed to getting in the way of it. No two songs on this album sound the same. To be honest, the last cd I was this excited about was Pantera's Vulgar Display Of Power..and that was 11 years ago. From the hammer-on/pull off opener \\"Unholy Confessions\\", through the \\"November Rain\\" meets \\"Suicide Note Part.2\\" of \\"I Won't See You Tonight\\" (a devestating 2 parter) to the brutal closer \\"All Things Will End\\" A7X sets the listener up for the kill with a dizzying variety of tempo and vocal changes. My only knock against it is that it's not a box set, because I'm wearing ruts in this disc.
0790734591|4.0|this is sorta like a spoof of Lethal Weapon but its great and theres lots of suspense and thrills along the way. though theres some parts that parents might not take. all in all the 2 leads deliver good parts. favorite part is when Kim Coates hits Willis and then Willis upchucks him in the nose breaking his nose and killing him, that was great

B00008J4P5|5.0|I myself have a large CD collection and I take music vary seriously.  This is the first reveiw I have written because I usally don't wast my time, but in this case I felt that I should voice what I think is an INCREDABLE album.  The White Strips have released three albums previous to the one, and after giving them all a listen you can see that thay continually develop themselfs.  If you listen to them, you can tell that they draw form different gondras like rock and blues, and still they have their own unique sound.  Also it seems to me that their music is influenced by the Beatles and other british bands.  <BR>If you like the Smashing Pumkins or Raidiohead you should by this album because of its refreashing unique style.  I can not believe that anybody would be disappointed for buying this album which is whay I rate it a 5 star album.
B000056MOD|3.0|better than Highlander3, way better. this one has Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert, both McClouds, teaming up to stop the evil Brucy Payne(the preist Jacob) and it tells of great storys with nice action scenes including scenes with Donnie Yen(from Blade2 and Iron Monkey). theres like one scene with sex and thats with Adrian Paul and his wife. though I hated seeing Lambert's head get chopped off but hey, thats the way it is and the ending where Paul thinks his wife is dead but shes not and she appears is a great ending.

Moreso than some other Petty albums, this one is strong from top to bottom- every song is beautiful, and the flow of the album is superior to &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;.  The addition of Stever Ferrone on drums is a perfect compliment to Tom's emotional messages and enhances the band a substantially.  My favorite tracks from the album are the mellow, beautiful tracks:#3, 5, and 14.  Listen to these three and you'll want to buy the album.
0767819446|4.0|a man is murdered and a cop suspects a techman partner for his death, but what happens next is astounding and the finale is great too. the theory in here is that theres the real world set in the future and they create a game world of the real world which is todays world and then todays world creates a game that goes back into the old world and you can be who ever you want to be, plus theres a killer on the loose. hang on tight. D'Onofrio, Mol, Stahl, Haysbert and Bierko give nice performances
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Ralph Fiennes, who is by far one of the most gifted actors of his time, teams up yet again with Juliette Binoche, his costar in English Patient, to make the Bronte tale come to life with superb acting, and vivid imagery,not to mention beautiful,albeit morose scenery. Makes one long to don a velvet cape, and stroll along the moors at dusk alone.Sure, this is a gloom and doom story, but it is just so superbly made...a visual treat.I love the Sinead cameo.Just a fine film.Highly Recommended.

6305922756|5.0|Spinal Tap. Not your everyday mulleted metal-rockers -- oh no, they're the loudest band in the world.<br /><br />Or so says Marti DiBergi (played with a straight face by director Rob Reiner), in a hysterical \\"rockumentary\\" that focuses on the dumber side of rock'n'roll. \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" has become the quintessential rock'n'roll movie -- full of strangely lifelike jokes, gigantic hair, annoying girlfriends, hilarious acting, and a many an exploding drummer from time to time.<br /><br />Spinal Tap, the loudest band in Britain, is returning to the US for the first time in years to promote their new album, \\"Smell The Glove.\\" Trailing behind them is DiBergi, capturing every strange moment on film and interviewing the solemnly strange trio that makes up the core, Nigel (Christopher Guest), Derek  (Harry Shearer), and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean). Their many drummers have died in a series of bizarre freak accidents (including the vague \\"gardening accident\\"), choking on someone else's vomit, and spontaneous combustion).<br /><br />Charting the history of the band (including psychedelic rock) to the present, DiBergi chronicles the controversy that springs up around \\"Smell the Glove\\"'s sexist cover (\\"What's wrong with being sexy?\\" \\"Sex-IST!\\"). After bizarre mishaps (a Stonehenge set the size of a cat), waning popularity and falling sales, the manager quits in anger and Nigel walks out. Is it the end of Spinal Tap?<br /><br />One of the funniest ways make something funny is to stay really, really close to reality -- and that is where \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" strikes gold. It sticks JUST close enough to be semi-accurate, but remains just on the outside line of comedy --  basically, if you like laughtracks, gross-out humour and pratfalls, this isn't your kind of movie.<br /><br />The humor is all the funnier because it's delivered in a deadpan manner: Nigel's amp that \\"goes to 11,\\" the cucumber incident, or when Derek gets trapped in a plastic pod, and has to be freed via a desperate roadie with a blowtowtorch. And sprinkled in between are little interviews between DiBergi and the band, littered with hilarious quotables (\\"It's like fire and ice, basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water\\").<br /><br />In fact, Reiner manages to craft a very believable rock'n'roll world, complete with label controversies, Sinatra-loving chauffeurs, groupies and frequent technical malfunctions. And the music... hoo boy, just try not to laugh at \\"Gimme Some Money,\\" \\"Sex Farm,\\" \\"Listen To The Flower People,\\" and the sidesplitting \\"Big Bottom\\" (\\"Big bottoms drive me out of my mind/how could I leave that behind?\\"). Not to mention Nigel's ghastly Druid monologue.<br /><br />And rock in-jokes are sprinkled liberally through the movie. There are homages to Black Sabbath (the teeny Stonehenge), Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin (playing a guitar with a violin), and countless other little jokes. Even Jeanine is based on famed rock girlfriends like Yoko Ono and Anita Pallenberg.<br /><br />As for the actors... well, reportedly they made up a lot of their dialogue on the wing, which might explain why they are so unspeakably funny. You'd almost think they were real -- in fact, a few uninformed people have.<br /><br />Guest and McKean form the core of the story, as the lovably clueless Nigel (\\"It's one louder\\") and the savvier, too-influenced-by-his-girlfriend David. These guys really rule the screen with their rambling dialogue and gigantic hair. The hairy Harry Shearer is less front-and-center, but both he's pretty funny too -- as is Reiner, who somehow manages to keep a straight face through it all.<br /><br />\\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is the ultimate rock movie -- a funny, deadpan, wittily mocking little look at the world's loudest band. A treasure.a desperate roadie with a blowtowtorch.

B0000AUHOH|5.0|I have reviewed Star Trek V: The Final Frontier before, but feel compelled to do so again based on my recent purchase of this Special Edition DVD. <br />First off, let me revisit my feelings on the film itself. Star Trek V is one of my favorite Trek films. I think that this and &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; best embody the themes and tone of the original series which I love so much. &quot;Final Frontier&quot; was an ambitious project that explored many relevant issues including family, spirituality, terrorism / fanaticism, and religion. The underlying theme of the film is the bond of the Enterprise crew, specifically on Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, which was always one of the most entertaining and important aspects of the original series. Put these elements together and add in some action, lightheartedness, and good plot twists, and Trek V delivers where other Trek films have failed. <br />I am always amazed at how fans and critics miss the wealth of priceless moments in this film. The campfire scene is wonderful, and the scenes in the observation lounge with the three heros and Sybok are probably the best exploration of these characters since the 60's. These are the elements that make Trek V so endearing to true fans.<br />Unfortunately, on the surface, Trek V does not deliver as much, and that is what generally hurts the film. The direction and editing are very good, and there is a fresh look that we have not seen in the more asthetic Star Treks 1-4. However, the execution of the plot is somewhat flawed and a bit corny at times (but then again, so was the original series). The special effects are the worst of any of the films, and the climax suffers miserably because of it. It is unfortunate that the film is basically judged on these shortcomings rather than the many strengths it has.<br />As for the DVD Special Edition, it is by far the best of the Trek series. Although the William and Lizabeth Shatner commentary is not nearly as entertaining as the Shatner / Nimoy commentary from &quot;Voyage Home&quot;, it is still interesting. The &quot;Advertising&quot; portion of the disk includes some very well put together trailers and TV spots that took me back to 1989 when I was anticipating this movie's release. The &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette and &quot;Press Conference&quot; piece are both very good. The Press Conference is a very rare and interesting extra. The deleted scenes are pretty much useless, and it's hard to believe that cutting most of these small scenes really saved them anything, but it's a great added feature that we have not seen in the other &quot;Special Editions&quot;. Most of the other featurettes are interesting and fun as well. <br />Overall, this is a good Star Trek movie, and easily the best of the Special Editions. I question Paramount's decision to not produce this as a &quot;Director's Edition&quot;, thus allowing Shatner to improve and re-cut his film with digital technology (much the same way Star Trek- The Motion Picture was retooled). I would have thought that if any film could use improvement that would truly IMPROVE the plot, it would be this one (whereas Star Trek I was more cosmetic improvements). Alas, Paramount is not known for it's intellegent decisions where Star Trek is concerned. <br />This is a worthwhile DVD to add to your collection.
B00004T37H|5.0|this one shines and its grandstandly animated. one of my favorites in anime movies. a young man(BIlly Crudup) is stricken by a boar god and he has to go on a journey. soon he comes between a war brewing between the animal gods(featuring voices of Keith David and Gillian Anderdson) and a greedy lady(viciously voiced by Minnie Driver) and he falls in love with Princess Mononoke(played great by Claire Danes voice),a  girl who is housed by the wolfs and theres also a greedy fat man(Billy Bob Thornton) in the mix, the lady and the fat man want the head of the forest spirit but if they do so they will create chaos and everything will be distroyed. some great moments include the cutting off of the forest spirits head, the showing of Iron Town and the cute white forest spirit spirits whose heads turn and click(funny). other voices contributed are Jada Pinkett Smith and John DiMaggio(who voices Bender on TV's Futurama).
0385504209|5.0|I finished this book yesterday - and it's one of those that I keep thinking about, missing the characters a bit, now that I've left their story-line.  It's entertaining, intriguing, fun, but I didn't once mistake it for a textbook or a factual primary source.<br />I liked it for the same reasons I like WWII code-breaker stories, it united math, history and art with a suspenseful storyline.  And like other interesting stories, it prompted me to do my own research into some of the tenets of the plot.  Overall, a very entertaining fiction!
B00006IU73|5.0|I had never heard of Steve Wilson before this, and he has also done producing and even some playing for the band Opeth. If Opeth is as good as this, then I must hear it. Porcupine Tree fuses Prog-Metal with smooth almost-world music. Each song is either driven by an awesome guitar solo, etheral vocals, or a sweet rhythm section. The songs are quite beautiful, from the banging instrumental \\"Wedding Nails\\" to the peaceful yet eerie \\"Heartattack on a Layby\\". My fave is Trains, Which starts of as an acoustic song, then breaks off into a great melody and an acoustic solo, then there is a sort of banjo part (the only thing i disagree with), before it explodes back into the main melody, only this time with distortion. It's great!<BR>)(...) trust me, the CD is great!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|William Miller, a 15 year old aspiring rock journalist of the 70's, lies about his age and goes on tour with the upcoming band of the moment Stillwater to do an interview for Rolling Stone magazine. Along the way he finds out about true friendship (and not so true), falls in love, and loses his virginity - all while trying to break free of his over-protective and worried sick mother. Kate Hudson plays Penny Lane, the gorgeous wild-child &quot;Band-Aid&quot; who steals the heart of William but has her own stolen by the self-centered guitarist of the band. <BR>This is a great movie - definitely one of my favorites of all time. Some say that it is losely based on the life of Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script and directed the movie. <BR>This director's edition bootleg cut is great to own - you get 2 discs (disc one is the movie with never before seen footage, an interview with Lester Bangs, behind the scenes footage, Cameron Crowe's top 10 albums of '73, and a music video; disc two is the special features disc which comes with Stillwaters Cleveland Concert, Deleted scenes with directors commentary, Oscar winning screenplay, theatrical trailer, production notes, cast &amp; crew info &amp; more) and it also comes with a Stillwater CD - songs of the band that you can take with you in the car! The movie also has a great soundtrack that was put together by Crowe's wife, Nancy Wilson (guitarist from the 70's/80's band Heart)<BR>Great movie, highly recommended!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I'm amazed to read some of these reviews.  Only one reviewer so far has hit on some of the intriguing aspects of what the matrix is doing here.  I'll have to watch a few more times to see what is actually &quot;repeating&quot;, but the end of this movie blew me away.  Stopping those sentinels &quot;outside&quot; of the matrix???  What was that.  Very few sequels capture the audience like the first, because the story is already out there, and we anticipate what will happen next.  Especially a sandwiched sequel like this.  I've seen the previews of revolutions and it just makes me want to watch all this even more.  I would also reccomend watching the animatrix.  It definitely adds to the story line by telling a prequel scene to the matrix reloaded and also adding the history of man vs machine.  Stop being impressed or put off by the action in the movie and think a little more about the story line.  The Wachowskis are weaving one helluva web here!
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is about how one man (Kevin Spacey) didn't like his life and decided to change it. Lester starts off miserable. He hates his pencil pushing 9-5 job; his wife and he have just been going through the motions for years; his teenage daughter hates him; and everyone walks all over him. But he turns it all around and becomes the man that he always wanted to be and begins to live the &quot;simple life&quot; that he lived as a teenager when he was the happiest. As he says, it's never too late to turn it all around.<BR>The awardsedition of this movie is great. it comes with over 3 hours of bonus features ( Behind the scenes, interviews with cast and crew, film commentary by writer and director, storyboard presentaion by director, digital screenplay with corresponding film footage and storyboards - dvd rom only -, cast and crew biographies, theatrical trailers, production notes, and other DVDrom features!)<BR>This is a great movie - funny and dramatic. watch it, you'll love it!
B000005ILF|3.0|Thee are just so many people out there that admire Sting for who he really is. I can't deny it without any preference, he is truly one of the most brilliany singer-songwriters that've ever made it into this business. Unfortunately, that didn't come into position, all the way. When Sting released his 1993 record, Ten Summoner's Tales, he redefined his career as a solo act. But to follow up that position isn't that easy. I couldn't say more than meets the eye.<br />The 1996 album, Mercury Falling, shows a little bit of difficulty within the record itself. Although the music does seem to range quite smoothly, it doesn't seem to have that legacy Ten Summoner's Tales made. Although there are some good tracks to the mix on here like Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot, and I Hung My Head. Still, there are some songs that could've been upgraded on the record. One song, I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying, was released twice by Sting, once solo and the other as a duet with Toby Keith. The duet seemed to be a bigger hit than Sting solo, and could've been added to this record as well.<br />Still, there are so many words to describe Sting, except improvements with his records. Thankfully, he has made better albums like Brand New Day and Sacred Love. Still, Sting has came a long way, but this record wasn't one of them. Hopefully, he will try this on a better Greatest Hits collection than the last one released in 2002.
0312263120|5.0|Dan Brown has been getting a lot of press lately for his most recent novel, The DaVinci Code, which debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. *Digital Fortress*, Brown's first book (published in 1998), is another taut, intelligent thriller designed to keep you up late.<br /><br />Just as The DaVinci Code, Digital Fortess is peopled by highly intelligent characters. Susan Fletcher, brilliant mathematician/cryptographer, and her linguistically accomplished fiance David Becker are both caught up in a plot against the National Security Agency's secret--indeed, officially nonexistent--super computer. With the brute force of its three million processors, TRANSLTR is capable of breaking any code in an average of about six minutes. Or it  is, at least, until the action of the book begins, when TRANSLTR is fifteen hours into at attempt to crack a code its creator claims is unbreakable. The clock ticks loudly in this book as David, Susan, and other NSA employees work to break the code and/or discover its pass-key before the algorithm is made public and/or a computer worm destroys the security protecting the United States' most confidential information. Meanwhile, an assassin is dogging Becker's steps in Spain, an NSA employee may be in cahoots with the author of the code, and a zealous security guard is pushed to his death in the bowels of the super computer's housing.<br /><br />Some of the plot twists in Digital Fortress are predictable, but this hardly detracts from the book. Brown's debut novel is a riveting thriller you'll find hard to put down.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle have managed to take the success of their first album and make a follow up which breaks all the standard rules of second albums. Instead of pumping out the same formula, this album (aside of Outsider and Pet) sounds nothing like Mer de Noms, but still manages to maintain the now easily recognized APC sound. Thirteenth Step is an album that shows musical growth, and while it's not as mainstream or instantly catchy as Mer de Noms, it's a better album in the long run.
B000002J6F|4.0|People tend to overpraise certain albums as time goes by. In the case of this album, the praise is worthy. If you liked anything CSNY,Byrds,Eagles,Or Neil Young has ever done , you will like this album. Another beauty of this is classic rock radio hasnt played it to death, so you are not tired of any of the songs. The lp is very diverse and Steven Stills was probably at his creative peak. The lp has a confident sound. You can hear that these guys knew they were putting down some great tracks.
B00005221L|5.0|Predator is one of the best sci-fi action thrillers I've ever seen.  It's definitely in my top ten sci-fi movies as number 3, with Aliens (at number 2) and the original Star Wars (number 1) ahead of it.  As you may or may not know Predator is an alien bounty hunter from another planet who has come to Earth to hunt the human race.  In the film, Major Dutch Sheafer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of CIA operatives (Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura, Carl Weathers, and a few others) have been called on by the U.S. government to go to South America to rescue a group of hostages being held captive by a secret guerrilla army.  Upon rescuing the captives, Dutch and his group stumble across a strange being lurking in the jungle.  As one member of Dutch's group could remember, the jungle just seemed to \\"come to life\\"(you and I all know it was the predator with his camoflage armor).  One by one, Dutch's group is picked off by the alien creature until it is just him and the Predator, duking it out in one, final showdown.  Before I spoil the ending, I'd like to say that Predator is nothing short of great.  You like Arnold and Sci-fi films, Predator is just right.
B00003CXTG|2.0|So there's a script for &quot;Pearl Harbor.&quot; It's bad. How bad? Imagine a dog writing it. <br />Actually, Randall Wallace penned it. He wrote &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;The Patriot.&quot; These were not awful films, though neither were particularly accurate on the history front. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is more accurate, but it's like a mini-outline with a poorly conceived love triangle in the middle. <br />I've seen many 1940s movies, where actors fired off lines of wit and verve with the same energy. What is the assembled acting clan supposed to do with what passes for dialogue in this film? I don't know. Believe me, they didn't either. <br />At the centerpiece of this three-hour clambake is a 40-minute invasion sequence, where Japanese planes descend upon battleships and airfields at the Hawaiian naval base. The director, Michael Bay, of many other loud, brogue action films, has made this sequence equally loud, and things blow up over and over as planes zoom, as they must, through the same mangled set of ship wreckage and ominous flotsam. <br />How disappointing this melee of fireworks is. It's redundant for one, the action clearly dialed down to achieve a PG-13 rating. And though it's meant to be the payoff, of course it isn't, because we can barely understand the Japanese motives or strategy behind the attack, nor do we care to see Americans blown up continuously, in the exact same fashion as the last scene. <br />Consider &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for a second. Infinitely better film, but infinitely better in styling its combat scenes - it has a progression, for example, and innovation in terms of camera angles and point of view shots. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; steals all the choice shots from &quot;Ryan&quot; (the underwater cameras with bullets streaming by) and cuts at such a furious rate that the action becomes nonsensical. <br />It is for this sequence that you're watching the film at all. That it doesn't deliver is reason for disappointment. Then you must consider what is around it - a story of supreme cliche and weariness, as born pilot Rafe (Ben Affleck) falls for nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) before volunteering to fly for the British Air Force against the German Luftwaffe. He leaves behind Evelyn and best friend Danny (Josh Hartnett), also a pilot. <br />Rafe dies in action. The nurse and best friend get transferred to Pearl Harbor. Nurse and best friend spark relationship. Rafe returns (He was in occupied France! He couldn't get word! And all he thought of was Evelyn!). Anger and betrayal ensue, with more bad dialogue. The next day, they all live in infamy. <BR>We're with these simpering flakes and their romantic overtures for 90 minutes before bombs fly. This is an attempt to steal the top off another film, &quot;Titanic,&quot; which set forth a reasonable love story of some interest before iceberg, straight ahead. <br />But Wallace, said screenwriter, whiffs. One cliche, or two, fine. But when there's a lone Irish pilot in the film, when he has red hair and wee mustache, when he speaks in a thick Irish stew accent, and when his name is Ian, the line I must draw. <br />Bay hides his lack of storytelling skills by using the Jelly Belly palette of colors. I don't care if he can make a sky look nine different shades of aquamarine. How about not backlighting all scenes as if its showtime at the dinner theater? Or stopping the camera? Or refraining from the use of music better suited for &quot;Rocky IV&quot; in scenes that involve the Japanese? <br />And, of course, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; ends dramatically upbeat, with the United States' pinkerton response over Tokyo on April 3, 1942, led by Captain Doolittle (a glistening Alec Baldwin) and his Raiders, of which Danny and Rafe are a part. <br />It concludes with a speech of great overstatement by Evelyn that suggests after Doolittle's raid: &quot;Japan knew nothing but defeat. And the United States knew but victory.&quot; <br />That's just the kind of history &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; chooses to serve up: that the U.S. then went on to pummel Japan at will for three years in the Pacific before dropping a couple atomic bombs in 1945 as a sundae cherry. Sure. And bats can see. <br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is an unmitigated insult to the day and the place. The romance is pitched at an eighth-grade level, so the teens might like it, but I cringe at them thinking they've learned history here.
B000092ZYX|4.0|It's spelled Myxomatosis (the CD has it right) and it is a disease introduced to feral rabbits to reduce their population.<br />The best new band of the last twenty years continues to weave its magic without the aid of a spell checker.<br />Happy Trails
B000077VR3|4.0|Not unlike his previous film &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,&quot; bohemian director Baz Luhrmann makes a mess out of the opening sequences of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; a bright, opera-style rethinking of Hollywood musicals. <br />This bold and loud beginning, which takes the aspiring and fairly lousy poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) to the aforementioned Parisian gentleman's club full of tarty courtesans and one sparkling diamond among them, Satine (Nicole Kidman, who arrives dangling on a trapeze, singing &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot;) is not so promising. <BR> <BR>There's more where that came from. And less. If an old movie axiom says a good film is one that contains three great scenes and no bad ones, &quot;Moulin Rogue&quot; rewrites it: Luhrmann's opera has at least five or six great scenes, two or three stinkers and a horde of in-betweens. <br />I liked it, a lot, as a full film experience: drama, camp, music, drudgery, scamps, tramps, poets, love, heroes, villains. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; gets messy, but in a sense it has to; only by coloring outside the lines can it reach certain peaks of human joy rarely found in a theater experience. Sure it's contrived. But it's a hell of a lot of fun. <br />Christian's indoctrination to the Moulin Rouge is a setup, really, to help lure Satine into a turn-of-the-century musical entitled &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; which makes clear in its early lines that this early 20th Century tale is going to thieve from a boatload of love pop songs from today. <br />The ringleader of this hothouse, Harold Sidler (English stalwart Jim Broadbent) has better designs for Satine, as he hopes to auction her off to a high-bidding Duke (Richard Roxborugh) in return for funding the club conversion to a grand opera theater. <br />Unsurprisingly, a clumsy mix-up between the two men leads Christian to a private meeting with Satine (as Kidman vamps in pushups, girdles, teddies and flowing gowns in what seems a nice rebuttal toTom Cruise's filing for divorce). And Luhrmann, who has to this point held back the dueling solos in the film, begins it in here, with McGregor's rendition of Elton John's &quot;Your Song.&quot; McGregor, who proved his pipes in &quot;Velvet Goldmine,&quot; convinced me further. His voice is high and light but broad; it goes further just as you think he's hit his vocal climax. <br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; settles down a little bit after that, telling a sad tale loosely based on the myth of Orpheus, who rescued his love from the underworld only to look back upon her and watch her turn to dust. Satine, we learn, is dying from consumption, unbeknownst to all (even Satine) but a small few. Kidman's voice sounds strained at times, possibly purposely so, to show the effect of the disease. <br />The movie stretches out and bombards us with images, colors, sounds, malarkey and love. A medley of love songs between Kidman and McGregor inside a giant elephant house is a high mark, as is duet &quot;Come What May&quot; as Satine and Christian's love song. A Spanish flamenco version of &quot;Roxanne,&quot; cross cut with another of Christian's songs and a symphony involving the Duke and Kidman is a giant feat of editing. <br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; rushes through the hearts of the young and in love. It might be just too full of gusto for the older set that will find it blinding and incomprehensible in parts. But Luhrmann has made this film with the same love as elders crafted the Astaire-Rogers musicals. The method has changed, but the divine, happy madness of song remains.
B000002GJH|4.0|This record sounds like what it pretty much is, &quot;Chris Cornell&quot; fronting &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, circa 1991. It was made by these guys for the late singer &quot;Andy Wood&quot;, who overdosed, and was the singer for &quot;Mother Love Bone&quot;, and &quot;Cornells&quot; one time roommate. As much as I wish it didn't have to be made, I'm so glad it was. It holds up to &quot;Soundgardens&quot; and &quot;Pearl Jams&quot; best albums. &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; was the hit from this, and the only song that &quot;Eddie Vedder&quot; really sings on. Otherwise this is &quot;Chris Cornell&quot; in all his wailing glory. Most of these are typical, but excellent grunge rockers, but both &quot;Call Me A Dog&quot; and the amazing &quot;All Night Thing&quot;, really are more like ballads. In short, if you're a fan of either band, or the genre, pick this one up. It goes great with the other one-time side project from &quot;Mad Season&quot;.

B00005JM4Z|1.0|This film is an awful sequel to an awful movie beginning at the start. Thank God Vin Diesel is not in this. He is an awful actor. This movie is too fake. Everything to the cars is bull. What is with the title? 2 Fast 2 Furious? Next is Biker Boyz. What the hell is with the titles, do it right, Fast and the Furious 2, there, it's fine. Biker Boys. There it's fine. People working on this project are dumb. And also what the hell is up with all the rappers and hip-hop music people in the movie business? They don't belong. They belong in the music business and actors belong in the movie business. Get them out of here. This director has his head up his ass. XXX, Fast and the Furious, he has so much more to learn.
6301174240|5.0|This video cassette was released about 15 years ago, but it still proves to be one of the best music video compilations ever. It was released way back in 1988, when the album &quot;BAD&quot;, was taking the market by storm, and &quot;Michael Jackson&quot;, was at the height of his powers. If you enjoyed the &quot;BAD&quot; album, along with &quot;Thriller&quot; and Michael's output with &quot;The Jacksons&quot;, then this VHS is for you. &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Speed Demon&quot;, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; represent material off of &quot;BAD (1987).&quot; While a medley of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Say, Say, Say&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot; represent The 1983 &quot;Thriller Hey Day.&quot;<BR>You also get some snippets of the songs &quot;State of Shock (1984)&quot;, &quot;We Are The World (1985)&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Diana (1988)&quot;, which are unavailable on any &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; video release, past or present. The special effects on &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, &quot;Speed Demon&quot;, and &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; are phenominal, and rank up their with &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Black or White&quot;, and &quot;Ghosts.&quot;  Too bad no live performance footage from the &quot;BAD World Tour 1987-1989&quot; was included, but what's here is golden. Hopefully this VHS will be remastered for a DVD re-release some time soon.
B00008MZ0O|1.0|This movie is awful. Vin Diesel is an awful actor, the screenplay is absolutley trash, the director obviously has no idea how to make a good movie. Vin Diesel always plays the tough guy and it was good for a change to see a different kind of role in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Everything is too fake. TOO fake. Don't be fooled by the awesome action, all right, it's too fake. Beleive me, my father was a race car driver, he's seen this movie, it's all bull. He noticed a fault every time they got into a car. This is a pathetic try at a tough racing movie. Trust me, it's not worth it.
1573300403|5.0|This DVD by Michael Jackson, features 13 of his greatest music videos and television performances, from 1983 to 1997.<BR>The most outstanding performance on this DVD would have to be the live version of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, which was performed way back in 1983. This was the very first time that Michael ever performed the &quot;moonwalk&quot; in public, and the rest is HIStory.<BR>Other highlights include 1989's &quot;Liberian Girl (from BAD)&quot;<BR>&quot;Smooth Criminal (short version)&quot;, a &quot;1995 MTV performance&quot;<BR>&quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, and &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor.&quot;<BR>It was great to finally have &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; on DVD. I also own the VHS &quot;Moonwalker (1988)&quot;, but the tracking on the video has gone to hell. Now I can watch &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, whenever I want to, along with &quot;Billie Jean (live)&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;, which I also own on VHS as well.<BR>Any fan of great dancing, catchy beats, R&amp;B, and phenominal directing, would enjoy this treat by the King of Pop, <BR>&quot;Michael Jackson.&quot; Hopefully, he'll put out another DVD in the near future (maybe &quot;Moonwalker?&quot;).
0385504209|4.0|Good reading makes for good debate.  If a book can challenge your faith, it's either a really good book or you have some issues to work out.<br />So, it's funny that when this author of fiction expresses views that run contrary to popular religion, the zealots will scream blasphemy-it's a heretical book to be avoided by Christians!  In the same breath they encourage people to open their minds...but only to the teachings of Christ, the bible and the church.  (I'm not sure in what order; I'm still trying to sort through the inconsistencies that each present.) Apparently the sources of divine inspiration run in limited quantities and can only be found in select locations.<br />Good god, if some are that stirred by this book it's got to be amazing, right?  Well, it's a good read.  But the real mystery is why some are so offended by this book and author.  You would think that someone is coming to take their children....or their faith, perhaps.<br />You won't find the answer to life in this book.  Then again, i suspect that you won't find it in any other book (ohh, how blasphemous!) including the latest from Dr. Phil (double blasphemy!)  But that's not why you are reading this book.  It's a novel!<br />OK, just calm down you nuts. No, it's not the author's main purpose is to cast doubt on the validity of the Christian faith. (I cannot profess first hand knowledge of this.)  And if the church and bible cannot withstand the First Amendment, good luck surviving the test of time (and faith).  No one in his right mind is going to make a religion out of this book.  But if they do, I'll join it, if for no other reason than to stir up the debate, and expose insecurity and lack of faith.
0966638328|4.0|This book is quite nicely done. If you are looking for a manual or technical tome, then you would be better served by looking elswhere. This book is light on technical information. However, it is visually inspiring and thought provoking on several different creative levels. As the title suggests it is merely a guide to using Pantone colors in print communications and the book does indeed show how that is accomplished. I would recommend this book to anyone in the design business, simply because of the ideas that will emnate from the creative mind as you turn the pages. The nicest feature of this book is the wonderful compilation of color swatch combinations. You won't be wasting your money by buying this . . . but don't expect to become a master of color from reading it either. Use it for what it was intended and you will be quite happy with the book.
B00000IPAX|5.0|If you are a Blink 182 fan and you have listened to the previous albums (Dude Ranch, Chesire Cat, and Budha) you will notice a major change in the music. I find the change better; the older albums have good songs but they all sound the same.  The energy in their lyrics and music is so present it is almost crazy music... The songs of the Enema are all energetic and with the old Blink sound but not overboard. Now that Travis is the drummer for the Enema the drums are noticably better as well. As for the way Blink 182 is going now, I think they change more with each album.<BR>First albums went to the punk extreme and their next album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, is totally different from these albums. I think this album is in the middle; not too punk or too prep, as Blink is almost going now. Get this album to hear true Blink 182.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This is another Best Classic Album from Classic Rock band. I am really with YES last about 20 years. I've got all their Classic albums (1971 - 1978, and Yesshows). This is very unique band with its own stile. There is not any other band close to this stile. This album is perfect from start to end, I am not talking about bonus tracks, because really I hate that idea to add bonus tracks. They are not good as usual. Just remember this, the band created this brilliant album in few years and there is not any wrong sound in the all album. So what's the reason to add the tracks which their didn't put it. The idea just keeps this album as it was. These versions of remastered CDs are very close to their previews one from Atlantic company. I recommended to buy this album, actually I prefer to have Atlantic's ones without junk music.
B00005N83M|1.0|Well, for me it's not so much that she is &quot;bad singer&quot; (I am not a music expert neither) - but she just seems to lack what is for me one of the more important things in the showbuisness actually : the individuality. <BR>Everything about her is so fake, commercial and primitive - she try so muuuch to be someone else that she is to please and be &quot;so damn cool&quot; lol .. she just make me pitty to look at and listen to her ..<br /> sorry but not!<BR>(And ..no it's not a comment of a fat girl with 7 childs lol ...but one of an actress and model unfortunatly .. and apart of this one who really enjoy looking at beautifull women.. tell me about someone like Penelope Cruz or Carre Otis, but Miss &quot;L.Jo&quot; ?? Sorry but not lol;)
B00006879E|5.0|I heard about Maroon5 from a friend. I trusted her taste in music so I bought the CD. I bought it 5 months ago and it hasn't left my CD player since. Their music is the perfect fusion of R&amp;B and rock that never gets boring. I would strongly recomend that anyone who likes original music buys this CD.
0156027321|5.0|If I can sum up this review in a few words - I won't.  I will simply suggest that you read this book.  No, it won't change your life, but I think it will be one of those rare books that you will find yourself thinking about after it is finished.  I believe this book is simply a classic, and a very worthy Man Booker prize award winner ( best book in the British Commonwealth for a given year).<br />The book is about a young man, Pi Patel (an Indian boy - the son of a zookeeper), who believes in Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity, all at the same time!  He is on a cargo ship bound for his new life in Canada when the ship sinks under mysterious circumstances. Pi ends up in a lifeboat adrift in the vast Pacific with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan (think Clyde : )) and a Royal Bengal tiger - or does he?<br />The book is well-written.  I learned some new things - which is always a plus in fiction, and I was challenged on some views I had.  Zoos are defended, and notions of God are given throughout the book.  Pi learns to survive at sea with wild animals - but his motivation is curious.  The story may never have happened the way Pi thought, or perhaps it happened exactly the way he thought. This is the fun of reading this book.<br />The book is very symbolic, but like most great fiction, the book works on a very simple level.  The book is like a great \\"childrens\\" animated movie which satisfies children, but has many symbolic meanings to enthrall adults.<br />Truly this book is well worth reading.  A great yarn about survival at sea in a lifeboat with a number of wild animals becomes a great story about life itself - is Pi just a name, or does it suggest a greater theme in the book?  Read this book and find it for yourself.
B00006CXXU|3.0|The album does contain a lot of great &quot;Pop&quot; tracks such as &quot;Dirrty&quot;, &quot;Get mine, Get yours&quot;, &quot;Fighter&quot;, &quot;Infatuation&quot;, &quot;Can't hold us down&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot; and her latest single &quot;The voice within&quot; but as far as this being R&amp;B or Hip Hop, this album is not what some are describing it as.  The songs are &quot;POP&quot; with a little bit sampling of different genere's...Christina will always be a popstar, and there's nothing wrong with that.  She should still be taken seriously regardless of what type of singer she is.
B000089RVX|4.0|From the very first listen I loved the vocals but I was a little disapointed with parts of this CD .The singer is great ,I mean (WOW) her emotion and feelings really shine like very few popular artist around (I mean lots of chart toping singers sing well  but Evanescence vocals just melt you) , further more she is actually not counting on her looks to impress, (its all about her voice) thats pretty rare  these days.  The atmospheres of the music definatly work, its moody and has a easy to listen to sound, However<BR>If you are looking for the musicianship of more progressively minded bands like Lacuna Coil, The Gathering (a few years ago) or perhaps even Nightwish or Edenbridge, perhaps you should look elsewhere . You know what the worst thing about this is ? There seems to be an inner conflict of interests within the artist ,I mean it comes so close to being great but the music isn`t sure what it is?  Either these guys should decide if their market is aimed at the 15 year olds or Mature their Image (for the sake of their own  longevity in this  their choosen genre (lets face they sound too nice to be Goth, Its a ploy of Evanescence to try and find a market $$$ <<(In my own opinion) these guys I consider are almost semi prog.  From a Muso`s point of view (mine) they are stuck in the middle. Too bad really because Evanescence does have alot of talent I`d like to see em stick around not get consumed by the image stuff, with  that  said  I  know  many good Goth bands, Evanescence strike me as  something else though, If you buy this CD your probably going to like it more and more with each play. I hope other young bands sit up and take notice of   Evanescence its good to see music in the charts thats not Lacking of substance. The lyrics are good the vocals are great the music in places is great. Its a pretty good CD , you could do  alot worse than   Evanescence .
B00005G901|4.0|The reviewer (LUKK) who claims this record sucks (like many people from outside of the U.S.) doesn't truly understand life in NYC. I might even have to question his knowledge of Hip Hop, too.<BR> <BR>Have you actually based part of your critique of this album on the packaging of the product instead of what's inside?<BR>Unbelieveable!!!<br />If you cannot find the artistry &amp; genius in Nas' song &quot;I Gave You Power&quot; then you really have NO clue!<BR>That song is one of deep poetry, revealing a brutally honest view on society's inner-city crime/murder epidemic.<BR>I also love other tracks on this CD, too.<br />When you're grown-up, I suggest you re-visit this release and finally realize what you've been missing.<BR>Good Luck, schmuck!
0446608955|5.0|I came across this book when my teacher was talking about the book in our college reading class. I remember watching the movie and few years ago I thought to myself/ it was a good movie maybe it's a good book. Well this book was remarkable! I even think it was better than the movie. Some parts were different like, Jamie giving Landon a bible instead of her mother's poem book, and what time period it take place in. Also some parts where similar like how they knew eachother their whole lives but not once did they talk, and the ending of the book. There was never a dull moment in the book and it made me want to keep on reading, it even made me cried at some parts. This book was about trust, honesty, love, and life. The writing technique was awesome. I think Nicholas Sparks is a great author and maybe my favorite. His books really help me capture the moment. Some parts I know that teenagers can relate to. For example,dealing with relationships, and dealing with being acccepted in high school. I also think that this book is great for anyone to read young or old because there is an important life and love lesson, but you have to read it to find out what it is. I would rate this book a five star.
B00006RCSU|1.0|I hated the fast pace, confusing updates, and wierd coloring.  I just hated this whole movie.  I am a Shakespere addict, but this adaptation I just can't sit through.  <BR>Leo and Claire Danes do pretty good jobs, so it's not the acting.  I just hate everything else about this movie, it seems to be mocking Shakespere. It was just... ick.  <BR>Everyone else I know loved this movie, so it might just be me. In any event, if you're looking for some good modern Shakespere, definitely check out Hamlet with Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles. It's great.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I had talk to many peopple about this film. Some said is not like the first one, didn´t have the appealing or beuty of the original. Some said it´s good, but not that good.I think the Wirters/directors intend to give a more human face to the story. More than the struggles of few caracthers, but the survivor og the hole race. I specially like the part when Neo is revealed as a containment program. The same way the agents of the first one can hack into any &quot;system&quot; ,  Does this program hacked inside NEO? Obviously they can interact in and out of the matrix, (Remember when Smith, took posetion of Bane´s system) I want to know the explanation of why Neo have powers outside the matrix (REVOLUTIONS)<br />I give the movie 4 stars because everybody looks at them as a joint venture. Even is not like the first is like a more mature version (if you can say Sci Fi filming is mature) of the first one. Reloaded cannot and would not top the original but it´s a good sequel with a more elaborated story. I can Wait to see how everythig wraps up. Te same is happening with everybody waiting for SW episode 3, we only want to see see the whole picture, Even when episode 2 was better the 1, I belived Revolutions is going to satisfy and clear many things that us, Matrix fans, have.
B00005YTFG|1.0|Or maybe it wasn't.  That's the whole problem with this movie. Now I know people try to say this is a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; scenario, and they may be right.  I, for one, hated it, from the bastardization of 80's pop hits to the sickening brilliance of color to the cheesy plot and poor acting, I thought this was a decadent, self-indulgent movie whose doubtless enormous budget was ciphoned into all the wrong areas.  Both Kidman and MacGregor deserve much better.  The camera angles are annoying, and the plot is terribly unoriginal.  I can't say it enough - stay away from this movie.<BR>However, I also hated &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;.  I love Shakespere, and I also love musical theater.  So maybe you just have to appreciate one or the other.
0156027321|3.0|then became really boring, like that tom hanks movie...castaway...
B000099T2L|3.0|This album is ok.not much to say about pick it up
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence Of Arabia is perhaps the most perfec t movie ever made. It is the best confluence of acting, writing, directing, cinematography, score and casting I have ever seen. The story is compelling, the score is magnificent and the scenery is breathtaking. I HIGHLY recommend this film.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|This is a good album but there is only 8 track not including<BR>Intro or outro.that is the only downfall of the album<BR>it's a great album.
B00005JLTN|5.0|Well, I will put it plain and dry, whoever said this movie sucks is a complete dumbass and doesn't understand this one or even the first one. It was long awaited and worth the wait in my opinion and when its over it leaves you wanting more.
B00000IMCW|4.0|I am sick and tired of people talking about how !3#$%* great this movie is. It's good, I'll give it that, but it's certainly not the groundbreaking horror masterpiece that all Romero's fans call it. In fact, some areas are very slow. However, some places in the film are very exciting. The scenes in which the men drive through the mall in a car shooting zombies as they go is very cool. It's good, but it's not the horror masterpiece that Romero fans would like us to think it is.
B00004HYLF|5.0|One of the biggest regrets I have is that I hadn't listened to this album until very recently. I've been digging through my dad's record collection since I was very young and this was one of those albums that simply slipped through the cracks. Upon listening to it for the first time, my jaw dropped to the floor. I was familiar with and utterly impressed by the solo projects of Stanley Clark, Al DiMeola and Chick Corea, but never even imagined they had played together. The masterful use of schizophrenic meters, intricate melodic concepts, ethereal analog noise machines, and inhuman technical ability blended together into a beautiful cohesive work of art puts to shame the work of other phenomenal artists such as Zappa, Yes, ELP, and yes, even Miles Davis' electric band. The compositions on this album give the listener a portal into which they experience the full range of human emotion. Plus it's a trip to listen to when you're high as a kite.
B00000K3CK|5.0|Various folks have tried to remake this tale with decidedly MIXED results.  Why bother?  Watch this one over and over.  Gwenn is incomparable as Kris Kringle.  And who can compare with Maureen O'Hara as the self-made woman who is really a little girl who grew up too fast.  What a treasure to have Natalie Wood's performance captured for posterity.  Gene Lockhart and William Frawley give classic performances as well.  And don't miss a cameo by Thelma Ritter as the greatful mother.  Sure it's cheesy in spots, over-the-top even, but IT WORKS!!!  This one is an annual tradition in my house, and will be for years to come!<br />This DVD version has an interesting look behind the scenes and a star-studded trailer as well.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Any movie with Queen Latifa (sp?) in at can't be that good.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|I have been waiting for this for some time now.  When Chitty came out on DVD a while back, at first I was thrilled.  But I never bought it because it was Pan and Scan which is a travesty.  I refused to buy it and preferred to play my old widescreen laserdisc.  This edition promises to deliver all I would expect, and more.  High-quality video and audio transfer and a plethora of very cool extras!  This went on my wish list immediately (and I will buy it if I don't receive it as a gift).
B00008J4P5|4.0|Elephant, like their previous albums, rocks. One reviewer who gave it a one star rating said that they sounded like Led, Dylan, Zappa and Beefheart. I think it would be impossible to rip off those four bands at the same time, ya know? That the Stripes remind some dude of four bands that are so blatantly different from one another is not much of a criticism. Oh yeah, and the less flattering reviews all seem focused on the fact that the Stripes have recieved critical acclaim. Well, I'm not a critic, and I'd never read a review of them before I started digging their music. I'm disturbed that so many people let the amount of hype a band gets influence their judgement of the music. That being said, I prefer their self-titled album and White Blood Cells to this one. Elephant is probably my third fav., followed closely by Destijl. But, whether you get this album or another one of theirs, you won't be dissapointed...if you can chill out and forget the hype, and the fact that the critics like Elephant more than your boys Sum41 and Good Charlotte or whoever it is you listen to, that is.
0783225792|4.0|Casino is an excellent film about the rise and fall of an empire in the gambling haven, Las Vegas.<br />Robert DeNiro plays Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein, a cunning and smart business man who gets into the casino business. He is given a casino to run, mostly because of his reputation for always winning, by the mob who get their cuts of the money one way or the other (i.e. lying, stealing, murdering, etc.). Joe Pesci stars as Ace's best friend Nicky Santoro who is sent to Las Vegas to protect him. Nicky has a tendency to be a ruthless and merciless person, so he eventually gets into a lot of trouble, making it harder and harder for Ace to stand by him. Sharon Stone stars as Ginger, a hustler, call-girl, and junkie who Ace falls in love with and persuades to marry and have a child with him. She agrees, not because she loves him but because she sees the money, jewels, cars, and houses all awaiting her.<br />Soon things start to go wrong. Ginger comes inbetween Ace and Nicky and the Tangiers casino is investigated by the FBI. All the while Ace tries to keep everything as legitimate as possible because he's a smart business man who's made a lot of money in Vegas. He doesn't want his success (and his reputation) to be ruined.<br />Even though this film lasts three hours, it did not seem that long. This film held my interest the entire time and had me wondering what was going to happen next. There are some rather brutal and violent scenes in the film - I actually had to cover my eyes a few times because the scenes became too graphic - but that is expected in this type of mobster film.<br />I would definitely suggest this film to anyone whether you like mob films or not. This is one to see. Mr. Robert DeNiro always come through and gives a stellar performance!!!
0743201140|5.0|I've read quite a few of these kinds of books starting way back when with &quot;What Color is Your Parachute,&quot; through &quot;The Acorn Principle&quot; and &quot;Please Understand Me.&quot; This has been a long-term process of discovering my interests, talents, abilities, skills, knowledge, preferences, and potential - always with the intention of finding my true calling in life.<br />But this book is not just another addition to that list; this is a superior method for focusing in on very specific talents and strengths and clarifying your own thinking about your life choices. The assessment and categories of strengths are more straightforward than taking the Meyers-Briggs or other similar tests. The book confirms some of what I already knew, but completely clarified the concept of natural talent combined with skills and knowledge creating the strengths that one can use throughout their life.<br />People have complained in other reviews that some of the book is &quot;fluff&quot; or that  it doesn't tell you what job to go get. This is only true for people who want one 250-page book to answer some of the greatest of life's questions. I greatly appreciate that the authors give simple, straightforward examples and their own theories quickly and pointedly. They leave it up to ME to make decisions based on that information.<br />If you are prepared to do the work over the course of time and use this book as a mentor (not a nanny who tells you what to do) you will gain great insight into yourself and your path.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you have any sense of class, you will own this album! I truely wish that there were more artists like Norah! The greatest album for any moment!
0156027321|5.0|A teenager and a tiger on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean. How does the boy survive? On the surface (pardon the pun) it seems a simple story. It isn't. It has the complexity of a zoo filled with a myriad of creatures. The ending of \\"Life of Pi\\" reminds me of the ending of \\"Atonement\\" (by Ian McEwan), where I wanted to return to the beginning and start over, because I wanted to enjoy the story with a new understanding. (Someone actually emailed me about Atonement, after I left my comments on Amazon, wanting me to explain the ending; and that ending was far less complex.)<br />This book works on many levels. I admire the writing, but I greatly respect the amount of research needed. Yann Martel deserves the Booker Prize based on his research alone. Through his characters, he explores zoo maintenance, religions and religious practices, sea life, survival techniques, and so on.<br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is both a work of art and a work of science, with a little science fiction and fantasy tossed in. Since I already believed in God, the book didn't affect my faith (as some of the hype insinuated it would), but if I interpret the theme correctly, it does reinforce my faith in mankind's ability to survive. The mind is resourceful, and that, to me, is the real message Martel the Marvel brings us: that the mind allows us to devise ways to survive, mentally as well as physically. Of course, it could be said that the human mind is God's gift in the first place, therefore justifying the \\"will make you believe in God\\" hype. Regardless, I believe that \\"Life of Pi\\" is Yann Martel's miracle of literature. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. And you must read the book to truly understand that last sentence. It's worth your dime, as well as your time.
B000089RVR|5.0|I've been waiting 4 years for this album. It's been that long since No Angel was first released in the US. The wait was certainly worth the wait.<br />The first single White Flag took a bit to grow on me before I realized how beautiful it was. I loved the sound from the first listen, but it didn't seem to compare to the power of No Angel.<br />Much can be said of the album Life For Rent as a whole. I like every song on the CD, and enjoyed them from the beginning. But there was a sense that the album didn't have anything quite as powerful as Here With Me, Slide, or Take My Hand from No Angel.<br />That is, perhaps, because Life For Rent is a bit more subtle. The beauty of the songs is still there. Dido's voice never sounded better and her songwriting has matured. It is because of the latter that the songs take a bit more listening to until they bear their fruits. With the exception of the anthemic title track and Don't Leave Home (one of my favorites from her live tour for the last album) and White Flag, nothing really jumps out at you.<br />But nearly every track has a hook, and I was soon swept up in the mellow beauty of Stoned and This Land Is Mine.<br />This is a beautiful album. And even though No Angel will always occupy a special place in my heart, I do feel that Life For Rent is a superior album in nearly every way.<br />The only slight dissapointments come from the translations of some songs I was familiar with live onto the record. Do You Have A Little Time lost some of it's sweet innocence and See The Sun isn't the anthemic roof-raiser it was live. But it's unfair to judge an album against a live performance, and the strengths of the recorded versions of these songs soon show themselves.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember tells the tale of discovering pure, innocent love for the first time and then having that love returned and unexpectedly taken away. The character who tells the story, shows that even he is surprised at how his life can be changed by love. In true Sparks style, the writing is descriptive and tugs at the heart strings. Tears will be flowing for happiness and for sadness before you get to the end.<BR>Another book that looks at innocence lost and growing up is If I'd Only Known... by Edee Wilcox. It isn't about a death, but other events change the main character's life forever. It also has a strong Christian influence as this book does.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: Two towers is one more legendary movie to go into the hollywood Hall of Fame. This movie is another fantastic sage that takes you into battles in a mystical world where the quest to destroy the ring continues.<br />The special effects in this movie are spectacular and certainly is a never seen before way to show the battles and the cool conflicts. The last battle when the evil is trying to invade the castle is incredible.
B00005KHEU|5.0|Read the reviews up above and then this one and you'll get an ida of why ELO is brilliant.<br />They mean a thousand different things to a thousand different people.<br />While some one else might think Horace Wimp is &quot;horrid&quot; songwriting, I think it's an absolutely brilliant example of Jeff Lynne's reverence and appreciation for the Beatles and Absurdist Brit humor.<br />Ironically, &quot;Don't Bring me Down&quot; the biggest &quot;hit&quot; on the record, is probably my least favorite on this albumn.<br />Although catchy at first, It's repetative and boring to me.  The song has a short relistenability lifespan.<br />Other songs like &quot;I need her love&quot; and &quot;last train to london&quot; remain fun and interesting years after you first hear them.<br />If ELO bridges Pop and Prog (and many suggest that it does) Discovery is certainly more to the Pop side (while the next albumn, Time, leans more to the prog side).<br />Personally I feel as though this stretch of time between out of the blue through time (including the xanadu soundtrack songs) are the most interesting and exciting period of Jeff Lynne and ELO's catalog.<br />If you liked out of the blue or new world record, don't hesitate to get either discovery or xanadu (but never rent the movie because it's god awful... unless your into god awful, in which case, cheers!).<br />If you want a real treat that will challenge you and open you up to a world of beautifully brilliant intelligent yet poppy while simultaneously progressive sounding music, I suggest you look into TIME.<br />From a musical standpoint, Time is groundbreaking in it's production and it's conception.  The problem is that no one noticed it at the time because it's also ve fun (and since Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; was dominating charts at the time, fun wasn't exactly what folks were listening to in the post punk pop world.<br />But don't snub discovery either.  It's a blast you won't regret (or at least shouldn't regret!)
B00000JPH5|4.0|Although the direction and photography is somewhat dull in some spots, I find this movie one of my favourite movies of all time.<BR>Jennifer Connelly's performance as Sarah is truly mesmerizing, and David Bowie makes a great performance as the evil Goblin King, Jared. The music in this film, soundtrack and actual songs,<BR>are very cool and add to the incredible atmosphere of this fantasy film. I love this film, and always will. Another true classic.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|&quot;Get it!&quot;  <br />That is my two-word review for this DVD Special Edition.  I saw this classic film as a child with my parents in maybe 1968 or so.  Much of childhood movie-memory is hazy, more of a 'feeling' than a movie critique, but if the movie was fun, that feeling stays with you into adulthood, and prompts you to consider buying the movie on disc.  Since The Adventures Of Robin Hood had such a far reaching appeal, people may remember all of the satire and spoofs it later generated.  There was even a Bugs Bunny episode that borrowed a clip of Errol Flynn swinging into the scene at the end, and the gallant Daffy Duck had his very own WB spoof as Robin Hood.  When I heard that &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was being remastered for DVD, I instantly thought of all those memories, naturally.  <br />Are you ready for the good news?  All of that is on Disc Two of this package!!  And we also have the movie trailer, not only for THIS movie, but for other Errol Flynn vehicles like Captain Blood, and The Prince &amp; The Pauper. And a documentary on the history of color in the movies called &quot;Glorious Technicolor&quot; a full HOUR on the history and magic that is &quot;technicolor&quot;.  It is almost embarrassing to admit that the special features alone are worth the price of this Special Edition! (I really don't mean to use so many exclamation points, but I spent two nights enjoying various parts of this presentation, and I haven't even gotten to the film itself yet!) <br />Back on Disc One, the film boasts a commentary from a film historian, and Leonard Maltin presents the masterpiece with a short, a newsreel, and a cartoon just like they did back in 1938!  You can relive that era pretty much just by pressing play and popping some Jiffy-Pop. The only difference might be an improvement on picture and sound:  they have restored the picture, and also the audio.  Apparently they still had the dialogue and the music as seperate audio elements, whichallowed for truly pristine renovations!  This film looks and sounds so great, and is so well done, it would warrant the purchase of a DVD player (if you don't have two already)  <br />Welcome to Sherwood Forest my friend, and enjoy!    --mf
1558807381|3.0|Although beautifully photographed and well directed, this film <BR>has Tom Cruise's (and alot of other great actors) talent going<BR>to waste. Legend does have the ability to enchant the eyes, but<BR>the screenplay and the majority of the acting is painful on the ears. I had to increase my star rating because of the beautiful<BR>photography here. If it wasn't so beautiful to look at, this film would have received a big, juicy, single star!
B000002G9S|4.0|Free was a band brimming with talent.  Paul Rodgers displayed a powerful style as a lead vocalist.  Bandmates Paul Kosoff, Andy Fraser, and Simon Kirke added fine instrumental touches.<br />Fire and Water offers the rock n roll classic All Right Now which is loaded with energy.  However there is more to that fine singles on this recording.  Fire And Water is loaded with fine hooks and stunning guitar work.  Mr. Big features some fine interplay between Andy Fraiser's soloing bass and Paul Kosoff's power chords.  Heavy Load and Oh I Wept feature some fine slow blues playing with some good atmosphere. Remember offers a steady blues pattern while Don't Say YOu Loe Me features some soulful Paul Rodgers wailing.<br />This recording is not as structured as Bad Company would later be.  However, there are many noteworthy instrumental and vocal touches that will capture many fans of good time rock n roll. Seek this recording out as it has many merits.
B00005OLY5|5.0|Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis star in this spellbinding tale of a village in peril, when an evil sorceress takes over the land, and the title role must leave his wife to battle the evil 'witch.' All the cast is great, and the direction of this movie is enchanting. I also enjoyed the epic music score. One of<BR>the best adventure films of all time, Willow is a clever, interesting film of sparkling settings and likeable characters!<BR>A true classic.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I loved it! Can't wait for Matrix Revolutions!!
B0000B3FCX|3.0|This cd is ok, but I prefer Silver Side up to this one. After I bought it, I listened to the whole thing a few times, and could not get into it, except for a couple songs. Better luck next time Nickelback
0446530891|2.0|Too many novels in too short a time span , this Balducci novel is not worth it at all. Too far fetched , too unreal. It seems as though the author was painstakingly trying to end the story , when in fact it ended before the 100th page. Take a pass on Baldacci for awhile.
B00000724P|3.0|The 1st 4 songs on this CD are really really good, but the others are just boring.  If your pressed for money, don't buy this CD, but if you aren't go ahead and buy it, the first 4 tracks make it worth it.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Wow, I thought you couldn't get worse then the Hulk or Episode 2...this one takes the cake as &quot;WORST MOVIE EVER&quot; It so deserves to win a razzy award this year...total crap. If you like flushing money down the toilet then do that instead, because this movie has no redeming value. The other dorks who are in favor of it, are just that, dorks...folks who couldn't tell even if a good movie bit them in the butt.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|I was out of the country for the last half of 2001, and out of the loop as far as movies went, so upon my return I had to catch up.  I have been interested in comic books for as long as I can remember.  I read, I collect, I write.  My good friend does the artwork and inking for most of my stories, and he is the one who recommended this DVD to me.<br />It truly is a comic book story.  Donnie Darko, a sixteen year old boy with emotional problems, is a superhero who must save the world, or so he is told by Frank, the 6-foot tall bunny rabbit.  Donnie, his family, his girlfriend Gretchen, and everyone around him can feel the subtle aura of something not quite right.  What only Donnie realizes is that the countdown has begun.<br />The film has a great cast, including Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone, and, of course, Jake Gyllenhaal and his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal (who plays his sister in the film).  Each actor fit their part perfectly, and portrayed their character very well.<br />It is a bit confusing the first time through, the second time it gets better, and the third time I recommend turning on the director's commentary.  The director, Richard Kelly, along with Jake Gyllenhaal, offer an amusing and clarifying commentary that allows for better understanding of the film.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This is my favorite Pearl Jam album. I like Ten alot too. I don't know why or how Vs. did so well though. I just didn't connect with that album like I did Vitalogy. Those are the only Pearl Jam albums i own. I've heard no code and some other album i had by them but sold to the pawn shop cuz it was boring. I've noticed Pearl Jam have released alot of live albums. What's up with that? Who the hell buys all that recycled garbage? I mean, not to be a ... or anything, but that's pointless.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this novel.  The initial story is a terrific one -- a boy stranded in a life boat with an unexpected and dangerous shipmate.  While the story of survival is riviting, more satisfying still is the ending, which leaves you wondering not only about the truth of the story, but also about the place of truth in the story of our own lives.  I read this book months ago, and the story has stayed with me.  I think this is a great book, an addictive read, and a fabulous story.  I recommend it completely.
B00008BXJF|4.0|It's great to see King Crimson back, and they are back with an Powerful sonic assult.  The ConstruKction Of Light was not even in my top 5 KC outings.  The title track was awesome, but the disc was muddled with abstract experimentation.  This was possibly left over from the ProjeKcts, another set of abstract experimentation.  What both the ProjeKcts and TCOL did was set in motion the new direction of KC and fine tune the new additions (Mastelotto and Gunn) left over from the Thrak sessions.  The Power To Believe is an incredible disc from start to finish.  Level Five, EleKtrik, Power To Believe II, and Dangerous Curves are four mind shattering instrumentals.  Each different, yet each seem to be playing variations on that particular songs theme.  The lyrical songs, Power To Belive, Eyes Wide Open, Facts Of Life, and Happy....range from spooky, to beautiful, on through angry, ending in  the Crimson ( Lark's) tounge in cheek.  This one does it for me like THRAK, Three Of A Perfect Pair, Discipline, and Red has done it for me in the past.  A definitive, mature outing from one of the reigning Kings of Prog.  This one makes me happy they tinkered around with ProjeKcts and TCOL , to get to this plateau.  Furthermore, this album finally made up for the loss of Bill Bruford and Tony Levin.  Mastelotto on the Roland V-Kit  & Trey Gunn on the Warr guitar are really the perfeKct fit for the mighty King Crimson.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Rented Reloaded today to see it again. Now the movie itself has divided opinion, I personally think it sucks and is probably one of the most disappointing sequels in the history of sequels! Not that it's a &quot;bad&quot; movie per se, it has lots of action, effects, etc. It's just poorly directed, written, and edited, and the final product shows.<br />As far as this DVD release goes, way to make the movie worse WB and Wachowski brothers! The first disc contains ONLY the movie, NO commentaries or anything else. Disc #2 has a FEW behind-the-scenes type featurettes plus some worthless specials like a TV commercials featurette and so on. NO deleted scenes or actually informative specials, and the two directors never once pop up for an interview spot. What, they can't show for an interview somewhere?<br />This DVD release is pathetic given the amount of hype behind the movie, I bet WB has a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD in the works already, wait for that if you plan on buying this movie! Bad, bad DVD for the 2003 summer blockbuster that raked in more than $250M at the box office.
0312319517|5.0|Welcome back, Mr. Forsyth. This novel, using current affairs as a backdrop, takes us from WWII to Vietnam to Bosnia to the Current War on Terrorism. This book arrived today, from Amazon of course, and I thought I'd read a few pages. At midnight, I finished it.  I simply couldn't put it down.  Every once in a while, it is nice to have something so taut that one page simply leads to the next.  Thank you, Mr. Forsyth!!
B0000028VT|5.0|This album is Mariah's bestseller, for good reason.  It contains two of her biggest hits, the pop perfection of \\"Dreamlover\\" and the inspiring lyrics of \\"Hero\\". It also includes her beautiful remake of \\"Without You\\" as well as the inspiring \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\". Then there are the beautiful album tracks, such as the title track and \\"Just To Hold You Once Again\\".  This album also contains Mariah's last (as far as I know) collaborations with Clivilles and Cole. These tracks (\\"Now That I Know\\", \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\")have a House-type feel and prove Mariah's versatility. This album is listenable from beginning to end, with no slow spots. If possible, one should try to order the version with \\"Everything Fades Away\\" as a bonus track. That track is worth it's weight in gold. This masterpiece is a must for any Mariah collection.
B000092ZYX|1.0|If you are looking for the &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; sound, this is not it. Who wants to give listen to a bunch of potential artists use very little of their talent to produce a bunch of electronic &quot;Nintendo Music with a Radiohead frontman&quot;?  Keep giving them your money and they will produce even more crap; what even happened to the old Radiohead....the Radiohead from Pablo Honey?
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is the best classic rock album in the existence of this universe.  OMG!  How can you not like it!  Every freakin' song is teh sick!  With classics like Time, Breathe, Us and Them, Brain Damage, The Greath Gig in the Sky, and Eclipse you CANT go wrong.  I love this album.  It's so dark, desperate, and sad.  Especially Brain Damagage, an obvious tribute to their former member in a Sanitarium.  And Eclipse so much in so few words...all of ones life is in that song.  Great Wonderful Diveine music from angels of Heaven!  Seriously!
0385470819|4.0|My dad supplied me with this book saying it would be an interesting read and that I would enjoy it.  I must say that it is quite interesting, and I have enjoyed it so far.  I have no time to read, therefore, I'm only 350 pages in, but so far it's been great.  Grisham's use of multiple plots and transferring between them throughout the story keeps things interesting in a book full of courtroom drama.  I wouldn't be interested anymore if he didn't write the book the way he does.  Vivid imagery appears in this book every page, as well as intriguing plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat.  This book is a good read for adults, and isn't a difficult read at all.  Everyone else who has read this book said it was good, and I'm going to agree with them on that. This book was a bestseller years after it was published!  I'll rate it 4 out of 5 stars, and coming from a critic like me, that's not bad at all.
B00006690G|5.0|Let me start by saying that every single track on this CD (all 19 of them) is outstanding! The music is not only catchy, it's addictive. Eminem's forte is the use of simple words to create hypnotic and oddly magical art. Obscene and derogatory terms are bitterly expressive and speak volumes of the Eminem's candor and risky courage to express himself. His words are unapologetically offensive but not for the sake of shocking audience. When you get pass the awesome music (I am serious, the music is extraordinary) and get to actually to listen to the lyrics, you will notice that his rated-R words are not used out of context, so to speak.<br />If I had to choose favorites, then I will choose: Superman, Cleaning Out My Closet, Drips, Say Goodbye Hollywood, Square Dance, White America, Without Me.<br />Eminem is definitely an acquired taste and I used to detest him for his attitude toward gays and women, but honestly the guy is a genius lyricist and rapper. He gets my nod and I couldn't recommend this CD enough! Buy it and get down with the dawgs.
B00006RCSR|1.0|Of the myriad adaptations of the Cinderella story, there can be few as clunky and stilted as this one. Set in sixteenth-century France- which the dialect coach confusingly chose to indicate by giving the characters English accents ranging from the reasonable (Anjelica Huston) to the appallingly bad (Ms. Barrymore)- this version of the story presents Cinderella as a spunky, educated, strong-willed girl who triumphs over adversity as a result of her own daring and creativity. <BR>  This wouldn't be so bad except that the poor script is indifferently delivered by a cast who seem to be projecting &quot;Ooh, look at me, I'm in a clever adaptation of a fairytale!&quot; throughout. Add to this the fact that there is little to no on-screen chemistry between Drew Barrymore's Danielle and the Prince (played, if such a one-dimensional performance can be so called, by Dougray Scott); the scenes where we are meant to marvel at how two such different personalities can fall in love are instead extended exercises in excruciating cuteness and smarm. <BR>  In short, Ms. Barrymore would be well advised in future to leave revisionism to the politicians and concentrate on roles that can be played straighter and with less self-conscious artiness.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This has to be one of Maiden's most adventurous and unique albums to date. It blends all that they have been before and probably all that they will ever be. It incoporates elements as far back as Powerslave and as recent as Brave New World. It features two of the heaviest tracks they have ever recorded (Paschendale, Montsegur). It features some very satisfying experiments (Face in the Sand, Rainmaker). It feautres classic Maiden epics (No More Lies, Dance of Death). And it features classic Maiden metal (Wildest Dreams, Gates of Tomorrow, and New Frontier). There is also the only accoustic track that Maiden has ever done, Journeyman. This song has to be heard to be believed, it is startling, and at once pleasing. <BR>The Album flows nicely and there is no track that sticks out as being filler. There is some truly stunning guitar work, Dave Murray is in top form, even after all these years. Adrian is the steady rhythm, and tracks like Gates of Tomorrow alow Janik to show off his experimental side. The lyrics are some of the best they've written, particularly in Paschendale and Montsegur. Dance of Death could easily have been turned into a &quot;Stonehenge&quot; by any other band, but Maiden does a great job at making it good. The riff is very memorable. In all, a spectacular new Maiden record, buy it.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|whoa...for me the movie really has to have a visual and emotional connection for me to see it twice in hopes of evoking that same &quot;lump in the throat&quot; feeling...success it was great even the second time and i was able to pay attention to the visual details which made me think how refreshing to see something different but not outrageous that it would scare away the not so &quot;film affeciendo&quot; types..ok spelling might be off on that one..but...when i listen to the CD it moves me to the visual scenes in my memories of Oren...and her fateful moment the music is a compilation of import classics i had never heard and so it was nice for the original artists to get their work recognized a second time
B000092ZYX|5.0|I think that in many ways this album is better than ok computer. I would say that pranoid android is one of radiohead's best song's ever, but there were a couple songs on ok computer that i didn't really like. But i absolutely love every single song on this album. At first i didn't like sit down, stand up...or we suck young blood...or the gloaming. But they have all slowly grown on me and now i couldnt imagine this album without sit down, and the gloaming is so unsettling that it makes this album a whole. We suck young blood is just now becoming one of my favorites. Radiohead is amazing. They are truly one of the greatest bands ever. Those who hate radiohead will be very dissapointed when there is a list of best album's or bands and radiohead is at or near the top of both of those lists. Radiohead is the only band that matters now, they put almost every other band to shame. Buy this album immediately, it will change your life.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|What can you say about this CD! It's just fantastic. While watching the film in cinema I was sure that I will buy the CD, although in cinema it is normally difficult to focus on the music. But it is just great. No other wors possible. My advice to you all: If you like good instrumental filmmusic it is definatley the right dicussion to buy. If you have watched the movie or if not. You will love it. Sometimes with only action and drama but all the time full uf emotions.<BR>I cannot stop listen to the CD!
B00005K3NY|3.0|A film I have been wanting to see for 22 years.  Now on DVD, I can.  Imagine having the will power to make someone do anything you want them to do without touching them or physically blocking them.  Your mind of ESP or telepathy was so strong they can do exactly what you wanted.  They have a seizure, a heart attack, give themselves a shot instead, have a car accident.  In this film, these exceptional people are called \\"scanners\\".  Some do this for goodwill.  It's just a quiet form of communication.  But the character Michael Ironside  plays is so powerful with telepathy, he can assassinate at will using only his mind.    Followed by:   Scanners II: The New Order (1991).   Scanners III: The Takeover (1992).   Scanner Cop (1994), Scanners: The Showdown (also known as Scanner Cop II: Volkin's Revenge [1994]).    Michael Ironside can also be seen in [[ASIN:B000EDWLW8 Visiting Hours]], [[ASIN:B000067FP2 V: The Final Battle]] (1984), [[ASIN:B00023BKMC V: The Complete Series]] (1984-85).
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Don't bother with this one.  The first one was great but this is terrible.  See Kill Bill instead or anything else for that matter. *The freeway sequence is nowhere near as cool as the one in Bad Boys 2.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has one of the most beutiful voices I have ever heard.  There are very few artist who can top Loreena's voice.  This is a great album if you like Celtic music or just want an album that is very relaxing.   <br />    All the songs on this CD are great.  Mummer's Dance and Marco Polo are probably my favorite songs on the CD.  The CD book has a story about each song on the CD.<br />    I listen to this album as background music when reading and when I'm in the mood for relaxing music.  I plan on buying all of her albums.
B000023VR6|5.0|To this day, I still have not come across a rap CD that tops Dre's Chronic 2001! I can listen to this CD from beginning to end and not need to skip tracks. It's just remarkable. I don't know what else to say. But this!
B000001Y5X|5.0|Get this album right now. Portrait is an album that just keeps on rocking. The lyrics are sometimes brutal, but so are the guitar and keybord bits that keep the listener on his/her toes. Standout tracks are &quot;Lunchbox&quot;, which fits perfectly to anyone thats been picked on in school as the intro states (with a child saying &quot;Next motherf***er's gonna get my metal!&quot; obviously, he's had enough. &quot;Cake and Sodomy&quot; is just a catchy rocker. Definitley a riviting first album from Marilyn Manson!
B000092ZYY|4.0|a hypno-sonic escapade that travels through bizarre and soothing territories before bringing you back to your normal self, a bit transformed.<br />I like the surprises of Radiohead, especially with regard to being able to decipher different nuances with each new listen.<br />This band is certainly pushing many envelopes wide, wide open...
B00000AFGM|4.0|1998's Mechanical Animals paved a new direction for Marilyn Manson, very different from the previous Antichrist Superstar era. The album, produced by Michael Beinhorn and mixed by Tom Lord-Alge.. whos mixed everyone from Weezer to Sarah McLachlan.. you would have to expect a new sound for Manson. Indeed, this album delivers. Experimenting with acoustic guitars and really cool riffs on guitar and keyboard, Mechanical Animals shows a more &quot;soft&quot; side to Manson, or at least melodic and the man can write a song. Standout tracks are &quot;The Last Day on Earth&quot;, &quot;Coma White&quot;, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;, &quot;Disassociative&quot; as well as the singles &quot;The Dope Show&quot; and &quot;I Don't like the Drugs...&quot;.  I have to admit that when I hear track 1 (&quot;Great Big White World&quot;) I can't put the album down and have to listen to to the whole thing. Its definitely more radio-friendly than the first three albums, but it shows that yes, Marilyn Manson is a band that can put together an emotional album that still rocks your socks.
B00008J4P5|5.0|a stunning album worthy of all its praise. This is solid rock that manages to integrate so many other influences deftly and then uniquely take it into new dimensions.<br />Originality and powerful rock coalesce quite nicely in this lethal concoction.<br />Such an accomplishment adds a fresh dose of energy to reinvigorate a waning musical landscape.
0553213105|5.0|Some might feel that Pride and Prejudice is just a feminine romance novel, but to me this book was much more. The words and language in the book were mesmorizing. I believe Meg Ryan put it perfectly when she said, \\"I get caught up in the language, words like felicity and thither.\\"(You've Got Mail, 1998) Considering Jane Austen's formal education ended at age nine, Pride and Prejudice proves that America as a whole has been \\"dumbing-down\\" their children. I feel Pride and Prejudice is a timeless literary classic.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Yeah some people say theyre sell outs<BR>Well dont listen to them. They didnt SELL OUT they just matured as artists and this album obviously shows what great musicians incubus are. All of the Songs are wonderful. At first i didnt like the tracks 11am nor Just a phase but now ive come to love them. Dont judge this cd by the first listen because if you do, you wont get the cd's creativness and greatness. I love this album and it is my favorite cd ever made. BUY IT!
B000002LEM|2.0|This album serves up the hits only. The rest of the songs have great guitar dynamics but that is the extent of it. &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot; is good, but not until you get to almost the end of the song, and that isn't cool. &quot;Mine All Mine&quot; is interesting, at the beginning of the song you don't know what you're in for, but the tone is a bit darker and it has kind of a catchy chorus. I use catchy losely, what I really mean it has a certain melody to it that appeals to me. It's not a bad album opener. Everything else is making me yawn. You may want to stick to the hits here, the fav has to be &quot;When It's Love&quot; and also &quot;Feels So Good&quot; those two songs make it worth the purchase, &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; is a good song as well. This album is too varied as far as good songs spread over ok songs thrown in with some terrible songs. It's too sketchy for me and is recommended for die-hards.
B00000D9TQ|2.0|I am a huge fan of Phil Collins, however, this album does not include three of my favorite hits of his from the 80s: &quot;Everyday&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember?&quot; and &quot;Don't Lose My Number&quot;.  Instead of including these they made room for songs like &quot;True Colors&quot; (which was appopriate for Cyndi Lauper, not Phil Collins) and &quot;Dance Into the Light&quot; which was a minor 90s hit that does not merit a spot on this album.  Although there are some great hits here, this album is very incomplete.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I don't know about the video game but I don't have to know about it and to be a bright one to see that the conceptors of the game were inspired by George Romero's cinema.<br />Take Romero's excellent movie, \\"Day of the Dead\\" (the third and last film in his zombi trilogy), add to it a big budget, plenty of computers and special effects and a couple of female stars, in order to grab the required audience, and you get that kind of predigested movie, that you forget as soon as you see it. The story is practically the same: a handful of characters trapped by a bunch of zombies in a closed, underground place, and who quickly slander each other for survival. \\"Resident Evil\\" is unfortunately typical of today's American action cinema: it's empty, noisy and brainless, in one word, standard. More than the story, totally trivial today - the virus theme has been told a hundred times, and in better, especially in \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" and in Richard Matheson's founder novel, \\"I am Legend\\" -, the biggest default of this film is the total lack of gore scenes, which is paradoxical for a zombie movie and the symptom of a politically correct U.S. cinema. Milla Jovovich is not very comfortable, the music, uselessly hard, is deafening and brings bad headache (but this is the fashion today), the beginning is totally taken from Vincenzo Natali's \\"Cube\\" and the ending, from John Carpenter's \\"In the Mouth of Madness\\".<br />This disastrous movie (but what could you expect from the director of pitiful \\"Mortal Kombat\\", also based upon a video game?) is a good proof that money and technology don't always do good to cinema.<br />A last point: it's George Romero himself who was first supposed to direct the movie. But he was put away after he brought a script we may suppose as 'gore' - and good - as his previous zombi works... Shame on the deciders! And shame on the finally chosen director! Your movie is a waste!
B000035Z3K|4.0|Dracula was made during the great monster movie period of the early 1930s and stars the impeccable Bela Lugosi in the title role.  Lugosi may be remembered by some horror movie enthusiasts for turning down the role of Frankenstein, which ultimately went to Boris Karloff, but he gives a timelsess performance as the mysterious Count Dracula.<br />The early scenes of the film, which include excellent shots of Dracula's castle and the eerie Carpathian mountains, set the tone for the rest of the movie.  Dracula's castle is perhaps the best, with its long spider webs and dark passageways.  <br />As the movie begins, Renfield, played by horror movie veteran Dwight Frye (who also stars in Frankenstein), is travelling to Dracula's castle.  He is the caretaker of some legal documents requiring Dracula's signature.  Upon arriving, Renfield falls under Dracula's spell and is bitten by the Count. After being bitten, Renfield goes mad and begins feeding on the blood of insects and small rodents.  They then both set sail for London, where Renfield is put into a mental hospital under the care of Dr. Jack Seward (Herbert Bunston).<br />Dracula is introduced to Mina Seward (Helen Chandler), Jonathan Harker (David Manners), and Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan).  Dracula is immediately drawn to Mina's beauty, but little by little, Van Helsing is able to deduce that Dracula is really a vampire.  The clincher comes when Van Helsing is looking in a mirror, but Dracula fails to give off a reflection.  With the help of Harker, Van Helsing tracks Dracula back to his lair.<br />I tend to prefer the older horror movies of this period to today's blood and guts slasher films.  The psychological terror is more entertaining to watch than some slasher cutting up unsuspecting teenagers.  Lugosi and Frye give excellent performances, and the supporting actors give good performances as well.  Turn out the lights, make some popcorn, and enjoy this classic period film.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|An excellent release by an excellent band.  13th Step is more in depth and superbly arranged than Mer de Noms.  Its not as heavy...but better all the same.  Maynard puts on an amazing vocal show.  The guitars are catchy in almost every song.  The drums have groove and \\"feel\\" to them.  'The Package' has a neat bassline. I like it :)<BR>Best Song: The Noose<BR>One Word Review: Artistic
B00005JLYW|1.0|I liked \\"Charlie's Angels\\" when I saw it in the theatre.I (sadly enough) even bought the DVD. I knew that it was dumb but I thought it was dumb fun. I watched the DVD once and I put it on the shelf for a couple of years.<br />I watched the movie again a couple of months ago and I hated it. It wasn't dumb fun anymore. It was just dumb. The action scenes were not cool anymore, the funny parts were not that funny and the movie was just bad. I guess my taste in movies either matured or the movie was always bad and I just didn't realize it.<br />\\"Charlie's Angels Full Throttle\\" was just as bad as the first film. In many ways it was worse. This is just a movie for the juvenile fourteen year old \\"Maxim\\" crowd. I saw it because my parents made me see it. I hope I will never lose two hours of my life like that again.<br />Why oh why was Bernie Mac in the film? He is too good for this sort of material. Why Bernie why?!?!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I got this CD a couple days ago and have listened to it about six times and I really enjoy it. Why? because unlike some other reviewers of this record, I wasn´t expecting something &quot;different&quot;. <br />What I see (and hear) on this album is a mature effort by arguably the best Rock N Roll band ever. Remember when Janick Gers explained, on the Rock In Rio DVD, the reason to Iron Maiden´s success all over their almost 30 years of brilliant career? He said that´s because fans know what they´ll get each time the band releases a new record. That´s the case here.<br />Going to the record, I have to agree with the guy who gave 2 stars to it...sort of. I agree that production fell a little short, the lack of use of the 3 guitar lineup, and the similarities in song structure and lyrics with some old tunes. <br />Still, songs like &quot;Paschendale&quot;, &quot;Montsegur&quot;, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; and the title track stand out. The other songs are very good too. Maybe I was expecting a little more on &quot;Journeyman&quot; as this is Maiden´s first full acoustic track. Nothing really new, just good, over the top Rock N Roll. <br />When was the last time you heard something &quot;different&quot; from a heavy metal band? see Metallica and Queensryche for an answer. This is why Iron Maiden will continue to rock and will keep conquering generations of fans all over the world, they wont sell out. This is why they are my favorite band, because they create great, timeless music. Can´t wait to see them live.
B00005JLXE|4.0|There is no hero quite like Daredevil. I will not say that he is the best super-hero that is out there today but I will say he is one of the most real.<br />Daredevil has always been different than the other heroes in comic books because his disability is what GIVES him his power. He is proof that anything is possible and that anyone can overcome anything if they really have to.<br />Daredevil is worth your time if you like super-heroes that are more human and full of flaws. Ben Affleck does a excellent job as Daredevil and he prooves that he has what it takes to portray a hero in the Marvel Universe. Mark Steven Johnson does an awesome job as the director and the writers are great at re-creating some of the best issues of Daredevil. Daredevil is slightly different from the comics but you feel like you are re-reading the best of Frank Miller's run on the comic once you view the film.<br />Daredevil is not perfect (I can see why some of the comic fans would hate the adaptation) and it has some parts that are really lame but it is a good film if you really like the red hero that we all love. I would be bold enough to say that it is the best solo super-hero movie since &quot;Batman.&quot;<br />The Daredevil film may not please all of the Daredevil comic fans but the DVD is set up in such a way that the Daredevil comic fans will find the extras well worth the price. The DVD has really awesome interview's with all of Daredevil's best writers and artists. You really learn more about Daredevil as you hear what the creators have to say about the comic and the film.<br />This DVD is great for fans and non-fans. It is a really cool film that is well worth the price.
B00005A46T|5.0|many people dubb this band nu metal bacause they are relatively new and actually reached double platinum status yet they do not compare them to actual nu metal bands such as korn, disturbed, adema, drowning pool,etc. so lets compare, bit by bit:<br />Vocals: <BR>Slipknot-Mostly Screaming, some singing.<BR>korn-slowly talking (chorus toblind),Singing(hollow life), some screaming.<br />Guitars: <BR>Slipknot-6 string, reasonably fast. <BR>korn- slower, 7 string, different tuning.<br />Drums: <BR>Slipknot-Very fast, additional percussion, double bass.<BR>korn- single bass, slower.<br />Bass: <BR>Slipknot-more traditional bass sound. <BR>korn- unique \\"clicking\\" bass, 5 string.<br />As you can see, Slipknot is not nu metal, and to Mr Matt Mason:<BR>I love slipknot as well as Sepultura, Pantera, Slayer, Old metallica (albums 1-4), Soulfly, Static x, and CHILDREN of BODOM.<BR>So dont say that 'if u listen to slipknot u are not a \\"true\\" metal head', that is just stupid. Since when do slipknot sound anything like pop music, are you high or are you deaf?<br />...!!!<br />BTW, i'm not dissing korn or disturbed, i was just comparing two types of music.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I have to give her credit where it is due. She has mastered a VERY successful career for herself, and stayed at the top of her game (whether you liked her or not) for many years.<br /> This album, in my opinion, is not BAD...it's just OK. And for me, for an album to worthy of listening it needs to be atleast GOOD or GREAT. Most hardcore Madonna fans will most likely drool over this release, despite the poor record sales it has garnered.<BR>  Madonna seems like she is trying TOO hard  to be noticed here, and that act in my opinion is getting quite old. Just be yourself Madonna! People will like you, I promise. And now she's teaming up and making out with Britney Spears? C'mon...She makes out with young girls one day, and the next she slips on a flowery sun dress and tries to sell her Children's Book, what gives? <BR>  I think Madonna may be going through a mid-life crisis, and it shows on this disappointing album.
6305882592|5.0|If such an irreverently offbeat film were to be made today, I wonder how the putative audiences would react. As was probably the case when the film was released, people would probably find the theme edgy, if not inappropriate. This anti-establishment cult classic quite openly explores themes of suicide, love, death and life with a fresh perspective.<br />The interesting part is how this film will likely find you. In most societies, an older man will likely fall for a woman years his junior. Here though, Harold (Bud Cort) -- a shy teenager with an affinity for death -- meets his 80-year-old true love Maude (Ruth Gordon), not at a dance or social event, but at funerals.<br />I guess 'Harold and Maude' plays on '60s-esque themes of turning maverick, challenging societal moulds, denouncing materialism. The story is strewn with delectable humor, and thankfully is not of your average garden variety. Cat Stevens' open-air, acoustic-driven rock 'n' roll makes for a cherishable soundtrack giving the film an authentic organic sound indicative of its demeanor.<br />A great movie with a warm heart -- required collective for every self-respecting library!
B000069HKH|5.0|I did not become a Bruce Springsteen fan really until I heard the first single from this album which is the title track.<br />  I think the whole album is just absolutely incredible. It has turned me on to this rock legend and everything he has done. I have noW explored his past musical endeavors, and I still think this is his best ever.<br /> This album makes me feel fresh, excited, and just genuinly happy!
0446530891|4.0|One of the reviewers called this tale \\"less gripping\\" than Baldacci's previous works and I most strongly disagree with that statement. Split Second is as riveting a psychological thriller as any of Baldacci's previous yarns.<br />The paths of two discredited secret agents collide as they come together to uncover the kidnapping of a presidential candidate, only to unravel a shocking truth: that the separate acts of violence that shattered their lives were really a long time in the making -- and are a long way from over.<br />Baldicci engagingly pits each player against the others, their chemistry adds depth and suspense to the page-turning ride through annals of high crime and politics.<br />My only minor gripe: the stretch towards the denouement is a bit drawn out, but the intrigue pretty much makes up for it.<br />A thoroughly engaging novel!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful work that every Glass fan should own.<BR>Glass has this amazing ability to make his music hauntingly beautiful.  This album can be described as peaceful, but at the same time, there's an underlying current that keeps you on edge.  <BR>I would highly recommend this disc for casual Glass fans as well as for the die-hard fans.  <BR>If you enjoyed the music from &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, you'll enjoy this cd very much as well.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember, is one novel when read you shall always remember.  Once you have read this novel<BR>you will understand what wounderfull writting style Nicholas Sparks has as a writer.  You will cry from the <BR>love and the heart break in the novel.<br />I stumbled across this novel after watching the movie which has Mandy Moore in it.  Once I fell in love with <BR>the movie I had then proceeded to go and purchuse the novel.  There are a few differences from the novel and<BR>the movie, but in genral they are still pretty close in comparison.  <br />The novel talks about the truth and love which you will experince in your life.  You will also read about<BR>hardships that the characters go through, and that you may witness in your life.  The novel is about Jamie<BR>and she would be stereo typed as a Bible lover, and a church freak.  No one really knows that she is truley<BR>a wounderful person until Landon steps in.  She is always helping no matter what happens, or whats going <BR>on in her life.  She is protected by her father though.  Once you meet Landon Carter though you will see a <BR>tere in the personalities.  When Landon started to hang out with Jamie you will notice that Landon is the type of <BR>person who only cares about the outside of a person.  Mean while Landon also has to worry about his <BR>reputation and seeing him help out Jamie starts to cause a problem.  But no one really knows Jamie that<BR>well, and no one knows whats wrong with her.<br />The hardships that the characters go through, and then what finally ends up happening makes the book <BR>worthy of calling a spectacular novel.  The tears that you will get after reading the novel will make you<BR>understand more about the bigger picture in genraul.  Finding the truth behind it all is what is best about the<BR>novel A Walk to Remember.<br />Nicholas Sparks has achived the greetest thing in writting and that is showing the differnec between two different <BR>people, and their differences can be over come.  He also showed the readers what true love really is, when<BR>two people work hard for their love.  This love is very ordinary though, and you wouldn't understand how truthful<BR>this love is.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Come on, people, if you think you can make a better Matrix movie than the Wachowski brothers, make it yo damn self!<br />The first movie ended on a wildly hopeful note.  They could have built on this and had Neo proceed to fulfill part of the Prophecy in movie two.  But instead they built on the darkness.  If the &quot;Matrix&quot; was the manic upswing, &quot;Reloaded&quot; was the depressive downturn, which may be part of the reason many people found it disappointing.<br />Caution: if you can't stand darkness and mind-expanding philosophical sci fi mumbo jumbo, stay away from this movie.  Otherwise, whether you buy this film or not is a choice I leave to you.
B000002GWN|4.0|Joni Live, finally. Her first concert album is a schizophrenic affair. Half of it is just Joni by herself, with guitar, piano or dulcimer. These tracks are uniformly amazing. Her skill as a singer has improved so much over the years that the studio versions (especially of older songs like &quot;Cactus Tree&quot;) sound slight and precious by comparison. The other half pairs her with the L.A. Express jazz band. While she bent the same players to her will with glorious results  in the studio on &quot;Court and Spark,&quot; on tour they just sound like a pretty good fusion band trying too hard to be hip. I find the performances unlistenable. &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot; is also notable for the chatting: Joni's wise but spacey discourse on the difference between painting and singing is much fun.<br />Four stars may seem a bit high, since I hate half the tracks. But when it's good, it's sublime.
B00006L83N|1.0|Odissey es un albúm malo, realmente malo. Los riffs de Michael Romeo han perdido toda noción de la harmonia y los teclados son absolutamente inaudibles, debido al enorme estruendo que provoca este grupo cuya meta es la de hacer cuanto más ruido mejor. Un grupo que perdió todo su talento con la marcha de su antiguo bajista. La melodía es inexistente, la historia que se explica -La Odisea de Homero- no deja de ser una defenestración en toda regla de esta milenaria novela épica... Si te gusta &quot;Damnation Game&quot;, &quot;Twilight in Olimpus&quot; y &quot;Divine Wing of Tragedy&quot; (albúmes muy superiores), encontrarás este 'Odissey' falto de ideas, aberrante, estrepitoso, estúpidamente pretencioso, aburrido y con las letras más estúpidamente delirantes y tontas que hayan figurado jamás en un 'concept album' como es éste. Amigos de la música, buscad Nightwish, Kamelot, Therion, Royal Hunt, Sonata Arctica, Lacuna Coil, antiguo (old) Gamma Ray, Rhapsody, Luca Turilli, Within Temptation, 'Visions' de Stratovarius, 'Lingua mortis' de Rage. Y si buscais algo más tranquilo, mirad Sarah Brightman, Wim Mertens, Enma Shapplin, Nightnoise, o ese genio que se llama Tom Waits.<br />NOISY RECORD, CHEESY LYRICS, STUPID PLOT, PRETENTIOUS RECORD, AWFUL (or inexistent?) HARMONIES... A TOTAL DISASTER DEDICATED FOR THOSE MAJORITY THAT RECLAIMS HEARTLESS AND EMPTY MUSIC, DONE WITH THE ANXIOUS OF BETTER SALES... FOR TEENAGERS ONLY (LIKE LIMP bIZKIT AND lINKING PARK, ETC...)  TERRIBLE.
B000059MEK|5.0|Hey, finally bought this yesterday, but I've heard it before... but it's amazing how much better it sounds coming through my headphones... the beats are crazy, and the bass is so funky... this is happy music, this is music that will get you going... I love the way it mixes so many styles, so much cheesy music, into this melting pot, and out comes an amazing dance album... I can hear traces of hairmetal, early 80's hip-hop, disco, electro, stuff like Journey or Boston, and even stuff that sounds so much like Giorgio Morodor it's not funny... just listen to track 11, it sounds like the lost Neverending Story song... it could fit on that soundtrack so well... I personally think that's a great thing, cause the neverending story soundtrack is awesome... but some may not...<br />anyways yeah, if you like dance music, you need this... Daft Punk are the kings of the groove... their beats are excellent, and so tasty... check this monster album out boys and girls!!
6305897786|4.0|One thing you have to remember about Polanski is his films contain puzzles. Rosemary's Baby had them, and so does the Ninth Gate. The first time I watched The Ninth Gate I thought it sucked. Then I thought: &quot;Hmm - I must have missed something because Roman Polanski can't suck this bad.&quot; so I watched it again. Sure enough, I missed the puzzles. Every time I watch it I find something I missed before. In my opinion, it's pretty damn good. The more I watch it, the more appreciation I have for it.

B000002C2E|5.0|I've had this album for several years and just picked it up again.  Now I can't seem to stop playing it.  This CD is absolutely wrenching in its despair--&quot;When you think you've lost everything, you find out you can always lose a little more&quot; but ultimately redemptive--&quot;The sun is beginning to shine on me.&quot;  It is sad, very sad, but occasionally weirdly funny.<br />&quot;Time out of Mind&quot; is not an easy listen, but rewards the attention.

B000002UAI|5.0|The fact that a fair number of reviews on this album are 3 or 4 stars shows just how spoiled the Beatles made some people with some other albums.(Well gee,not every song on this was written by Lennon/McCartney...how dare they).There are some great songs on this album,some originial,some not. My faves-Eight days a week,I'll follow the sun,Kansas city,Rock and roll music,Every little thing,ect. Essential album!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Pro - Does everything i would expect it to (Saves my games)<BR>Cons - Bit pricy
B00005JMFR|5.0|Ok, my turn.  I believe there will be a similar ending to that of Akira, being that I know someone working on the movie (I won't name anyone but he's reasonably important) and they know whats going to happen but only hinted to me what was going to happen, ie he told me its going to be an Akira ending with a hollywood twist.  Anyway, the way I see, the theory of Neo evolving into \\"something\\" that destroys the matrix world is more than likely, and the effect will probably be destructive and claiming many lives, the death of all these people in the matrix world (not zion) will cause them to either wake up or die leaving Zion on its own to rebiuld the human race again.  However, questions of Neo's parents and what happened to the last \\"One\\" are explained in the new film I can reveal, but from what I know the last \\"One\\" had a choice to pull the \\"plug\\" on the matrix but chose not to due to socio political reasons, ie free will leads to war, famine, corruption, etc. The endin is philisophical, and the hint of matrix within a matrix is made.  Thats all I know, but its something to work with.

0380973650|5.0|\\"American Gods\\" is an interesting hybrid: fantasy by way of mythology, mystery thriller in the noir tradition, cultural and religious satire, and more. The risk any author takes in writing such a book is that devotees of each genre will protest the bastardization. Witness the scores of disappointed readers drawn to the book by the Hugo Award, who may have expected swordfights, elves, and aliens. Similarly, fans of Thomas Pynchon, who even gets an honorable nod in the book, may find Gaiman's noir style too lowbrow for their tastes, while readers of detective fiction may be repulsed by the book's supernatural elements.<br />I think, however, that the book will fascinate and intrigue readers who dabble across the various genres to which Gaiman pays homage. The premise is inspired: the old gods brought to America by generations of arriving populations (from Native Americans to recent immigrants) have been rendered nearly moot and powerless by modern infatuation with the new gods--telephony, the Internet, transportation, television, etc. The two camps prepare for a final battle, and Shadow, still traumatized by his wife's betrayal and death, finds himself bafflingly caught up in the war plans.<br />In an allegory, characterization is probably beside the point, but Gaiman still manages to infuse the imported gods with enough traits to make them distinctive and, more important, identifiable to anyone with a passing knowledge of mythology. He resurrects a few gods or legends who are so esoteric and forgotten that they survive as faint echoes of their former selves or, like the poor Queen of Sheba (remember her?), they meet an early demise. The new gods, just as appropriately, are as faceless, fleeting, and frivolous as the technologies they represent. Not a few readers have objected that Christianity gets barely a mention, but they've missed the book's most cleverly \\"hidden Indian\\": Shadow himself is the messiah-figure. The most obvious parallels are placed early on--he's in his early 30s, he's spent three years in the desert (prison) before embarking on his reluctant mission--and the parallels only multiply as the book progresses in ways I can't fairly divulge. (Watch for the role the goddess Easter plays in the book's climax.)<br />Gaiman has a droll, dark sense of humor that livens up his prose. Along the way, he also effortlessly plants so many loose ends and subtle intimations that he surprises the reader with unexpected twists and forehead-slapping resolutions even after the main action of the book seems to have wound down. Like Shadow performing his coin tricks, Gaiman repeatedly distracts the reader with \\"obvious\\" revelations, only to unveil a secret hidden in the other hand.<br />The story moves along so briskly, so imaginatively, and so wittily, that I raced through several sections, but the more I think about \\"American Gods,\\" the more I realize I missed. I'll be pulling this one down from the shelf for a second stab in a couple of years.in his early 30s, he's spent three years in the desert (prison) before embarking on his reluctant mission--and the parallels only multiply as the book progresses in ways I can't fairly divulge.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Why is it that most of the people giving negative reviews can't just say why they don't like it and leave it at that?  Comments like &quot;ohhh the only reason you five star people like it is because it's radiohead... it's ok... it's really ok to say you don't like it&quot; and blah blah blah.  Well maybe those of us who like it actually DO like it, not just because it's Radiohead.  Did that thought ever cross your mind?  I just think it's utterly rediculous to accuse those of us who like the album of just pretending to like it simply because you can't see how anybody could.<br />Anyway, with that out of the way, I have been a radiohead fan since ok computer came out and this album is just as good as anything they've ever done in my opinion.  I'd put this one tied with ok computer as my favorite radiohead album.<br />I think the thing is, radiohead is not as accessible to non-fans and first time listeners.  As in you generally can't just listen to a song or two once or twice and judge it.  You have to actually sit down and listen... read the lyrics and just listen to it.  It may take a few listens to grow on you but once it does you will love it.<br />If you like radiohead in general then give this album a chance.

B00005JMEW|4.0|This is one of the best movies i have seen in the last few years.<BR>I've been waiting to see it for a year and a half, first Pulp Fiction now this, Quentin Tarantino is the man. My favorite part<BR>in Kill Bill was the 10min animation & the blood bath battle at<BR>the end of the movie. Uma Thurman & Lucy Liu really impressed me in this fim and i cant wait to see the upcoming Kill Bill vol.2.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I just saw this movie an hour ago at an advance screening, and there are no words to describe how perfect it is. It's romantic, it's uplifting, it's funny, it's inspiring, it's every fantasy a girl has ever had with every type of man she's ever fantasized about. I saw it with my best male friend, who is generally critical of these types of movies. He went in expecting the worst but came out just as full of love and twinkle in his eye as I did. GO SEE IT!
B0000BWTK3|5.0|Despite the fact that there are already so many beautiful recordings available of these popular concertos (e.g. Andsnes and Katayenko's 1991 performance on Virgin Classics or Zimmerman and von Karajan on DG or Kovacevich and Sir Colin Davis on Philips), this new coupling of these so well-known masterpieces of the romantic repertoire is far beyond words, even close to immaculate perfection.<br />The creamy, glooming and fullblooded tone of the peerless Berlin Philharmonic under Jansons opposed to the fenomenal pianistic subdued noblesse and passionate poetry of this absolutely stunning pianist,result in both an aristocratic and overwhelming outburst of pure romantic music, a truly classic interpretation.<br />Especially the Grieg performance will become undoubtebly one of THE recordings of the century, unwrapped of all common clichés, breathing with an impressionistic glow.  The cadenza in the end of the first part, astonishing.  The intro of the second movement with an acquiescent and silken horn section of the Berlin Philharmonic, of a rare beauty.  The climax of the slow movement,two hands of Andsnes touching the piano with a yearning and deeply moving intensity.  The third movement, a pure osmosis between orchestra and soloist.         <br />This performance is really the one to have, especially on cold and sometimes sad winter eves, even when your cd compartment is already filled with two or three versions of these concertos. <br />Music for the centuries.<br />Even if it could be judgded that it's very difficult to surpass the legendary Richter performance of the Schumann concerto (Original recordings on DG), this live performance full of volatile and passionate outbursts opposed to the many chilled restraint passages by the orchestra and the fenomenal Andsnes again equals perfection.  <br />The EMI sound quality of this disc is impeccable, revealing every detail and every shade of these beautiful pages.<br />Buy it.  You'll never regret.
B00007FCTH|5.0|I can definately see why. It's shot perfectly. The cinematography is extradoniary, as is the story, plot, acting, music, and historical accuracy. It's incredible. The way it is told and it's just amazing. The story is about a newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. The movie starts off like a documentary, and then they reveal that it is footage made up for the rememberance of Charles Foster Kane, who at that point had died. On his deathbed he uttered 2 words &quot;Rosebud.&quot; No one knows what he meant by that, so they start interviewing and asking people who knew him to tell them everything they knew. The reporters find out about his childhood, young adulthood, his adulthood, and basically his entire life. They sadly never find out what or who Rosebud was, but the audience finds out. I'm not gonna tell you, but it so obvious that you'll kick yourself at the end of the movie for not knowing.
0140277447|1.0|lie. My parents are chinese and I don't like Japan but this book is terrible. For example, the photo of necks is widely believed to be taken in Manchuria and they are thieves that slaughtered many people in Manchuria. A photo of abandoned in ruin has another one taken at the same time. It shows his parent and (his brother?) put the baby in the ruin for the problem photo to show barbarism of Japan Army. There are more but it takes long time to type and I don't want to waste my important time. Anyway, this book is not worth reading.
B00005A46T|5.0|I know i throw around the words awesome, cool, and one of the best a lot in my reviews, but this is the the only review where you will see the phrase &quot;greatest CD in existence&quot;.  This is an absolutely killer CD and anyone who thinks that they've gone soft can go f*** themselves because this one is even harder than their first one (with the exception of the final track, &quot;Iowa&quot;).  Corey's scream is absolutely awesome and the riffs are absolutely killer (expecially in &quot;the heretic anthem&quot;) The drums are absolutely crazy, but what do you expect with Joey Jordison at the kit?  Listen to the drum part at the beginning of &quot;the shape&quot; and I gaurantee you will be blown away.  The tracks and the riffs on the whole seem more polished and the music just has an undeniable kick to it.  A f****** masterpiece
038572179X|5.0|I highly recommend this work.  The Atonement is the novel itself.<br />I was expecting a lot and it turned out to be more complex and rewarding than I expected.  McEwan is a masterful novelist and, although I thought the beginning was slow, the last 200 pages of the book were simply so good and often so riveting that the novel is beyond criticism.  The ending is great.  Very touching.
B00005UOXL|5.0|Being a fan of Idol's for nearly 20 years, this CD still holds up today.  From punk rock tracks to a couple of slow tracks, this is one of my faves!
0900652985|5.0|This is a standard reference work.  Its value does not lie in its estimations of values, but in the well-chosen range of coins shown and identified, and in its long-time use by scholars and numismatists as a comparative tool (giving the Sear # for coins to identify them is standard practice in the field).
B000002UUX|5.0|Others have said it and I concur. This Megadeth cd is simply amazing. The arrangements kick ass as does the musicianship. Great cd!!.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I've finished reviewing the low raters and I can only come to one conclusion: more than half apparently suffer from attention deficit syndrome and the remainder want to show their musical knowledge by comparing Sigur Ros to other late 70's early 80's 'head' bands. For the former, take some pills and grow an attention span, and for the latter, bravo on your musical knowledge...clap...clap....<br />Now about the music. Yes I've heard some of the sounds before, and some of the themes seem co-opted from other sources. But that, in a nutshell, is the state we are in as far as music is concerned. Anything remotely listenable, and not a pure din-fest, has been done before, and in some instances, relative to certain parts, done better. So that leaves amalgamating sounds differently, doing what's been done better, or a mixture of both. In the end when you can find a new band where you can identify Pink Floyd, Enya, Mercury Rev, a blend of shoegazers like Galaxy 500, early Tangerine Dream, Pachabel, George Winston, and The Cure, all the while having an indentity of its own, you're on to something. Drawing a comparison to another sensory experience one should think in terms of a gourmet meal. The ingredients have been used before, many times, many ways, but in the proper hands, ambrosia is created. Sigur Ros and Agaetis Byrjun is a feast for the ears.<br />Svefn g englar and Staralfur are my favorites. Said for the probably the billionth time, the lyrics don't need to be understood, as the intent is to leave a musical impression, like the tone poems of Smetana. I can't think of anything better than self-satisfied solitude (it is a rare commodity) but listening to this CD provides as close an experience as I have found in sound. A frosty, snow swept landscape, with no one in sight, and nearly bereft any sound are the images that come to mind when I listen this music. I suppose that is the purpose of such music and is not for the exclusively rump shaking, 4/4 beat crowd.<br />Itis not perfect mind you. I detect a smidge of self-consciousness and self-deprecation in some of the sounds used, and some of the vocalizations, which leave me feeling that they don't want to take themselves too seriously and want to counteract the lushness and beauty with some quirks that overall seems more contrived than the music, without such adornments, would have had. Seems like they're coming out of character to wink at the audience to not take it too seriously either. So overall **** out of *****.
B000002H33|5.0|This is what old Metallica was all about. Fast, furious, powerful, melodic, soulful, chainsaws cutting trees in a private park annoying your neighbours kinda sound. This cd is as good as it gets when it comes to all out in your face metal. Great song writing all around. The stops, the goes, the pauses are fantastic and really make this cd come alive. I saw them on the MOP tour with Sword and Metal Church and it's one I'll never forget. Metallica at it's best and a MUST HAVE!!.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|I remember liking this movie when I was very young (about six or seven). Then again, up to that point, I liked every James Bond movie I'd seen (which had been all of them except for the Pierce Brosnan pictures). But Never Say Never Again was one I was curious to give a second look, mostly because all this talk of Harrison Ford returning as Indiana Jones made me curious to see how Sean Connery fared as the superspy action hero in his fifties. The answer, not very well (though Ford at his current age appears in better shape than Connery was at the time), and if this were an official Bond entry, it'd be in contention with Moonraker and Live and Let Die as the worst of the series.<br />The film is a virtual remake of Thunderball; Bond is up against madman Largo, a megalomaniac who has a plan for worldwide blackmail by stealing two American nuclear warheads. On his side is Blofeld (Max Van Sydow) and the sultry, but dangerous femme fatale Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera). Bond eventually gains the services of Largo's girlfriend, Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger), and sets out to bring this terrorist plot to an end.<br />Never Say Never Again stinks up the screen right from the beginning with its silly title (which obviously relates to Connery's bid to play Bond) and certainly doesn't improve when we hear the awful main theme song. Right off the bat, a lot of traditional Bond elements are noticeably missing, the pre-credits shot of Bond approaching the screen, John Barry's famed score, and an exciting opening that should pave the way for the rest of the picture.<br />Bond movies generally rely on three things: the charisma of its leading man, the effectiveness of the villains, and spectacular action sequences. Sean Connery has actually never been my favorite as 007 (I've always preferred both Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore in the role), but he still makes a good impression even at the ripe age of fifty-three, delivering silly lines with a sense of conviction that few actors could muster. He's not quite as good with the action sequences, he moves a bit too slow during the fight scenes and the use of stunt doubles are often easy to pick out (the motorcyle helmet is the most obvious).<br />The supporting cast is subpar without exception. Klaus Maria Brandauer is one of the weakest Bond villains, Barbara Carrera is over-the-top without being fun or even sexy, and a young (though admittedly quite foxy) Kim Basinger represents the bane of good acting. Connery struggles mightily hard amid the crap that surrounds him, but he can't save the day here, and he's eventually dragged down by the awfulness.<br />Never Say Never Again was directed by Irvin Kershner, the same man who gave us The Empire Strikes Back. Virtually none of the outstanding qualities of that film are evident here. This picture has the look of a hack job, it's poorly edited and crafted without a sense of flair. Most of the action scenes are terribly boring, the only lively setpiece being a motorcycle chase that's quite fun to watch, but doesn't match up to the series' most impressive action sequences.<br />Never Say Never Again was released the same year as the Roger Moore Bond film Octopussy, which wasn't a great film, but memory serves that it was at least a passably enjoyable action movie that boasted several excellent action sequences. There's a reason why Never's distributors prefer not to acknowledge the movie's existence, and why it's the one Bond movie casual movie fans probably remember in infamy or don't remember at all.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Yet again Megadeth has released another fantastic riff masterpiece. They are truly the leading metal masters out there today. The one thing that I have always liked about Megadeth is that they believe the bass plays an important role in the bands overall sound and YES!!, you can hear what the other Dave is playing on all their cd's. Metallica take notice!!. Megadeth may not be as big as you are, but they are a better band hands down.
B0000399WI|5.0|For me, The Shawshank Redemption and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, two movies which have virtually nothing in common, have forever been ingrained as my favorite films of all-time. The reason: both films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place. In The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and never has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that the third Indy movie has done for me. <br />Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be enlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would have thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never even heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular films ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film in theaters.<br />Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're introduced to several other characters and situations over the many years that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows), all of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers the film's message.<br />What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about what we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality that involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the unitiated (take my word for it, I first saw this film whenI was a 14-year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.<br />Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping much of the storylines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few crucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant. Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.<br />But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likeable character is entirely believable. Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.<br />The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous. Everything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but everythingabout the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure genius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Yes that's right, Audioslave is by far the best group out there at this point and time. They are wonderfully melodic and the songs groove big time. I honestly have to say that this is the first album/cd that has inspired me in some time. This stuff is that good really!!. Anyone who listens and doesn't respect what this cd brings, has little or no understanding of what makes music great. My God the riffs and the passion of Mr. Cornells vocals are simply amazing. If your ass isn't moving on Show Me How To Live, you're not alive!! Their is not a bad song on this cd period. I'd say they all rate a 7.5/10 or higher. Shadow of the Sun is another classic of this cd. Passion out the ying yang!!. If you love Rock &amp; Roll like it's supposed to be played, buy this cd. If you like the current over paid under talented stuff you hear all to offer on VH1 (new metal/rap metal I'm talking to you), don't buy it as you simply won't understand it.<br />Yes Audioslave have saved the music industry and possibly the last 10 years of what I call the (with no reference to the Grateful Dead) dead decade.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Indian music at best, but never Indian.  Afro caught fire while break up in November.  Highlight:  good rogue.  Lowlight: good rogue.  How many stars can give?  How many?  Never ask.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Intelligent stories, great effects, *amazing* cast portraying the most interesting characters ever.<br />Exactly the kind of programming FOX would cancel.
B000002H33|1.0|The Metallica Master of Puppets Cd is way below average. Songs like Batteries, Something Like You, and Suffocating inside of Jose are way too comercial. Metallica needs to go back to their roots. If you want a good Metallica album buy St. Anger.
B000002UUX|4.0|Some albums grab you and don't let you go until the disc stops spinning, Megadeth's classic Rust In Peace is one of those albums.  Much more complex than their previous efforts, Rust In Peace really showed the complexity of everything Megadeth does.  This album has one common theme throughout, the cruelty and unjustice in the government.  Many bands have written about corruption of government but none pull it off quite as good as Rust In Peace.  Holy Wars...The Punnishment Due and Take No Prisoners discuss the unfairness of war to the citizens and the people fighting, they are forced to fight and then left to die unrecognized.  Dawn Patrol and Rust In Peace...Polaris show how pollution is leading to the ultimate destruction of Earth and the life on it.  Hangar 18 warns of lies the government is telling us involving alien lifeforms in outer space.  Not to mention the other four tracks, each with their own unique theme.  Poison Was The Cure features possibly the most complex music on the album, with the slow bass and drum intro changing comletely into an all out speed metal assault.  This album is nearly perfect, the only thing keeping it from a four star rating is the quality of the recording, but as far as the music goes, this is an unstoppable record.  From the first chords of Holy Wars to the last scream of Polaris, Rust in Peace is an all out thrash metal assault.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I have seen many movies, and have enjoyed many of them;  however this is by far the worst film.  First, the movie starts from backwards to forwards, similiar to Momento.  In the beginning of the movie, the camera work could make anyone dizzy.  The worst part of the film without question was the rape scene. This is the longest rape scene (about 10 minutes) that I have ever seen and it was very brutal.   Lastly, I have been going to movie theatres for a long time, but I never experienced  a reaction from moviegoers as was the case here.  Halfway through the film, most of the people in the theatre left!  It was incredible to see people walk out of the theartre, all of whom were very upset about the contents of the movie.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|I really loved the background music from the scene where Uma is in the attic with the swords....is this song on the CD?
B00006LLNU|5.0|A beautiful album!  If you really want to enjoy Sigur R&oacute;s, see them play live.  I saw them play with Bj&ouml;rk this past summer in New York and they were awesome. Probably the best concert of my life!
B0000931OG|4.0|I'd never really minded Blur, maybe because I'm an Oasis fan. But I downloaded some songs out of Think Tank after it won an award for best album over in the UK. I had to immediately buy the album. It is a clever, slow paced, loving signature of Damon Albarn's thoughts on commerciality and stupidity of the U.S.A . Albarn's melodies reflect on war in not a very profound level, easy political views for the non political. <br />It's a good thing Gallagher's wishes were not fulfilled and Albarn has not died out of Aids, he and Blur have offered a superb album with sounds that from the Moroccan Republic to the night life of a broken city filled with lights, sights and sounds and war.
B00009XITQ|5.0|I love this movie!  Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, and Kelly Preston, etc., made this movie spectacular!  You can't forget the crew who made this movie great!  Listening to the commentaries of Amanda Bynes and the directors and writers, it made me think about it even more, and like it even more.  Not knowing that some of the scenes were not even buildings but tents that looked so much like an old British building.  And not knowing that Amanda was only 16 at the time, they had doubles for her. It's kind of weird that they would make so many rules for young actors and actresses, that it seems to be worthless and odd.  The crew was amazing!  The sound, camera, actors, and actresses, digital crew, hair and makeup (AMAZING), and the clothes team--were also FANTASTIC!  It was so much fun to watch!  Also, Kelly Preston did her own singing!  She was GREAT!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|The Matrix underwhelmed me when I first saw it; admittedly, I saw it after much of the hype was underway, but I always wondered why it was such a craze.  I saw Reloaded when it came out, and again was sorely underwhelmed - though this time half the field was agreeing with me.  But after the movie I finally picked the original up on DVD, and liked it a lot more on re-viewing.  With that in mind, I picked up The Matrix Reloaded on DVD, to see if it would grow on me like the first one has.<br />It did, actually.  The Matrix Reloaded is smarter than I initially gave it credit for, and the action scenes actually hold up quite well on multiple sittings.  The problem is not really technical (though the overhyped \\"Burly Brawl\\" is so blatantly CGI it hurts) so much as it is with editing.  Most of the action scenes go on too long.  There's some really astonishing stuff that goes on, but it tries to hold the tension longer than it is good for and a number of such scenes lose their impact before the end.  Aside from the artful fight before the Oracle meeting, the freeway is the best of them; but again, this simply lasts too long for its dramatic potential.<br />The \\"Burly Brawl,\\" on the other hand, did not work for me.  Many of the fight's moves were sheer poetry in motion; you could really tell that everyone involved was crafting it lovingly.  But, the fight came out of nowhere and lacked the insane sense of urgency that the brilliant subway fight in the original film had.  I have nothing against a scene of this scope, but it needs to be for a desperate reason.  When the hero can just fly away, it becomes the filmmakers showing off.<br />The rave / sex scene early on is...misguided.  It was actually pulled off fairly well (if it lacked a certain sense of taste) and did have some revealing purpose; but again, it went on too long and seemed as if it were in lieu of characterization.  The sex couldn't pull off the fact that, together, Carrie-Ann Moss and Keanu Reeves have not really generated a believable spark since one tense moment in the club in the first movie.  This is a tragedy of filmmaking in general nowadays; rather than rely on chemistry and submerged sexual tension (watch The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn for a classic example), characters hop into the sack fairly quickly and waste it all.  A shot or two of their hands came close to conveying it, but that was the best the Wachowskis got out of it.<br />I actually really enjoyed the scenes where Neo meets with the Oracle, the Merovingian, and the Architect.  The Oracle seems to be making the original film's pat Campbellian structure questionable in a really interesting way; the Merovingian's trick with the cake was actually brilliant in a discussion of causality given the sort of metaphysics the first one asks us to consider; and the Architect's room was pure science fiction brilliance.  With stoic, clipped acting on both sides, and the amazing device of the monitors (which we saw briefly in the original), the Architect's scene stands as one of the best in the whole movie.<br />The acting is okay.  It deserves no awards, but it did convey what it needed to convey at the appropriate times.  The attacks on it are exaggerated.  Most of the disappointment seems to be the chemistry, the fact that Keanu Reeves talks, and the fact that Laurence Fishburne has abandoned the mystery man of the original in favor of, you know, actually developing his character.<br />This is a film that could've been really good (I'll reserve the question of \\"greatness\\" for the final product) if it had reined in its running time by about 20 minutes, cut fairly evenly from the big action scenes.  As it stands, there's a good amount of lag in the storytelling on top of the interruption that is the Burly Brawl.  Some really memorable moments are created in the Matrix Reloaded, and the story is very interesting both dramatically and philosophically, but the directors went too far in showing them off.I just hope Revolutions provides a degree of redemption for the trilogy.<br />A word on the DVD:  if I'd actually bought it at MSRP, I'd be royally ticked off.  The film lacks a commentary track, which is a crime, seeing as how much the original popularized such tracks.  The \\"Crash Course\\" featurette on the making of the freeway scene is a really cool look into technical filmmaking, but \\"Preload\\" is too much fluff for its worth and the rest is straight fluff.  I did get a kick out of the MTV Movie Awards Reloaded.  But, at such a high price I'd expect a commentary and a more packed second disc.
B00006690G|1.0|I cant believe that someone could go around and rap things like that. Im not dissing Eminem. But I really dont like this cd. The stuff he sings about is just way to horrible and violent. I would suggest KJ-52 instead of Em. He sounds just like Eminem just without the violent lyrics.
B00007LL7O|4.0|This is a great disc.  The musician's and the production are pretty good.  Timo Kotipelto has a good voice, but when he sings really high, it sounds like crap; very forced and tight.  Other than that, he sings great.  Tolkki does a good job on the guitar, but I wish he would do a little more.  The instrumental song shows that he can definitely play, but I feel that he could have let loose a little more. I wish Johansson would have done alittle more as well.  I really like track 2.  It starts out with a really heavy in-your-face riff.  The background choir-type vocals really add to the tune.  &quot;Eagleheart&quot; is another good one.  The Elements song is really good as well.  As stated, the instrumental is absolutely killer.  I am quite satisfied with this album, and would recommend this to anyone who likes metal that has some substance to it.  4.5 stars.<br />P.S. - Check out Kotipelto &quot;Waiting for Dawn&quot;.  It Rules!!!
0140277447|1.0|I don't want to believe the american read the book of this kind and believe it easily. I wish they are only want to blame the highly developped country of different race by reading F class book.<br />My parents are chinese too and I know photographs in this book are not true. Most of them were propaganda of communism china to disgrace Japan to unite so many people who speak different languages in their own country. Actually communism china (and North and south Korea) still asks Japan to pay for these fake crimes. Their purpose is to turn Japan to communism country and control highly educated and developped country as they want.<br />I strongly believe this Iris Chang is sponcered by communism china. You will lose intelligence if you believe this book.<br />This book is toooo bad for intelligent people in the united states and will give bad influence to relationship between Japan.
B000059TEP|1.0|At first view, this movie should be looked at as one of the greatest romantic movies of all times. But then it's not.<BR>The movie is about a man who was murdered, then returns as a ghost because he still loved his girlfriend and wanted to catch his killer. If you could ignore the fact that there is no ghost, then perhaps you'll get over the first hurdles of this movie. But if you're one does not believe that there is such a thing as a ghost, then the movie is simply nothing but mindless entertainment.<BR>The director of this movie, it seems, was confused as to whether this movie should be a comedy, a romance or a drama type movie. Because of that, all the elements were incorporated together and that ruined the movie. The humor in the movie was dry, the romance cheesy and the dramatic elements were anything but. As one person wrote, by the middle of the movie, we already knew what would happen next and who the murderer was.<BR>This movie also lacks one other element -- logic. For any logical person who could think critically, this movie should be very painful to watch. Nothing they do in the movie makes any sense. <BR>For those who are thinking about watching this movie as a movie date -- please don't bother. It's a waste of money, fake tears and if you end up liking the movie, your date *if your date is at all smart*, will laugh at you for being superstitious, sophomoric and stupid.
0425098478|5.0|I read this book almost immediately after it was first published more than 20 years ago and recently re-read it, curious to learn how well it has held up over the years. In fact, I hold it in higher regard now than I did before because Blanchard and Johnson focus on certain core principles which (if anything) are more relevant today than ever before. Specifically, they offer an allegory in which they use the metaphor of a single minute to suggest how to set goals, praise achievers, and reprimand non-achievers within a brief period of time. It is probably human nature to over-explain. (How often have you asked someone for the correct time and received an explanation of how a watch works?) I agree with Blanchard and Johnson that much of our precious time is wasted during interaction which is out of focus. We waste others' time. They waste ours. Group meetings are unproductive. One-on-one conversations fail to achieve their desired objectives. We also waste time when thinking about what we do and how we do it, about what others do and how they do it, and about unsatisfactory results when working with others.<br />Blanchard and Johnson draw heavily upon their extensive research in medicine and the behavioral sciences. What they share in this book is organized within 16 brief chapters. In the first, they introduce a \\"bright young man\\" who is searching for an effective manager from whom he can learn how to become one himself. In the last, the young man (who by then had become a One Minute Manager) is about to share with a young women the same \\"gift\\" which he had previously received from others. \\"I will make only one request of you.\\" Blanchard and Johnson make the same request of those who read this book.<br />For whom will The One Minute Manager be most valuable? Good question. My initial response is to recommend it to those who want to increase their organization's productivity and profits as well as their own prosperity. In other words, to almost everyone. In fact, my opinion is that many of them (for whatever reasons) will not be receptive. Why? Perhaps they reject any ideas presented within an allegory. Or perhaps they strongly disagree with Blanchard and Johnson about what can be accomplished in only a minute.<br />I think it is a thoughtful. well-written, immensely practical book. Just as in my review of Spencer Johnson's The One Minute Sales Person I recommended that sales managers provide a copy of it to each new salesperson, I now strongly recommend that management supervisors provide a copy of The One Minute Manager to anyone for whom they become responsible. I also think that senior-level executives would be well-advised to re-read both books from time to time.

B00004RF83|4.0|I'd been meaning to see this film for many years and finally did last year in our local photography museum's theater.  They used the DVD and I was not only very impressed with the film itself, but the quality of the DVD's image projected on the big screen as well.  This was one of those times where I left the theater saying to myself, \\"Now THAT'S how movies should be made!\\"  I feel Leonard Maltin's review is sufficient; I will only add that some of the rocket models (intermingled with scale models of real ones) used to decorate Gen. Scott (Burt Lancaster)'s office and the Senate hearing room looked like cheap props out of bad science fiction movies, but that was only a minor distraction for me.  Lancaster's character was quite frightening, Fredric March made a believable President of the United States, Edmond O'Brien turns in another great character performance (this time as a Senator from Georgia), and the title sequence (reportedly by Saul Bass) coupled with Jerry Goldsmith's score is quite dramatic.  And I found it amusing that Kirk Douglas (Col. Casey) once again crossed swords with George MacReady (Sec'y. Todd) and Richard Anderson (Col. Murdock) as he previously did in \\"[[ASIN:0792841409 Paths of Glory]]!\\"    My only complaint with the DVD is that it did not have more in the way of supplemental features, especially more complete cast information than was provided in the film itself.  I was interested in knowing who other actors in minor roles were since a good many of them are not listed at all (most notably John Houseman as Adm. Barnswell); I ended up having to go to the Internet Movie Database for that.  Other than that (and a few other very minor technical nitpicks in the plot), this is indeed a true classic and I'm proud to have it in my collection.
B00005JMEW|5.0|\\"Kill Bill, vol. 1\\" is an incredibly violent, cartoonishly gorey, and ultimately very watchable film. I won't bore anyone by recounting the plot, as many others have done that ad nauseum. What I will tell you is that I think the movie is extremely entertaining, and that \\"Q and U\\" have created a highly memorable movie character. QT certainly borrows loads of cimematic and stylistic techniques from previous eras and multiple genres... but so what?!?! He is confident enough to create films that will not be confused with any other directors, and much of his borrowing is tongue-in-cheek. IN the end, perhaps the most important question about any moviw where you KNOW there's a second installment is whether or not you'll go see it. In the case of \\"Kill Bill\\", I cannot wait to see volume two.
B000003TAR|5.0|If Nevermind was a teenage angst album made to bob the head to, then In Utero can be called a painful secret shared.  This album sheds tears of blood, and only a fool would pass it off as overrated.  Kurt's sensitivity is extremely acute, and the allusion to his dying in the womb is an ornate example.  Looking back on those sad days, it doesn't surprise me that I didn't appreciate him as I do now.  Kurt was truly ahead of his time, and I am glad to see that kids who were babies at the peak of his fame are deifying his music.  His poignant lyrics pierce the emptiness of our culture in a startling way, and that is precisely why he deserves all the acclaim he has received posthumously.  Of all his albums, this is the deepest.  Buy it; you are buying a perfect specimen of classic rock.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|good songs, good lyrics, this is the best cd i've ever gotten for less then 10 bucks (if only all cd's could be less then 10 bucks). there's other rock soild songs besides \\"are you gonna be my girl\\", actually \\"look what you've done\\" might be my favorite track on the album. their singer's voice is pretty good. get this album and you will not be disapointed, it really is a rock soild debut.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Can you feel the love tonight? The Donster says Darn Right<BR>!(capitals for emphasis people!).  I think the special features with the amazingly sensuous Elton John, the wonderfully effervescent Nathan Lane, and the titillating Whoopi(there's no whoopi on this DVD - pun intended) Goldberg approach the sublime world of cartoons - a world where few cartoonists in their lifetime dare venture.  <br />My partner, Tony Muser, and I, at The Stop the Violence in Cartoons Foundation, find this new special edition to be of a magnificently splendid variety suitable for all ages.  However, I must issue a mild admonition(and this is the reason it gets 4 stars) when I say watch out for certain racy innuendos targeted at an adult audience(eg Simba's comments - you know what I'm sayin) that prove to be of a somewhat debaucherous, and crude I might add, attempt at corrupting our innocent youth of America.
B00004YKUY|5.0|\\"Arrival\\" truly marks the arrival of this new incarnation of Journey.  The band is stronger than ever with the addition of Steve Augeri on lead vocals and Deen Castronovo on drums and back-up vocals.  (Yes, he also sings - and phenominally to boot!)  This album is a must-listen-to from the opening licks of Higher Place to the last drum beat of We Will Meet Again.  Just put the CD in your player and let it play through - no song will disappoint, whether you are a lifelong fan or you have just discovered them!  (Anyone who doubts whether the band can still carry on needs to attend a concert ASAP - they are selling out shows left and right, and for good reason!)  There is no band out there that uses triple meter, minor keys, and harmony the way that Journey does!  Buy Arrival and hear just how terrific the collaboration of these 5 musicians is.  It is difficult to choose any stand-out tunes when they are all great.  With Your Love is a touching and beautiful ballad, perfect for any wedding.  Kiss Me Softly is an incredibly sultry and sexy song, while Loved By You will bring you to tears.  Livin' To Do is a moving testament to really living life.  And the \\"rockin'\\" songs abound, like Higher Place, Nothin' Comes Close, World Gone Wild, I Got a Reason, and the newest classic anthem, (like Wheel in the Sky or Stone in Love) To Be Alive Again.  If you're like me, you will be putting each song on repeat before going to the next because they are all just that good!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The first time I listened to it My stomach dropped and I thought, could it possibly be a bad album!  I thought is was shallow minimalistic and rushed.  but then I ggave it a second listen and a third and by the tenth time it was beautiful.  I forgot that eveything that apc does has to grow and mature and I think I was spoiled by hearing some of the album in advasnce live.  overall I think this abum is more complete than MDN but they are really to diifferent to compare.
0066214122|3.0|I picked up this book with great expectation. Unfortunately, while the idea was great, I did not find the book to be as meticulously written as several other Chrichton's novels. Worse yet, Chrichton let his imagination wandered too far that a story that could have been highly believable turns into another undistinguished, overly imaginative science fiction tale. I found the idea of nanobots becoming renegades and starting to reproduce in the wild possible, if not plausible, in the next decade or so. However, the idea of them taking over human bodies was laughable. It reminded me of a 1980s movie called \\"The Hidden\\" in which an eel-like alien entered human bodies and took control of them. Actually, Julia's mouth-to-mouth introduction of the swarms to David was exactly the same process the alien in \\"The Hidden\\" used to migrate from body to body. <br />Furthermore, there are a few things that I simply found puzzling at the least. 1) Why was Jack brought in? The official (and false) reason was to fix the program. We learned later that it was not true. Yet, nobody (including Jack himself) offered any explanation. Was Jack brought in as a consultant simply because there was no other way to introduce him to the scene? 2) When Jack first saw the swarms formed Ricky's shape outside the factory, he immediately realized that it was the same shape with the one he had seen in Julia's car. Yet he did not ask any question; He did not even wonder about it. 3) The swarms invaded and took over Julia, Ricky, Vince, and Bobby but not the others. No explanation was offered. 4) Crichton made the point of nanobots being a confluence of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and software engineering. Yet, with the exception of Mae, everyone had background in Computer Science. How come there was no expert in the other two fields? <br />There are many other things that were not satisfactorily explained in the book. As usual, Crichton wrote something of an epilogue, but it did not offer much in the way of explanation. In the past, I had immensely enjoyed reading Chricton's books. This one simply failed to match those earlier creations.
0140042520|5.0|This is the most amazing peice of literature I have ever<BR>set eyes on -- a life changer. Please, read this book, you'll feel the same way.
B00000DC4A|5.0|This 1998 Bryan Adams' work is really smooth and the most suitable for those who have loved Bryan since \\"Everything I Do For You\\", #1 hit from Robin Hood soundtrack. Although it does not rock hard as Reckless(1984) or Waking Up The Neighbors(1991), it is one of the finest examples of pure adult rock. And it is smooth as a river, naural as 38-year-old rocker can be like. While Reckless is the hard-edge Bryan to the limit, On A Day Like Today is the softer side to the edge. Both are appeals of Bryan for sure. \\"When You Are Gone\\" and \\"Cloud Number Nine\\" are acoustic pop rock songs George Harrison or Eric Clapton might have liked. \\"C'mon C'mon C'mon\\" is a slow ballad but with dynamic turn from frailty to firmness. Ballads such as \\"Inside Out\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" are remnicent of \\"Everything I Do For You\\" and are really impressive. \\"Getaway\\" is an acoustic rocker yet with trademark hooks of Bryan. \\"Fearless\\" reminds me a bit of Foreigner's \\"Waiting For A Girl Like You\\" at the start, also with Bryan's typical hook. Well, don't worry. Two surprise uptempo rockers as if popped out from Reckless will please you.<br />A must-have for Bryan Adams' fans young or old. It should also appeal to wide range of rock fans who love George Harrison or Eric Clapton.  @
B000089RVR|4.0|With her first great album, you would almost think its too true to get any better, but Dido proves how talented she is with her newest ablum, Life For Rent. Her voice is amazing, so calming, and soultry with exotic sounds. You can just picture a scene in your life, with every track on the cd. Some of my favorites are, White Flag, Stoned, and Sand in my shoes.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|The only reason why this CD doesn't get a full 5 stars is because of one thing...Jack Black decided at the last second to pull Brand New Sin's song &quot;Sad Wings&quot; from the lineup!!  If you're not sure what the song is, it's played in the background(softly) when they go in for the audition..actually, it's right around the time when Jack Black talks alone to the heavier girl, when she's saying how she's afraid no one will like her because she isn't 'petite' (I'm trying to be politically correct here)...anyway, it's a very good song, great guitar work, and wonderful lyrics...buy their self titled CD if you want to here it(no, this isn't a pitch to buy their CD...BUT if you hear the song, you'll understand what I'm talking about)..as far as the rest of the songs on this album go, I have NO complaints whatsoever..a good mix up of actual rock music(The Doors, The Who, Ramones, etc..) ..anyone trying to get a good mix of different genres of rock will get a good sampling on here...however, 'Sad Wings' by Brand New Sin would have made it complete....
B0000AQVCL|5.0|honestly; i think this is the greatest album ever made; its better thant sgt. peppers.  i know that's blasphamous but this album really rocks.  the slower songs seriously remind me of the beatles.  for example, &quot;look what you've done&quot; kinda sounds like let it be.  and &quot;are you gonna be my girl&quot; reminds me of lust for life by the stooges (or was that iggy's solo effort) i absoutely love this album and i'd recomend it to anyone who values classic rock n roll; kicking butt and taking names!
0676973779|1.0|I heard from everywhere and everyone how wonderful this book was and how I had to read it so I did.  Or at least I tried to. I stuck it out about 2/3 of the way before giving up on it (which I don't usually do!).  I just couldn't keep waiting for something to happen.
B00005LLK8|5.0|A story about a boy who finds his dream in an unexpected turn.  Detained after a boxing match, he discovers a ballet class and trades his boxing gloves for a pair of ballet shoes.  Set in the mid 80's in Northern England where his family was entangled with a bedlam strike, he heads off to his classes despite the father's detestation.  The film captured the devastation of an impoverished family of that era.  And the delivery of Jamie Bell's (Billy Elliot) character and ingenious performance utterly depicted a child's vulnerability and rising amongst chaotic fragments in this world.  You can't help but be invigorated by this child's passion.
B000006NPY|5.0|It is the most advangarde modern rock record I've ever heard.<BR>Billy Corgan shows his charm and inteligence again.<BR>When I first bought it ,I could not catch the consept too<BR>much but, I liked its atmosphere.Then it has been one of the<BR> CDs that is turning on my CD player most.<BR>It could be a new start and a brand new page for the band.<BR>They had refreshed themselves in an admirable way<BR>but they are unfortunately scattered after releasing only one<BR> album.<BR>Anyway..<BR>'Pug' is the best song in this record.<BR>Ava Adore ,<BR>Once Upon A Time , <BR>Crestfallen ,<BR>The Tale Of Dusty And Pistol Pete,<BR>Apples+Oranjes ,<BR>Tear,<BR>Daphne Descends  are the other ones that attracts me.<br />Also the booklet is very fantastik too.It worths to buy<BR>even for its cover.
B000002AVF|1.0|She is one of the most overhyped and overrated singers in all of music history.She is mediocre at best and probably does not even write her own lyrics.All of the songs are boring and her squeals annoy the hell out of me.Most of her songs are sampled off of other artists so that shows how original she is.She obviously cant make an album on her own so she collaborates with other people like most rappers out today.I would not recommend this unoriginal music to any fan of real music.DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Yeah well I love this movie.  It is a beautiful mixture of music with plot.  It is a musical with a very fun and very interesting plot intertwined with it.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|Considering that Maynard is a musical genius, I expected more from this album than it delivered.<br />A quick review of the tracks will give you the same impression I got - it was produced in a day.<br />The lyrics on this album hardly compare to the masterpiece that was Mer De Noms. Every song seems to be a replica of the last with the exception of &quot;Weak and Powerless.&quot;<br />&quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; follows the style of Tool right down to the music video, thus making it hard to believe it comes from A Perfect Circle.<br />The rest of the album is a slow, spiraling circle to doom, definitely not music to drive by.<br />Listen to it only if you have insomnia.<br />Even with this said, it's not a bad album, just poorly produced.  I'm sure that if they had given more attention their lyrics and music, it could have been better.<br />Songs worth listening to:  Weak and Powerless, The Noose, and Pet.
B00007BH5C|5.0|after all that has been said. I own two copies of this CD. One for my car, and one for my home. A day without listening to it is like a day without sunshine or air. I can't live without either. It does not hurt that I like Wagner.
B00005JLTN|4.0|While this movie is hit and miss for many people, I did enjoy it more once I saw it a second time and was told to pay attention to particular scenes.  Where this movie falls short is it's subtle dialogue and million-dollar words, that go over the heads of most people.  How many times did you need to rewind to just understand the Architect?<br />Anyhow, this movie is very good upon second viewings.  Where I am dissapointed is it's lack of bonus material.  DVD is supposed to be about the supliments, yet this set falls short.  I really wonder why it was 2 discs when only one was needed.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The first time I watched this, it scared me...the beast scared me. And so I really didn't feel like watching the rest. However...<br />The second time I watched it...it still scared me, but it was a much more pleasing movie. I paid the story more attention and realized a lot of misconceptions I previously had about this movie (e.g. - Maurice got the beast in trouble, Gaston was badly done, prince is ugly, etc.). There was much chemistry between Belle and the Beast. There were very entertaining scenes where the Beast tries to please Belle by acting like a gentleman...you can almost feel the changes in him after Belle nurses his wounds after he saves her from the wolves.<br />I can't rave about it more. It would have been the perfect tale if they hadn't made the Gaston sequences so long, as I really disliked him (this might be the pt. since we are supposed to hate the villains) and I really wish they would make a sequel to it instead of doing short pieces that belong in the middle.<br />And the songs...what can I say?? They're skillfully made and put-together. Paige O'Hara's voice is a delight. All the songs were entertaining, the tunes were catchy. And it all melded into the story perfectly.<br />Overall, it's a heartwarming, tear-jerking Disney classic for the whole family...even the guys!
0345448898|5.0|Philip Pulmans style of writing is absolutly gripping!  It is hard to put these books down, and once you finish them, its hard not to pick them back up and read them again!  (Believe me, I had to go through a 12 step program.  No, Im joking!)  I usually read a lot heavier material, but this is great stuff if you want material just to keep you enthralled, asking \\"What will happen next?!\\"  You definatly have to read all three, or you will not get the full experience.  If you like mystery, action, adventure, questions, answers, supernatural events, and intricate, well woven plots, then you will not regret buying these three books!

B00005JKZU|5.0|Well, I was thoroughly impressed with the artistic treatment of the Fellowship of the Ring, and found only editorial advantage to the screenplay. Peter Jackson's second volume-film makes a somewhat lukewarm book into a roaring movie, and the purist-decried changes to the text serve only to reign in JRRT's sometime excessive verbiage.<br />SPOILER:<br />Purists recoiled (I saw them do so in the theatre) when the unheralded horn blows before the assault on the Hornburg. It is testimony to Mr Jackson that, when the horn sounded, my mind said &quot;Elves!&quot;, and, dammit, I was right, and the plot addition was exactly with the spirit of the story. The Free Peoples come to each other's aid, no matter their ethnic dislikes (was there a moral here?), according to the larger issues at stake. While it might be argued that Mr Jackson has let his romanciers run wild with the attraction between Arwen and Aragorn, it must be remembered that JRRT dealt with this in his appendices, and much would be puzzling to the viewer who has not read the text. The engagement between the Rohirrim and the wolf-riders was logically necessary as JRRT's poetry did not always serve military sense; a spoiling attack by Theoden's force was necessary to allow his people time to reach the Hornburg.<br />This is an excellent movie made out of a weak book, and wholly in the spirit of JRRT's overall work, if deviating from it in some necessarily dramatic details. The Return of the King promises to be a whopper.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|The thing about this CD...if you're expecting &quot;Merde De Noms II&quot; you're going to be disappointed.  Who wants the same stuff twice anyway?  &quot;The Thirteenth Step&quot; is much darker, yet not as heavy as &quot;Merde De Noms&quot;.  It takes a few listens to appreciate, not like MDN which is an instant favorite from the first spin.  Stick with it, you'll be glad you did.
B0000942LT|5.0|This cd is awesome. i like the whole cd but id have to say the first 6 are my fav.'s. i have both the other albums of theirs and they just rock. i seen them in concert in dallas in june 2001 and they were just as good on stage as in there cd. i completely recommend &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; too because to me that was their best album put out. Aaron can sing good slow songs or hard and heavy songs just perfectly. They are definately something people can relate too. i know these cds have helped me deal with some stuff and help me relax when i just want to have fun.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I have always been a fan of Hulk since my childhood , i loved the original<br />TV series plus the comics  , and the photo of the original Hulk<br />was always lingering in my mind , and so it was naturally to be very excited<br />when i have heard the pre news about the Hulk's movie being in pre production<br />, I have waited for the official trailer to appear and after i have seen<br />it i begun to worry about the quality of the CGI creature , and then the<br />movie was released and i have been overwhelmed by the mixed reviews both<br />from Critics and the Audience , which resulted in my enthuasism for the movie<br />a less hotter till i decided to give the movie a visit .<br />With the first moments of the movie i have been totally hooked by the awesome<br />credits rolling and the fast pace of the first fifteen minuets , while we<br />watch the complicated story while unleashing and forming , the story about<br />the biotechnology scientist Bruce (Eric Bana) who is teaming with his ex<br />love interest Betty (Jeniffer Connelly) on a scientific project , but Bruce's<br />past is shady and full of mysteries , his parents has been dead for long<br />time since he was a kid ( or that what he thinks so) and he is having strange<br />nightmares , one day he is exposed to Gamma radiations by accident and this<br />accident unleashes the furious power within him , and the arrival of the<br />mysterious late shift worker in the lab (Nick Nolte) means that his dark<br />past's secrets is about to be unfolded , but he has to face them ,discover<br />his true origin and learns to control his rage .<br />Ang lee has done a very great job in this movie , he is a director which<br />i call is a (poetic director) , that means directing his movies with poetic<br />vision which enhances his view , and adds more haunting sense to the story<br />and to the movie itself , you can't help but admiring his complicated techniques<br />including the usage of multiple views to give the Audience the feeling of<br />the comics , also he tried to balance between the commercial needs of the<br />summer movies , the requirements of the fans and his solid rules as a director<br />with a solid vision .<br />The casting was simply perfect , i remember when i first heard about casting<br />Eric Bana as the Hulk i was worried about his portraying for the superhero<br />, but actually he is very brilliant actor , he really was very convincing<br />in the rage moments which made you feel he is really suffering , and for<br />Jeniffer Connelly all i can say that she is cute as usual and very emotional<br />actor which gave the movie a sense of tenderness which worked as a contradiction<br />for the ultimate roughness of The Hulk , for Nick Nolte he really surprised<br />me with his performance and he sat a new rules for this kind of roles ( i<br />will not reveal it here).<br />So what actually went wrong with this movie? we all know that he suffered<br />a very large drop in the second week of it's box office's run , i think<br />that was simply because this movie is not a multiplexes crowds pleaser ,<br />Ang Lee directed this movie with a very brilliant approach to the SOUL of<br />the Hulk , because the Hulk character in general is not only about the green<br />giant smashing objects and roaring a scary scream , it's about the human<br />soul , and the continuing  search for every man's true identity within himself<br />, those added a very deep meaning to the movie which was not convenient<br />for the summer's audience , he also focused on the eyes , because as they<br />say that the eye is the mirror of the soul , and in multiple shots we see<br />Bruce staring to himself in the Bathroom's mirror and we a reflection of<br />his true identity in the mirror , his true self which he is trying to discover<br />and learns how to control .<br />For me i had just minor problems with the movie , the plot actually is not<br />simply straightforward , it's inter complicated and unfolds itself during<br />the duration of the movie , but in the unfolding process there were some<br />loose ends that were not connected properly , also i found the CGI Effects<br />is satisfactory except for a few scenes (in the desert) which needed rendering<br />, and the last glitch i found is the almost unsatisfactory last 10 minuets<br />which needed some more work .<br />The Hulk is one of the best summer's blockbusters to come in the past few<br />years , it's rare to see a blockbuster which respects the minds of it's<br />audience , and gives them something with a value , something with a Heart<br />and a Soul .ding process there were some<BR>loose ends that were not connected properly , also i found the CGI Effects<BR>is satisfactory except for a few scenes (in the desert) which needed rendering<BR>, and the last glitch i found is the almost unsatisfactory last 10 minuets<BR>which needed some more work . <br />The Hulk is one of the best summer's blockbusters to come in the past few<BR>years , it's rare to see a blockbuster which respects the minds of it's<BR>audience , and gives them something with a value , something with a Heart<BR>and a Soul .
B00009W0WM|5.0|Cassablanca just might be the perfect movie, I'd give it 6 stars.  This movie is the perfect guys romance, Bergman is the only woman he's only loved, she hurt him and now he doesn't give a damn about anything.  What guy has gone threw that.  The movie has wonderful acting, when Bogart enters the room and hears &quot;As Times Go By&quot; playing, he runs up to the piano and when he see Bogart you can see in his face that he's just had his guts ripped out and stuffed back in, that's acting.  I cant' imagine a better movie.

Just because you've heard non-pop music, you aren't God, you don't have to be such snobs. You don't have to be too good for it if it sounds nice, which it does, whether or not you admit it. I mean, one of the many who complain about repetitiveness cited sigur ros as music you should listen to instead! Sigur ros is frickin' amazing, but, less repetitive? So don't hate. It doesn't make you better to call what other like crap.<br />In short, don't write the 5 star, &quot;it changed my life&quot; review, because it doesn't do anybody any good, and you probably aren't exactly a musical expert, either. And don't wirite the one star, &quot;the world is coming to an end if this guy is called a musician review&quot; just because you think you're the world's foremost expert on good music.

B00005JLTN|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded has so many cool special effects and intense scenes that it makes you want to see EVERYTHING you can at once. I have the full screen version but went over to my friends house to watch it widescreen. This difference was VERY noticeable. For instance, I saw so much more in the Freeway scene that i had before. The amount of cars and true feel of how fast they were going was unbelieveable. For all of those like me who always choose Full over Wide, trust me, Widescreen is a MUCH better idea for this movie.
B00005JM02|5.0|.. and you're looking for more, make sure you check out \\"Captain Jon Explores the Ocean\\"(also available from Amazon) a great way to continue the journey of a young marine biologist.

B000000H3W|4.0|Before the 1993 masterpiece \\"Chaos A.D.\\" Sepultura shook the death metal community with two albums, first in 1989 with \\"Beneath the Remains\\" and two years later with this solid effort. With \\"Arise\\", Sepultura took their death metal songwriting into a conclusion; the only way to really progress was to create an alternative metal masterpiece in the form of \\"Chaos A.D.\\" ... and then they went to invent nu-metal with Korn... it is forgiven...
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I am impressed that David Bowie unlike say, the Rolling Stones, continues to make new music.  He is an inventive artist who constantly explores and expands his artistic range.  His cover of \\"Pablo Picasso\\" is a wonderful take on a classic puckish song, and Bowie makes this material his own.  He also shows off great wit, as in \\"Reality,\\" the most honest and accurate musical description ever about receiving fellatio.  The only disappointment, and a major one, is the final track.  For the life of me, I can't tell if he intended to make this cheesy song as an ironic comment on Disco, a rock genre some find cheesy. If it's ironic, it doesn't work; I wish he hadn't bothered to include the song.<BR> It is refreshing to listen to an artist who is not content to rest on his laurels or retread his \\"signature\\" sound.  We should thank him for pushing his music in new directions. For David Bowie, his \\"signature sound\\" has always been his voice and his ambitious musical arrangements covering a variety of styles.     He resides permanently on my Genius List.
B00006AW2G|5.0|It's heavy.  It's real raw.  And it rocks like there was no tomorrow.  Literally.  This is the sound of the Stones rocking at the brink of the 70s, before they completely descended into decadence, and before their music got progressively worse (with the exception of 1978's &quot;Some Girls&quot;, which heralded the return of some lightheartedness in the Stones' music.)  Here, the band is contemplating the \\"no road ahead\\" sign and the various directions they could take, and most are exceedingly dark, making this the most harrowing Stones album I've ever heard.  Musically, nothing is held back, nothing seems forced, and the album sounds as if it were recorded completely live in the studio.  While that may not be the case entirely, the important thing is that it sounds that way.  Everything is evenly spaced in this album so that the darkness does not completely overwhelm the glimmers of hope and hints of humor.  &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Man&quot; collectively shoot out the lights, while &quot;Country Honk&quot; and &quot;Live With Me&quot; tell twisted jokes to lighten the mood, and the title track and &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; light a couple of (small) candles.  And &quot;Love in Vain&quot; and &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; are a couple of the best heartache songs penned by Mick and Keith.  This is a great album front-to-back.  The standout, if I can choose one, would have to be &quot;Monkey Man&quot;.  The instrumental break in the middle, with the beautiful slide guitars, is just choice.
B00004RHZU|2.0|I bought her album Misundaztood and was so upbeat about getting this album to go with it.  What a disappointment!  This album is very different with a very monotonous rap background music on almost every song.  This album is not near as good, nor shows the talent of this entertainer that she demonstrated on other CD.  If you like Rap music that is about the same in every song with just a change of words but with the same background, you might want to spend money on this album.  Otherwise, buy Misundaztood, skip this one, and hope for better things on her next release.
B00006JSS8|5.0|So, what can I say about a Stevie Greatest Hits CD? In some ways a lot but in many others, not much. Stevie, like the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye and Prince, just has too much to offer to fit in one disk. This definately does include most of his hits but an artist like Stevie is so much more than just the hits. He's about taking chances and busting down doors and barriers. The album includes ballads like Overjoyed which is for sure one of his best and one of the best written in the last 2 decades but yet it doesn't (or can't because of space) include You and I, All Is Fair In Love or the great Lately. It includes social/political songs like Superstition, Higher Ground and Living for The City but can't include Evil, Big Brother, He's Mistra Know It All or the amazing Apartheid (It's Wrong). How about the best lost love song ever, Maybe Your Baby, from Talking Book? For the casual listener or for a beginner to Stevie this is a great disk. If you have to get a greatest hits type of Stevie's work, get this disk. If you can afford better, get At the Close Of A Century. Of course, if you are a real music fan interested in how we got to where we are today in music, and of course where we came from, buy his whole collection. It's an incredible journey well worth the money.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Having thought the DVD was due November 14th for some reason I was very happy to see it a month earlier.  Rushing home I immediately cranked it up on the big screen.  Reloaded continues where the original left off, Neo resigns himself to the role of `the One' but wonders what his purpose in the larger scheme of things is.  With the machines drilling towards Zion, Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the guy from Oz head to the oracle for some last minute wisdom.  Told to get the Key Maker they proceed to rescue him from an old exiled rogue program and attempt to get into the source of the program where Neo will eventually confront the architect of the Matrix.  The second film ratchets up the effects, taking advantage of advances in computer graphics since the original debuted; to stunning results.  The highway scene is one of the, if not THE most maniacally amazing car chase put to film, making the Blues Brothers pile ups pale in comparison [granted, different technologies].  It is so engrossing I find myself just going back to that chapter in the DVD and watching it in awe over and over.  Like LOTR: Twin Towers, this second installment in a trilogy does not lag like many before it.  It builds on the original mythos and expands the character set somewhat.  Further cerebral philosophical games are played when Neo confronts the Architect and learns about the history of the Matrix and his place in it.  Beyond that we glimpse yet another potential layer of the Matrix being peeled back at the very end, setting up the third installment, Matrix Revolutions nicely.  This is a marvelous sci-fi action flick with an excellent back story, highly recommended.
B000025XKM|5.0|With these stunning and sparse 11 songs (clocking in at a mere half hour), Nick Drake showed us that it really is all about the economy.  Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" is an exercise in doing the most with what you have.  There's just an acoustic guitar, a single piano overdub (on the standout title track, which you may remember from a VW Cabriolet ad a few years ago), and a lone, lonely voice.  While there is some filler here, the beautifully aching lyrics and incredibly talented fingerstyle guitar work more than makes up for it.  You can't buy this kind of inspiration, although you can buy the antidepressants that would keep you alive along enough to put the inspiration on tape.  Drake passed away two years later, in what may have been an accidental sleeping pill overdose or a suicide.  He suffered from depression and other mental frailties, in part due to lack of commercial success.  His three albums (see also 1969's \\"Five Leaves Left\\" and 1970's \\"Bryter Layter\\") were not well received at the time, although they were certainly accessible and arguably superior to anything his contemporaries were putting out in the England folk/rock scene.  By the time he recorded \\"Pink Moon\\", he had no backing band and had turned away from an industry that he felt had likewise already turned from him - so much so that he recorded here with his back to the engineer, facing a wall.  This album speaks so much louder than the hush of its instrumentation.  Some have called it his suicide note, but I prefer to call it pure genius and a masterpiece of simplicity.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A, more than any other work by Radiohead, seems to be the most loved and hated of their albums. On this album, radiohead have gone in a much more electronic, abstract and digitally processed direction, and so it is easy to see why people either love it or hate it. The album is very well produced, and there can be seen at every turn many electronic influences (an obvious one is autechre) as well as the good old radiohead we know and love. <br />There seems to be only two types of reviews on this album - glowing praise and luke warm, even venemous responses. Rather than provide yet another of the former reviews, I will attempt to answer some of this albums detractors. <br />Broadly, the bad reviews of this album can be grouped into two types. Those done by people who just didn't click with the album, who recognise it's quality but just can't quite get into it's (sometimes quite absract) sound, and those who give it one star and sound like a collective of Thom Yorke's disgruntled ex-girlfriends or something equally as bad.<br />The first type of reviewers typically give the album ~3 stars, and this is quite understandable. If approaching radiohead from a rock background, then this new direction for radiohead must indeed be quite bewildering, and just sound like an annoying collection of different noises all jammed randomly together in some places. Many people who listen to radiohead have their background in electronic music and rock such as myself, and so this album is not such a very hard leap to get into, particularly if some of the more abstract electronica (ie. autechre and the like) is where you come from. That is not to say this album sounds a great deal like autechre, but the influences are definately there. There is not much one can do if you have listened to this album at least a few times through and still don't like it. You just may not like this type of music, which is not the fault of the album or you. Try out their earlier stuff if you haven't already.<br />For the second type of reviewer, which give the album one star and call it sh*&amp;, please nobody pay attention to them. For example, one reviewer complains that Kylie Minogue isn't on the album, and then goes on tho say that Radiohead are overrated, and that Justin Timberlake is modern day saviour of music!!! Now I'm no music snob, but please! Perhaps radiohead are overrated. But this is not the fault of the band or music, it just means that they have burst into popular music as a result of appealling to a wide audience, and now everything they do is hyped so much it's ridiculous. Perhaps Kid A is an intentional backlash against this popularity, an attempt to get back to the relative safety and appeal of not being so mainstream. Many popular bands have done this - nirvana, metallica, etc. etc. It's not uncommon to want to break out of a pigeonhole the public and media have placed you firmly in.<br />Other reviewers, possibly fans of thier earlier works who don't appreciate the change in direction of &quot;their band&quot; say that the music on Kid A is pretentious and self indulgent, whatever the hell that means. They typically start off &quot;I really wanted to like this album, really...&quot;, and then go on to say its the worst thing they've ever heard, and that radiohead have deserted their fans. Seriously, musicians are not there to make music to please their fans. They are there to make their music, and if you happen to like it, then good! If not, don't listen! They don't owe you anything at all. Not a thing!<br />All I'm really trying to say is that don't base your opinion of this album on what others have to say. Give it a try - download it to try it if you want. If you like it, support the band and buy it! If not, get rid of it - no money down and no problems!<br />In all, a misunderstood (I hate using that term referring to music) album, but a good one. Not for everyone, but highly recommended. Try it.
1573229725|5.0|My wife is a big fan of historical anglophile fiction, but when she told me (way too much) about the plot of this book, even though I'm like Mr. Nonfiction guy, I thought, \\"Hey, I think I'd better check this one out.\\" I have not been disappointed - I'm about 400 pages in, and I can't wait to get to 401. Buy this book. Read this book. Tell your friends.<br />I've read a few reviews that say this book is reminscent of Dickensian sorts of things, but I think it's a closer parallel to George Elliott's Middlemarch, to the point where I think it's deliberate, with the stuffy Uncle, the roguish gentleman suitor, etc.<br />Again, check it out. It won't disappoint.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Many people think that this, Van Halen's self-titled debut, is the greatest of their eleven studio albums. A quarter of a century ago, Edward Van Halen caught many listeners' ears with his stunning performance on &quot;Eruption,&quot; a guitar solo that contains, in a minute and forty-two seconds, more talent than many whole albums. But naturally, &quot;Eruption,&quot; being the second track on the album, was by no means its highest point. You will find on this disc (or vinyl or cassette) thirty-five minutes of some of the most influential rock 'n' roll of the 20th century. The album's first single, &quot;You Really Got Me,&quot; which is a cover of the classic 60's song, is also a classic itself. Everyone remembers the opening guitar on &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love.&quot; And who can forget the &quot;Ohhhhh, ohhhhh-oh, Jamie's cryin'&quot; chorus? &quot;Van Halen&quot; is the perfect album for collectors, and it's gotten even better since Warner Bros. remastered it (as well as the other five VH albums of the David Lee Roth era).
B0000A118M|5.0|By 1964, Coltrane had achieved a technical mastery of the saxophone that was light years ahead of his peers, and here that talent meets at a crossroads with Coltrane's soul on its journey towards enlightenment.  This is the product of that meeting.  And whatever enlightenment is to you, I think you'll hear it in volumes here.  It's one long piece, split into four tracks with the titles &quot;Acknowledgement&quot;, &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Pursuance&quot;, and &quot;Psalm&quot;.  The message is overtly spiritual - reference Coltrane's poem by the same name - and the beautiful thing about music without words is that it can deliver the message panoramically to anyone of any spiritual persuasion.  Only the most sullen atheist wouldn't feel moved by what's happening in this album.  There are passages of quiet reverence juxtaposed with furious bursts of atonal epiphany.  The first and last tracks are the standouts as they are the most memorable - the first for its sophistication in stating the theme, the last for its sheer emotion.  There's even a mystery saxophone overdub in the closing seconds of the album; no one's claimed definitive knowledge of how exactly it got into the final mix.  Put it on the platter, and you'll always find yourself rewarded and moved when the last note ends.  It's that deep.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|I was just wondering if anyone could help me find the name of this song. It was in the movie for a short little time. It was when they were in class and it was on the commercial and I knows it's not Sunshine of Your Love. Anyone know what it is?
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is perhaps the most funny and enjoyable film there is.  The screenwriter/actors do a great job interacting with 20th century Earth, which will leave you laughing constantly.  Nimoy again does an outstanding job directing this film.  All the actors give a great performance as do the guest actors/extras.      The special features delve into the evolution of the script and how they wanted to make a lighter Star Trek film after having dealt so seriously with life and death.  They accomplished their goal admirably.      Star Trek IV remains the highest grossing Star Trek film and upon watching it you will know why.  This is the best Star Trek film for those who may not know a lot about Star Trek but enjoy a good movie.  I guarantee you will enjoy this movie.  Live Long and Prosper!
0385504209|5.0|Look in the dictionary under the definition of great writing; this book is it.
B000002P5R|5.0|This is a compilation of the best tracks of Jimi's post-Experience years.  Many of the tracks were originally featured on several posthumous albums released in the early 70s, including &quot;Cry of Love&quot; and the &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot; soundtrack, among others.  The tracks here were all digitally remastered so the mix quality is far clearer than the originals.  Jimi's playing easily reached its zenith here.  His voice is confident and clear, and his guitar work continues its advanced up a path that guitar players and others are still trying to fully understand and emulate.  Lyrically, many of the songs are far more political than what had come before.  For example, &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Izabella&quot;, and &quot;Earth Blues&quot; make &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot; seem tame.  And the ballads feel more mature.  In fact, I found &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Drifting&quot; to be remarkably superior to everyone's usual favorite, &quot;Little Wing&quot;.  The rhythm section, by the way, puts the Experience to shame, and it's good to hear Jimi finally playing with musicians that were his equals (or nearly so) on their respective instruments.  This makes for a great driving album and has been an inspiration to me on the guitar, even if I only know about 4.39 % of what he's doing with those six strings and all those effect pedals.  The standout track is &quot;Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)&quot;.  While it's not the most musically challenging track, it carries a certain significance with me, with its references to alien visitation and the fact that it's the only Hendrix tune I can actually play decently.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Hey I just wanted to know what that song was called in the movie. It was short and played for only a little bit. It was in the commercial and I know its not Sunshine of your Love. Anyone know what it is?
B0000AUHOH|5.0|Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is a good film with a great deal of fun and action but also provides great character moments and drama.  Out of all the TOS films this one best represents the relationship the actors/characters have.  You can't help but love them.      William Shatner's Star Trek directorial debut is great, though this film has been critisized by many for its story and visual effects.  Personally I feel the story is very good.  The effects are good but you can tell the vfx supervisors did not try to top what had been done in the previous four films.  All in all they did the best they could considering that when Star Trek V was being made Hollywood was in the middle of a writer's strike and the low budget Shatner was given which forced him to cut corners.      The special features are packed full of goodies that will keep you entertained and give you a better picture of the problems faced while filming this movie.  Also, there is a feature on how the original ending of the movie would have looked like if they had had more money to work with.      This is a very good Special Edition that will entartain for hours.  Adventure and Imagination Will Meet at the Final Frontier!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Ms. Badu has yet to disappoint me. Her music is never without it's surprises and thomping beats. She is one of the few artist I will purchase with out hearing a few tracks first. I love her lyrical style and musical mixes.

B00006RU5B|3.0|So the three instrument-playing guys in Rage Against the Machine lose their vocalist (good), hook up with The Voice from Soundgarden (good), and dump the political stance (also good).<br />What's left? Well, the band knows how to play, and they still know how to steal from older rock bands. (They shamelessly snatched a few Zeppelin riffs on the old Rage albums.) They know how to write the songs they'll use in concert to blow the roof off, and they made sure there was a hit single or two.<br />But it turns out that the best thing they have is Chris Cornell's lyrics. It's refreshing to hear this band play without an agenda, and to hear Chris Cornell shred his vocal cords again. What's he signing about? Well, on Show Me How to Live, he might be singing about Frankenstein's monster. Or maybe religion. Either way, it's interesting.<br />The down side is, this is a boring album. There are two great tracks: Cochise and Exploder. The rest is . . . very professional. It's recorded too clean, it's nothing you haven't heard a hundred times before, and it's generic.<br />But there's always the next album. Both Soundgarden and Rage started off with weak albums. Rage didn't get quirky until the second CD (Evil Empire, still their best) and Soundgarden wasn't anything special until Badmotorfinger. Let's hope they continue.
B000002OCP|5.0|Well, of course this isn't pure blues - nor was it meant to be.  This is, however, Muddy Waters.  The great thing about being able to play and sing like Muddy Waters did, is that you get to experiment, regardless of the reasons why.  This is a really good album that shows the great scope of Muddy Waters' talent and Marshall Chess' imagination.  Kick back, relax and enjoy.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|If you liked the music from the movie its all here in great quality and some extras to. The music style is a range between classical western and kung-fu goodness. I would advise any Kill Bill fan to buy it and start listening to the beats.
0312319517|2.0|A weak, half-hearted novel from a writer capable of much more.  Character has never been Forsyth's strong suit, but in Avenger he has hardly bothered with it.  Synopsis:  An ex-tunnel rat from Vietnam is now a &quot;lawyer by day and a bounty-hunter by night&quot;, motivated apparently by the death of his daughter and wife.  He hires out to very well-heeled people who have been wronged and cannot get justice the usual way, to bring back whoever has wronged them and hand the low-life over to the authorities.  This protag is completely unbelievable, as is the villain, a 100% evil Serb who has fled his homeland after the end of the war there, taking a billion dollars with him and setting up a Dr. No-style fortress off the coast of South America.  Ian Fleming did it better than this.  Forsyth's usual familiarity with technology and with the various intelligence and security organizations of the world is pretty weak here, if not absent.  A pathetic example of resting on one's laurels.
B000001EUP|3.0|This is the Scorpions' Off the Wall. When Michael Jackson hit his peak with Thriller, it was interesting to go back and hear the previous album. When the Scorpions hit their peak with Love at First Sting, you could go back and hear this, the album in which they were clearly trying to figure out how to reach the largest possible audience.<br />On Blackout, even the missteps are pretty good. You Give Me All I Need and No One Like You are prototype power ballads with a little too much power. That makes them more interesting than anything on Love at First Sting. And songs like Blackout and Now! are a lot of fun --- garage versions of Rock You Like a Hurricane.<br />It helps that this album sounds so good remastered. It's really tight, but too old to be as slick as anything produced today. And they didn't throw in any extra tracks; I just want the original album, sounding good but without weak bonus tracks.
B000088E6D|3.0|In this age of popstars, idols and celebrity worship, the art of singing usually seems to have been forgotten. Marketing, personality, and looks are all nowadays quite openly looked upon as the most important aspects of an artist courting popularity. Michael Buble has all these (looks, big label, big managers, big producers, etc.), but the amazing thing is... his voice and delivery are pure class. This kind of authoritative but unhistrionic, stand-and-deliver, conversationally-toned singing hasn't been in fashion, or even heard, for years.<br />There are beautiful echoes of Jack Jones, Frank Sinatra and Mel Torme all the way through this album. Does anyone remember Jack Jones? Most of the songs, singing, and production from this collection would sound quite at home on some of Jack Jones' terribly unfashionable 70s albums (which, by the way are not available on CD - now may be the time to release them, someone!).<br />The song selection here is sometimes overly conservative and bland, or sometimes even kitsch (&quot;Crazy Little Thing&quot;), but the voice usually compensates for any mediocrities in songwriting and orchestration. George Michael and Barry Gibb are good songwriter choices - maybe Michael Buble should do more of these kinds of songs in this kind of setting? Some of the swing stuff may be overly blatantly Sinatra-influenced, but it's impeccably done.<br />I'm very much looking forward to hearing more from this guy...
1577311523|5.0|This book is one of the best on enlightenment I have ever read! It not only explains the state of enlightenment and the process involved, but also explains how we can approach this state. This book is easy to understand and a pleasure to read. As Toru Sato convincingly shows us in his book, \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" it is impossible to reach a state of enlightenment while we are \\"trying\\" to become enlightened. However this book still eloquently shows us that living in the moment is the essence of enlightenment and what that really means. If you are ready for this next step, the ideas in this book will resonate in your heart. If you are interested in enlightenment, definitely read these books!
B0000C7PQK|3.0|This the latest offering by Michael Cretu's ENIGMA. This one goes completely far and wide from previous releases. The whole sound structure to the compsitions are don't hold true to the origin of what made Enigma. There are many New Age bands that have forever tried to emulate Enigma, but none have come close to get the Gregorian chants and the grandness of them. This one just does not hold true to any of the past releases. It s understandable that people try to experiment with different styles, but to move completely away from your formula that made you who you are. Case in point, you can't have Iron Maiden singing N'sync songs and you can't have Enigma try other over the top styles without a big crash in mind.<br />The album is not all that bad. Some of the compsitions are heartfelt, which is a surprise in an album without much of an identity. The choice of music is what you would expect from the now defunct Robert Miles. I don't know if the group will release another album, but you just know that it will definitely be much better sounding than this one.<br />The vocals leave something to desire. Cretu sings some of them, which I still cannot understand. Can someone, please tell him that we would like to hear the lusty French accented girl rather than his screech? In all, the mix between vocals and music is not bad, but they have to lose their vocalists.<br />In all, not a bad album, but still leaves you wanting more. It creates this void that you would expect can be filled only with an authentically sounding Enigma album. Personally, two stars from the CDs design and one for the album itself.
B000002H4C|2.0|There are only four good songs on this album:<br />Heavy Metal by Sammy Hagar<BR>Heavy Metal by Don Felder<BR>Radar Rider by Riggs<br />Okay, three songs. I was going to add Blue Oyster Cult's 'Veteran of the Psychic Wars' or Black Sabbath's 'The Mob Rules,' but they just aren't in the same class as the three listed above.<br />And the rest of it? Well, Cheap Trick is always entertaining but never amazing. The songs by lesser-known bands are okay. Journey's 'Open Arms' is completely out of place. So is Stevie Nicks.<br />You have to admire the wide range of songs here, but the top three outshine the rest. (And there's something funny about the fact that the two best songs on the Heavy Metal soundtrack are BOTH called Heavy Metal. Maybe the producers should have given each band or musician that requirement: &quot;The song has to be called Heavy Metal.&quot;)
0380002930|5.0|Without being long winded, Watership Down is hands down my favorite book of all time.
B00004RF9I|5.0|This film is more important than ever now, considering the corporate usurpation almost all of our media. The film is loaded with poweful performances. Watch it. It will change the way you view things.
B00005JLTN|3.0|I can't tell you how eagerly I anticipated this movie and saw it on Midnight the night before its release.  Frankly, I was initially disappointed because I was expecting something else than the film delivered.  Then I decided that I should give it one more chance... and actually liked it.  Those long periods of dialogue (which many have complained about) actually add a great deal to the movie and offer a discussion of power and the interrelationship between man and machine which is unmatched by other &quot;Hollywood&quot; films.<br />So why the three stars???  My main beef is with the DVD extras (why not include a commentary).  The picture and sound presentation are excellent but the second disc is mainly full of self-promotional material which does not help the viewer understand the construction of the movie anymore than watching the preview.  My only thought is that the Brothers are planning to release a special edition with both films in a single package. Anyways, I think I am going to save my money in hope of that happening.
B0000256VK|1.0|I see that everyone is going ga ga over this album like it is great.  It is not great.  Are you kidding?<br />The first song, &quot;More Than This&quot;, is such an obvios redux of The Spinettes &quot;3, 4 and More&quot;.  Whilst &quot;The Main Thing&quot; is obviously (I think I misspelled &quot;obvious&quot; in the first sentence.  Oops!) a ripoff of &quot;The Main Thing&quot; by Robbie Terrel, same lyrics too.<br />And, call me &quot;Wacky&quot;, but &quot;Avalon&quot; and &quot;India&quot; seem a little too reminiscent of &quot;Avalon&quot; and &quot;My India&quot; by Fantastic (when real diva Simina sang for them).  <br />I'm pretty sure of this stuff anyway.  I know I've al least heard these songs before somewhere.<br />What is this?  These guys get the glory from doing some uncredited remakes (I think)?  Huh?  That's horrible.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Not a review really, but anyone having concerns about the aspect ratio should read the following from dvdfile.com:<br />\\"Rounding out today's news are the full specs for Paramount Home Entertainment's highly anticipated new special edition of the Sergio Leone classic Once Upon a Time in the West, due to hit stores on November 18th. NEWLY RESTORED IN 2.35:1 ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN and Dolby Digital 5.1\\"<br />I've personally never known DVDfile.com to be wrong about this sort of thing, so anyone worried<BR>should relax.
B00009W0WM|5.0|There's very little to add to wtdk's review below, but I must add my vote to the list of those who are wowed by the quality of this 2-disc set.  I still experience that &quot;gee-whiz&quot; feeling when I see the best of these restorations, and this is without question one of the best.  It's as if I had been watching this movie through a dirty window for years, and WB came along and didn't bother to clean the window, but busted it out entirely.  The black and white is so clean and so crisp that it's possible to appreciate the line and shadow and pattern to a degree that could not be done before, unless one had the good fortune to see it sixty years ago.<br />While the outtakes and deleted scenes are pretty esoteric (film scraps really rather than anything of genuine interest; too bad they didn't save their fluffs), the documentaries, one of which I'd seen before, are excellent and a great addition to the disk.  Having Bacall around is a plus, and a rarity.  Most of the people involved in these classic films just aren't around anymore, and finding someone to talk about them in anything other than an academic way is going to be increasingly difficult.<br />A great movie and a great restoration.  Here's to Warners!!

B00004W52U|5.0|This album really is sav. at first it sounded like a bunch of yelling collaborated with a bunch of great pinapple hard core jamming but i can't stop singing and boppin along to the beat. This is the GREAT band that breeded with genius to make rancid...but operation ivy is far better..less polished and without lars fredericksen. but i love him too. i would highly suggest getting this album or strippin it off the internet. :)<BR>oh and lint will have my children
B00005NWLO|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out and I've always loved these songs and these performances.  The deluxe edition, with remixes from the original 2&quot; tapes, brings out the sound beautifully...with one exception.  Billy Powell, on piano/keyboards, is way too far down in the mix.  When he's soloing, the piano should be in your face, but instead it's at the same volume level as the guitars.  The original version of this album had a better mix, but not the same sound quality.<br />Too bad the mixing guy, Kevin Elson, wasn't paying attention to the original mixes - or he doesn't like Billy Powell's playing.  I may have to pick up the 1996 remaster to supplement this one.
B000002LGW|5.0|I immediately went out and bought this CD set after a friend let me view the 101 Video.<br />Gahan's ultra sexy vocals are always a pleasure to listen to. But his oh so apparent energy and enthusiasm on this live CD set heightens the listening pleasure all the more. It's impossible so sit still while listening to it; it'll have you dancing in the aisles. These CDs (especially CD2) never leave my CD player!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|'Requiem for a Dream' is a movie I've seen many times... never with the same person. I wanted to share this experience with as many friends as possible. <br />Every reaction was different. Some were speechless, some cried, some were depressed, but they were all shaken. As for me, it hurt me. The level of uneasiness created by the movie is impossible to describe. The characters find themselves slipping down a seemingly endless slope. You ache for them, you cry for them.<br />A brilliant movie that you will not soon forget.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|In the realms of entertainment and pure intrigue The Matrix Reloaded is a movie that most do not &quot;get&quot;, but once you &quot;free your mind&quot; you'll be able to see the full scope of the movie.  Delving into the realms of philosophy and religion, while appealing to low, middle and high brow the Brothers captivate the mind, all the while rivetting action sequences that break the confines of reality absolutely dazzle the viewers.<br />Keep an open mind and don't just watch the movie . . . participate!
B0000C9V3T|3.0|I'd like to start of by saying, this movie is probably one of the best 'revenge' movies i've seen in a long long time, can't wait until vol.2<br />Now for the soundtrack, it's great, but the problem is, some of the tracks that can be so amazing are ruined by the lyrics that over power them. So I'm gonna seperate it into 4 sections to describe my feelings towards each track.<br />1, 2, 11, 13. they are all decent, I was expecting them to have lyrics since they did in the movie. 13 is my fav out of those four tracks.<br />6, 10. What? These tracks have no need for lyrics, so why put have them??? Now since the lyrics are they're to ruin the wonderful instrumental music that it could of once been, these tracks are HORRIBLE! WHY WHY WHY WHY!!!!!!!! Please don't do this on the next soundtrack, i want another track 10 to be without lyrics, so I can have some nice fighting music....music to exercise too, instead I have to put up with some horrible singer, singing horrible lyrics! And for  6...., as soon as you think the man speaking is about to break out a decent rap...nope...just ruins it even more, while in the end, the easy way out would of been... no over voices at all!<br />3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14. These are all awesome experimental instrumental tracks that give out a mood for each of it's own. These seven tracks make this cd worth the 15-20.99 dollars you have to spend to get it. specially  8 and 9!<br />5, 15, 16, 17, 18-22. Yes there are a few secret 10 second sample tracks near the end. All and all, I don't mind these, atleast they're not inbetween every other track or so like the soundtrack to &quot;Once Upon a time in Mexico&quot;, which to me, just ruins the mood of the cd. So the count-down begins to see who's gonna be the first DJ to take these sample tracks from this cd and try to make them fit well with their cheesy club-mix-set.<br />All in all. This soundtrack is worth the money just for the few good tracks that werent ruined by cheesy lyrics. Hopefully theVol.2 soundtrack wont be the same.<br />later
0714834491|5.0|I found out about this book of all places while channel surfing one gloomy day. A TV show was doing a profile on the author, his creative process and his book. I was hooked. They showed some of its pages and I special ordered it the next day. That was 2 years ago and every time I've picked it up since, it never fails to awe and inspire. I love so many things about it: its simple yet highly styled layout, the hand drawn graphics, the author's graphical experiments, the quotations (there must be at least a thousand) and the combination of humour and thoughtfulness that permiates the pages. To describe it, I would say it's like a box you kept all your old concert stubs, matchbooks and photographs, keepsakes and anecdotes but that have been organized and displayed and &quot;made sense of&quot;. And this is exactly what the author did in compliling this book.<br />You can read it in the traditional front-to-back way, but my favourite way to approach the book is to just open it at random and start reading - then I usually end up flipping around because parts of the text refer to other parts of text in another section - like little hyperlinks that zoom you to some other connected place. The discovery is seemingly never-ending. <br />So, to you I would say: Treat your brain. Pick up this book and learn what it means to look sideways!
B00008PC2O|5.0|The first \\"Terminator\\" movie from 1984 became, from my point of view, one of the most unlikely sci-fi/ action hybrid classics of all-time. With such a low budget that was allotted into making that movie, the result was a surprisingly incredible experience thanks to James Cameron putting that limited amount of money into excellent use. Parts of that movie though, especially the futuristic scenes have dated rather badly over the years but it still remains a highly innovative movie. 1991's follow-up \\"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\" takes what was great about the first one and builds upon it to create an even better sequel. This is no sequel slump by any stretch of the imagination. James Cameron with the benefits of a much higher budget and with the task of creating one of the most highly anticipated sequels ever in the history of movie-making, he pushes the envelopes of sci-fi action thriller making and revolutionized special effects by creating some of the most awesome special effects ever made in action movies even by todays standards. \\"Judgement Day\\" surpasses the first one by a good amount in many ways, even though the first one was awesome in it's own right. It showed a much improved technological breakthrough in movie-making with far more special effects and innovation that results in a movie that still looks fresh and as up to date and even ahead of it's time, much more so than many sci-fi movies that have come ever since then.<br />It all begins many years after the terrifying events of the year 1984 where Sarah Connor survived her ordeal with the emotionless human cyborg. She is now in a mental hospital after being arrested for attempting to blow up a computer factory. John Connor is a very rebellious teenager who's in the care of foster parents. However, John Connor, even if he 'survived' the ordeals of the original Terminator machine, his life is about to take a drastic change when two Terminator machines arrive out of the unknown realm, in the year 1992 in Los Angeles for opposite purposes. One is to kill John Connor, the other to protect him from the vicious machine.  Skynet from the year 2029 send an extremely dangerous human cyborg called the T-1000 who can take the shape of any human being by means of liquid mercury metal, to kill John Connor to prevent him from being able to lead the human resistance against the machines. Just as the machines sent back a T-1000 back in time, the humans also send back another cyborg ironically called \\"The Terminator\\", with almost exactly the same design as the original version that was sent back to kill Sarah Connor many years back.<br />While it may have improved upon the greatness of the 1984 original Terminator movie, \\"Judgement Day\\" carries all of the depth and darkness of that one and takes the storyline to even darker realms. For a relatively long movie of over 2 and a half hours, the darkness and the incredible suspense will keep you holding tight to your seats for the entire time. Few movies in my opinion have such ability to do this but Terminator 2 does just that. In some ways, I would also view this second outing as the opposite or counterpart to the original Terminator movie. The first one had Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the bad guy while this one has him playing the good guy. I kind have to say that Arnold did a better job at playing the evil Terminator machine from the first one but he still does such an excellent job playing the 'good' guy while Robert Patrick delivers a truly chilling role as the menacing liquid metal machine T-1000.  While Arnold Scwarzenegger did some good movies since then, his roles went downhill in my opinion, and fell to rock bottom with the awful \\"Batman & Robin\\" movie and hit speed bump after speed bump before getting back on top with the awesome \\"Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines\\". To me, it's the Terminator movies that have forever made me a fan of many of his movies. Edward Furlong does such an excellent job playing the rebellious John Connor, must I saw even better than Nick Stahl did in the Terminator 3 movie, no offense to Stahl, he did good but Furlong did better. Linda Hamilton improves her character Sarah Connor, by turning her in a mean woman fighter, with massive attitude. In some ways, Sarah Connor rivals Ripley from \\"Aliens\\" as the best woman fighter character in any movie I've ever seen. With the help of the extraordinary directing of James Cameron, dark and powerful script, and from the excellent cast, \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" was one of the few movies that got all of the justice that it deserves. This is one of the best movies of 1991 and even now, it still has all of the punch it had when it was released. No other action movie, except for \\"T3\\" has toyed with darkness, fun, action, and depth the way that \\"Judgement Day\\" did.<br />I don't know how they did it but they created what I would consider one of the best movie sequels ever in the history of movies. A good number of sequels fall flat on their faces against their original counterparts but not \\"T2: Judgement Day\\". This one surpasses the first one. Go and get this movie. I don't really feel like commenting on the presumably numerous editions released these past couple of years. I just would like to say that you should get this movie. I just wanted to comment on the movie itself. I went through the sad event of having to toss out the VHS edition because it got damaged from being worn out. This is definitely one of the best movies ever made and I must even go the distance to say that this movie trilogy is up there with Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, and Indiana Jones as my favorite movie trilogy. I cannot explain enough of how much I love these three Terminator movies with this review. Just go and buy the dam movie.Connor, must I saw even better than Nick Stahl did in the Terminator 3 movie, no offense to Stahl, he did good but Furlong did better.

B000002ADT|4.0|This is a good album, no question about it.  Some of the reviews seem a bit hyperbolic to me, but don't let that turn you off.  I agree with one of the prior reviewers that the second cut of Flamenco Sketches doesn't add much to the CD.  My two favorite cuts were So What and All Blues.  Straight-ahead jazz.
B000002H97|4.0|'Metallica' was the first Metallica album to really split the fans.Since, 'St.Anger' has done it,probably to a bigger extent.But the Black Album is still an excellent album, and is full of different musical styles rather than just mainly heavy and full-blown thrash metal.'Metallica' is the album which turned Metallica to the world, and the world to Metallica.It's also the album where Metallica started to realise their full songwriting potential.While 'Master of Puppets' was pure brilliance, it was all similar-style writing, but more diverse tracks are found on 'Metallica'.This is probably most obvious on 'Nothing Else Matters', their first full ballad.They'd hinted at it before, with 'Fade to Black' and 'Welcome Home(Sanitarium)', but never fully gone through with it.Ironically, it's one of the weaker tracks here.<br />As with previous albums, Metallica had always managed to get away with filler songs because the songs had always fitted into the set well,and this is true on this album too, but too a bigger extent, in fact, to an extent where the frayed edges starts to show.'Enter Sandman' is as big a noise as ever, and a fantastic opening track,but is followed by 'Sad But True' which is overly long and plods too much, and 'Holier Than Thou' which is a decent speedy song.The opening 3 tracks bode fairly well for the rest of the album though, and things go uphill with the surprisingly good 'The Unforgiven', which sounds good with the backing orchestra,and is fairly reminiscent of the aformentioned 'Fade to Black'.'Wherever I May Roam' is also very good, and is a particular fans favourite.Then 'Don't Tread on Me' and 'Through the Never' crop up, which on first few listens sound fairly weak, but these 2 are real growers.Track 8 is 'Nothing Else Matters' and the album hits a high point with 'Of Wolf and Man' and 'The God That Failed',the standout tracks.Heavy as f*** and of a slower pacing with some intuitive soloing, they are both excellent.Then the album dips badly with 'My Friend of Misery', which is torrid and boring, but thuds to a fantastic conclusion with 'The Struggle Within'.<br />Hetfield's rhythm guitar is brilliant on this album, though the bass is nothing special, as with the drums.Surprisingly unspectacular though is Hammet's solos.This time around the solos are pretty awful, though an honourable mention goes to 'Enter Sandman' and 'The God That Failed', because, to be fair the solos here are superb, but if you disagree just liten to the chronic mash of lead guitar on 'Don't Tread on Me'.So there, the album of 1991(including Nirvana's 'Nevermind'),where Metallica didn't sell out, they just fell into the trap of the 'mainstream rock' tag.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I am a fan of ATDI and when I first heard TMV's Tremulant EP I was not too impressed.  Don't get me wrong, I was not expecting ATDI when I was listening to it. I was expecting a little more from the experimental EP. After hearing this though, I was completely amazed. They definetly have &quot;thrown a monkeywrench in their own system.&quot;  This album is amazing, TMV is amazing. Buy this now.
B000002H2H|3.0|'Ride The Lightening' isn't as good as 'Master of Puppets','S&amp;M','Kill 'em All','Metallica' or 'St.Anger'.It doesn't have the energy on most of the songs, and too much is too average.So, needless to say, i am royally p***** of at the hype that surrounds it.'Trapped under Ice' and 'Fight Fire With Fire'are okay and 'Creeping Death' is excellent, but 'For Whom The Bell Tolls, and 'The Call of the Ktulu' sound much better with an orchestra(in S&amp;M),'Fade to Black' is overrated, and not a patch on 'Welcome Home (Sanatarium)' (on 'Master of Puppets'), and 'Escape' is awful, as is the title track, which sounds like it's a jam session.Add to this it's only 8 tracks long, and while the masterpiece that followed this in 1986 was only 8 tracks long too,'Ride the Lightning' sounds short,wheras 'Master of Puppets' doesn't.Not that it's completley bad, because there is some good listening to be had here, and I'm not denying that the album made a decent contribution to the metal scene at that time, and also nowadays, but don't believe the 'best Metallica album ever' hype, because it's not true.That's all.
B00003CXAA|5.0|When Francis Ford Coppola returned to direct &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; his mission was to create a sequel as compelling, involving, interesting, and downright exhilarating as the original. Everyone told him it was impossible. He made the impossible possible.<br />This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as &quot;sequel&quot; is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a sequel - a blockbuster blast that returns the characters from the original in a new storyline. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is something more. It is more of a chapter than a sequel. A continuation, if you will. The same characters are all here - at least those who survived the original, that is - but when I call it a &quot;sequel,&quot; it strikes the wrong cord. It is as if both films are one, divided into two separate chapters. When you read a novel, and someone asks you if you liked it, you don't say, &quot;Yeah, but I liked the first chapter better than the second and so on.&quot; You either like or dislike the novel. Think of &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; as a chapter in a novel; it is a true continuation, nothing more.<br />This film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. <br />As I write this review, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; holds the no. 3 spot on the IMDb's list of the top 250 films of all time. \\"The Godfather\\" is currently taking the no. 1 spot. I guess people still do have good taste in film - but the fact that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; made it to the no. 1 spot for close to a month startles me just a bit. Are filmgoers so cinematically naive nowadays to vote every blockbuster they see a &quot;10&quot;?<br />Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).<br />Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did. Among his other film contributions was Martin Scorsese's classic tale of loneliness, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;; Michael Simino's tale of friendship, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;; Martin Scorsese's fact-based drama &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta; Sergio Leone's true epic &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;; as Al Capone in &quot;The Untouchables&quot;; and Martin Scorsese's true story of gangsters in &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;<br />Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the terrific script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, with wonderful direction, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of a film at the wrong time; Coppola inserts his flashbacks here like clockwork, ticking back and forth and coming into play right when the audience either (a) wants them or (b) does not want them, which is always the best thing. Sometimes an audience wants a flashback if they're getting tired of a scene - sometimes they don't want a flashback because they are involved in a current story and are hooked on the screen. Coppola inserts his flashbacks at just the right moments. If he feels a scene is too long, he gets a flashback going. If he feels the current story could benefit from a flashback that is reminiscent of the current matters, he inserts one. And if the audience is at the height of tension, awaiting the end of a scene, he will insert a flashback and the audience will soon forget about the scene they were involved in minutes ago - until the flashback is over and the &quot;present time&quot; scene starts up again. Then they are really at attention.<br />It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. &quot;The Godfather&quot; was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. Oh boy, there I go again with that word, &quot;sequel.&quot; I really hate that word. Continuation: That's a word I really have to keep in mind next time I'm coughing up a review on a sequel. Argh, there I go again. D'oh!
B000002H33|5.0|It says it all in the title.<br />Not only is 1986's 'Master of Puppets' one of the best albums ever,it also happens to be the single most influential metal album ever.Anyone who fails to be moved in some way on hearing this is a liar.'Master of Puppets' is Metallica's most seminal work and an absolute masterpiece.Opener 'Battery' is brilliantly crafted thrash song which ebbs and swells richly,and is probably the best thing Metallica have ever put their name to, as with 'Master of Puppets', a spellbinding song about drug addiction.It is here that Hetfield's knack of carving an epic rhythm out comes to the fore, and the solo is phenomenal.All good things come with a bad thing though and in this case 'The Thing That Should Not Be' is disgraceful.On another Metallica album this would be a good song(as proved by 'S&amp;M')but alongside the other 7 tracks it comes across as rubbish.Such a Shame.<BR>'Welcome Home(Sanitarium)','Disposable Heroes' and 'Leper Messiah' make up the bulk of the album and all 3 are brilliant.Not as good as the opening 2, but 'Welcome Home(Sanitarium)' pisses all over 'Fade to Black'.'Orion' is good, not as good as 'Call of the Ktulu' but still brilliantly listenable and 'Damage Inc.' is a great thrash finale,reminiscent of 'Kill'em All'.'Master of Puppets' is the milestone metal bands are judged by, and anyone worth their salt should pick up a copy NOW.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|&quot;You wanna play rough? Say hello to my little friend!&quot;<BR>- Tony Montana, a.k.a. Scarface.<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; chronicles the life of a Cuban refugee who came to America in May, 1980, when Fidel Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Bay, Cuba, with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their families back in America. As the movie's opening intro explains, it soon became obvious that Castro was doing little more than sending the scum of Cuba to America in hopes of ridding his domain of filth. Of the 125,000 Cubans who came to America that year, an estimated 25,000 had criminal backgrounds.<br />Antonio Montana (Al Pacino) was one of those criminals who came to America from Cuba and successfully set up his own kingdom of cocaine, wealth and greed. We see him in the first few minutes of the film being interviewed by police regarding his background. He's asked about the scar that stretches from his eyebrow down to his cheek. He gives all the right responses and is sent off to a quarantine camp along with his long-time friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). After murdering a man in the camp as a favor for a Mafia kingpin named Frank (Robert Loggia), the two buddies are given green cards and released from the camp. Eventually they land another job for Frank. Their wealth and greed starts to grow.<br />Every time we see Tony Montana he is a bit better off. Better clothes, better means of transportation. He visits his mother at her small little home in Miami to show off his fortune. He tries to give her money but she says that people like him give bad names to the hard-working Cubans (like herself) who have come to America and work legitimately for a living.<br />But Tony's sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) doesn't think so. She adores her brother and accepts 1,000 dollars from him as a present. But it backfires--soon Gina is hanging out in the fancy clubs and getting felt up by men. Tony sees this and anger lights up in his eyes like fire.This happens twice in the movie. Both times are in regards to his sister. Manny explains to Gina that Tony doesn't want her to turn out like him because she is the only thing pure left in his life.<br />Soon Tony is so powerful that he overthrows Frank and marries his girl (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes so depressed that she sleeps all day and snorts all night. &quot;Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that, Tony.&quot;<br />&quot;Scarface&quot; is based on Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same title that starred Paul Muni as the title character. Both movies were accused of being overly violent. Both characters from the films had a strange infatuation with their sisters. Both characters fell in love with their boss' girlfriend. But the similarities end there. The 1932 version was not about a Cuban, it was not about an empire built on drugs, and it was not very similar by any account. Al Pacino said that Muni's performance inspired him to become Tony Montana. And while some critics accuse Pacino's performance of being over the top and too flamboyant, think about this: His character is a Cuban refugee who came to America and killed people for a living before taking over an empire built on drugs and crime. He lives in fear of not only others but himself. As his life proceeds he snorts cocaine so often that he can barely think. Then he has the underlying guilt of his life bearing down on his shoulders. How over the top would you act?<br />The movie was written by Oliver Stone, who completed a final draft after many attempts by other writers, including one attempt by the director of the movie, Brian DePalma, who claims that his script was not going the way he wanted it to go. Stone made the story his, and succeeds on almost all levels of storytelling. Back when &quot;Scarface&quot; was released drugs, violence and big blowouts at the end of a movie were hardly run-o'-the-mill. The 160 + F-words in the film were not exactly standard, either. But the story is involving and sad. It is the best film about the American Dream ever made. Tony Montana wanted the world, and when he finally got what he wanted, he realized that even the world was not enough. Perhaps the best and most important scene in &quot;Scarface&quot; is the subtlest one--when Tony is sitting at his desk after he has killed Manny. He has everything he ever dreamed about and wanted in front of him--drugs, drinks, a luxurious mansion, a beautiful wife. Yet it isn't enough for him. And the reason he sits there in silence for so long is because it is then that he realizes happiness does not come from material wealth, but from the inside. And, to be honest, Tony Montana doesn't really have much of a soul inside. And he knows it. <br />&quot;Scarface&quot; opens with its own theme song and closes with it, as well. It is more than just coincidence--when it is played in the beginning of the movie, it is during the time of Mariel Bay, and hope is everywhere for criminals. When it plays at the end, we have witnessed the American Dream from start to finish. When it plays at the end, there is no hope left for anyone.
B00000IO4J|4.0|very impressed with how this movie played out. there where some annoyinh scenes and then there where some gorey and cool scenes. without a doubt Josh Hartnett(Hollywood Homicide) stands out in this picture as the rebel kid and Elijah Wood(The ICe Storm) is great as the geeky kid. the alien at the end is really a let down though thats not the reason I liked the movie, I liked it on the premise of paranoia and the chills you get when one of those alien things comes out of the peoples ears. Jordana Brewster, CleaDuvall, Jon Stewart, Shawn Hastosy, Robert Patrick, Famke Janssen, Usher Raymond, BeBe Neuwirth, Salma Hayek and others also star
B00007BH5C|5.0|I was literally stunned by this soundtrack! I fell in love with the first one, and wasn't sure if the second would live up to its predecessor...I was wrong to wonder! It is miles beyond incredible! The spooky nature of &quot;Passage of the Marshes&quot; really gives off that eerie feel, the same feeling in the movie. All of the songs make you feel like you are right in Middle-Earth. &quot;Evenstar&quot; is a beautifully woven piece. It really depicts the picture of Arwen in your mind. My personal favourites? &quot;Helm's Deep&quot; - You can clearly hear moments of triumph and moments of loss in this piece; &quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot; - includes the main &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; theme, and the beautifully written theme of Rohan. John Williams does an incredible job of placing this magnificent film on a disc. Better than anything I have ever heard. I highly recommend this soundtrack.

Pacino partners up with Hilary Swank(Boys Dont Cry) and Nicky Katt(Suburbia), and they go to a place by the lake where they might find the killer, surley enough some nicely done suspense is put in there as Pacino shoots his partner on accident and kills him and he covers it up and the real killer saw it, who just happens to be Mr. Robin Williams(who is creepy and mind-blowing). its a great game between them and it ends with Williams shooting Pacino and then Pacino shotgun blasts Williams and then Pacino confesses to Swank about everything as she holds him on that walkway. if your renting movies or buying, rent or buy this one or Williams other creepy movie One Hour Photo
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack is the most incredible thing I have ever heard! It truly represents the movie better than any other soundtrack I've heard. The music is what makes the movie so fascinating! Howard Shore delivers a truly marvelous and inspirational work of art. In &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, it begins the CD with an eerie feeling as the history of the Ring is introduced. It is followed with &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, taken straight from the book (great for us die-hard Lord of the Rings fans!) It truly sounds like hobbits when you are listening to this song. We follow the journey of the young hobbits through songs like &quot;The Black Rider&quot; and &quot;At The Sign Of The Prancing Pony&quot;, where they are joined by Aragorn, or Strider. The music perfectly depicts their journey to Rivendell, where we hear the beaitufully woven theme for Aragorn and Arwen's tragic love story. The fellowship is now made up of nine as they set out for Mordor. This is where one of my favourites comes in - &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot;. An easily disregarded piece, this song uses the main Hobbit theme in the bass voices with crunching notes played by the upper voices. It sounds very cool, but just when you feel like you can't take any more of the dissonant chords, it is resolved beautifully into a solo trumpet playing the main Lord of the Rings theme. We then follow the fellowship into Moria, and we hear the tragic fall of Gandalf in &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot;. You nearly weep for Gandalf as you hear the music depict his fall. The remaining eight travel to Lothlorien, where we hear several dimensions of stringed instruments and fascinating choir harmonies. The disc comes to a close with my absolute favourite piece, &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;. I have never heard a young boy sing so high so beautifully. This song goes on for about seven minutes, and near the end, Edward Ross enters the piece with the beautiful melodies and lyrics of &quot;In Dreams&quot;, written by Shore and Fran Walsh. This tragic yet peaceful song fades flawlessly into Enya's own piece, &quot;May It Be&quot;. This haunting finish is a perfect way to end off this masterpiece. This soundtrack depicts every emotion known, and even those we have not yet experienced. Howard Shore brings to life the playful nature of Hobbits, the beauty and wisdom of Elves, and the greed of Man. It is flawless and can be described as perfection. I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who has fallen in love with Peter Jackson's magnificent film.
B00005QATY|5.0|likable movie by the Cohen brothers(Fargo, Raising Arizona and Blood Simple). Clooney gives a hilarious performance as Everett with all that hair gel stuff. sorta a version of The Odyssey with John Goodman as The one eyed bible saleman/KKK member. the part where Hunter trys to tell Clooneys kids he was hit by a train is the highlight. for fans of any of the stars or fans of the director
B00006ZCFH|5.0|WELL, WELL, WELL. WHAT HAVE WE HERE? YET AGAIN, IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE WAS PAYING ATTENTION WHEN OUR GODFATHERS AND GODMOTHERS OF SOUL WERE GIVING CLASS WAY BACK IN THE &quot;REAL-MUSIC&quot; DAYS. THEY USED THEIR LYRICS, MUCH AS MISS BADU DOES, TO INFORM, ENTERTAIN, ENCHANT, AND MELLOW US. THEIR BEATS LYRICALLY LIFTED US OFF OF OUR SEATS AND DANCED US ACROSS THE ROOM. PLEASE ADVANCE TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS, MS. BADU.<br />I LOVE REVIEWS LIKE THIS. THIS ONE IS REAL SIMPLE. THIS IS GREAT MUSIC. NEVER MIND WHAT YOU MAY THINK IT'S NOT, REDIRECT YOUR FOCUS TO SIMPLY WHAT IT IS: GREAT MUSIC, FUN LISTENING, AND AN EXTREMELY REFRESHING LOG IN THE TRUE-ARTIST FIRE. THE ADDITIONS OF MR. KRAVITZ, THE QUEEN, MY GIRL ANGIE STONE, JAZZ PRINCE HARGROVE, AND OTHERS ARE JUST ICING ON A VERY DELICIOUSLY-BAKED CAKE.<br />YOU GO, GIRL!
0767819594|4.0|this was naughty because of Sarah Michelle Gellar(Buffy) who stold the movie and my virginity, well. Ryan Phillippe is great in the lead as the step-brother to Gellar and they make a pact, if he gets Reese Witherspoon in bed he gets to get Gellar in bed and if Gellar wins and he doesnt she gets his shiny car. the romantic chemistry between Phillippe and Witherspoon work because they are married now and have kids, duh. some hots scenes include that sex scene with Phillippe and Witherspoon, where Gellar gives Phillippe a laprub and that oh so famous kiss with Gellar and Selma Blair.
B00000AFWW|4.0|Between &quot;Live Through This&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, Courtney Love lost her husband, got off heroin, and started a second career as a (surprisingly talented) film actress. &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; sounds a lot like Courtney was appearing at the time: a little cleaner, a little more friendly, but still packed with plenty of edge and unpredictability. Most of the songs are fairly melodic, and the production is filled with glittery little touches here and there. But nothing ever really gets in the way of Courtney's raw, powerful vocals. She still has rage and angst to spare, and her fans wouldn't want her any other way.
B00000269M|5.0|This album is amazing. I enjoy it every time I listen to it.<BR>1. Bad: A great start to this album, great original lyrics, and a catchy tune. The video is great too.<BR>2. The Way You Make Me Feel: Who hasn't heard this one? Amazing writing skills from MJ, catchy tune.<BR>3. Speed Demon: A different sound from MJ. It fits the album, love this one too.<BR>4. Liberian Girl: This video is very entertaining, as well as the song. I like listening to the song, but watching the video makes the song come alive.<BR>5. Just Good Friends: Very poppy song, not bubble gum, though. Stevie Wonder is great in this song, and makes a great team with Michael.<BR>6. Another Part Of Me: Love this song as well! Great energy in this song.<BR>7. Man In The Mirror: Great song. He really puts his heart into singing this song, though he did not write it.<BR>8. I Just Can't Stop loving You: I didn't really noticed this song when I first got his greatest hits and found this song. I skipped over it, but when I listened to it, I found that after the slow entrance, its a great song.<BR>9. Dirty Diana: One of my favorite on this album, and of Michael's career. A more rock type song you'd expect to hear from Michael, but he does great.<BR>10. Smooth Criminal: I love this song, I love the video, they are both brilliant. It would be even better if he didn't allow Alien Ant Farm to butcher it.<BR>11. Leave Me Alone: Not one of my very favorites, but I still like it, humorous video.<br />This album is definately worth you're money. I reccommend it to anyone, fan or not.
B00004X01U|4.0|Of all regular Madonna's albums, &quot;Music&quot; (2000) may well be (and remain for a couple of years) her best. That's not to say it's the best by far. But, beside &quot;True Blue&quot; (the most coherent of her 1980's works), &quot;Music&quot; is the most respresentatively-sounding long-player of the superstar's career. Bridging &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, relying heavily on Hinduism/William Orbit's electronica and the somehow sterile 2003 offering &quot;American Life&quot;, the Music here is eclectic and multi-faceted, marking the start of close cooperation with French dance music guru Mirwais.<br />Starting with the title tune which already can be called a modern classic, the album's first half is steeped in dancing, with beats apparently more timeless than your most common remixes. None of tracks 2-5 are too memorable, which is striking, given the real top quality of what's next.<br />Track number six, vocoder-painted &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;, is deceptively simple, and just like another classic &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, which follows, ends fading out in a fabulous groove. Guy Sigsworth collab &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; starts originally with an authentic sound excerpt from &quot;Cement Garden&quot; movie, which wonderfully fits in the song, another highlight. &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot; is a deep epic electronica, preparing the mood for a calm acoustic closer, &quot;Gone.&quot; The European version also contains a hit single previous to &quot;Music&quot;, the movie remake of Don McLean's &quot;American Pie&quot;.<br />Although &quot;Music&quot; did not score such a wide success as &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, it is less uneven in quality while covering more textures, and at under 50 minutes refreshingly shorter than its 67-minute-long predecessor. &quot;Music&quot; stands out as the most accomplished of the post-1997, updated Madonna.
B00005JLTN|5.0|Cmon guys!  Stop criticizing this movie.  To understand why I say this, you must realize a few things.  First, it is extremely difficult to please a crowd who has seen the original Matrix movie.  The original was a masterpiece, and very hard to top.  Second, this is the second movie in a trilogy.  The second movie in a trilogy, especially a trilogy that is meant to have a beginning (Matrix), middle (Matrix Reloaded), and end (Matrix Revolutions), is usually not as good as either the first or third film, so give it some credit.  Finally, stop questioning Neo's powers.  The entire basis of the Neo concept was the fact that the Matrix is all in your mind.  Once you become self-aware and master of your domain, you can then do whatever your mind desires (i.e. stop 5000 bullets, fly like superman, etc.)  And if you remember, at the end of the original Matrix movie, Neo flew away (at the very end of the movie) yet no one whined and complained.  Now that Neo is flying people don't like it?  Give me a break.  This movie is great, and I'm sure that Matrix Revolutions will wrap up the trilogy and make us think about a broader scope of life.
0385504209|4.0|I read a lot - and this is by far the most interesting book I've read in years.  The action is paced well, the historical information is accurate and the plot stand up well.  There is so much going on and you're thinking about everything that for once the ending really was a surprise.<br />  From a pure literary sense, this book falls down.  The dialogue is clumsy at times and the writing seems forced.  Give it 3/5 as a literary book and record it as the only flaw.  That probably keeps it from being a perfect 5/5 for me overall.<br />  There are people who won't like the subject matter.  I will warn you that it deals with religion and lightly questions a lot of what you &quot;know&quot; is true.  Apparently the author believes a good deal of what he writes, but even a crackpot can tell an entertaining story.  I don't think this book is going to be creating the religious firestorm that other reviews have hacked it for.
1400049628|3.0|When I picked up this book, I thought it would be a laugh-out-loud kind of book, judging from the subject matter and the back blurb. Trust me when I say the funniest parts of the book are condensed onto the back blurb.<br />That doesn't make it a bad book. When I started reading, I got the eerie feeling Mr. Brooks kinda, sorta believes zombies are real. If not, he did a very good job of convincing his readers he thinks they exist. It could be his humor was very subtle, and he intentionally wrote it to be so utterly serious that it crosses the line to utterly silly. Maybe I just missed the line.<br />This is a good book for the die-hard zombie fans. Don't buy it if you're looking for a quick read that will leave you gasping with laughter. But if you want to know how to survive the inevitable Class Four zombie invasion--and how to watch for the precursors leading up to it--you won't mind shilling out $$$ for this book.
630157401X|4.0|...Of a sequel being better than the initial movie of a franchise. \\"Last Crusade\\" finishes, (for the nonce,) the trilogy that started with the wildly overrated \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and was continued by the much more promising \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\". Both sequels are far more entertaining than the original.<br />It's exactly like the \\"Batman\\" franchise....the first one being hyped like crazy as being from the director of a successful previous movie, with the promise of eye-popping special effects and spectacular action, and the succeeding sequels being MUCH better...in fact, offering all the action, humor and thrills that \\"Raiders\\" was purported to have!<br />I was GREATLY disappointed when I first saw \\"Raiders\\" and wondered what all the fuss was about. Then I saw \\"Temple of Doom\\" and I was hooked! \\"Last Crusade\\" continues this new tradition, with the added fillip of having the great Sean Connery playing Indiana's father, Henry.<br />Cinematography is top notch. Comedy is evident in just about every scene, and, as usual, there's a thrill-a-minute action sequence waiting to start just as one finishes. It's obvious that Spielberg, again, didn't so much direct this movie as tell the gaffers where to aim the lights....the hand of Lucas is everywhere. Again..there's the  formula of older hero, younger hero and a feisty love interest. Evil, mystical forces in evidence as the basis for the plot....just like in the Star Wars movies. There are even two HUMAN sidekicks to take the place of droids R2D2 and C3PO....Sullah and Marcus Brody!<br />However, the screenplay offers some very wry dialogue, especially between Indy and his dad...and there is some excellent acting, particularly from Julian Glover and Allison Doody. There are some ingenious scenes involving Connery and Indy BEYOND just the dialogue, too. However, the big disappointment comes at the end, when Indy finally encounters the Knight that guards the Holy Grail. This part looks like it was ripped out of another movie, like \\"Excalibur\\" or \\"Camelot\\", and doesn't quite jibe with the rest of the film. It also kind of drags this otherwise good film back to the childish \\"gee whiz\\" level of the first Indy movie.<br />Indy's brief is to find the Holy Grail for Donovan, played by Glover, since the original archeaologist they hired to find it got lost. This person was Indy's estranged dad, played by Connery. On his way to do the assignment, he runs into Allison Doody, playing Dr. Elsie Schneider, who had worked with his dad on the project. He eventually finds out that SHE'S in league with the Nazis and, after a night together with her, before he finds THAT out, he finds out that his dad has ALSO had her, which makes for some nice Freudian confrontations between the two. After this is revealed...the real hijinx start in earnest!<br />I enjoyed this movie like I've enjoyed no other flick with Spielbuck's name on it...it's so obvious that he wasn't the ONLY name involved, however!<br />Highly recommended!pped out of another movie, like \\"Excalibur\\" or \\"Camelot\\", and doesn't quite jibe with the rest of the film.

B00005OAIE|3.0|Catchy and fun to listen to.<br />But......the similarity of the chord progressions between Mayer's \\"Why Georgia\\" and Dave Matthew's \\"Satelite\\" is disturbing.<br />If you adore Dave Matthews like I do, you'll find \\"Room For Squares\\" irritating.  That may be due to your unconditional love for Dave and inability to accept the notion that many tracks on the record are REALLY good.<br />If you don't like DMB, then don't listen to John Mayer.  (But if you hate DMB because you love John Mayer.......then PLEASE try to rationalize your train of thought.)<br />If you've never listened to DMB before, listen to this CD and you might LOVE it (that is, until you listen to Dave's \\"Live At Luther College\\" CD, in which \\"Room For Squares\\" will quickly be forgotten).

B00009TB5G|5.0|THE TWO TOWERS is a great movie, even if you aren't a Tolkien aficionado, you will enjoy this great piece of cinema history. This is more action oriented than the Fellowship, and this CD contains the extras that you want. If you want to see The Two Towers at its fullest this is the DVD collection you need.<br />I won't go into details about the movie, since almost everybody knows the actors and the plot but if you are a collector this is the DVD to get, this is the expanded version with 40 minutes of footage you didn't see when it was originally released in theaters last year. This movie will raise your spirits toward THE RETURN OF THE KING, later this year in a cinema near you.<br />If you like great and epic movies and the extras don't hesitate and get this DVD you won't regret it.

B000002KD5|4.0|All songs are made wonderful by the omnipresent drumming of Mick Fleetwood and the bass of John McVie, necessary rhythmic components for the quintet that made up the legendary revamped Fleetwood Mac.  The key ingredient was the addition of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.  Such is the first song, &quot;Monday Morning&quot;, with its decent lead guitar, great drumming by Mick Fleetwood.  It describes the degeneration of an affair from Monday morning (&quot;You look so fine&quot;) to Friday (&quot;I got traveling on my mind&quot;), and the crazy cycle that returns back to Monday.  &quot;You only want me when I get over you&quot;, sings Lindsey Buckingham.<br />Christine McVie's sweet &quot;Warm Ways&quot; displays the higher-octave silky warmth she would later bring in on future songs like &quot;You Make Lovin' Fun&quot;, &quot;Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Songbird.&quot;<br />Even before the breakups and bittersweetness that would later emerge in Rumours, in comes the rocking &quot;Blue Letter&quot; made engaging by Lindsey Buckingham's guitar.<br />This song alone is worth buying the album.  It's about a girl who &quot;rings like a bell thru the night/and wouldn't you love to love her.&quot;  &quot;Rhiannon&quot; narrowly missed the Top Ten but was one of three singles that proved that the Mac was a potent force to reckon with.  Although I don't if I'd be interested in someone who &quot;rules her life like a bird in flight.&quot;<br />A moody lover and the effect he has on a woman is the subject of the McVie-sung &quot;Over My Head&quot;.

B000002I2I|5.0|Morrison Hotel (1970) was the fifth Doors studio album, following the jazzy Soft Parade that saw the band break out an orchestra, horns, and due what all bands eventually do: try to over engineer rock tunes.  I think The Soft Parade is a great album, an example of how far a band could go and still pull it off admirably.<br />Morrison Hotel, on the other hand, is a return to good old rock and blues with less on the production and a bit more emotion.  It opens with Roadhouse Blues, one of the best bar songs of all time.  It has a rhythm that can go forever and Morrison does a kind of rock scat man bit (even better live) in the middle.  It also contains the immortal line, `Well, I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer'.<br />Waiting for the Sun is, not surprisingly, a holdover from the album of the same title.  It doesn't sound like it belongs on Morrison Hotel but it's still a good number, with some strong, early Moog work that produces a buzzing rumble.<br />The entire album is diverse, as it goes from the fun, bluesy You Make Me Real, with Ray on electric piano, to the beautiful, somber Indian Summer, a pure Doors song that sounds like it was resurrected from the earliest days.  Peace Frog has a classic riff (one of the few Doors samples in hip hop I could note was when 3rd Bass used the breakdown part in one of their tracks) and Jim's lyrics are spot-on ('Blood on the streets...')  Blue Sunday sounds like a bit of Sinatra in Doors uniform (in a good way).<br />Maggie McGill is a down and dirty bluesy rock number with a playful lyric.  The back to back Ship of Fools and Land Ho! are fun as well.  Ship of Fools made a great live song with Ray's keyboard solo.  The Spy is very cool piano number; Jim's voice lends the lyrics that extra menace ('I know your deepest secret fear').  The entire album is a return to rock, to blues, and it sounds like a strong effort, though it came when the band was trying to put the Miami incident and the aberrations of the Soft Parade behind them and just continue.  It's a stronger effort from Jim Morrison, whose song writing credits made up only half of The Soft Parade.<br />I don't think the Doors made a 'bad' album, but if I had to pick, this is easily one of the best.  Recommended for Doors fans of course (dig deeper than the multiple Greatest Hits packages they have) and classic rock fans.rade behind them and just continue.

B00000J631|4.0|It might not be the best punk compilation (check out the Peace/War double album or the Dischord box-set or the Punk-O-rama series for some alternatives) but its definitely an essentaial one. And not just for minutemen fans either, anyone who likes fast, loud punk should take a look at this.<BR>Obviously, its good for anyone with a short attention span, but some of the songs are good enough for you to put them on 'repeat' and listen to them 14 times. It's got huge variety (blink and Black Flag, GWAR and The Descendents, AFI and Wizo....) so theres gotta be something you'll like. Even if you hate some of it ( I still don't know what to think about the Real McKenzies's track) it'll be over in 24 seconds.<BR>Obviously the huge variety is an incentive to check this out, but theres also a whole lot more quality than you'd expect of an album with 101 songs (99 tracks, ... punk fans......). How many albums do you own that can claim to have 74 great tracks?
B000001ESF|5.0|This album takes the listener through a journey into the future. Side one is the rock opera song &quot;2112&quot; which is based on Ann Rands book &quot;Anthem&quot;.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|There are almost 300 reviews of this album already. I will not describe each song - I never do. I will only say that this is a very worthy addition to the Maiden catalog. The mere fact that this band is still around, proudly waving the METAL flag, is worthy of respect. Like another reviewer said, when listening to an album as good as this, from a band as old as this one, it makes a band like Metallica look so much smaller. When I got this new CD, even though my expectations were low, I was completely blown away. But when I listened to Metallica's new one, even though my expectations were still kind of low, I was almost brought to tears in sheer dissillusionment. This album is proof-positive that you can remain vibrant, powerful, and relevant without completely forsaking your established style. So what if some of the songs have similar structures? So what if they use the same kind of lyrical themes as in albums past? This is CLASSIC METAL, and as such, it obviously follows some guidelines, otherwise, it would be something else. Bear in mind this is a band with more than 2 decades of existence. They are sticking to their guns, and that is admirable, and again, worthy of respect. I wish some other bands took a clue from Maiden or even Slayer - who, even though they've made some changes, still retain their aggression and yes! their anti-religious lyrical themes as if it was still 1982. I don't care! That's WAY BETTER than going into a forced, fake nu-metal or rap-metal direction. As Iron Maiden has beautifully done here...Keep TRUE METAL ALIVE!!
B00009V7RF|4.0|That is the only way to describe the newest CD from the Black Eyed Peas. I have read many of the other users reviews and I was so disturbed by their criticism that I had to weigh in on the topic. The biggest issue I had with the reviews was the criticism over the diversity of the songs - diversity, especial with regards to this CD,  is a good thing. We as music listeners have gotten way too accustom to hearing the same mass produced garbage over and over that we can even recognize a true artist when we hear one. My second issue is the criticism over the song, &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot;...for all those offended, look up the word sometime. And finally, it really is a shame that a band gets criticized for &quot;making music just for money&quot; when in fact they have been making music for years and they are just now getting their just deserves in the form of over exposure.
0385504209|5.0|WOW! If you're in the mood for a few cheap thrills -- this book will certainly provide it. There's not much character development, but the pacing and plotting of the narrative is so tight, it's like a literary equivalent of Raiders of the Lost Ark! I've never been propelled through a novel so quickly in my life! Truly a fun, fast read! Take a moment to enjoy it! Other recent Amazon purchases I enjoyed: Life Of Pi, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I am usually open minded when it comes to music, i saw him play on tv, i think it was jay leno. He seems to know what hes doing with his guitar, but his voice is just plain annoying. I tryed to listen to the whole song, but i couldn't. Changed the channel, went back, changed the channel, and so on. I gave him 2 stars because his guitar playing sounded good. Maybe i'm just not a fan of that kind of music.
0446530891|1.0|I don't understand the rave reviews that have been posted for this book.  I can only assume that they were written by the publisher's employees or friends of Baldacci.  I have read and enjoyed every book he's written, but this one was awful.  It was loaded with characters and possible suspects.  It had a convoluted, confusing, shallow plot, and it alternated telling the story between the main characters.  One of the main characters got kidnapped and the others acted like it was no big deal.  Very little mention of her fate, no drama, no concern.  Very strange.  After reading this book, I would have to recommend that Baldacci stick to &quot;lawyer&quot; books.
B000002UAR|5.0|Listen, even I will admit that this record is a classic.  Contrary to what most people say, not everything the Beatles recorded was perfect or even good.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was pretentious, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was an ambitious failure, and &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was VERY uneven with maybe 4 or 5 good tracks.  But &quot;Revolver&quot; is the album where the Beatles really get their act together with cool tunes like &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; &quot;High Yella Submarine&quot; and George Harrison's &quot;Taxman.&quot;  My only beef with this album is that the Beatles are STILL trying to copy Oasis' sound.  But other than that, this record is really good.  Buy it now!
0393057658|5.0|If, like me, you're one of those hopeless stat geeks who never get tired of &quot;who's better?&quot; discussions, &quot;Moneyball&quot; may well be right up your alley.  Chronicling how the cash-strapped Oakland A's regularly compete with the huge-spending likes of the Red Sox and Yankees, &quot;Moneyball&quot; sets out to demonstrate that how plentiful your resources are isn't as important as how you use them.  In one sense, it's about how A's general manager Billy Beane, himself a washout as a player, manages to build successful teams on a tight budget with a bunch of guys even I haven't heard of.  But in another, deeper sense, the book is about how any enterprise can be improved if it's remade along rational lines.<br />Beane's business plan for the A's rested on a bold premise, namely that much of the traditional &quot;knowledge&quot; accumulated by baseball insiders was, well, b.s..  After all, Beane had tanked in his professional career after being tagged as a can't miss prospect, so how much could scouts know?  Beane's plan, while radical, was also so fiendishly simple it's hard to believe it wasn't more common.  Under Beane, the A's started judging prospects not by how athletic they were, or how good they looked in a uniform, but by how well they had performed in games.  And if that meant hiring a group of Harvard graduates like assistant GM Paul DePodesta to pull names of college players off a computer, so be it.<br />Of course, the A's also faced the problem of money, since their payroll had to be kept at about 40 million dollars, or 15 million less than Alex Rodriguez makes.  The solution?  Treating the team like any other business, Beane and co. used cutting-edge research and technology to break players and stats into parts.  Since they couldn't afford highly desired players, the A's had to figure out what was most important and go after it.  And if the research is to be believed, it's the ability to get on base by any means necessary.  On-base percentage takes on an almost mythical importance in &quot;Moneyball,&quot; with the A's searching relentlessly for guys who could get on base and do it cheaply.<br />It's this aspect of the book that gets the most attention, and quickly becomes the most fascinating.  Lewis emphasizes how the A's front office, with plenty of help from stat guru (but don't call him a statistician)  Bill James, was able to look at numbers and find the underlying truth.  As Lewis makes clear, it's not just looking at numbers that determines a player's value, it's looking at the *right* numbers.  Lewis often draws parallels to the business world, and these comparisons serve to illustrate how one can make a killing with superior knowledge and counterintuitive thinking.  It was strategies derived from the research of stat geeks that enabled the A's to improve their record in 2002 despite losing three of their top players to free agency.<br />Lewis also takes some time out from the analytical stuff to paint a vivid portrait of Beane himself.  Lewis lets us see him plying his craft in the draft room and at the trading desk, demonstrating the shrewdness of a swindler.  He often appears to be playing a different game from his colleagues, which is exactly what Lewis wants us to think.  And we get to see Beane's (sort of) human side while he works out, and stresses out, during games.  His frequent profanity-laced tirades and incessant tobacco chewing may not be too savory, but Beane is clearly just like the rest of us in at least a few ways.<br />Lewis gives us snapshots of some other, secondary characters as well.  There's Paul DePodesta, Billy's Harvard-educated sidekick.  There's Jeremy Brown, the overweight college catcher who was scarcely rated as a prospect despite having set records at Alabama.  There's Scott Hatteberg, who was cast off by the Red Sox but given a new life in Oakland thanks to his ability to get on base.  Finally there's Chad Bradford, the submarine-throwing pitcher who became apremier setup man with an 84-mile-an-hour fastball and a delivery that scraped the mound.  We get to know all of these guys, and why they fit so well into the A's scheme.<br />Lewis also happens to be a pretty damn good storyteller, with a an engaging and uber-readable style.  Bill James said baseball statistics fascinated him because they had the power of language, and Lewis's discussion of this seemingly boring subject demonstrates why.  By framing a book about baseball in the language of business, Lewis makes his story accessible to enthusiasts of both.  Not to mention, the book is worth reading simply for Lewis's brutally hilarious description of Jeremy Giambi's outfield play.  High comedy, friends, high comedy.<br />I don't think &quot;unputdownable&quot; is a word, but if it were it would definitely be applicable to &quot;Moneyball.&quot;  I could even be convinced to say this is the best sports book I've ever read, and I've read some good ones.  You don't necessarily have to agree with the A's strategies to enjoy the book, but you may well find yourself turned into a stat geek by the end.  And for all you dolts out there saying Billy Beane had nothing to do with drafting Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, and Mark Mulder, it's right there on page 39 from a member of the A's scouting department: &quot;Billy made us take Zito.&quot;  So that's one down right there.e a premier setup man with an 84-mile-an-hour fastball and a delivery that scraped the mound.

B00005KAQP|5.0|This has to be one of the most hilarious movie ever!, I remember this from my childhood, and I definetly still enjoy it today!, what a great movie, a lounge singer Dolores Van Cartier hidding in a convent as Sister Mary Clarence hahahaha!, whoo hooo!, who came with this idea, a comedic genious!, all the movie surrounded by 60's music another great fact, this movie is timeless, classic, and a must have in your collection!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Eight dream-like stories that touches on everything from a childhood fantasy about a witnessing a fox wedding in the forest to post-apocalyptic nightmare of mutants and cannibals. Some very powerful stuff but a couple of episodes got too preachy when Mr. Kurosawa is exploring his nuclear-war anxieties. <br />Some of my favorite pieces:<br />The Tunnel: A weary Japanese officer is walking home from a POW camp at the end of WWII. On the road, he comes upon a dark gaping tunnel, from which the ghosts of his dead soldiers emerge and haunt his conscience. It is hard to forget the image and the sound of a platoon of dead soldiers marching with relentless military precision, gradually emerging from the inky depth of the tunnel like bad memories welling up unbidden.<br />Sun Under the Rain: A boy ignores his mother's admonitions to stay in doors on a day when rain is falling on clear sunny sky. He ventures to the woods and witness an odd procession of fox spirits. It may sounds like fairy-tale yet the story takes a disquieting turn. The last images of a rainbow striding across a lush valley are beautiful almost beyond belief, but all that beauty is tempered by the uncertain fate of the little boy. <br />Crows: An art lover step into Van Gogh's paintings. Your eyes will think they died and went to heaven.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Wow! this movie blow me away, I thought first that this movie sux, so I didn't saw it on the Movie Theather, but when I saw on TV, it capture me, and now is on my top 5 movies of all time, Nicole Kidman has such talent, in this movie were a revolutionary writer falls in love for a cortesan you fall in love with the magic of cover rock music and a loving story!, great should have been best movie of the year at the oscars!, great movie, excellent extras in the DVD. buy it!.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|An explosive start to the film which one would expect from such an epic adventure - Trinity bursts onto our screens again (a la &quot;The Matrix&quot; where she is the first main character we see there also)in the usual blaze of digital fury.<BR>The main gist of the film appears to be a link in the trilogy - as &quot;Empire strikes Back &quot; linked the Star wars trilogy and filled in a few gaps and opened a few doors, so does this excellent sequel.  There is, quite obviously and apparently, a huge emphasis on the use of CGI in the film and in part elements that are supposed to look &quot;human doing amazing things&quot; look to slick and too generated - this however i feel adds to the feel of the film as a whole - the fight sequences are perfectly orchestrated as is the awesome freeway chase m- this is after all a computer generated dreamworld so in the sense of the film the imagery should look as it does - it gives the film that extra edge i feel.<BR>There has been a lot of criticism with regards to the &quot;pseudo psychobabble &quot; that is present in much of the dialogue with various characters i.e. the merovingian, the oracle, the Architect in particular - admittedly on first seeing the film at the pictures the emphasis on watching the film is more on the special effects and this convoluted dialogue can seem a bit tedious and pointless - its only on watching the film on dvd a few times and actually digesting this text does it actually make sense and there are explanations for the Matrix itself there and also commentaries on life itself.  Stick with it guys when you do watch the film - it is important to the overall plot and does actually make sense. Again the sequence regarding Zion near the begininning of the film - Zion was mentioned a lot in the first film and it was essential to give the feel of the scale of Zion and its inhabitants - in a high tech world, Zion has an almost lo-tech tribal feel to it - of mankind returning to a time gone past and their most primal instinct fuelled by heavy rhythmic drum beats.<BR>I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Reloaded&quot; from begining to end - the whole concept and the Wachowskis brothers vision , although not a completely original idea (this dystopian future where machine rules man), the concept the have created here is truly fascinating and the whole trilogy will un doubtedly become a cult classic in years to come , if not for the ground breaking cinematography for the concept alone.  As Terminator 2 set a precedent for visual effects, so does the Matrix for its use of almost three dimensional camera shots.  Already we are seeing Matrix &quot;copies&quot; and reviewers commenting on films that are &quot;like the Matrix&quot; - mainly down to the action sequences (&quot;Equilibrium&quot; springs to mind - seeming to emulate the Matrix in both fight sequences and clothing (See Christian Bale in his long dark overcoat ala Neo!)<BR>Favourite character has to be the seemingly indestructible Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaver - &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Priscilla Quuen of the Desert&quot;.)  There is an air of almost sinister campness about him as he spits verbal venom at Neo on more than one occasion.  His loathing of Neo is evident and he displays this with a cool arrogant manner that would make a snake think twice before stiking !<BR>All in all , The Matrix Reloaded is the perfect visual entertainment for the modern 21st age - in this time of technological advances a film like this is fascinating to dissect and digest and the concept may seem hard to follow, but it is truly worth following.  I look forward to &quot;Revolutions&quot; with sustained glee....!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie, well you know the story, an orphan kid that becames a wizard!, parents were killed by a great dark wizard, that for some strange reason let Potter live, this is a classic fantasy that will drive you away to another world, what a pleasure to watch movies like this done, great script and acting, worth it!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The movie was deserving of at least three stars. I agree with the people that say it was horrible in certain ways, but only as much as the people who say it was the best movie they'e ever seen. The Matrix Reloaded is a flick that is meant to key you in on the lack of information from the original Matrix movie. It's only purpose is to help make the Matrix Revolutions kick absolute ass. It wasnt better than the first Matrix, because in this movie, the ENTIRE film was just giving you more and more information, especially the last hour (which I absolutely loved). For poeple like me(who some people call \\"Matrix Philosophers\\" yeah right) the information is really the best part of the movie. Most people thought the original Matrix was such a cool movie because so much was left unexplained, and it was sucessful, because all people could talk about for months after having seen it is what was missing from the movie and what could actually be true. I loved the first one so much because it allowed me to use my imagination and actually excercise my mind trying to figure out the mysteries of the Matrix. The matrix reloaded was almost like an answer key in certain respects, to these \\"Philosophers\\". <BR>Back to the Matrix Releaded... I feel that the special effects were dazzling, absolutely better than any film I have ever seen, and that contributed to the populartiy of the movie, and in my opinion made up for some of the weaker points of the movie. It was eye candy, but I liked it. As I said before, this movie is just filling you in on whatever was left out of the original matrix and telling you what you need to know in order to go into the theatre in three weeks, and acutally understand the matrix revolutions, and this, in part, will make the Matrix Revolutions better than even the original, trust me, its a good buy, and it will be even better once the trilogy is comlete.
B0000640VO|5.0|What a great movie this is! the first time I saw it I was speechless, with a great feeling inside, this movie is about a outsider that has been alienated from society just for circumstances, Amelie likes to help people, but would she find love herself?, oh, this is great!, you should buy it!, it's worth the money, fantasy, suspense, love, all in one, and deliciously talk in french!, I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
076790592X|5.0|I have heard many wonderful things about this book over the last couple of years, but I didn't believe them until I read it for myself.  This story provided me with insight on my own life as well as Morries.  His words were so full of passion and intelligence that there was never a dull moment in this story.  It makes you question life and the quality to which you are living your own life.  It makes you want to be a better person and to do the things that we sometimes forget to do in this busy world.  I enjoyed reading this book and feel that it helped me to realize how many things I have to be thankful for.  I suggest that everyone read this book, it has something in it for everyone.
0920668372|5.0|How anyone could say this book is less than EXCELLENT I have no clue.  It is the sweetest book my son has.  I love reading it to him! It makes me cry every time!<BR>I only wished he enjoyed it as much as I do!
0679736646|2.0|Dick once more plays with his favourite theme, i.e. whether reality is for real. But in Ubik he does so in a heavy way, far from the subtelty one can see in The Man in the High Castle for example. There are literally hundreds if not thousands of books dealing with Reality that are more subtle and smarter than this one. It's not that Dick was uninspired when he wrote it - it's full of energy, has humour as usual. But it just did not work out well that time.<br />Age cannot have been the problem because he was just 7 years older (41) when he wrote Ubik, than when he wrote TMITHC.<br />I am a big fan of Philip K Dick, but Ubik is simply one of his weaker books - most if not all writers have them.
1400031354|4.0|&quot;Mma Ramotswe found it difficult to imagine what it would be like to have no people... Many white people were like that, for some unfathomable reason; they did not seem to want to have people and were happy to be just themselves. How lonely they must be...&quot; (p. 180)<br />If you liked the first Precious Ramotswe book and are after more of the same, this book delivers very much that. It has more of a continuous thread running through it as Precious is preoccupied throughout with a single case, the attempt to discover what happened, ten years ago to an idealistic young American son of a World Bank regional manager and his recently widowed wife who now seeks her assistance. It may be tempting to feel a certain mild regret at the introduction of this western dimension into a fictional world which hitherto had been so thoroughgoingly African. But as complaints go, that is about as minor as they come.<br />If there is a bigger quibble, it is this: a good crime story does two things:  the mystery and suspense of the investigation should grip us and the characters should engage our interests and sympathies. On the first of these desideratum this book is actually a little weak. It's interesting enough to learn what happened to Michael Curtin but that is not what keeps one turning the pages. <br />What does that is McCall Smith's spectacular success with the second desideratum. The main drama is the developing relationship between Precious, who is imperturbably comfortable with the fact that she is, not fat, but \\"traditionally built\\",  and Mr J. L. B. Maketoni, proprietor of Speedy Motors, now her fiancé, profoundly cautious about the financial commitment of buying an engagement ring but who allows himself to be talked into adopting two children with almost no resistance. Then there is Precious' secretary, Mma Makutsi, who is a little fed up of being a secretary with almost nothing to do and wants to be promoted to assistant detective, and Mr Maketoni's dishonest maid whose position Precious threatens at some risk. It's a compelling and joyful short book about people and the importance of having some of your own.
B000069HKH|4.0|This album was done very well. All the songs sound very well my favorites include, &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, &quot;Wait'in on a sunny day&quot;, &quot;Nothing man&quot;, &quot;My city of ruins&quot;, &quot;The Rising&quot;, and &quot;You're missing&quot;.  The reason I liked this album because of the brillance of Bruce's ability to write songs and the way he can incorporate it into songs so beautifully.  This is not his best album but it does offer fast hard rock songs and soft slow songs.  The variety of slow songs and fast songs make the album good it mixes it up.  I gave this 4 out of  5 stars because I felt that this album lacked the old touch that he used to have in his songs.  It is still a must buy album.
B000059RL3|5.0|It seems redundant but how could you posssibly improve on one of the best R&amp;B albums of ALL time? By giving the listener every conceivable aspect of &quot;What's Goin On.&quot; I own the original LP, even had a cassette somewhere, sometime, someplace, the remastered CD and for the last couple of years this deluxe edition! Can you have too much of a good thing? Not when it comes to this disc that captures the essence of the 60's and it's aftermath. The songs are as relevent today as then, maybe more so as there is a sense of urgency  now; it's a cry out and plea for sanity before we leave a necropolis for our children. There are many good reviews of this disc so suffice to say that is one of the ALL time best discs and the proverbial desert album. In recent years I've bought several of my favorite discs in the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; format and I must say  I am always pleased ; this disc is no exception but rather goes furhter and presents an exceptionally beautiful repackaging with lots of extras. For those that like to read about their music the booklet is superb with an essay by Ben Edmonds on the making of &quot;What's Going On&quot; entitled &quot;A Revolution in Sound and Spirit.&quot; There are other writings included by Smokey Robinson and Harry Weinger that are compelling testaments to the greatness of &quot;What's Goin On.&quot; This is the disc I turn to in the best of times and the worst of times; it is the solid rock, like a foundation of hope, a reminder of the past, present and future, it is a song for all seasons, it is &quot;What's Going On.&quot; The music stands on it's own merits  and there is no arguement; it is MY favorite album of all time, nothing is even close. I cannot explain(others have tried and done a good job) the music  and how it  touches you deep within your soul but I can say that this &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; is like a magnificent movie  where you get many different angles of  the same thing. It is a Quentin Tarrantino movie with simultaneous snapshots of the action, freeze frames fast forwarding, all imposing on your consciousness the importance of one man's inspired message  written  thirty plus years ago. The previously unreleased songs, especially those live from the Kennedy Center reveal a sensitive man with many problems of his own but in spite of his own hurdles  he was able to lay down some of the greatest tracks ever recorded.  The many facets of &quot;What's Going On,&quot; packaged in this superb double disc are worth every cent. The Detroit Lp Mix  and the original single versions have a raw edge that show up in the polished version of the LP release and make for some interesting comparisons. Words in a review cannot due justice to this disc; go out and get this disc  and see for yourself why it is the best  or at least my(Smokey Robinson's too) favorite disc of all time. Five+ stars.ie with simultaneous snapshots of the action, freeze frames fast forwarding, all imposing on your consciousness the importance of one man's inspired message  written  thirty plus years ago.

B000059PR5|3.0|&quot;The Day After&quot; was Hollywood's answer to the Reagan Administration's &quot;Evil Empire&quot; drumbeat.  Conflicts in Central America, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the largest arms buildup in the post-war period generated a climate of genuine fear.  With great fanfare and an expensive press campaign, ABC screened &quot;The Day After&quot; over successive nights on prime time television.<br />A number of movies along similar themes were in circulation at the time, and &quot;The Day After&quot; was easily the biggest, but not the best.  Unlike &quot;Testament&quot;, which worked inexorably on character development, &quot;The Day After&quot; blitzed through its two dozen characters in the Before time in short snippets, and as a result, when the Bombs fall (and there are more than one), we don't really know them that well, and as a consequence, it is hard to empathize with the individuals.  Jason Robards is one of the exceptions.<br />The effects are excellent; the scenes of the missiles rising out of the plains are worth the watching, and the airbursts over a crowded highway are equally unmatched.  But for the most part, as the characters one-by-one develop radiation sickness, we see them as specimens and not individual people.  (The British films &quot;Threads&quot; and &quot;The War Game&quot; also suffer this problem).  The low-budget &quot;Testament&quot; with Jane Alexander succeeds where these films failed.<br />Trivia point:  After the last episode, ABC ran a panel discussion which included the original Dr. Strangelove himself, Henry Kissinger. It was delightful to see Dr. K absolutely foaming at the mouth as he denounced the movie as fear-mongering.<br />The film is now hopelessly dated, since it is entirely postulated upon a massive Soviet-US exchange.  Yes, both nations still have thousands of warheads, but our current threats, if equally serious, are not of this magnitude.
B0000DBJDL|5.0|This DVD is incredible. I would recommend it any fan. And Pink Floyd never went \\"bubblegum-mainstream pop\\" in their career. DSOTM was written at a time when David Bowie and T-Rex were taunting their pop fantasys' and PF wrote an amazing album with things we all experience everyday. It had the lyrics, music, and an incredible concept that was shown so incredibly. PF never gave up, sold out, or wrote easily-digestible-by-the-masses ablums. Roger Waters is one of the greatest lyricists' of all time and PF worked unbelievably hard to mold all their work to their vision. At no time did they make music like any other. As far as selling out goes, they never did it. Stanley Kubrick wanted \\"Echoes\\" for 2001: A Space Odyessy and PF told him no. They did do soundtrack albums but they did the whole album from scratch and soon after released those albums under their name. The only people that Roger Waters allows to recreate \\"The Wall\\" in theatrical form is young school children, not even college students. Their albums were never easily-digestible either. The song \\"Pigs (3 different ones)\\" from \\"Animals\\" was about Mary Whitehouse and how she tried to keep their \\"...feelings off the street.\\" PF was never just trying to make a lot of money. They used to buy entire blocks in a town and give all the homes to those who could not afford them. They gave to charity and did a lot to help those who could not help themselves. When Roger Waters played \\"The Wall\\" on the Berlin Wall he donated all profits to charity. Keep in mind that there were four hundred thousand people at that show. PF doesn't try to brag about how they are generous because they are extremely humble, unlike U2. Yes they wrote some songs lamenting the life of being rich pop stars but don't forget they charitable things they did with a lot of that money and just because they are huge rock stars doesn't mean they enjoy it, if you analzye some lyrics you would understand that. Stardom just came with their amazing music, theywould have made it even if no one was listening. (...)
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is unlike any other Anderson movie; really, it's unlike any other other kinda movie either, and a possibly-necessary antidote for those of us who feel more and more alienated by modern life &amp; culture. Since there are already a kazillion reviews of this I won't rehash the plot except to say that it's about one &quot;ordinary&quot; day when all the buried/masked/diverted/denied pain of the world comes welling up, like a dam bursting, refusing to remain unacknowledged any longer. The apocalyptic finale may not make a lick of &quot;sense&quot;, but it feels inevitable and right and it plays perfectly. The ensemble cast is uniformly inspired, and savagely underscores the stupidity of Oscars and Golden Globes....singling out an outstanding performance here is akin to taking apart a perfectly-calibrated Swiss watch in order to praise one particular gear. <br />One further point: you hear a lot about Anderson's &quot;audacity&quot; and &quot;ambition&quot; in discussions of MAGNOLIA. It's true but that ambition has less to do with juggling interlocking subplots, and more to do with the moral caution this movie offers the viewer: that forgiveness is hard but living without it is impossible, and that even pain has beauty in it because it is authentically FELT. The final image - Claudia's uncertain, frazzled, vulnerable but hopeful smile - is one of the most haunting in movie history, one I hope to carry with me forever. God willing.
0783225857|5.0|I bought the book To Kill a Mockingbird upon instinct in sixth grade but did not end up reading the entire thing until ninth.  I LOVED it.  Each and every person should read this book.  Not only is the message right on, but the prose is also really great.  Though some of the reviews on here said that the movie was so untrue to the book, I would have to disagree.  I watched the movie with my mother (my ten year old sister was too young for it) and cried and laughed and suffered through every emotion with Scout and the rest.  Even though I saw the movie right after I finished the novel, I still was on the edge of my seat the whole way through.  You MUST watch this movie or your life will be unfufilled.  I guarantee it.
B0000B3FCX|1.0|A five-minute experiment for those of you who are going to purchase &quot;Long Road&quot; by Nickelback:<br />Open a browser page for &quot;Long Road&quot;, and scroll down to the song titles.  Now, after hitting CTRL+N -which opens a new, identical browser page-, scroll back to the top of the page, click the &quot;Nickelback&quot; link under the &quot;Long Road&quot; Title.  Select via link Nickelback's &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, and scroll down to the song titles.  <br />Now for the enlightening part of the experiment:<br />On the &quot;Long Road&quot; page, select the link for &quot;Someday&quot; and listen to it carefully, no matter how many times you've heard it.  After this, quickly select the &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; link on the &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; page, and listen to it carefully.  Repeat this process a couple more times, if desired (recommended).<br />So what are the results of your analysis?  My findings indicate that the two songs, from consecutive CDs, have<br />1)  NEARLY IDENTICAL DRUM PATTERNS: Not only do both songs have very similar kick drum patterns, but also listen carefully to the drum fills (at 00:06 on &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and 00:11 on &quot;Someday&quot;)...  Are they not very nearly identical?<br />2)  IDENTICAL PACES: There's vitually the same time interval between snare drum hits on both songs.<br />3)  POST-CHORUS DESIGN: Notice that both songs, after exiting the chorus, enters a 4-note, acoustically-based progression.  Also notice that the bottom seems to fall out from both songs following the chorus in the exact same manner.<br />So what are our conclusions?  What could possibly explain this trendy phenomena between these two CDs?  Is it just a cooincidence due to their style?  Or, can this repetition be attributed to consistency; that they just wanted to release a hit from from each CD that sounded the same?  (Now we're getting somewhere...)  <br />Folks, why in the world spend money on a band that has the gall tooffer you a would-be-hit (&quot;Someday&quot;) -blatantly testing your gullibility- that sounds the same as a hit from their last album?  Is it not obvious that &quot;Someday&quot; was not actually 'composed' at all?  Is it not obvious that &quot;Someday&quot; is easily one of the most formulaic songs you've ever heard, and that Nickelback is condescending the bejesus out of you?  <br />Do NOT buy this album.  Though I have focused this review mostly on &quot;Someday&quot;, the remaining songs follow the same, successful, ultra-simple, ultra-catchy, ultra-condescending formula as &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;.  If your not convinced by the experiment above that Nickelback has no respect for you whatsoever, and have not yet heard this CD, then simply continue to check out the samples above from both albums.  (Actually -ahem-, I probably shouldn't mention this, but barnesandnoble.com has samples of all the songs from each album on their website if you need further convincing.)  <br />By the way, don't these guys seem to &quot;feel&quot; a lot in every song, like all the others?  HMMMMMMMMM....
B00006JDVV|3.0|With a whopping $95-million budget, Rob Bowman's sci-fi/fantasy/action/thriller entitled &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; did not even break-even at the box office.  It's weak, apocalyptic story begins in present-day London where construction workers, led by Karen Abercromby (Alice Krige, who played the Borg Queen in the 1996 film &quot;Star Trek VIII: First Contact&quot;), accidentally unearth and awaken a living dragon that begins a rampage of destruction.  This first dragon is quickly joined by thousands more that virtually obliterate the surface of the earth, leaving only a few, beaten remnants of humanity in isolated pockets worldwide.  The story moves twenty years into the future with one of those pockets struggling to survive about 90 kilometers from London.  It is led by Quinn Abercromby (Christian Bale, who is slated to be Batman in the next Batman film for 2005), who as a boy (Ben Thornton), witnessed the unearthing of the first dragon by his mother.  Without warning, a group of possible marauders appears in tanks.  Instead, they are a group of paramilitaries that use rather unorthodox methods to kill dragons.  They are lead by the rough Denton Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey, who played Father Palmer Joss in the 1997 film &quot;Contact&quot;) and have a working helicopter piloted by Alex (Izabella Scorupco, who played Natalya Simonova in the 1995 film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;).<br />Most of the film's large crew worked with special effects, sound effects or visual effects; which probably accounts for most of the film's expenditures.  The film received no Oscar nominations, but was nominated for Best Fantasy Film by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films and did win a Best Visual Effects award from the Catalonian International Film Festival in Sitges, Spain.<br />&quot;Reign of Fire&quot; is the third big-screen film that Rob Bowman has directed. His previous two big-screen films include the 1998 &quot;The X Files&quot; and the 1993 &quot;Airborne,but most of his directorial experience comes from directing 31 episodes of the 1993-2002 TV-series &quot;The X Files&quot;. He is clearly an up and coming big-screen film director that needs to learn how to better balance story and plot with special effects.<br />Overall, I rate &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; with 3 out of 5 stars for being an entertaining film with lots of special effects, but having insufficient substance.  To me, it's not as good as Matthew Robbin's 1981 film &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, but it is certainly much better than Courtney Solomon's 2000 flop &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool may not be my fav band of all time, but there is no denying that they are just damn brilliant. At first I didn't really like them, after listening to Lateralus. Then I realized Aenima was just my speed. Sober is my fav Tool song but this is definitely their best work as an album. The thing about Tool is that they actually have something to say which is one of the main reasons why their music kicks ass!! By the way if you don't like Lateralus very much try this one. Its a heavier and more aggrivated Tool, which I will forever enjoy!
B00005JM0B|1.0|This Film created Cinema History for me :- Being the first film I have ever walked out of half way through. Pathetic Acting & Patheticly Weak dialogue. Not just a simple \\"let down\\" but a degradation of the whole franchise. Cant believe people liked this film!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is a great follow up from their first cd, Hybrid Theory.  Its the kind of cd where it just gets better and better the more you hear it.  The only thing I have bad to say about this album is that its TOO SHORT.  It's only about 40 minutes, but those minutes are all fantastic!  I'm a rock fan, but even the rap songs on the cd I enjoy.  This is definitely a must-buy!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This bears repeated listenings...along with Neil Young's Greendale, Rickie Lee Jone's new Evening of My Best Day, is getting a lot of spin in ye old cd drive.Sonically thrilling, a power house and a not-so -subtle anti-war message throughout.. It captures post 9/11 miasma perfectly and gives voice to the feel of these twilight days. Like the best blues though, it is cathartic...hope someone is hearing &quot;alarm bells&quot; ringing and  that we're not all &quot;not paying attention.&quot;
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I think this is probably Nickelback's best cd.  It doesn't stray too far from their old stuff, but it's definitely a change.  Don't get me wrong, there are songs very much like their old music like &quot;Another Hole in the Head&quot;, but the other songs are kinda harder or faster.  I would have to say the weaker songs on the cd are &quot;Saturday Nights Alright&quot; and &quot;See You at the Show&quot;.  The Rest of the Cd I love!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Overall I have found the Matrix concept to be fascinating and entertaining.  I felt that the first movie in this series was the best new SF movie to come out since GATTACA.  Like most movies it had both good and bad aspects to it.<BR>  Some of the flaws:  The story was not as engaging as the first movie.  To be fair, it would be very difficult to follow up on the first movie.  However, this movie had an unfinished feel to it that left me a little cold.  It served as an excellent lead in for Matrix: Revolutions, but left something to be desired as a stand-alone film.  Additionally, some of the effects were over done, and a bit cheesy.  The use of 'bullet time' was, I felt, over used.  While cool, using so many sequences in each fight scene (esp. Neo vs. the multiple agent Smiths) tended to bog the action down.  Some of the CG work looked plastic and very unrealistic.  As far as characters went, not enough development was done with Trinity.  While Morpheus was developed, he was presented as an almost irrational fanatic.  It made it harder for me to connect with him.<BR>  Positives:  While the action could have been better done, there was plenty of it.  The movie was overall quite a thrill ride.  I felt that the ending was great, and raised many questions that I have enjoyed pondering.  I enjoyed seeing Zion, and I felt that introducing the whole 'Architect' and repeating history story Arc, was great.<BR>  Overall, it was a good movie.  Could have been better, but I will wait until Revolutions, before I condemn the series.
0440238609|4.0|I bought this series because it was recommended for Harry Potter fans and I was having trouble finding books that I really enjoyed after rereading Harry Potter so often. I really didn't want to read another \\"children's\\" book.  This series I really got into and found it hard to put down. I was a little disappointed in the last book. It was still a great book but the story line in the first two was much stronger.
B00003CXDB|5.0|I just love this movie.  It showcases the difference between capitalism (when his boss mentions capital raised for legitmate business) and greed (taking money unfairly by profiting from insider trading.
B00005QJDG|3.0|Unlike a lot of people, when Images &amp; Words came out I thought that James La Brie's vocals were perfect, and the band was perfection in a 100%. Next album, Awake, the same thing and so on...until Once In A Livetime. The live performance of all DT members was awesome on that recording, with the only exception of JLB, he seems so tired and he screams with a completely out-of-control voice sometimes. Well, i'm a big DT fan and thought &quot;OK, the guy was probably running or jumping or whatever&quot; (though i have the video) <br />A couple of years later this album came out... And JLB's voice it's even worse than the other live recordings. And i mean, WORSE i can't stand it. really, i love DT, but JLB live performance it's so un-satisfactory.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|strange and beautiful. <br />the lyrics have an amazingly subtle way of being incredibly deep and moving at times and somewhat confusing and light at other times. Softer emotional tracks, mixed with harder angrier tracks. Maynard's voice is haunting - taking on both masculine and feminine qualities. great use of rhythm, mood, guitar. a perfect balance. nice to hear a softer bass unlike Tool which by the way is totally different music from APC unlike some critics claim. (who hires these music magazine critics?)Tool is harder, sharper, left brain, more masculine... APC is softer, rounder, right brain, more feminine and earthy (the drumming in the package like a heartbeat). <br />If you're looking for an album to bring itself to you, straightforward and apparent - wrong album.<BR>If you're looking for something deeper, something artistic and available to your own interpretation of not only lyrics and music but also sound - you've got it. This band is not looking to reduce itself to please anyone. If you don't agree you may have been too straight while listening.<br />I do agree that it seems as though the album is missing an element, however it far exceeds almost every release this year and it seems more as though this is part one to a two-part compilation. Eager to see what's next.
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok, this album's great. For all TOOL fans this is a perfect album: Great guitar riffs, great lyrics, AWESOME, and i mean AWESOME drumming, and a nice evolution in MJK vocals. <br />It's way more introspective than other Tool albums, so take your time and listen to it carefully in a completely out-of-light room, so you focus only in the music.<br />Tool's music isn't very technical (besides the drumming), and has it's beauty in the simplicity of it, and the emotions that they grow on you. I love bands like Dream Theater, but lyrics like the ones you find in tool's albums aren't so common, and so mmm...ok, let's say it once again: GREAT.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie!  I personally liked it better than the first.  There was more to it than action (as you should freakin know).  Plus  that freeway sequence was just plain awesome!<br />I am awaiting the end of this trillogy.  <BR>Remeber people, this is just a fun ficitonal story.  Not a documentary, so stop analizing it soo much (unless you want to talk about its philosophy), i'mtalking about the complaints on the story and the action.  Grow up and deal with it.
B000002J27|5.0|Who would have thunk it???  PG would leave Genesis, and  after promoting from within, PC would start a new chapter with such a bold outing.  I love Gabriel Genesis, and I love The Lamb, but this is hands down my favorite Genesis album.  Although it is very much a band making a musical statement (We can survive without Peter Gabriel), this and the next album Wind and Wuthering have Tony Banks' fingerprints all over them.  Phil might be the new frontman, but Tony was the silent partner.  Anyway, the music is downright impressive.  It comes on strong with Dance On A Volcano, and then changes gears to a beautiful somewhat Floydian take on Entangled.  Hackett is sublime on the acoustic guitar.  Squonk jumps back into jam mode, while Mad Man Moon slides you back in your seat with your eyes closed.  Robbery, Assult And Battery could go, but after a while, it's cheeky nature gets the best of you.  And trust me, it's cheeky.  Ripples sounds like it's title, and that brings you to the title track.  A Trick Of The Tale is one of the best lyrical songs Genesis ever penned.  Tony's tale of ethnocentricity is stunning and the music adds to it's appeal.  Last but not least is Los Endos.  The End, is an instrumental jam that brings the album clarity, and if you ever get a chance to hear it / see it, live...you will understand what I mean.  If all the Genesis you've ever heard is from the 80's, you desperatey need to go get this.  Furthermore...this is pre synth drums, and Phil rocks the house on his left handed Gretch...
B00005JKN9|4.0|The title should have been called &quot;Gangs of Heaven's Gate&quot; for all the advance media hype (both good and bad) which pretty much soured the milk for this epic.  In truth, although it's not a bad film, it was hyped up to be this pinnacle of Scorcese's achievements, when the reality is, he's been past it for a long time.<br />What does this film have in common with &quot;Casino&quot;and &quot;Bringing Out The Dead&quot;?  It's extremely well-crafted, but lacks a soul.  While you have to give credit to Scorcese for pulling it off, I think the real stars of this film are the supporting actors and the prop/wardrobe department.<br />Say what you like about Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz; neither of them really sinks this film, but it is true that the movie would have benefitted with a bit better casting.  Maybe somebody like Robert Downey Jr. or Johnny Depp instead of Leo.  Diaz could have been replaced by almost anybody, but Scorcese likely hired her for the same reason he put Sharon Stone in Casino; bankability.<br />Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show, and rightfully so; his character has the best lines, the best character development, and you can tell he put 110% into his performance.  Liam Neeson is also good for the short time he's on-screen.  And the set department surely deserved all the accolades they received for re-creating the massive sets of the Five Points.<br />Whether the film is historically accurate or not matters little to those who're in search of entertainment.  There's plenty to be found here, even if you're not a fan of period pieces.  This is a flawed motion picture created from the wisps of an old man's greatness.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Uh, I don't think so, always one naysayer in the crowd I guess.  This album rocks.  $ well spent.
B000001EXR|3.0|If you're going to criticize the band (or at least, penalize their albums) during their 80s pop-metal phase, then you should also deduct points for this foray into past-it grunge/metal.  Kiss was never a metal band, and they'd be the first to tell you that.<br />However, the album contains a few bright spots.  &quot;Jungle&quot; got a considerable amount of airplay, and &quot;Master And Slave&quot; sports an impressive metal pedigree, but you can tell the band isn't very comfortable performing music with the intent of head-banging.<br />To top it all off, the production is just too sterile.  &quot;Revenge&quot; was heavier-sounding without trying half as hard.  Musicianship isn't the problem in the slightest.  But most of the album comes off as a bunch of demos.  Worth a listen, but far from essential.
B00005UK1F|5.0|Holy wow!  What an awesome album  Don't stray away when you hear there is but one song on this album.  that one song measures in at 60:06.  So you are definelty getting your money's work with the time.  This is a wonderful epic, one of the best out there.  Theres metal, singing, screaming, choirs, orcehstrations.  This band has *everything* (excpet suckiness, thank god).  It is your duty as a living (or even dead) being to buy this album.  You will be blown away within the first two minutes.  Definelty one of the top ten best albums in existnace.
B00006GFAB|1.0|That's right, a minimum of stars until the band or the record company (whichever one is truly responsible) stops releasing completely redundant compilations.<br />Yes, the track listing is representitive of the band's career.  Yes, there are younger fans who don't know what to buy.<br />Yes, Gene's house needs an additional wing for all the memorabilia.<br />No, most of us were not born yesterday.<br />Check out &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, &quot;Smashes, Thrashes And Hits&quot;, &quot;Greatest KISS&quot;, &quot;The Originals&quot;... need I say more?
B000088E6D|1.0|Well,  I heard Michael LIVE on the Sharon Osbourne show and I was really impressed after hearing him sing Kissing a Fool.  I bought his CD soon after.<br />Kissing a Fool is the only song on the cd I can say I like and even that wasn't near as good as what I heard on Mrs. O.    In my opinion he doesn't do justice to any of the covers on his cd.   <BR>I was really disappointed with his slow, melancholy, ushy gushy style.   What were supposed to be smoldering, smokey ballads were utterly nauseating!  <br />If you want to hear Frank Sinatra or George Michael buy the originals. <BR>If you get sloppy drunk and want to cry, buy it.<BR>I think if it was packaged with a razor blade he could be charged with assisted suicide, cause it made me want to slash my wrists... (-;<BR>He's no Frank. He's no Lou. He's no George. He's a Bublé
B000001ELP|3.0|Back in the vinyl days, the one thing this album had going for it was artwork; the inner gatefold looked like it belonged in a KISS song, if not  an entire album.  Still and all, an album as far removed from &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;Unmasked&quot; as they are from &quot;Love Gun&quot;, etc.<br />It has its moments; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot; (featuring one of Paul Stanley's best solos), &quot;Dark Light&quot;, and &quot;Escape From The Island&quot;.  But such efforts as &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Mr. Blackwell&quot; sink this concept album before it even has a chance to sink in.<br />It's a mediocre pop album, and a semi-decent rock album.  Does the remastering help matters?  Not really--I've got a 15 year-old cassette version that sounds just as good on a decent deck.  More's the pity, as ex-drummer Eric Carr believed the album only really needed a good mix.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I love Fleetwood Mac and have ever since I heard Don't Stop as a child and danced around the hardwood floors on towels.  For those reasons, I clambered to get this CD for Christmas and haven't stopped listening to it since.  However, the story about me doesn't really matter.  I don't know if any of you people out there have listened intently to it, but don't misjudge the unknowns as failures which we all tend to do.  Go Insane is probably my favorite song on the album and it sounds so much better live.  Take out the CD, dust it off, and listen to Lindsay Buckingham's vocals.  I promise, no regrets.
B0000073PU|4.0|I agree with the previous reviewer, but have to add a little historical background so you understand where the appeal possibly comes from.  Because who doesn't already own &quot;Bollocks?&quot;<br />Prior to (and even after) the release of their one and only proper album, &quot;Spunk&quot; was one of the most highly sought after bootlegs on the market; most of the tunes were performed either live, or else underproduced, with Chris Spedding doing some of the guitar tracks (while the Pistols were trying to find a label that would take them).<br />After the fact, &quot;Spunk&quot; has some interesting tid-bits, but nothing you couldn't already find on a plethora of subsequent boots (&quot;Flogging A Dead Horse&quot;, &quot;Some Product&quot;, &quot;The Swindle Continues&quot;, etc.).<br />A decent value, but not the essential work some would have you believe.
6304806418|5.0|I have never liked musicals.  I'm a fan of Pink Floyd, The Who, Kiss and such but I watched this because Alan Parker directed it and I'm a fan of his film &quot;Pink Floyd: The Wall.&quot;  This is awsome.  It's basically one big, long music video with a pop/rock score which I suprisingly admit is really good.  The cinematography and art direction are visually awsome.  The editing is also incredible.  The &quot;Lady's Got Potential&quot; scene is one of my favorites where they play rock'n'roll music and cut all around to these scenes of war and chaos in the streets.  It's cool how they show her with the Pope and they're playing rock'n'roll music; the combination is rare.  I'll put this move on and crank up the volume.  I have a new respect for musicals now. (Just the contemorary pop/rock ones like this.)
0380820846|5.0|For anyone who likes Julia Quinn, you won't be disappointed with Romancing Mister Bridgerton. A very sweet, funny, and romantic story about a intelligent and witty, although not overtly beautiful young woman finding love with the man of her dreams.
B0000024K1|5.0|This album has generated 104 reviews (not including mine). While I didn't read every single review, I did notice that out of those 104 reviews only 8 did not give this album 5 stars. That says it all. Many of the other reviewers gave excellent descriptions about the content of the material on this album and thus I don't feel the need to repeat what's already been written. However, I will say that this. Some 15 years after its release, this music still sounds incredible today. That is one incredible feet to accomplish. There aren't that many other albums, records or cd's that still sound fresh after so many years and, just as importantly, after so many listens. Off the top of my head, only Seal's first album, Led Zeppelin's 4th album, The Police's &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, Sarah Brightman's &quot;Dive&quot; and Van Halen's &quot;1984&quot; still sound fresh years after they were released. Public Enemy's &quot;It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back&quot; has nothing musically in common with these other artists except that the music has aged very well.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|what is the song that jack teaches the guitarist to see if he can play? its got a nice catchy beat and i know it has to be really famous but i somehow dont know what it is.
B00009RGBS|5.0|I used to hate musicals. They were always so sweet and nice, with all these happy little songs...they made me want to throw up. I have only seen a few musicals I actually liked, and those are the ones that have a dark edge to them, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and now CHICAGO! I loved Chicago because it wasn't all sweet and nice. Yes, for all those of you out there who hated it, it does NOT have a moral to the story. It is not about morality. It is making fun of the justice system. For all of you hypocrites out there, a movie doesn't have to have a moral. Just look at wonderful movies like Mel Gibson's Payback, and all other movies like it out there. you can either root for the bad guy or.. the bad guy! so what if the murderous singer/dancers get off and make a fortune off of their crimes? At least they do it with style. And yes, I was sad too that the only nice guy in the movie got thrown away by Roxie, but better that than being stuck with her! People shouldn't take things like this so seriously, and shouldn't walk into the movie expecting to get a sweet morality tale just because it happens to be a musical.
B00000JZXJ|5.0|What can anyone say about Robert Johnson that hasn't already been stated?  The music he left us just has that feel of someone who has traveled the humid shadows of the early twentieth century, checked into every dive hotel and motel across the Bible belt, stomped his feet in more than a few juke joints, courted the devil and let everyone know about it, smoked a few cigarettes, drank his share liquor, tasted love and was bitten more than once.  The more you listen, the more your imagination is sparked.     This particular collection showcases the 29 songs he recorded - minus the variations.  If you are a casual listener, this is a marvelous retrospective of the music.  If you are more of a completist, then the critically acclaimed box set is what you want.  To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the blues - in all its various styles.  A few things I like are R.L. BURNSIDE - TOO BAD JIM, JIMI HENDRIX - BLUES and various things from MUDDY WATERS, SON HOUSE and HUDDIE LEDBETTER.    A quote from the CD liner notes by Tony Watts:  \\"If details of Robert Johnson's life are shadowy, there is nothing at all indistinct about his music which is full of the most elemental power imaginable.  Obviously a driven man, he attempted to exorcise his demons through the medium of his songs...\\"    I sometimes wonder if it's because this guy left so few facts about his life behind, that his music becomes that much better?  The popular story of his life's end is he was poisoned by a jealous husband he had cuckolded, and then buried in an unmarked grave after midnight.  The king is gone but he's not forgotten:  Does the mystery and drama of his short life actually float the music, add to its potency and make it transcendent above what it actually is?  My recommendation is to take a listen for yourself.  For whatever the reason, I can't stop listening to this collection of great songs.  Personal favorites are - HELLHOUND ON MY TRAIL, MALTED MILK, LITTLE QUEEN OF SPADES, IF I HAD POSESSION OVER JUDGEMENT DAY, FROM FOUR `TIL LATE and STOP BREAKIN' DOWN BLUES.    Enjoy.
B00004XONN|1.0|Why? why? why? why?<BR>WHy are they the best? the yare one of the worst bands in hte world and one of the most overlooked bands...they are playing minimal post-rock and peaople are thinking that this is a new quiality in music not knowing bands like Can or Sonic youth...tragic but true.avoid KID A and avoid RAdiohead!
B00009TB5G|3.0|When I went to see \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" in the movie theater, I was absolutely speechless at the end of it.  I was so relieved, so encouraged by Jackson's interpretation of the novel I was beyond words.  But beyond that, I got the feeling that the people who made \\"Fellowship\\" really loved the story - a sense that they'd taken great care in filming it.<br />I do get that feeling at times while watching \\"The Two Towers\\", like during parts of the battle at Helm's Deep, but the rest of the film seems like \\"Tolkien Lite\\".  The sets and visuals were top-notch, but there was entirely too much cheezy dialogue that stood out painfully from the original source material.<br />It's not a bad movie, per se, but it's not as good as its predecessor, and it lacks the care and sensitivity that made \\"Fellowship\\" great.
B00007EBAG|5.0|This CD is simply CLASS! From start to finish there is never a dull moment with more melodies &amp; hooks than you have any right to expect from one CD.<BR>TTD has never failed to impress with each comeback. Get this album if you are a lover of music!
B000002HH9|4.0|Starting out in typical Cure style, Wild Mood Swings starts in irritated darkness and becomes a roller coaster ride of fun, sorrow, joy, pain, hope and love lost.<BR>There are some great cuts on this - Mint Car and Jupiter Crash being my favorites and although I'm not a die-hard Cure fan, I really enjoyed the depth of emotions that this album had to share.<BR>For me, it's all about quality and Wild Mood Swings has more then enough.
0156027321|4.0|I read this book after I had read the book that it allegedly plagiarizes \\"Max e os Felinos\\" by Brazilian Moacyr Scliar. Aside from the fact that both books seem similar Yann's book is still well written and poignent. A good novel that'll make you think.

I Will Type The Lyrics On The Computer Tomorrow.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Dear fans of Once Upon A Time In The West,<br />I spoke to Paramount Home Video and they assured me that this DVD will offer the film in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, as it should be seen. The aspect ratio Amazon.com lists (1.77:1) as of today (10/17/03) IS INCORRECT. I asked Paramount to inform Amazon and fix the error but it is not corrected at the time I am writing this.<br />Really, Paramount has done a great job of releasing films in their original aspect ratio, other than a few titles that came out at the birth of DVD (e.g. Jade) and when they offer both WS and P&S versions. Paramount is sometimes light on supplements, but they deserve kudos for the aspect ratios. It's really Artisan and Warner Brothers that you have to watch out for in terms of aspect ratio. I really don't think Artisan gets it at all - you would think as a film company they would care about the quality of their DVD releases. In my opinion, Artisan hasn't grasped the idea that DVD is not simply an extension of VHS and that DVD has the capability to offer so much more than VHS; they seem to be of the mindset that they are producing DVDs for a renters market, one where the renters of a film are not keeping it and therefore won't care about preserving the integrity of the filmmakers' vision.<br />Now, if we can just get MGM to release A Fistful of Dynamite on DVD, and a proper domestic release of My Name Is Nobody, all of our Leone dreams will be fulfilled.<br />Enjoy Once Upon A Time In The West! If it's not the best film ever, it's certainly the best western in my opinion.
0385504209|3.0|Well worth it now if you can borrow it; otherwise wait for paper. Readable because the ideas are interesting and well presented, but the characters are sketchy and the author's style lacks polish.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I must say that this is a mindblowing film for the world of not just anime yet movies in general.  Master film maker Hayao Miyazaki has truly proven that anime is an incredible art that is best for a good story-telling.  This film is more than just for looking at from a technical point of view. It tells a touching story of the battle between machinery and nature.  You witness this from the two complex main characters, Asitaka and Mononoke, who are caught in the midst of the horrible struggle.  This is definately worth picking up so buy it and give anime a try.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|This DVD is simply stunning! Thankfully someone decided to capture one of the world's most exciting bands as they are on tour during their breakout into commercial success. You owe it to yourself to pick this one up...and you get a live cd as well!
B0013ND36G|1.0|I found this movie a bitter disappointment. Early on, the scene with the Elton John glasses on the Terminator was ludicrous, and (for me) somewhat spoiled the truly cool scene in T2 it parodied. The cast is weak. I like Nick Stahl as an actor, generally, but he makes a poor John Connor. If I can believe the internet, Edward Furlong has had drug problems and that's why he's been replaced by Nick Stahl in the role of John Connor. It's too bad; I greatly preferred Furlong's take on the character - his portrayal of John in T2 came across as competent and tough, with enough angst for seasoning. T3's John Connor is a whiny loser. Though I wonder if Furlong could have done any better with this script.<br /><br />Honestly - no exaggeration at all - I found myself yawning repeatedly during the truck chase scene. We've seen this sort of mindless property damage countless times before. And since neither John nor Kate (the Clair Danes character) had grabbed my sympathies, I couldn't really get emotionally involved in it, or care what happend to them.<br /><br />And there were just so many moments in this movie that made no logical sense, that were obviously inserted because the writer thought they were cool, and didn't stop to think them out:<br /><br />The Arnold Terminator is programmed to obey the lady vet's orders but not John's. WHY? She sent the thing back to save her life, and John's. Why not program it to obey his orders, too? What if she'd died - John would have had no control over the thing. Obviously the writer and director thought it was funny to have John vehemently order the Terminator around, to no effect, then have it immediately obey the woman's orders. Maybe it was funny....until you actually think about that for a pico-second.<br /><br />We have more scenes of the Terminator machine-gunning cop cars with zero casualties (only it was done SO much better in T2). WHY? Okay, in T2 the teenage John Connor was uncomfortable having \\"his\\" Terminator kill people. Butafter decades of combat, knowing she was fighting for the very survival of the human race, are we expected to believe Kate would be braindead enough to so severely handicap the machine that's her last, desperate hope? Okay, it has to kill someone. When we balance that against the entire human race dying - well, it's a full-throttle Terminator kinda day.<br /><br />We see the female Terminator going around killing the people who will be John Connor's lieutenants in the future, the hard core of warriors that saves the world. True, we only see two scenes of what these people are like in their teens, but what are these future heroes? A brother and sister preppy blasting their brains out at a kegger, and a short-round guy with wispy mustache working drivethrough at a burger joint. I mean, sure, maybe severe hardship can cause profound changes in some people's personalities, but wouldn't we expect the saviors of humanity, by their mid-teens, to be serious A-type personalities? Maybe we might even see a few older folks with, dare I say it, some military experience.<br /><br />It's a tradition in Terminator movies to have a scene where the present suddenly transitions over to the bombed-out Terminator future. In T3 it happens when John, in a boozy funk, drops a partially empty beer bottle off a bridge. The problem is, the bottle doesn't disappear when it hits the water, it continues travelling downward until it lands on the bottom, carpeted with human skulls. Let's think about that for a moment. In order to believe this scene, we have to accept that someone in that future world, where humans live in underground bunkers and only come out at night to wage guerilla warware, where flying HKs constantly patrol the air....was on top of a bridge drinking beer and then dropped the bottle into the water. The movie crowd was literally hooting at that scene, it was so stupid.<br /><br />Then we have the scene where John and Kate are trying to enter the passwords to break into the mountain complex. The TX blasts a helicopter through the doors and then WALKS toward them. WHY? Well, because if she moved as fast as we've already seen she can, the movie would've ended right there.<br /><br />John powers up the super-magnetic field which works on the TX so well it actually pulls the metal right off her body....but doesn't affect anything in his backpack. Jesus wept.<br /><br />I've read the comment from one reviewer of T3, \\"I wish they would destroy every copy of that movie, reshoot it with a competent script, with a competent director and with some good actors.\\" I disagree. I don't see the need for a better T3. Rather, I don't see the need for any T3 at all. The ending scene of T2 was so perfect, the series should have ended there.
B000000H57|5.0|&quot;October Rust&quot; by Type O Negative has to be one of Type O Negative's best CD.  Well, that's not being very helpful, because all of Type O Negative's CDs are equally amazing in my opinion.  But on with the CD, the best advice I can give to you is read all the other reviews and listen to the samples.  If you are a fan a dark and depressing music, you will most definitly like &quot;October Rust&quot;.  Like someone else said in a previous review, October Rust is a good CD to listen to alone and in the dark.  This CD features some of Josh Silver's best keyboarding and some catchy and beautiful guitars, like on &quot;Be My Druidess&quot; -I found the guitars on that addictive.  It's absolutely amazing.  Get this CD.  And when you listen to it all the way through and you're not that impressed, don't despair.  For one of the things I've noticed about all TON's CDs is that they take time to get used to, and when you get used to them, you will fall in love with them.  Listen to this album at least 5 more times before you decide you hate it.  And if you haven't already, make sure to get &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; and Type O Negative's new release- &quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot;.  If you like this type of music, Type O Negative will become your favorite band.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Yo Yo Yo Ffred dust numberrr 1 fan .you are an ignorant a** who doesnt know anything about PUNK. This album is my second favorite of all time.  You need to stop writing crappy reviews,  go throw away all your cds so your offsping will not spread your crappy musical taste. Thak you
0446530891|3.0|David Baldacci is a excellent writer and storyteller, and is one of my most favorite authors. I have missed many meals and hours of sleep because of his books. <br />Split Second was no exception.  It was entertaining, intriguing, suspensful and thrilling.<br />But it is not is Baldacci's greatest and could have done with out a few characters and a few gruesome details (i.e. hanging bodies). The end was exciting, and I don't care that it was a little unrealistic.  My biggest beef is that is was so darn complicated. My head is still spinning from all that went on at the end, and I still don't really know exactly what happened.  <br />Die hard Baldacci fans will certainly find this book a good read, but will feel a little disappointed that it is not up to the caliber of his previous works.
B000063DIR|4.0|I like this CD because I own it and I do give it a 4 star rateing.
B000002HJD|5.0|I have always been a fan of The Doors and enjoy their unique music very much. This album is a collection of poems written by Jim Morrison with the Doors music in the background. I like the poetry on this album but I find it difficult to understand it at times. Jim has always had a knack of really confusing people with his poems atleast he confuses me but that does not mean that I don't like them. This CD collects some of his most famous works into one single disc. Some of the poetry contained herein he would perform it live in concert and he always liked to throw them in the middle of a song. I especially love the music that serves as background for &quot;Feast Of Friends&quot; one of my favorite poems from Jim. The music on this one is really beautiful and somewhat sad, it gives me a sort of melancholy feeling when I'm listening to it. This album was recorded a few months before Jim died in Paris in 1971 and was finished by the three surviving members in the 70's and finally released in 1978. This recording won a Grammy Award for the best album of spoken word. Who would of thought that Jim Morrison would win a Grammy nine years after his death. Even though this album is complex to understand and really tough to come to grips with it, I think it's brilliant and Morrison's voice is really good here he sounds quite smooth and relax but only some of the time. There are other parts in the album where he screams and he sounds mad but Jim was always unpredictiable and one never knew what he was up to. Classic poetry album by the one and only Jim Morrison.
B00005JLWN|5.0|To tell you the truth, I thought this movie was going to suck.  I heard so many people say \\"better than the Matrix,\\" that I was thinking \\"Existenz\\" all over again.  Besides, though there have been unfortunate moments in the Matrix (i.e. orgy scene in second flick) it's a solid movie with overall great acting and action, and one of the most original treatments of the subject matter in cinematic history.  <br />To my surprise, I actually enjoyed this movie!  I fail to see where the Matrix comparison comes in, however.  The action is different, no one flies or dodges bullets (in the traditional sense), and the explanation for supernatural ability is scientifically precise martial arts (with guns!).  The subject matter is different; here people struggle with feelings, not machines.  Despite the potential for cliched dialogue (i.e. Bobby Robot: \\"what's that wetness rolling down your cheek\\"  Cindy Human: \\"It's called a tear\\"), they actually handled it with as much grace as possible.<br />If you like sci-fi and action, check this out.  It's not the Matrix, but it shouldn't even be compared to it!  Watch it for what it is, a rare gem in its genre!  It's well acted, well scripted, and extremely interesting.
B00003CWL6|3.0|This movie is a Social Satire.  There is a lot of dark humor and several pretty serious stabs were taken at the culture of consumerism.<br />However, it proved to be extremely misleading for a lot of folks who chose to waste time defending (!) and embracing (!) the characters and the plot.  They feel a need to do so in order to justify their own way of life.<br />Of course the flick has no likable heroes -- that's the whole point.  Our life in suburban America became so deprived of basic human values, the director is clearly appalled and disgusted.  Had it not been a bit self-gratifying, and more of a social commentary, this movie might have served as an open call for change.  Instead, I hear mumblings along the lines of &quot;life is beautiful&quot; and &quot;celebrate whatever life it is&quot; and so forth.  For this very reason -- that the movie fails to clearly present its point to the suburban masses, it gets only 3 stars.
B00005ASHM|5.0|What fun growing up was.  No matter our age there was music that brought us from our young dark ages into the light.<br />For some of us the Beach Boys did that.  For young guys it was about cars (Little Duece Coup +), for young girls it was about a life dreamed about (In My Room)<br />Then, Pet Sounds came along.  I could write all day just about &quot;Wouldnt It Be Nice&quot;. I think that it,along with In My Room, was and is two of the most influential songs in my life.<br />It is said Paul McCartney bought each of his children a copy of this music as an example of what it takes to go through life.  <br />There is a cleanliness about this music, a freshness. It plays without hidden meanings, no searching necessary here.  It is straight forward life as a young person.  Give it a try, go on back to where you came from.  Remember having girlfriends?  Remember that car you used to have?  Remember your feelings as a young person trying to figure things out?  Its still here.  Listen.

B0000257O9|4.0|I have a special place in my heart for this quirky melding of synth-pop and sci-fi. To me, it ranks with the Alan Parsons Project's &quot;I Robot&quot; and Kraftwerk's &quot;Man Machine&quot; as the perfect mesh of human and android musicality. Given that the novelty status of The Buggles will forever be secured by &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star,&quot; that may come as a hard pill to digest. But there was much more to &quot;Living In The Plastic Age&quot; than that wonderful single.<br />There was a fair amount of imagination involved with the making of this album. Horn and Downes obviously, in retrospect, had a lot more ambitions than making cotton candy new wave. If you listen to the lyrics, you'll find fear of the Reagen/Thatcher power mongering of the time (&quot;Clean Clean&quot;), wariness of technology isolating people from humanity (&quot;I Love You Miss Robot&quot;), and the title track's cynical look into a future of replaceable parts and governmental control.<br />Unfortunately, the album did suffer from the fact that neither Horn nor Downes was much of a singer. While that lends a certain charm to a song like &quot;Elstree,&quot; it does suck the power out of &quot;Kid Dynamo,&quot; which really would have been more convincing if the vocal had more muscle. (In fact, I remember the shock of many of my friends when it was announced that Horn and Downes had been recruited for Yes...how the heck could the singer on this record possibly stand in Jon Anderson's space?) Regardless of the performance weaknesses, &quot;Living In The Plastic Age&quot; sounds better after the 20 plus years since its release than, say, A Flock Of Seagulls, and as a document of Men Vs Technology, still stands strong.<br />PS: I also recommend Bruce Wooley and The Camera Club's &quot;English Garden&quot; CD in addition to &quot;Living in The Plastic Age.&quot; He was a founding member of the Buggles and cowrote some of their best songs, but broke off before they hit. His versions of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; and &quot;Clean Clean&quot; are played as straight ahead power pop and can be found on his album.of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; and &quot;Clean Clean&quot; are played as straight ahead power pop and can be found on his album.
0780631684|4.0|This movie had so much potential, but in the end it is just doesn't deliver as much as it could have. I mean the teen actors were ridiculous. Totally unbelievable. The death scenes (well most anyway) are scary because they are pretty realistic. But in the end it's a slasher film with nods at the FAR superior The Omen. But it's not to bad. The sequel is pretty lame, but the gore makes up for it.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I flat out recommend this album to anyone who even has a slight liking of Bowie's work since &quot;Outside&quot; re-ignited his creative streak. I find this to be a more enjoyable album than &quot;Heathen,&quot; and a harder rocking one. It also shows Bowie continuing to explore the processes of aging with grace as a rocker (as opposed to certain old RS Duet partners). Nothing on &quot;Reality&quot; suggests a man struggling to grasp something he's no longer capable of relating to.<br />Take, for instance, &quot;The Loneliest Guy.&quot; Set on a dark stack of treated guitars and great piano playing (Mike Garson is &quot;Reality's&quot; secret weapon), it says little lyrically but conveys its mood flawlessly. It is the companion to &quot;Never Get Old,&quot; which kicks hard and confronts the denial of accepting mortality head on. And speaking of which, there's the title song's backward looking career arc to which the singer finally admits that he &quot;looks for sense, but I get next to nothing&quot; before barking &quot;Welcome to reality, Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; It's a remarkable moment on a darn good album.<br />Also worth noting is the joyous romp of &quot;Pablo Picasso,&quot; recast as a glam rocker, and a straightforward reading of George Harrison's &quot;Try Some Buy Some.&quot; It's nice to see that Bowie can still take a song and claim it as his own. That's the finest &quot;Reality&quot; of them all.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Not to scary. There are some scary parts, but all in all it's not really that good. This was the first horror film I ever saw to! I saw it when it first came out, and thought the first half was scary, but laughed (even at that age) at the 2nd half. \\"Kiss Me Fat Boy\\"-Pennywise has gotta be the funniest line ever! So not as scary as it should've been, so I say read the book. A lot scarier!

B00005JLKB|5.0|This is one of the best series out in television in today's world. All the actors are absolutely marvolous, especially Kristin Kruek and all of the Kents. The themes are absolutly amazing and down-to-earth. This is a series everyone can identify with in some form or way.<br />Smallville deals with Clark Kent as a teenager for the most part. Yet what makes it unique is that not all of the issues and situations have to deal with just defeating the &quot;bad guy&quot;. There are also intricate emotional plots and etical problems that arise and have to be dealt with. What also makes this an amazing DVD/TV series is the way almost all of the characterss have to learn about themselves and who they are, not just Clark.<br />All in all, one very good buy for families and friends alike.
B000084T18|1.0|This album is just about the worst load of manure to ever come out of anything.  I don't even own it.  I heard it on the radio once or twice.  Seriously, the grunts people make while taking a large crap would make for better lyrics than 50 cent comes up with.  From the way he sounds, you'd think it was the motor control center in his brain had been shot.  I mean seriously! He sounds like he's retarded! If this guy has really been shot 9 times or whatever, his enemies must be godawful shots.  Just give me a gun, and I'll finish the job.  Or maybe I'll kill him slow.  He deserves it.
B000003B6J|5.0|This was clearly a big start of gangsta rap mixed into the older beastie boys and more (as heard in &quot;8 ball&quot; - Easy-e), I can honestly say &quot;Straight outta compton&quot; was a classic with the funky-a** rhymes, and the classic &quot;Dj yella&quot; on the turntables and the funky drums this was clearly a classic, On f%$k tha police they talk about how the police trated them like s%$t because they were black, I entirely agree!, On 8 ball I told u earlier, And I can't name all the songs but I can say they are all Tight!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Buy the DVD; you won't be sorry.<BR>One of the best things on TV recently, Firefly deserved better than the shabby treatment it got from FOX.  While it is a SciFi show, like all great SciFi, it transcended the genre.  Tight writing, solid acting, and beautiful camerawork made this show a standout.  Flawed human characters thrown together in extreme situations made it a show that could have become a classic.<BR>I'm still bitter over FOX's poor treatment and rapid cancellation of this show.  It's no wonder that TV is a wasteland with dumb decisions like this one.<BR>Now, let's get that feature movie deal going...

B00005PJ6M|1.0|1 star because you can't pick 0 stars...<br />The WORST movie I have ever seen, and not just because I watched it with my ex-girlfriend, but it was a genuinely awful experience. Movies like this are why people become alcoholics. Every time I see Keanu Reeves I want to jab an ice pick in my eye. Because as Lewis Black once said, If I am going to be in that much pain, I am going to inflict it on myself. <br />Awful. Terrible. Horrid. I would even say pusillanimous if it was the right word, but it isn't. Still, it sounds good there, don't it? <br />You only have a certain number of minutes in your life. Don't waste any of them on this movie.
B000084T18|5.0|First of all if you can't relate to rap music you have no business judging it. Out of all the 1 star reviews this album has got I bet 90% of them are from people who just hate rap, probably because they don't understand it. How many of those people do you think acually listened to this entire album, most of them pobably just saw \\"In Da Club\\" on MTV and made their judgment off that. You have to take the other 18 songs on the album into account, because all of the songs are very different from one another. And saying that 50 Cent is the same as Ja Rule & P. Diddy is just ignorance. What's the difference? Well, 50 Cent has acually experienced what he's rapping about, he's not just making stuff up he's telling his life story through music. He's not just saying \\"It's your Birthday\\" for 70 minutes, he touches on many differnt subjects throughout the course of this 19 track album. Not all of his subject matter is incredibly deep, but it is diverse. He raps a lot about what 2pac rapped about without sounding like a wannabe. This is a great album, it has great production and 50 Cent has a great flow throughout all of the 19 tracks. This album can really be appreciated by someone who understands it.
B0000CDL93|1.0|I have no love for this film and i have no love for JFK as either man or President.  I've watched this film several times including when it was playing in the theatre that i owned. The dumming down of America started with JFK.  Why were people impressed and why do people even care who shot him?  I was about 16 when he was killed,,,it had no impact on me at all.  Actually anyone who was brought up properly would of had the same reaction as i did but somehow that generation of people fell in love with basically a sex symbol to many women and men loved him because he appeared to be athletic and said things that they thought was impressive.  The famous quote \\"Ask not what the country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\\" I love this country and i believe in taking care of this country but that stupid statement was the start of bring in the new order of corrupt political leaders and has put us in the worse shape we have ever been in.  I'm not talking about anything outside of the walls of the US.  I'm talking about the United States low class thinking, uneducated kids, trailer trash type of attitude when it comes to sports heros, the what's in it for me thinking. Yes people you can thank one jerk for the start of this and his name was JFK.
B0000025HG|5.0|Thank God for CDs.  I give this work a rating of 5 due to the fact that I am able to delete both<br />\\"Splish Splash\\", and \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\"(Hey!  An artist of Streisand's caliber, and the length of her career and high quality of her recorded output...well, everyone is entitled to a bad decision and a lousy song selection once in awhile!), and concentrate on the beautiful ballads and the simply stunning performances she delivers with them.  As for the infamous duet, \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\", I love it....No Discussion Necessary.  Pay particular attention to the lovely \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\".  Streisand's voice was at its apex during this time and this song, along with the other ballads contained here, prove, once again, that she has no equal in the field of living Popular vocalists.
B00004TJKI|5.0|This 1959 courtroom drama starring the incomparable Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorite Stewart films.  Jimmy's portrayal of a defense attorney is spot-on perfect here, in my view.<br />There's a great supporting cast in force here as well, including Geoge C. Scott, Ben Gazzara, Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden (hilarious, as always, in the role of Stewart's secretary), Murray Hamilton, Orson Bean, and the always-fetching Lee Remick (whose alluring quality is undeniable in this motion picture).<br />Keep an eye open for Howard McNear (Floyd the Barber in \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\") as a witness.  It's quite humorous--and maybe even a tad bit unsettling even--to hear Floyd Lawson on the witness stand, speaking of sexual matters. Mayberry-ites would gasp in shock & horror I imagine.  LOL.<br />Clocking in at a very lengthy 160 minutes, the film never drags.  It moves at a snappy-enough pace to keep our interest the whole way, with a nice combination of scenes both inside and outside the courtroom.<br />There's an outstanding Duke Ellington score to propel the action, and as a bonus on the DVD edition, there's a perfectly-fantastic Photo Gallery section of stills from the film, underscored by Ellington's music from the movie.  This is the best and classiest \\"Photo Gallery\\" extra you're likely to encounter on any DVD product as of this date.<br />Picture quality on the DVD looks just fine here. Aspect ratio is 1.33:1 (Full Frame), which I know irks the \\"Widescreen Only\\" crowd.  However, from all the info I can gather, the 1.33 ratio IS indeed the Original Aspect Ratio for this film.  So, it's OK by me, if this is the case.<br />If \\"Anatomy Of A Murder\\" is not currently in your DVD collection, you should probably be taken to court by lawyer Stewart for overlooking this fine motion picture experience.  Get it now -- before Jimmy comes after you with a subpoena.  :)
B00006IR5S|4.0|I really enjoyed it.The songs were so dreamy, i felt like sleeping.The main song, i felt, so full of magic, and mystery and wonder. I felt adventrous,and full of excitement. I wanted to be part of Harry Potter and it got me thinking hard about Hogwarts and danger. The songs seemed so secretive,ad if you've come in from a long day's work i would recommend this to you. Thumbs up, beatifully composed.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is a pure genious band...i'm personally hooked on The Scientist. the amount of feeling and emotion in their songs is incredible. i'd definetly recommend this to someone who appreciates a band's mellow, heartfelt sound, as well as great lyrics.
B00005JL78|3.0|I don't like this movie. There are two major gripes that I have with it, which come up because I have larger expectations from big budget flicks directed by Hollywood titans like Spielberg.<br />The plot hole was pretty evident, and I waited for the explanation throughout the movie and never got it. If you follow the sequence of events, the murder which Anderton supposedly did was instigated by the precogs themselves. What I mean is that if they hadn't seen him murder someone he wouldn't have been set on the path that lead him to do it. Maybe someone else was going to inform him of the scheme, and then the precogs would see it. But that didn't happen, and wasn't explained. Makes absolutely no sense to me. Maybe I am missing something, despite watching this movie a few times looking for clues.<br />Second gripe is Spielberg's futile attempts to do it like Ridley. The Russian doctor scene (does he have prejudice towards Russians?), is injected with this same `weird' theme as Ridley Scott has done with many scenes in Bladerunner. The wife of a doctor chattering away in some bizzar trance like language (it wasn't russian), almost resembling the final scene with Roy Batty or Maybe one of the scenes with Gaff. And the prison keeper who aside from acting weird uses the same disconnected tone. Maybe this is how Philip K. Dick writes, but Ridley pulled it off first, and I can't think of this as anything but mimicking on Spielberg's part.<br />Great special effects show. I wish they would stop making everything so blue, that visual noise detracts and doesn't add anything.
B00009TB5G|1.0|TT storyline botched into some romantic semi plot and Gimli reduced to comic relief - how sad considering what was potential if the director resisted dark temptation to please mass crowds with simple love story (under strong grip The One Ring of Profits ...)<br />well at least visual effectsa were good and it may be saved if somebody cut all this crap to make shorter movie!
B000002MTR|4.0|One thing is for sure about this album: It just wasn't the same without John. Sure Dave Navarro is okay, but his playing style does not match the Chili Peppers sound at all. Overall, the album is pretty good though with half of the songs being decent, a third of the songs being pretty damn good. Here is the track order:<br />1. Warped ~ an ok song, but they needed a little more work on it. Not a good way to start the CD.<BR>2. Aeroplane ~ A great song. Really funky with great guitar for Dave and great lyrics.<BR>3. Deep Kick ~ Weird at the beginning, but gets really good in the middle and at the end.<BR>4. My Friends ~ Outstanding song. The best on the CD. Enough Said.<BR>5. Coffee Shop ~ Not a very good song. The singing is just too weird. Come on now, Anthony.<BR>6. Pea (Flea) ~ Solo song by Flea. Very funny and sends an important message. Good Song.<BR>7. One Big Mob ~ Good song. Brings lots of energy. Cool transitions.<BR>8. Walkabout ~ I love this song. Really funky and cool.<BR>9. Tearjerker ~ Great song. The album desperately needed a song like this.<BR>10. One Hot Minute ~ Bad. The hooks are the only good part.<BR>11. Falling Into Grace ~ Eh, it's alright. Anthony sounds great.<BR>12. Shallow Be Thy Name ~ Sounds too much like Coffee Shop. The chorus is good.<BR>13. Transcending ~ Cool song. Good beat with good lyrics. BUT THE END IS TOTALLY MESSED UP. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?<br />Overall the album is ok. I gave it 4 stars simply because I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers and they have been my favorite band forever. This album does not even compare to BSSM, Californication or By The Way. Flea was a strong asset to this album as usual. Chad is great as usual, and Anthony sang great. But Dave, thank you for returning to Jane's Addiction. And John Frusciante, you are THE MAN. You're the greatest, thanks for comin back.
B00004U2G1|3.0|DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A MULTICHANNEL HI-RES TRACK - NOT HERE.  MAYBE THEY WILL TRY AND PUT ONE TOGETHER ON A DVD-AUDIO DISK???  MY BASIC CD VERSION SOUNDS THIS GOOD.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$$........ LIKE I DID...
0316666343|3.0|There has been lots of hype about this much talked about book, but for serious readers who really know literature, I'd say it's just that...hype.  Bones has an interesting devise (a murder told in first person by the victim) but just wasn't a great book.<br />After hearing the author on NPR's &quot;Fresh Air&quot;  and countless LA cocktail conversations about the book (everyone must have been bored with the usual topic of self absorption), I picked up The Lovely Bones.   <br />My expectations were high, but I've gotta say Bones was just an average read.  The only really affecting thing about the book was the way the author discussed the brutal rape and murder of a teen-age girl.  Told in 1st person perspective by a teenage girl looking down from heaven, it's a strange mix of   graphic descriptions of rape and murder, and girlish fantasy about heaven. <br />The disturbing thing wasn't that the rape description was so graphic, it was that it was discussed so matter-of-factly, as though going through the grocery list or describing baking a cake.  It really became difficult to read at times, and as a matter of fact, I had to put the book down, because I found it too depressing.  <br />Juxtaposed to this macabre subject is the bizarre description of heaven from the eyes of a young girl. It's so full of girlish fantasy you can almost hear N'Synch playing in the background.<br />Given that the author's first book...was also a book about rape, I think Ms... needs to move on and stop picking the bones of her favorite topic.  <br />I can appreciate the book for its novel approach, I can applaud the gutsy no-holds-barred way she writes about a touchy subject matter.  However I really can't fully recommend the book.  At the root, it's a clever idea and a shocking subject, but not really good literature.
B00004I9VE|3.0|THIS IS A STEREO ONLY SACD.  THERE IS NO MULTICHANNEL TRACK AND IT SOUNDS VERY CLEAN - BUT I WAS EXPECTING A MULTICHANNEL SURROUND TRACK IN HI-RES.  AMAZON WILL NOT LET ME RETURN IT -ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN MY SACD PLAYER FOR NO MORE THAN 60 SECONDS.  BEEEEE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING ONLINE...  ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM - I ALREADY HAVE IT IN BASIC CD FORM AND IT PLAYS IN DTS NEO:6 / ALL CH ETC.  ACTUALLY IT SOUNDS BETTER IN THE BASIC CD FORMAT CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN CREATE A MULICHANNEL ENVIRONMENT.
B00005A46T|5.0|I don't really know what to say...Slipknot have once again delivered and blown me away, staying true to their form, experimenting with their sound alot more this time around (always great for ME) and it sounds like they were listening to alot of Cannibal Corpse if you ask me. Sure, this isn't &quot;real death metal&quot; or whatever...but the influence does show. Slipknot sure as hell haven't gone soft at ALL. They have gotten BETTER and HEAVIER and this cycle will continue and Maggots worldwide will rejoice at this great revolution of music and will wait for the wasteland of radio-rock and nu metal to be washed away and disposed of forever...and Slipknot will rule over all godammit. You can either hop along for the ride or be crushed in their wake. It's up to you. If you enjoy loud heavy aggressive-as-hell music, and you don't buy this you should just be beaten severely. Bottom line. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW. (ps Mr Matt Mason, whatever your name is; GO F*CK YOURSELF)
B000002LQR|4.0|This is the album that features the Red Hot Chili Peppers &quot;breakthrough&quot; hit, &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;.  It's a great song, and there are plenty of other good songs here, too.  &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot;, &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; and &quot;Give It Away&quot; are particularly good.  If you like rock music with a &quot;funk&quot; edge to it, you should enjoy this album.
B00005T30L|5.0|For those that have read Daniel Clowes' graphic novel about the trials and tribulations of Enid and Rebecca in the post highschool graduation world, you could not ask for a better visual interpretation! Terry Zwigoff had proven his fanscination with cartoonists on the fringe with his doco 'Crumb' about Robert Crumb(the often maligned creator of Fritz the Cat amongst others).<BR>This is a great film and all the better being able to watch at home, a perfect DVD for a night in with your intelligent friends. It is always refreshing to have a good selection of special features on a disc including deleted scenes which I'm sure you have your favourite, though tell me any of these scenes would have made the film better, no way!<BR>The casting is brilliant. Thora Birch is 'Enid'up and down, forget all of these character actors like De Niro and Palcino because no actor has ever identified with their character like this. Thora plays 'Enid' as the perfect anti-hero. Steve Buscemi is inspired casting, as his face looks like it came straight out of the pages of the original comic. 'Seymour' is the ultimate loser and Steve walks and talks it well. Scarlett Johansson is great in the support as 'Rebecca',the ying to Enid's yang, perfect together and devastating apart. Each character is never at their best without the other. This film has absolutely no faults to be found with a top notch cast and great directing.This film quickly went into my all time top ten films with the recent 'Donnie Darko', also a beautiful portrayal of the teenage psyche. Do not miss it!
B0000C9V3T|4.0|One of the best things about the movie was the soundtrack Overall its pretty solid and is a great blend of diffrent types of music, but the one song im looking for in particular is the song they played just as uma and lucy lu where begining to go at it, at the end of the movie,if you know the name of this song and if its on the soundtrack please respond thank you
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I just watched this DVD and can confirm that it is NOT edited. If you really want to see Arnold smoking, eating pastries and carrying girls on his shoulders, it is still here. More importantly, the movie itself looks great as are the extras. One great extra is the making of documentary including a \\"Pumping Iron\\" reunion and shots of Arnold's bachelor pad from the 70s. Pretty funny.
0812550706|5.0|I guarantee that any fan of science fiction will enjoy this book, as well as many who are not.  Ender's Game is the story of a young boy chosen to fight the &quot;bugger&quot; aliens that threaten the planet earth.  Now, I like science fiction, but I'm usually not one to read books on alien invasion or outer space. However many people had recommended this book to me so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was excellent because the focus wasn't on the aliens but on Ender and how such a young boy is manipulated into a fighting machine.  He struggles with trying to find the fierceness he knows he'll need to fight the aliens without becoming a monster.  One thing I learned from this book is that sometimes one person's well-being has to be sacrificed for the greater good of others.  I'd recommend this book to anyone between the ages of thirteen and ninety-nine.  All ages can relate to this book and would enjoy.  Ender's Game is one of those books you simply can't put down.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan owned this movie. Ben Affleck doesn't convince me as a hero for a moment, and Jennifer Garner -- a martial arts assassin? What, was Britney Spears unavailable? Please. She looks about as legitimate as a killer as she does a spy in Alias. Which is to say, not a all. She got this job (and her Alias job) with her _____. Period, end of story. Fight scenes are OK, other than that though, this blows.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Maybe I didn't like this cd because I am not a big fan of radiohead. track 1,2 and there there are the best songs on the cd.
0385504209|5.0|I'm usually not into plot-driven novels.  So The Da Vinci Code was a real change of pace for me.  All I can say is &quot;WOW&quot;.  From the very first page I was absolutely captivated and found it impossible to put the book down.  Dan Brown is the master of suspense.  He knows just how to end each chapter with a cliffhanger.  Most of the book takes place during a 24-hour period and the story reads like one exciting roller coaster ride.<br />The subject is one that I know nothing about -- religious societies, secrets of Da Vinci's paintings and the search for the Holy Grail.  The author fed the reader the historical details at just the right moments to enrich the mystery, and as one preposterous thing after another happened to the main characters, I was always able to follow some of the complex puzzles that were constantly being uncovered.<br />The book starts with a murder.  And a secret to uncover.  There's a male historian who unwittingly gets involved.  And a highly intelligent female code breaker who just happens to be involved in the secret.  What follows next is a breathtaking race to prevent further violence.  And, at the same time, discover the a secret that has implications for the entire world.  Along the way, these two characters have to solve one puzzle after another.  I was totally caught up in the unraveling of this web, which was described so clearly that I never had to stop reading.<br />I loved this book.  It is so well paced and so interesting that it didn't even matter that almost no time was spent on character development.  Here, the plot was everything and a mini-escape from the world around us.  Just be prepared to schedule some time for reading.  Because once you start The Da Vinci Code, you won't want to stop. Highly recommended.
0385334176|2.0|In Deadeye Dick, the underlying messages shine through Vonnegut's words, the morals of innocence, the corruption of being etc. etc.<BR>But Vonnegut forgot one thing in this book.  The story. What is in his other books a perfect mixture of story and the underlying morals, here it is a decidedly lop-sided affair.  The story is very unengaging and I found it quite tedious, to be frank. And unfortunately, it went downhill after an ok-ish start.  Thankfully, those recipes he throws in very frequently at the first part of the novel are toned down because what was a good idea would have turned into an annoying one if continued too frequently.<BR>This is the most disappointing Vonnegut book I've read so far.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film has everything.  It is a beautiful story in the grand tradition of fairy tales and other classic myths, and has the added bonus of being visually stunning as well.  I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone with a dreaming heart and an appreciation for magic in everything.
B000002L7J|5.0|There is talented artists. What made Smiths so strong, the fact that they were not talented at all. They &quot;are&quot; Genius. Johnny Marr is a genius: he understood what was a good record. So it's a kind of an intellectual work. He created a unic style bsaed on country/rockabilly/jinglejangle/rocknroll and he ended-up sounding like no one. Doing things as Spector would have done them, he did real Art. Morrissey is a Great Genius: he read so that his brain became fulfilled with too much knowledge. That made him write ultra-brilliant words, and like he said, words that have never been said before. And his voice... he's a Crooner, a fun-one, mocking and having fun about his vocal. A strong Orbsion/Presley/Sinatra impression. With some Klaus Nomi behind all this, while he sometimes took Nico on his side. With Oscar Wilde in his mentality. Meat Is Murder: Perfect Pop emulation; &quot;Well I Wonder&quot; is a meditating song based on the 60's wondering-song style, &quot;I Want The One I Can't Have&quot; with its happy-joyful-rocky-melody and the delicious piece of solo in the middle, while Morrissey's singing: These are the riches of the poor.<br />This album is an Eternal Pop Classic.<BR>100 out of 5.
B0000542D2|4.0|This was the first time I've watched &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, and I gotta say that the movie exceeded my expectations. I got more than my share of the Beatles' Liverpool humor, and the quality of the picture was exceptional. I especially liked the cinematography, it caught almost every interesting moment of the Beatles in the &quot;natural habitat&quot;; and it really impressed me how the camera caught almost every witty sparkle in John's eyes =)<BR>However, even though there are two discs to this DVD, I found the bonus material quite insipid and superfluous. They are merely interviews of the other actors in the movie. I would have prefered an interview with Paul McCartney instead of a bunch of comments made by the other actors on their experiences. <BR>So if you are a true Beatle's fan and you're looking for a good, fun, insightful, and intimate movie of the Beatles, then don't hesitate to get this. But if you're one of those DVD freaks who like to get cool DVD's with all the cool extra material, I think you might be a bit disappointed in this little baby.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over and I just can't get enough.  The story line follows Jane Austen's novel perfectly.  Colin Firth gives a fabulous performance!  Definitely worth the $35.
B00007LTIL|5.0|the two best dead studio albums came out the same year go figure. about the same type of sound as workingmans dead but a little more steal guitar which was a favorite instrument of jerry garcia(he even played it for crosby,stills,nash and young on teach your children well). the hits(sugar magnlia, truckin'), concert favorites(friend of the devil,box of rain) and as the title says sheer beauty(ripple,brokedown palace). go buy it.

B000002KO1|5.0|Put a group of great musicians together, add Chrissie Hynde to the mix and you get an explosive debut album!<br />Strong solid rockers, touching ballads, and great song writing!<br />All pulled off with a hardcore edgy punk attitude!<br />The best release by the Pretenders and a Mystery Achievement yet to be matched!!!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I bought the DVD today, I am hoping that if I see it again it will make more sense!<br />I saw it the day it came out in the theaters, and I admit I had high expectations considering how much I loved the first one.  This one was great visually, I can't trash it there!  My favorite scenes are the ones with the twins, they are incredible!  My only issues with the movie are the writing and unnecessarily long scenes.  I'm willing to let it go that Neo has these amazing superpowers, yet he fights with all the Agent Smiths for 20 minutes and doesn't win, he retreats by flying away (why didn't he do that originally??).  I can forgive that, since in most fantasy stories there are things that won't make sense.  What irritated me was the extended Zion &amp; Neo/Trinity love scene which was beautifully done, but WAY too long.  I think a bit more editing would have made it 100 times better!<br />I am excited about the 3rd movie as well - I can't wait to see what happens!  Hopefully between seeing Reloaded on DVD and seeing the third one, I'll finally understand what the heck is going on. ;)
B00005MNP8|5.0|Parallel Lines is as fresh today as it was the first time I heard it.  This is one of a handful of releases that snapped the 70's out of the doldrums of music it was going through.<br />This is still by far the best release Blondie put out!  Edgy and soothing at the same time, with stunning musicianship, and the lovely Deborah Harry's infectious voice!<br />The result of this release was the challenge to other bands to step up, and the wellspring of great music that followed!
B00005JKC3|3.0|Visually, this movie was stunning.  I also thought the directing was pretty good.  I loved the action scenes (wanted more!!), especially the scenes where he is ripping apart tanks and running across the desert.  Very cool!!<br />The storyline was fantastic and I was really enjoying the movie, but then the end came.  And it was bad.  Half the people I know who saw this movie didn't understand what happened at the end and neither do I.  Is it some reference from the comic book?  What the heck is up with the blobby cloud that is supposedly his dad?  I don't have a clue!  A better explanation of the last 20-30 minutes of the movie would have made it a LOT better in my eyes.  I don't like a movie that I can't understand what is going on.
B00005B36H|5.0|To begin with let me just say this is the best albumn in the world(period). Honestly i cant stand any other type of rock or metal or watever the hell they call that crap they make.  Tool is in a genre of their own and it is more evolved than any music on the planet.  Maynards voice and lyrics are unbelievably incredible and thought provoking, and the music the rest of the crew makes has a sound that uv never heard.  I can ramble on for pages about this albumn but im just gonna get to the point....DO URSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS ALBUMN....ULL LIVE A BETTER LIFE!!!!!!!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The first scene of this movie is worth the ticket price all on it's own!  My only beef with the movie is that there wasn't nearly enough cool scenes with Nightcrawler, because after that first scene I just wanted more more more!  I won't go over the whole story, a lot of other people did in their reviews.  It was fun, action-packed and visually stunning!  Wolverine is back and amazing as ever, as is almost all the cast from X-Men 1.  Well worth the price, I can't wait for the DVD.  I'm ready for X-Men 3!
B000001IQH|5.0|A disc has to be pretty good for me to give it a full five stars and this one definately deserves five stars.  I have no problem listening to this disc over and over again without break.  It still has a fresh sound even after eight years.  &quot;Roots Radicals&quot;, &quot;Olympia WA.&quot;, &quot;Ruby Soho&quot;, &quot;She's Automatic&quot;, and &quot;As Wicked&quot; can all stand alone, yet you get them all together with this disc.  The rest of the tracks are less filler and are really more like intence segues between five power tracks.
0440237688|4.0|this book was allright.  but i didn't understand like why did the world change frokm regular to utopia and what went a way first like color or feelings.  also what happend to Jonas and Gaberal.  did they die or did they.  the best person in the book was the old man beacuse he was the only one knew what was going on the world and no one else knew.  i woould reccomend this book to any one who lilke sci fiction.  it is a great book to read on your own.
0783225970|4.0|More often I'm seeing alot of reviewers give the whole story.  Before I give my REVIEW, let me say to all those &quot;Reviewers&quot;; &quot;It's not a SYNOPSIS, it's a R-E-V-I-E-W!!  We don't need to hear your version of what the whole movie is about!!!<br />OK, now I can start.  The movie is good.  Al Pacino is brilliant.  What makes a great actor is story and great supporting actors.  Each of the actors/actresses in this movie really stand out on their own so you don't get a sense that Al Pacino carries the movie.  Violent, Yes.  Excessive Language, Yes.  But, it's reality.  I like the movie because of it's pace, it's wit and sometimes humor.  Very engaging performances.
1565123875|5.0|Achingly beautiful language in a story with political, philosophical, and psychological drama and realism. At times I wanted to look away at the pain, but the excitement and depth kept me transfixed.
0316666343|5.0|&quot;I was murdered on December 6, 1973,&quot; is the voice of 14-year-old Susie Salmon, ripped from this Earth at an age too young. Susie narrates this heartfelt and illuminating tale as she watches over those she's left behind. Her father, obsessed with finding Susie's killer. Her mother, withdrawn from everything and everyone. Lindsey, her 13-year-old sister, seemingly a pillar of strength, but completely numb on the inside. Buckley, their 4-year-old brother, who misses Susie and incessantly asks for her. The persistent Detective Len Fenerman. Ruth Connors, a girl from school whom Susie grazes as she leaves the Earth. Ray Singh, who had a crush on Susie and was the source of her first and only kiss. Susie also follows the movements of her killer. Through Susie's death, all of these lives will be forever entwined.<br />In the first chapter's narrative of the murder, there is just enough descriptive detail to get under your skin, forcing you to take a break in an effort to shake the images from your head.<br />Susie discovers that, now dead, &quot;life is perpetual yesterday.&quot; She describes &quot;my Heaven&quot; as being different for everyone, but often overlapping with the Heaven of someone else. &quot;You're given your simplest dreams&quot; in Heaven. There are no teachers in the school and the textbooks included Glamour and Vogue. Susie observes and listens, but cannot interact with Earth. &quot;All this made me crazy,&quot; she says, &quot;watching but not being able to steer the police.&quot; Although sometimes frustrated with her inability to communicate with Earth, Susie seems oddly at peace. Perhaps she hadn't yet accepted her fate.<br />Alice Sebold pens an incredibly well written story. More than just a story of a young girl who has died, The Lovely Bones is a journey of discovery, not only for Susie in her afterlife, but also for the family and friends who survived her, left behind, among the living. Certainly the best debut novel I've read, ever.
B00006690G|2.0|With Eminem claiming that he is presenting hip hop in its \\"most purest, most rawest\\", I have to wonder where that assumption comes from.   <BR>Ultimately hip-hop is about self-expression, which Eminem does as well as any other artist in rap.  Unfortunately, rap egoism and heroism are different.  Sure, Eminem can rap, and he can do it with a brilliant flair for meter, rhythm, and vocal intensity.  The problem?  He's just not saying anything.  <BR>Of course, that is a matter of debate.  The fact that Eminem expresses anger and rebellion and individuality is contradicted by blatant sexism and homophobia.  On this album, Eminem's ego once again takes center stage, only now it is no longer the torn and shattered self-image of The Marshall Mathers L.P. but rather the self-important statement of someone who actually believes everything good people say about him, and has major issues with those who don't believe in what he says.  <BR>It's not that I don't understand.  It's not that Eminem hasn't made some decent tracks.  It's just that behind the rhetoric and the sneer, there isn't much going on here.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|People Who don't like this movie are just not true Sci-Fi fans.  I really loved the way so much more about the true nature of the Matrix was revield and that of the Oricle.  The twins/ghosts were well explained in advance also.  Yes some parts were over done like the fight scene between Neo and a about a blazillin agent smiths, and the the party scene in Zion was just a bit too hedonistic for my liking.  But scenes like the opening scene with Trinity and her scorpian kick, and the freeway chase scene really seperates this movie from the Matix wanabee's.<br />All in all, the it was great with lots of exceptional special effects and blazing action.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can't remember ever being so unhappy about a cancelled TV show before. And it wasn't just me. It was my husband and everyone I knew, including my mother, who is not a big sci-fi fan, but she knows great when she sees it. This was the best character driven show in years, with elements of drama, comedy, horror, thriller, as well as that edge that you usually only get with something done independently of the big networks. But it had enough of a big network budget that the special effects were done flawlessly. It was a killer sci-fi movie, but it was never going to end, you were going to get to watch an hour of it every week! And then, knife through the heart, it was cancelled. I cannot recommend more highly that you buy this DVD collection. See the episodes IN ORDER! See the ones they NEVER SHOWED! And prepare yourself for THE MOVIE!
B000002A3T|4.0|To be honest, I had not really given PF much thought or ear since Dark Side of the Moon, just figuring they were still in the same rut and because &quot;classic rock&quot; stations played their past hits beyond reason.  Then a friend of mine was playing this cd in her car and I was surprised to hear it was these guys.  As a guitar player I must admit that Gilmore's style and tone is beyond reproach and the songs are fresh and performed with an amazing feel.  The production, of course, is immaculate.  Dedicated Floyd fans may dissect the lyrics for hidden messages to former bandmates and so on but I find the overall effect to be applicable to everyone, no matter how relevant the band's history may be.
B000002KIE|5.0|NOTE TO ALL LISTENERS OF GOOD CHARLOTTE; Go to hell! Anyone who needs that kind of punk will not stand Never Mind the Bollocks. This is what Punk is, harsh voices, slithering, fast, guitars, and A POINT TO THE SONGS!!!! Yes this will take you back to when there werent 5 million Starbuck and that how people wanted it. The &quot;punk&quot; name has been so tainted by Green Day spin-offs and the coperate revelation that teenagers are COMPLETE morons that in order to remember what punk is supposed to turn to this album. This one of the best albums ever, not best punk, or best british, or rock, one of the best ever on all charts. And to all doubters out there, anyone who can get banned from the BBC, and most major radio station and still go #1 with their album has something going for them.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|To buy Jet's album &quot;Get Born&quot; based on the single &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; is misleading.  There are 13 or so tracks on the album and about 6 of them are boring ballads that show Jet's gentler side.  Add to that the fact that the ballads sound like an Oasis cover band and you've got a pretty boring and uninspired album in your hands.  <br />The bands lead singer has a good voice and there are a few promising rock songs on the disc (including the single), but I just can't get past all the generic ballads.  <br />If you want all-out rock, I recommend either UK's THE LIBERTINES or NY's BONA ROBA.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet have been described as derivative and unoriginal many times before, but on the flip side, have also been hailed as the ones who will bring back the fun in mainstream rock as it really should be.  Derivative and unoriginal? Sure, Jet aren't out to change the world or anything, and they don't pretend to.  This 1doesn't change the fact that Get Born (their first full-length) is undeniably catchy and definitely a lot of fun!  A nice balance of fast-paced rock songs and appropriately sensitive ballads (as in not overproduced and oversentimentalized soppy songs), the whole album is an awesome display of what Jet are doing and will have the means to do for a long while I'm sure.  As soon as the world picks up on these guys, they're going to soar! (Horribly cliche pun really not intended... haha...)  So, while pretentious rock critics can turn up their noses and dismiss Jet, everyone else can have a lot of fun with the music by these awesome guys who are ready to play some rock! Besides, if catchy songs like Rollover DJ (featured on their raw and energetic four-soung EP as well as Get Born) and Are You Gonna Be My Girl aren't enough to entice you to hear more from a band like Jet, I don't know what will!
078322740X|5.0|I won't bother to go over the story line of this flick, you can read some of the others for that.<br />This movie is a lot of fun, and Steve Martin is Great---Again<br />You won't be sorry if you get this film.
B000001ESJ|5.0|I am a huge fan of Rush. I enjoy every single one of their musical eras, but the one that that this album was made in is my favorite. With A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres, Rush made their most complex and progressive music in their whole career. After 2112, Rush released this album showing that they'd matured in a year.....a lot. This album contains some of their most complex arrangements which is saying a lot for Rush. Every song on here rates from good to excellent, my favorite being the 11 minute Xanadu. This album also contains Rush's first \\"hit\\" Closer To the Heart. The rest is brilliant as well including the chaotic Cygnus X-1. If you're new to Rush, I'd say start off with Moving Pictures or Permanent Waves, but this is an essential recording and truly one of Rush's best.
0792838068|5.0|This kind of movie is an acquired taste.<br />That said, every emotion in this film rang true for<BR>me.  These people seemed real and very vulnerable, especially Elizabeth Shue. It was just spare enough to say the important things in the relationship, leaving out all the detritus and other pointless details.  <br />Mike Figgis really looked closely at these people at their worst moments and didn't flinch. I was fascinated - it spoke right to the deepest part of the human condition.<br />This is a rare work of art that will outlast us.
B00005JLTM|5.0|Well, to begin I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of the matrix movies (including the ENTER THE MATRIX computer game). I remember back in 1999, many people didn't even care about the first movie. Now in 2003 I've known a lot of people that don't like the sequel. They asked how could it be possible for Neo to have all those amazing powers, some kind of God-like attributes. When I asked them if they liked the first part they were surprised due to fact that they didn't know that there is a first Matrix movie, I was completely shocked, horrified. They even have that kind of courage to talk nonsense about THE MATRIX RELOADED, how can they talk that way if they haven't seen the first movie? Now I know for sure why they can't understand almost the whole movie. The way I rate this movie is due to the fact that it is a SCIENCE FICTION movie. I highlight science fiction for those who talk bad about the movie. Whenever you go to a theater, you have to be aware of what kind of movie you are about to see and experience. If I'm just about to see Matrix Reloaded, then special effects will have to be used to give the movie its reason of being. If you don't like science fiction movies or special effects, then what the hell are you sitting there, move your ass and go to see the Lion King then, for instance. Unluckily, many people agree that the movie sucks, that there are parts that are just fillers. I strongly believe that The Matrix is the most amazing science - fiction story ever done. The cast is just perfect and well prototyped for a story of this magnitude. I'm aware that the first part had a special impact on me and almost everybody. But then I got to think and ask myself. Have you ever seen a movie like that?<BR>Have you ever seen those special effects? Have you ever seen that kind of revolution when talking about movies' categories?The answer to these threee questions : NO, NO, NO. Though the first part didn't get the deserved audience attention, it is a 4 Academy AwardWinner. I really enjoyed The Matrix Reloaded right from the start, because it begins just like the first part, with trinity fighting cops including the amazing special effects. The sequence of Neo and agents trying to eliminate him is the best computer generated sequence ever. I'm not forgetting about the freeway chase with Trinity showing her skills with a motorcycle. To finish, the violent collision of the big trucks, just perfect. We'll have to wait weeks to watch the end of this whole story in THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. Finally , for those who criticise the movie and the story within, specially adult people, they have to know that THE MATRIX movies' mania is not impossible, it's INEVITABLE.<br />Write me : raiderstate@hotmail.com I'd be glad to see your comments about the movie whether good or bad.
B000093BDX|4.0|Music is good, but I wish they put more strictly Beach Boys music on here instead of rehash's of 1950's songs that the Beach Boys had sung.  Quality of the 1950's rehashes is pretty typical of what you'd expect the Beach Boys to do (probably not the best out there, but it's still decent).  Seems to be missing some of their big hits as well (The Honda song and Catch a Wave).  Perhaps those songs should have been put on there instead of the rehashes.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I couldn't get into this movie. It was a maze that went nowhere.Everybody who liked it is chanting,&quot;Wait for the final movie then you'll love Reloaded.Reloaded is just half of a movie .Judge it by that standard.&quot; Well, they are right. Reloaded doesn't stand by itself.It's begging to be explained.It needs something to justify it's gumbo of scenimatic atrocities.Oh, the horrible fight scenes! And many nerds out there want to make themselves feel better about themselves by saying it's an intelluctual movie that can only be understood by the elite of mankind which just so happens to include themselves.How pathetic. My opinion is if you are more of an artist at heart you will hate it. If you are more of an artist at heart and very smart you will be offended and somewhat angered by it. If you like action flicks, you will think it's meagerly okay. If you like sci-fi(to the point of dressing up in Star-Trek garb), you will probably like it. If you are heavily into special effects, it's a toss-up. Rent it first, then decide on whether to buy it.
B000006045|5.0|I bought it for the dark and gothic song 'man next door'.Only for this track it is worth to buy this album.Its atmosphere , ritm ,lyrics and Horace Andy's vocals are faultless and impressive.Although there are nice songs like 'risingson', 'group four' and, 'black milk',i couldnt find any other track that would give the same effect as 'man next door'.So for this track I give five stars to this cd.
B000089RVR|4.0|I knew that Dido was here to stay and here is my proof! No Angel is still one of the albums I listen to often and Life For Rent will surely follow in the same footsteps. Her voice is divine and her music so pure...like a secret water fall in the woods.
B000006NUW|5.0|This boxed set of Motown's early years leaves out a lot of obvious songs, which leaves room for a lot of wonderful songs that you don't normally hear, but which are well worth a listen.<br />My favorite of the four CD's here is the first, containing many of the early classics that were huge hits in America but not in Britain, where Motown was slow to catch on. Only My guy, Dancing in the street and Baby love, near the end of this CD, were major hits in the UK for the original Motown artists, though other songs became UK hits via cover versions. This CD is particularly notable for several classic songs by the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Miracles and Mary Wells, though Stevie Wonder, the Four Tops, the Temptations and Marvin Gaye are also represented here by early examples of their greatness.<br />The second and third CD's show Motown at the peak of their power with many classic songs included, although Diana Ross and the Supremes are poorly represented and plenty of other classics are also omitted. However, the absence of these songs leaves room to include songs by Chris Clark, Kim Weston, Brenda Holloway, the Contours, the Monitors, the Elgins, Shorty Long, Rita Wright (better known as Syreeta) and Bobby Taylor.<br />The final CD contains more high quality music but it was around this time that Motown started to slip as some of their stars departed to other labels and the replacements were not always of the same standard. So the final CD is great, but the first three are even better.<br />A companion boxed set covering the years from 1972 is also available. There are great songs on there too but not as many as can be found here.<br />This box is well presented with a superb booklet, but if you want a sixties hits collection, there are many other collections that will suit you better. For the ultimate Motown sixties hits collection, I recommend the British triple CD, Motown gold, which contains over eighty songs digitally re-mastered, almost all of them classics, though a few were hits in Britain but not America.em classics, though a few were hits in Britain but not America.
B000002OVJ|5.0|What more can be said...this recording is amazing.  Townshend's tone is spectacular, Entwistle is a master of the bass, Moon is a phenominal drummer, Daltry is great.   These are 4 monster musicians at their best.
B000001GEM|5.0|As important as Brahms is to the Classical world and as great as his music is, it would be a far lesser thing without the incredible interpretation of von Karajan.  I choose to look past all the many criticisms  - too stolid, too slow, too grand, too careful - and look at the final product.<br />Brahms inhabited Karajan's soul as no other composer with the possible exception of Richard Strauss.  I have the Symphonies (two versions), the Concertos and now the Requiem.  The music is simultaneously beautiful and touching, moving on several levels. I have often wondered about the artists and their fount of inventiveness.  What is Brahms &quot;trying to say&quot;?  This is not the traditional Requiem of a Verdi, Mozart, Schubert or Beethoven.  No, it is more a celebration of the human spirit.  If you must get only one version, this is the one.  The voices are clear, the orchestra just the right tone, the longing and &quot;Germanenss&quot; of the music stand out above all.  It has that haunting forest mood that inhabits so much of Brahm's music.
B000060P79|5.0|When I got this CD I don't know what I expected, but when I listened to it, I was like WOAH! THIS IS FABULOUS! I really reccommend it to EVERYONE! It has something for all. :P
B00005JM02|5.0|When I first saw finding Nemo with my friends on the release day, my life changed forever. There is so much in this movie that is so good. This is by far the best Pixar Anamation Studios movie, and they will only get better. Who says rated G movies are no fun?
B000002KGT|5.0|I listened to this last week for the first time in about 20 years. It's just as great, and perhaps even more so that it was when released. Nicks' voice was beautiful before she ruined it with booze and drugs. Christine was wonderful then, and Buckingham played a very melodic guitar. It's amazing that these songs were recorded under such personal turmoil with relationships breaking up. Heck, I couldn't stand being in the same room with my ex much less working with her!
0792107683|4.0|Shane is the title of the movie, and the main character of this well-made Western. Alan Ladd plays a quiet stranger - wearing buckskins and a gun at his hip - who wanders into a Western community where a range war between farmers and ranchers is about to play out. The farmers' leader is Joe Starrett, played by tough, reliable Van Heflin. He wants the farmers to hold fast to their land, to stand up to rancher Rufe Riker and his hired hands.    Shane puts away his buckskins and his gun and takes a job with Starrett. He does odd chores around the Starrett homestead and strikes up a relationship with Starrett's boy Joey and Joey's mother.    But there is always the dark shadow of Riker and his men trying to push the farmers off their land.    Shane obviously has a violent past, made clear by his ability to handle a gun and to defend himself with his fists. Though he signs on to work for Starrett, it's clear that his ways are really closer to those of the ranchers than to those of the farmers.     Shane's need to use his gun again provides the climax and the ending of this Western.
B000000OR9|1.0|Man, what all those reviews below are talking about?! This album is nothing more than hair metal. And worst of all: hair metal coming at the end of the nineties, when all this stupid genre was falling apart (Thanks God!)<br />Just check the guys in the photos of the album (Sykes, Franklin and Appice). They are dressed in the best Poison and Ratt way!<br />And about what riff you're talking in &quot;Riot&quot;? There's only a resemblance of a riff, it's sheer pop metal!!<br />And talk about the drums sound of Carmine Appice. It's that typical &quot;digitalized&quot; sound of that period, it seems a machine.<br />I just don't get so many praise for this album. It deservedly failed,  not due to Geffen's lack of promotion, but due to its sheer mediocrity.
0385484518|1.0|Yes, Morrie is knowledgeable<BR>No, he did not have all the answers, afterall, he's just a human (was)<BR>Yes, it's a touching story<BR>No, it's not the first touching story of life - you see the same stoyline more in a Hollywood movie (maybe a deal of adaptation is already underway)<BR>Yes, the author probably made millions out of this (thanks to all readers who are prone to hype)<BR>No, I don't think he's really into Morrie's teaching, afterall, you don't see him make tribute to his most beloved mentor through a charity fund named after Morrie with all the money earned, or really carry out the learning. Instead he made a  bookdeal by leveraging his relationship with a overnight sensation of the TV, and as a self-centered opportunist, shallowly recorded the teaching as his blueprint roadmap to his fatten piggy bank.
B00005V0X5|2.0|I have this album on tape and was ecstatic when the rendition of &quot;these boots&quot; was re-added to the cd, since it had been removed form the original. I almost puked when I heard every cuss word had been blipped out with a really annoying beep sound. The original remake of the old tune was great but, that blipping in the new cut sounds like junk! I don't have to have cuss words but, that blipping was like exasperating nails being driven into my head!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave must save rock...the current MTV rock gods are pop-punk garbage with all the teenage angst you've been trying to forget about.  I don't want Benji from good charlotte.  I don't want any more sappy love songs from bands wanting to be Green Day more then anything...I want Rock.  I want Chris Cornell's voice to pierce the heart of everybody who listens to him.  I want Tom Morello's guitar shredding so hard that the heavens will hear him.  I dont want Avril Lavigne trying to &quot;complicate&quot; things.  I want to hear &quot;Cochise&quot;  or &quot;show me how to live&quot; while blazing down the highway.  So my point ladies and gentlemen?  I hate cheese, and cheese is what is being fed to us on a daily basis on our radio stations and our music TV shows.  We're living in a generation where everything has become soft, and easy.  Audioslave stands for something else.  They stand for that person that chooses to walk his own path, and screw everyone else because eventually they will see the light...The last remaining light.
B000056N8X|3.0|The first Highlander film is still the best but considering how much of a disaster Highlander 2 and Highlander: The Final Dimension was, this one was a worthy successor to the first film. <br />This one is loosley based on Highlander: The Series with elements of the first film mixed in so I'd recommend seeing the series and the first movie before seeing this. That being said, Adrian Paul is a worthy successor to Christopher Lambert if there are any other Highlander films. While I hated seeing Connor MacLeod die (Lambert's character), it was a passing of the torch to Duncan, who is more than capable of handling it.<br />I have two big problems with this film. 1. Duncan being married! Why didn't this come up during the series? This would've made a great plot during the series and would've put a strain on any one of Duncan's relationships (Tessa, Ann, Amanda). 2. The MacLeod fight. Great dream match but I would've rather have seen it in a final film than right now.<br />Other than that, its not a bad film. Not great but superior to the other sequels.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Bowie has been around so long now that it's easy to dismiss a new album when comparing it with his already established classics. However, when you consider that Bowie is pushing 60, and that he can still reinvent himself AND rock out, then you get &quot;Reality&quot;. It is a close cousin to the excellent &quot;Heathen&quot; and just as consistent. It was a good idea to have an old hand (Tony Visconti) in the co-producing chair because it give Bowie's vision some edge and clarity. The cd kicks off with a trio of avant-garde bullets with &quot;New Killer Star&quot;, a cover of Modern Lovers &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; and &quot;Never Get Old&quot;. Not one note, rhythm or beat missed. Then there's a small speedbump with my least favorite track &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot; which is slow and plodding compared to the first three tracks where Bowie is in his element. Things get back on track with more avant-garde in the form of &quot;Looking For Water&quot;, &quot;She'll Drive&quot; and possibly the best song on the disc, &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Fall Dog Bombs The Moon&quot;. My second least favorite song is the rather listless cover of George Harrison's &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;. The song &quot;Reality&quot; rounds out my least favorite tracks with what reminds me of Bowie's Tin Machine-era work. Lastly, there's the unusual, almost seven minute, opus of the jazzy poetry reading &quot;Bring Me The Disco King&quot;. Bowie keeps producing cds that continue to be challenging and experimental. This is a sign of a great artist who is not afraid to take risks and expand his musical boundaries--something his contemporaries would do well to take a cue from.
B00005JMC6|5.0|11 year-old newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes literally shines in this endearing and moving tale about a Maori girl Pai, whose belief conquers every obstacle before her.  You don't have to know the original book; you just have to see the radiating charm of Keisha as Pai.<br />When Pai was born, her twin brother was dead.  Though this misfortune didn't alienate the chief of the family Koro from his granddaughter, it is painfully obvious that he wanted a boy, not a girl.  Among the male-donimating tradition, Koro still seeks for the one to inherit the tradition of the people among the local boys, and starts to teach it in school.  <br />But it is Pai, now grown up a lovely girl, who thinks that she is Paikea, the decendent of the Whale Rider who arrived there from the sea a long time ago.  Her zeal, however, unwittingly causes the wrath of her grandfather, who would not admit any female succeeding the name.  But Pai knows that she is right, and we too.<br />The simplicity of the story does not damage the film; it rather enhances it to the level of myth, and with the director's skillful descriptions of the Maori society where not everybody is happy to live, the film is given a colorful characters and some of the amusingly wry humor.<br />But it is Keisha Castle-Hughes who will impress you with her charms.  She is sweet, she is amiable, and most of all she is natural.  Castle-Hughes, who is 'discovered' by the same agent who found Anna Paquin, is a good testimony that you don't have to attend the acting school to be a star.  <br />There are also great performance from Rawari Paratene as Koro, whose character might at first be looked at in the negative light.  He succeeds in raising his portrait of the grandfather to tragedy, and we are not angry with, but sorry for him.<br />Pai's speech given at the latter half of the film is one of the greatest moments in the movie history, easily matching the Auden quotations by John Hannah in \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\\"  Her sincerewords would never fail to move you, and that part alone is worth the time of your life.  In short, a must to see.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Who fans will not be disappointed in the great work done to convert this film to DVD.  This is rock as rock was meant to be. The extras on the second disk make it worth the cost of the total package, especially the Q&amp;A with Roger Daltrey.<br />For those who have teenage children who constantly listen to rap and other pretenders, sit them down with this movie and show them what rock really is all about.  Especially good after all these years is the closing &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; sequence, which gets my vote as Greatest Rock Song Ever Recorded. The band is ticked off, and playing as if they were ready to commit mayhem on a grand scale.  Outstanding film.

0385504209|4.0|As someone brought up in the Catholic faith, this really makes you think.  For example, doesn't it make sense that a young man of that time who was a carpenter's son would have been married?  Is it so different to believe a human was born of a &quot;virgin&quot; than Budda coming from a lotus?  It is all a matter of faith and that is what he points out so beautifully.  So what do you really believe?  Don't take it all for granted.  After all, weren't &quot;indulgences&quot; really just a way for the popes to make money for the church?  Not everything we were taught in parochial school was true.  This book makes you want to sort out fact from fiction and think outside the box.  In the end, it is a novel, a great read, and good material for a round table discussion.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Yes, this is part of a trilogy but as a movie by itself it lacks the goods to be satisfying. There are too many questions that are raised here but not an effort to at least give a hint about what is going on. In another words, this film needed to at least give a solid story as part as a whole than to cut it off at the end with out much explanation about what is happing right in front of you. A good example of a solid middle entry in a trilogy is The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It not only expanded what was set forth with the first entry but also gave a solid story with an ending that raises the issues of what will come in the next chapter.  <br />Don't get me wrong, The Matrix Reloaded is a good film but it needed to stand on its own feet to be a solid movie.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Starship Troopers was one of my favorite books from High School and I was looking forward to the movie.  This has got to be the worse adaption of a Sci-fi book since David Lynch's butchering of Dune.<br />God, where to start?  A B-list cast of no talent mannequins, satrirical commercials that are a rip off from Robocop, but seem jarringly out of place, an awful script (yeah right, bug farts from a planet light years away cause an asteroid to destroy Brazil), and a futuristic army that basically isn't any better armed (or armoured) than any 20th century third world nation.<br />The bugs are cool, though.
0425170349|5.0|When I first started reading this book I felt kind of query because the first scene starts out in an airplane while the narrator (main character) Jack is nervous. As predicted and led up to there are terrorists on the plane that attempt to hijack it. (9-11??) Kind of ironic but Clancy is known for writing scenes and the in some way, shape, or form they come true. This book so far is very good and I can't put it down. Once you get hooked on Clancy books you will always be a fan. The best part is the detail Clancy puts in evaluating each agent (CIA, SEALS) it is as if the book wasn't fiction. I rate this book high and recommend it to anyone who enjoys military related books.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Albums rarely deserve five stars; I can recall giving only four other albums such a worthy rating, and while some may question me putting Nickelback's &quot;The Long Road&quot; beside Metallica's &quot;Black Album,&quot; this album, for whatever reason, struck me, and I haven't been able to push it away just yet. Upon hearing their radio-friendly &quot;Someday,&quot; I initially prepared for more of &quot;Silver Side Up.&quot; Now, don't get me wrong, it was a fine album, actually better than I had anticipated, but I like a fresh approach by bands of Nickelback's calibur. They did not fail to disappoint this time around.<br />While I was drawn to this album by the overplayed third track, I quickly abandoned it after my first listen. &quot;The Long Road&quot; simply has so much more to offer...yeah, it's a lot of the same, I agree, but while this album reflects &quot;Silver Side Up,&quot; the songs are fresher, catchier, and generally...better. I will not rate the bonus tracks, but they are some of the best on the album.<br />1.) Flat on the Floor: 2/5. I don't like it for whatever reason.<BR>2.) Do This Anymore: 3/5. Decent, but nothing special. <BR>3.) Someday: 3/5. About the same as the previous track, I guess.<BR>4.) Believe it or Not: 4/5. Louder, faster, better. <BR>5.) Feelin' Way Too Damn Good: 4/5. First turned away from it, but it grew on me. <BR>6.) Because of You: 4.5/5. Arguably the album's finest. Heavier than the rest, and more like &quot;Never Again&quot; from &quot;SSU.&quot;<BR>7.) Figured You Out: 3/5. It's not too bad, but there's better.<BR>8.) Should've Listened: 3/5. The same as the above mentioned.<BR>9.) Throw Yourself Away: 4.5/5. Starts like a song from Metallica's &quot;Saint Anger.&quot; Luckily it shies away quickly enough.<BR>10.) Another Hole In the Head: 4/5. Almost reminds me of a 3DD cover, yet I find it amusing nevertheless.<BR>11.) See You At the Show: 4/5. Slower, deeper, a great ending.<br />Add these to the supurb bonus tracks--including an awesome cover of &quot;Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)&quot;--and you have one hell of an album here. Give it a shot...if you liked their previous attempts, you'll find this enjoyable.
B00005JLTM|4.0|I love The Matrix series just as much as the next person.  It is one of the best ones out there.  The first Matrix was extremely good and made me want the second one mere seconds after it ended.  I saw the second one, Reloaded, in theaters and I loved it.  Now that's just me and you can think whatever you want about it.  I loved it because it went further into the story and introduced new characters, locations, vehicles, and fighting moves.  It showed us Zion and the people who live there.  The action sequences and fight scenes were amazing.  I thought the best ones were the burly brawl and the freeway chase.<BR>     Now for the things that brought it down.  First of all, I think some didn't like it as much because of all the hype it caused.  They expected too much from it and that made them forget that it was actually pretty good.  Also, the story was kind of confusing, but the third movie should explain a lot.  It was almost like they tried to explain and cram too much into a single movie.  <BR>     If you can look past the minor problems, then there is a really good movie here.  It isn't as good as the first one, but if you're a fan of the series or you just happened to watch this for some other reason, I really suggest that you pick this one up.  If you have a DVD player, get it on DVD.  If not, I'm sorry.  The Matrix: Reloaded is one of my favorite movies, right up there with the first one.
B00003CXB7|5.0|I watched this movie a few days ago, and I was blown away by it. It is probably the most unconventional film I've ever seen in my life. The movie is pretty much surgeons playing pratical jokes during the Korean War. That's it. And yet, it's more complex than that.<br />The film is better than the TV series, that's for sure. I love this movie. It had some great comedy (I mean, come on, who doesn't love the prank they did with Hotlips?), some interesting drama, and a LOT of cynicsm. Robert Duvall was my favorite actor in the movie, right next to the great Elliot Gould.<br />There were some scenes that confused me, but this is a movie that needs to be watched a 2ns, or 3rd time. It's very confusing if you don't know what the atmosphere was like in 1970. Just a great film, glad to have seen it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a show that came on the heels of Fox's usual brilliant decision-making--right after it cancelled my beloved Dark Angel.  I first thought this show would be awful, but I sat down and watched it--and it was love.  Truly.  It's rare to find a show that can be taken seriously that also made me laugh out loud in every episode.  The writing was extraordinary, and the actors/actresses were absolute gold.  It was really like watching a movie each time around.  Yet again, Fox shot itself in the foot and iced another good show.  Nonetheless, at least the DVD is soon to come.  At least they had the decency to do that.  Come on, sing it with me: \\"Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand.  But I don't care--I'm still free.  You can't take the skies from me...\\"
B000002MFN|4.0|This is one of the 4 Madonna cd's I own(Music,American Life,Ray of Light, and the Evita Soundtrack), and this one is by far the best.I, unlike what seems like the whole darn world, don't consider Madonna to be anything much more than a clever businesswoman.She  changes her image with each new year, and since most of the music buying public is a  bit thickheaded, they just go nuts everytime her hair is a new color. Besides this, I don't consider Madonna much of a musician.Sure she's had some fun, frothy dance tunes, but who actually listens to that stuff anymore?But Erotica is the one exception. It's the one place where I listened to Madonna, and it felt, for the first time that I was actually listening to the work of a true artist-someone who wasn't just looking to sell their product, but cared deeply about their music. IT's the only time where she sounded intelligent without all the contrived,spirtual pretense that plagued her later albums. It was the first time where she was able to keep things upbeat and goroovalicious, but remain consistently musical.This album is good.Musically, it sounds like it could've been recorded today, and not 11 years back.It's incredibly fresh, and timeless in terms of sound.It's a mix of traditional dance/pop and warm house/soul.And practically every track is a keeper.The opener, a thumping house groove is deliciously trance-ey and atmospheric.Madonna remade Peggy Lee's classic 1950's tune \\"Fever\\" into an icy dance track, and it works.The warm sax glides wonderfully to her sensual desires for oral sex on Where Life Begins.Deeper and Deeper is a swirling dance track-its absolute perfection, and is guaranteed to make you move. Rain is a gorgeous ballad, rich and cool at the same time.Secret Garden, the closing track has some of her best lyrics, and is no holds barred creativity.Vocally, who ever praised Madonna?She however, even though vocally limited sounds mature and collected.This is an album that I think that even people who dislikeMadonna like myself(or even hate) will be able to enjoy.It's level of artistry is too high to slide through by anyone unnoticed.And make sure to get the explicit version for inclusion of the hip hop track Did You Do It, which might as well be the slyest,sexiest hip hop track of the past decade.And I hate hip hop.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Matrix was immensely enjoyable for its clean cut action, simple plot and clearly defined characters. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark it had a simple story line, clear distinctions between the good guys/girls and the baddies.<br />Sequels have the annoying habit of complicating storylines and adding meaningless threats to distract and annoy the audience. Reloaded almost achieved this. The action was good as were the effects, although the powers of Neo in the Matrix are more akin to those of superman rather than those of a mythical hero struggling to understand his destiny and accept it.<br />Unlike the original Matrix, which was a complete film in its own right, this is half a film. Many questions are left unanswered ...is the prophecy true ?, is the &quot;real world&quot;..real or just anotjher level of the Matrix?...<br />To judge this film without seeing its conclusion is like trying to judge the future. A well thought out third part will nicely end the triology, however an attempt to over sophisticate the story will simply leave one wondering why they ever made two sequels.<br />The advice is wait and see.
B00005JMFO|4.0|If there is a film out this year that is destined to make your heart smile and eyes tear, it's this film. It's Christmas time again in London as unexpected (almost magical) things happen in very simple, heartening ways to the most unlikely people. With love lost and love found, courage found and courage lost, this movie is all about the love we have in our daily lives. The love we receive from those unknown people to us (sometimes form those who show slight animosity toward us.)<br />The characters will capture your heart (Emma Thompson is phenomenal.) For me, the scene that really did capture me was that of Emma Thompson in her bedroom listening to Joni Mitchell's perennial Both Sides Now. That scene made me cry.<br />This is the sweetest movie I have seen this year. I highly recommend seeing it during the Holidays with people you love.
B000084T18|5.0|If this album is so bad, then how come 50 went 6 times platinum! and sold 872,082 albums the 1st week his album came out. Many people people may dislike 50's album but its just a matter of taste. I like his album. His lyrics portray his struggle growing up and being one of the biggest drug dealers in Jamaica Queens. So if u like 50's album cop it. ITS OFF THA HOOK
B000063DFS|5.0|Yes!!! Not since the Blizzard of Ozz album has Ozzy come out with such a great studio album. The album flows, has attitude, and has some of Ozzy's greatest songs ever. If I was to pick Ozzy's best album without Randy Rhodes or Black Sabbath, I'd have to say 'No More Tears'.
B00005QG9J|3.0|As a big fan of Incubus, including the sometimes-derided slower numbers such as I Miss You, the idea of a softer, mellowed-out album appealed, but the result seems disappointing. It's a terrible cliché to say 'I prefer their earlier, less commercial stuff', but sadly that is the case.<br />Especially hideous is Mexico, where the volcals ar etoo whiny and the song structure repetitive. 11AM and Echo fail to hit any real emotive crescendo either, and A few of the rock tracks seem a little by-the numbers as well.<br />It's not all bad news though - Are You In? is an innvoative stylish track, decidedly funky and showing a real turntable leaning, and Blood on the Ground and Circles rock nicely enough. Warning is soemthing of a grower, amking it an odd single, and Wish You Were Here was quite a good lead-off single.<br />Overall, this sin;t good enough though. Having lowered themselves to work with Kelly Osbourne, you ahve to worry for their future. They claim that the next album will be mroe rock - I hope that proves to be the case.
B000002B7S|3.0|First of all Jake E. Lee is an awesome guitar player. Jake was not the problem with this album, it was Ozzy.<br />It hit Ozzy like a ton of bricks when Randy Rhodes died, and why shouldn't it? The world will never know of Randy's true potential to the musical world. He wanted to do so much more with his guitar. But back to the album.....<br />This is the one album in Ozzy's career when Sharon controled everything. Ozzy probably didn't even know any of the songs until he started singing them in the studio. He was seriously messed up on drugs, alcohol, depression, etc. To this day I remember reading in Hit Parader back in the mid-80's that Ozzy called this album 'weak'. That's an understatement. The title track is a classic and kicks ass, but what about the rest of the album? Ever hear Ozzy sing any of these other songs live in the last 20 years? Hell no. It's mostly fluff material with waaaaaaaaaaay to much keyboard and synthesizer work. I mean c'mon, sometimes you'd think this music was written for ELO, Asia, or REO Speedwagon.<br />Hey I'm a big Sabbath and Ozzy fan, but this CD doesn't see the light of day too much. I think once he got his head back he was able to record 'The Ultimate Sin' with a much heavier sound.
B000094DUP|4.0|Delta Goodrem is only 19, but her story already ahs more suprises, dramas, ironies and downright amazing songs than many older artists. Having overlapped her music career with a cahracter in Australian soap Neighbours, her public persona is quite hard to fathom. <br />More 'striking' that drop dead gorgeous, she has a certain gawkiness and doesn't seem primed for fame. It's sad that her hair was her finesst feature. Unlike certain other soap-stars-turned singers, she doesn't remove her clothes for publicity's sake, writes and plays her own material, and writes sophistocated mature ballads.<br />First single Born To Try is especially good. Perhaps the most wise, inspirational, subtle song ever written by a teenage girl, the lyrics show what a person she is. Needless to say, these traits will help in her current battle.<br />Most songs focus on love, which isn't something I usually like a whole album of, but these tracks pull all the right heart-strings, and are enlivened by amazing vocals and piano. Predictable and Butterfly are perhaps the finest, strange that neither were singles, although the title track is an understandable choice.<br />The only slight negative is that the record lacks variety and innovation in palces, and could benefit from subtle Dido / David Gray style electronics. Fingers crossed that there will be time for this.
B000002IPZ|4.0|Dude you need to listen to this album again. Seven Days of May, Face in the Sky, Beginning of the end, and the title track rip! Chuck Billy is one of the greatest metal vocalists EVER! Testament kicks and is TRUE metal.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|I agree (...)that this album wasn't as good as Poses.  That being said, this is still a great effort and I am enjoying listening to it.  My favorite tracks are the first two.  Oh What a World is a great sing-a-long track that samples Bolero.  It struck me as funny that Rufus would have a TV commercial advertising his album, but yet it was appropriate that it aired during Queer Eye.  I think I like I Don't Know What It Is even better - although it took me a while to realize that it was quoting song lyrics from the theme to Three's Company!!!
B000002B7U|4.0|80's Ozzy, you gotta love it. He was a lard butt wearing shiny sequins and gowns. What a hoot. Well it was the decade of craziness, so we must forgive the Ozz a little.<br />I think this is one of Ozzy's best albums when compared to anything he did without Randy or Sabbath. &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; and it's video gave Ozzy some much needed pressence on MTV (not to mention the hot chick in the zebra spandex &quot;It is Julie!!&quot;)<br />Much harder edged album than Bark at the Moon which I never cared for. Jake E. Lee was what he was, a competant 80's guitar slinger. Sure he sounds a lot like Bruce Kulick, but he did what he did and succeeded.<br />Favorite track here, and also one of his heaviest riffs is the title track 'The Ultimate Sin'. That bass and guitar intro just does it.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  It's even better than No Angel!
B000002IOJ|5.0|Now this is what thrash is all about. Chuck Billy to this day is still one of the best metal vocalists ever. Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson make an awesome guitar team that can explode your speakers.<br />The title track is a roller coaster ride, nuff said! 'The Ballad' is OK, but seems a little out of place on this album. But when you play on stage at 1000 miles per hour, you got to slow down once to prevent your fingers from melting. I just can't believe they made a video for it. But it was the 80's and Testament needed money like everyone else and 'metal ballads' and 'power ballads' were the way to cash in.<br />Other favorites include Time is COming, Perilous Nation, and Greenhouse effect. If you call yourself a metalhead, you can't be without Testament in your CD collection.
6304082428|5.0|This is a wonderful, captivating movie, and I love it from begining to finish. Firth and Ehle make a wonderful couple, and the story of head-strong Elizabeth Bennett and her suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy will reach the hearts of anyone. Don't miss this wonderful story!
B000002UUX|5.0|Rust In Peace is without a doubt, Megadeth's best album ever. You'll never get disappointed with an album like this, i mean, it has it all: Outstanding and hi-speed guitar riffs, very good lyrics and great guitar solos. Marty Friedman's collaboration in this album is great, remarkable. <br />The next two Megadeth albums, Countdown To Extinction and Youthanasia, are very good too, but they don't have the furious speed and crushing riffs of this one. You can't go wrong with an album like this, truly a Metal Classic.
0780619951|1.0|Yes folks, it really is THAT bad. Brando is funny playing a loon, but then he gets killed for no good reason. His mini-Brando sidekick is pitifully ugly, too; you feel sad looking at him. David Thewlis is a fine actor, but he has trouble reacting properly to the people in bad make-up and the computer generated mutant rats. Somehow, everything explodes in the end. This is a horrible film, not even so-bad-it's-good (like, say, Showgirls).
B00009V7T2|5.0|This cd kicks ass!!!!. I recomend for everyone to buy this cd. First of all it's incredible, and the way that I describe this awesome concept cd is that to me &quot; it soothes the pain &quot;. It can make you feel really smart or really dumb by listening to it. Everyone song has a special meaning and it follows one another. It's totally one of the best cds I've heard so far this year. The melody, the rythym, the lyrics, everything is just greatly put together in order to make the message clear. Awesome cd, awesome band, great voice, kick ass long songs, good to go to sleep to. 11 out of 10 ;-)
B00006GFAB|2.0|The first five tracks are studio cuts, which were never very good. If you want those five songs, buy Alive. Then there's a handful of good songs featuring the original band, including songs from Destroyer and Rock and Roll Over. But those songs aren't necessary because you should just buy those albums instead. I mean, what record collection is complete without Destroyer?<br />Then things get a little weird --- but in a good way. The song from Ace's solo album is unlike any other Kiss song. It's good, but different. So is I Was Made for Loving You, Kiss' best (but not only) disco song. By the end of the CD, you get to hear the band tread water, playing songs written by Michael Bolton (Forever) and some form of public response to all those loony parents claiming the band was really called Knights in Satan's Service (God Made Rock and Roll for You).<br />Instead of this, just buy Destroyer, Alive, Rock and Roll Over, Ace's solo album, and maybe Alive II. That's all you need.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I and a couple others noticed that the wide screen version cuts off the tops of the foreheads of the actors in the movie and the proportions of the actors are a little stretched, it's really annoying. I'll be returning it for the full screen version. The full screen version is supposed to be okay. I won't even watch this version.  So much for quality control.
078322608X|3.0|Terry Gilliam took a studio assignment for this movie. If he didn't direct it, someone else would have. They hired him while the pre-production was already scheduled, so he didn't have to build this one from the ground up. That gave him the freedom to just *direct*, but it also removed some of his unique sensibility from the film.<br />The result is a movie that could have been amazing if it wasn't so . . . Hollywood-ized. The actors are movie stars first, actors second, so you get distracted seeing pretty faces in ugly settings. The plot is both dull and pointlessly convoluted. It starts with a great idea --- is he from the future or is he insane? --- and then you get the tacked-on romance and too many action scenes. By the final twenty minutes you'll get impatient, waiting for everything to wind up.<br />The best thing about the DVD is the documentary, \\"The Hamster Factor.\\" You get to see Gilliam rant and sob and laugh at seemingly random moments. One minute he's upset about something trivial, the next he's happy when a major shot is falling apart. That's good because you should see the \\"warts and all\\" view of making a movie, not a censored version. Gilliam is a genius but also a bit of a madman, and the documentary gives you a taste of that.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This CD is better than Silver Side Up, which had some good songs and some bad ones. This one has all good songs. It's slightly heavier and darker than Silver Side Up, but at the same time its more emotional, with a lot more anger and sadness. <br />1-Flat on the Floor-Hard hitting, heavy rock song 7/10<br />2-Do This Anymore-Best song on the album, explores a bad relationship. Heavyish rock ballad with a bass dominated tune 10/10<br />3-Someday-First single, a slower, more intimate love song 9/10<br />4-Believe it or Not-This is a great song about emotions, sayong that no matter how bad you feel there is someone out there feeling the same 9/10<br />5-Feeling way Too Damn good-Solid song, another love song but with a sense of incredulity, as if he is saying &quot;can this be real?&quot; 7/10<br />6-Because of You-Angsty song about a person who is destroying herself 9/10<br />7-Figured you Out-Takes a shot at an ex girlfriend 6.5/10<br />8-Should've listened-Reasonable song, acoustic ballad about a bad breakup 6.5/10<br />9-Throw Yourself Away-Another angst filled song that as far as i can guess is a commentary on an ethical wrong, unsure of exactly what but it has something to do with a baby. Labelled as mysoginistic and insensitive, its in fact a cold hard truth. 9/10<br />10-Another Hole In the Head-I can relate!! Its a song about a bad choice in girlfriends 8/10<br />11-See You At the Show-Fast song 8/10<br />Some reviewers have labelled this album mysoginistic and insensitive. These reviewers need to try associating with women (or men for female reviewers) because its just a tale of bad relationship experiences, and im sure most of us can relate.
B000001EL3|5.0|This may come as a shock, but Kiss actually recorded one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time when they made Destroyer. Other Kiss albums have their moments, but none of them are as consistently stupid/fun as this one.
B000002J09|5.0|It's hilarious reading some of these reviews. Some of the bad reviews are jokes, so don't fret true believers. Others are obviously written by people who, well, are not people, because only a brainless ape would think that any current rock band is good enough to get Plant/Page/Jones/Bonham coffee during recording sessions. <br />Now I'm not saying one HAS to like Led Zeppelin, of course not. But if any human being on the planet can't at least note their talent I doubt a. their sincerity or b. their intelligence. Let us all be honest, the vast majority of the musicians post 90's are talent-less, repetitive, banal, idiotic no-talents who are of the same mental level of the teens your grandpa keeps catching sniffing spray paint in his garage. The vast majority of these people are rap artists and teen-pop idols of course, but hardly all. Rock music (music, snicker) like Limp Bizkit and Staind is so bad, so lacking in musical varity I often wonder if record companies are not drafting musicians from mental institutions and putting them on albums as some sort of sick, twisted, corporate joke. <br />I've reviewed this album in the past, it's a classic for those interested. So my advice to you good people is to ignore anyone who gives this less than four stars (most likely they either have an inferiority complex in regards to anyone with talent, or they are morons), buy it, and enjoy. I'm only here to help. <br />Look kiddies, at one time you had to have musical ability and talent to make albums! No I'm not and old burned out hippie, I'm 25, it's just that I'm honest and have avoided the sad disease that generation by generation, is lowering the intelligence, taste, and standards of American music fans. I mean when the rock music is so pathetically terrible that it can't even nock Eminem, Spears, and N'Sync off the charts, you know rock music skill has hit an all time low!
B000002KIE|5.0|if you can spot a poser 100 miles away how come you can't spot yourself?<BR> This is one of the defining records of punk. Real punk doesn't need perfect production to make them sounds better, niehter does the singer have to be extremely talented. This album made history!<BR> Stop going around saying Good Charlotte are punk, they are more pop than anything else!<BR> One day you're gonna get into a big mess by saying the wrong things to the wrong people....<BR> Go back to the doctionary and look at the picture of you next to poser again.
B00000DGUM|5.0|As a musician in the Bay Area, we are constantly on the look out for good quality hard sounding music to supplement our ideas in terms of what music, we of course would like to hear. With that I was turned on to this CD and Bach by a band mate who had also turned me onto much of Stephen Pearcy's (former frontman of RATT - when RATT was cool) work of the 70's &amp; 80's. Sebastian Bach (former frontman of Skid Row) is literally a piece of work &amp; I do mean that in a complimenting way. A lot has been said &amp; written about him, mostly false, but he is somewhat of an enigma. An egotist, YES! but as with all true (&amp; premiere) rock stars like Pearcy, Neil, &amp; Rose - he has to be. He has a tremendous voice with incredible range (which is rare) - this is heard right fr. the start, &amp; right out of the chute on this CD. He also has one of the best looks in the rock scene. He's extremely good looking which adds to his high energy stage presence! If you are a metal fan, this CD is for you -- the 2 stand out songs are: Youth Gone Wild &amp; -- Forever ... which give you a great taste of his talent as well as the talent of the band as a whole. Bach and Skid Row (of the 80's) were greatly underrated back then in terms of their place in the select few Olympian metal bands, and unfortunately this band (of back then) may still quite possibly be so today ... but get your hands on this one &amp; spread the word!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I am not going to attempt to write an incredible review here, I just want to get some points across:<BR>1. London Calling truly is one of the best and most creative albums ever<BR>2. &quot;Fred dursts number 1 fan&quot; you are an idiotic clone and tool to society. Just because a band has never been on TRL doesn't mean they're bad, I doubt that TRL even existed in 1979 (I appologize if I am wrong). It is mainly music that MTV WANTS YOU TO HEAR. And to reinform you, Good Charlotte, Blink, and definatly LIMP BIZKIT AND AVRIL LAVINGE WERE NEVER PUNK AND NEVER WILL BE, YOU ARE AN INSULT TO MUSIC LISTENERS AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PUNK IS. If you look punk up in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the clash.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Like many albums, one has to listen to Dance of Death several times before one can judge it.  I was not impressed with it the first time I listened to it.  However, it was dramatically better the second time, and the third time it was spectacular.  There were complaints that four songs on the album start out like Blood Brothers.  I hardly think that an intro with a bass riff, followed by a guitar riff over it was first established by Blood Brothers.  I do not think that the album suffers at all, and complaining that four songs begin with different intros involving bass and then guitar is nitpicking.  The fact that Iron Maiden repeats a certain structure is not a bad thing.  I have never heard Iron Maiden use the same riff in two different songs.  Steve Harris is truly a brilliant musician and writer, and claiming that he is hurting the band by wielding dictatorial powers is absurd.  Most of the songs on the album were co-written with other members of the band anyway.  Harris has written more songs than any other member of Iron Maiden and his songs are some of the best.  Not to mention the fact that he plays a mean bass.  The lyrics on this album are impeccable, and the solos and riffs sound as good as ever.  This is an excellent addition to Iron Maiden's already impressive catalog, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B000022TSH|5.0|With all the Oscar hoopla this past year around director Roman Polanski's sprawling, if flawed &quot;The Pianist,&quot; one would think that it's the only Polanski movie out there. Well, if you've seen &quot;The Pianist,&quot; you've seen a Holocaust movie like the rest of 'em. Take a trip back to Polanski's 1974 movie &quot;Chinatown&quot; and forget all you know.<BR>     Who knew a movie about a water conspiracy would be so nail-bitingly intriguing, and who'd a thought that screenwriter Robert Towne could take an old, dying genre (the &quot;gumshoe&quot; movie) and turn it into arguably the best screenplay this side of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;All About Eve&quot;? It's all here, with Jack Nicholson as smooth private eye Jake Gittes, and Faye Dunaway as the cryptic Evelyn Mulwray. Look closely, though. As &quot;Chinatown&quot; unfolds, it looks like it's going to be the typical detective movie, but twists and turns in the film's complicated narrative turn a simple San Fransisco water conspiracy into a twisted, perverse, nightmare that reeks of the Electra complex.<BR>     Yes, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; has the style that set a trend, and &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; juggles plot strands like a sideshow freak, but &quot;Chinatown&quot; adds a tragic depth to its narrative that was never seen in such a movie and has never been seen since. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are no Nick and Nora Charles - there's a deep secret lying beneath it all that makes the movie a haunting and unforgettable experience. Dunaway hides the film's tragedy well, revealing it in an infamous scene that proves this is the finest work she's ever done. And Nicholson. Drawn slowly into a twisted web of corruption and deceit, he seems almost too smart for it, but Towne's script proves that there is a heart beneath his inquisitive glare, and it, along with all of ours, is broken in the film's devastating finale.      <BR>     If you're into gumshoe flicks, this is the best one out there, but it also stands as one of the finest American films of all time. Just look at the film's ending - though &quot;American,&quot; it carries a tragic, &quot;European&quot; touch that was no doubt a product of the painful history of Polanski. In a way, this movie relays the torture and pain of his Holocaust experience in a better fashion than &quot;The Pianist.&quot; Even without digging into director's intentions, the final product of the movie is haunting, tragic, and won't get out of your head for days. One of the great lines of the film is &quot;Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.&quot; Fortunately, forgetting &quot;Chinatown&quot; is something anyone that ever sees it will never be able to do.
B00003CXUM|5.0|There's more here than can be appreciated in a single viewing.  I just finished my third pass and the film just blows me away.<br />If you think it's too slow you're just skimming the surface of what's there.<br />And if the final scene doesn't make your heart ache, you're not the kind of person I want to know!
B00004XONN|5.0|this is the album where radiohead pissed everyone off by doin the different thing with electronics and not playing guitar on most of the songs... they spat at rock and roll and proved they are the best band ever!<BR>songXsong:<BR>everything in the right place: this is a very subdued thing saying they are right where they should be... 4.5<br />kid a: very weird one with a fake voice and messed up words... its sleepy but good 4<br />the national anthem: it actually not the &quot;o say can you see?&quot; song its a weird one that has no melody just crazy jazz... no band has made stuff like this... 4.5<br />treefingers: total filler but its nice 2<br />optimistic: this is the best song! oh if they made a whole album as fun and rocking as this it could beat OKC! 5<br />in limbo: kinda dumb and pointless... a low point... 2.4<br />idioteque: dance dance dance! i love it! radiohead goes techno... 5<br />morning bell: good song about divorce 4<br />motion picture soundtrack: the harps and minute of silence is lame and they ruined the song 1.5<br />overall its a 4.9 out of 5 star album with OKC being the only 5 album EVER!
0786930640|3.0|Dragons of autumn twilight was a good story, but the writing style was NOT that impressive.  There was no character development and no character emotion put into the characters (I am speaking in general).  The beginning of the story went by so fast, putting them in a different place almost every single chapter, and the places were not very cool.<br />I gave the book three stars because of, what I said in the first sentence, it was good story.  Not the main story line of the eight or nine travlers (with exceptions, Raistlin), but the story of the whole world.  The gods which almost destoryed the world, children's tale's coming true, evil lurking all around the world, and the dark mystery which is Raistlin.  All these elements made me keep turning the pages.<br />If you are looking for a fun easy action adventure to read this is your book.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Reloaded couldn't be a more appropriate title for this movie. Why? Well \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is just that, rehashed stunts, reiterated philosophical themes, and the reappearance of characters from the previous film. What distinguishes this sequel from its predecessor is not anything truly novel or qualitatively different. Its claim to distinction is purely quantitative. Neo, instead of dodging and stopping a few bullets from one, two, or three agents toting hand guns, now evades and halts a whole barrage of ammunition from a whole assortment of adversaries carrying more hefty artillery. In the first film Reeves' character fought one agent Smith and two of his cohorts, now he fights against an innumerable horde of agent Smiths. The original Matrix had Neo performing a whole host of gravity defying wire assisted acrobatics to veer around bullets and stay suspended in the air for short periods of time, and in this second installment he still defies gravity except he is able to do it indefinitely to the point where he flies like Superman. Neo, is still the stoic, sometimes confused character, at the center of this movie, and he is still accompanied by a John the Baptist like, messiah worshiping, cryptic philosophical musing Morpheaus played by Laurence Fishburne, and of course to finish of the triangle we have the leather clad pasty Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. <br />With the same bullet time effects, martial arts wire tricks, and green veneer, the only thing different about this film is that everything is embellished to ridiculous proportions. In fact that's probably what they should have called this movie \\"The Matrix : Embellished\\" or \\"The Matrix : Really, Really Big Encore\\".  I suppose the Wachowski brothers are not from the school that emphasizes less is more. Its unfortunate that this duo didn't realize that though the technical wizardry of the original Matrix was ingenious at the time it has become clichéd and ubiquitous within Hollywood action cinema today. Every film from Tom Cruise's \\"MI2\\" to Jet Li's \\"The One\\" has used these celluloid illusions to help bolster their visual appeal. It has also been spoofed so many times from such satirical films as \\"Scary Movie\\" and \\"Kung Pow ! Enter The Fist\\" Granted the production team responsible for the Matrix franchise does perform these effects better than any other FX crew, but that still does not change the fact that what made the original Matrix such a visual phenomenon was that it was an aesthetic novelty. Yet, that novelty has been robbed by so many copycats that no amount of perfecting the process or enlarging the process can bring back its original appeal.      <br /> \\"The Matrix\\" was more than a visually stunning movie, it also had a rich and innovative storyline replete with many hefty philosophical and theologically charged issues from solipsism, existentialism and determinism to Christological parallels and gnosticism. So much substantive material for thought was in \\"The Matrix\\" that the movie spawned serious academic discussion concerning the film, its message, and its societal implications (see \\"The Matrix and Philosophy : Welcome To The Desert of The Real\\", \\"The Gospel Reloaded : Exploring Spirituality and Faith In The Matrix\\" and excerpts from \\"Hollywood Worldviews : Watching Films With Wisdom and Discernment\\").<br />Though the sequel to \\"The Matrix\\" is considerably longer than the original that is no indication that the plot is any better or more in depth. In fact how can the plot be better when there is no believable point of conflict - a central element in any plot? A conflict cannot exist if the protagonist has nothing of comparable strength to challenge him. How can Neo have a formidable adversary when the Wachowski brothers, in their infinite wisdom, decided to confer upon Neo, at least when he wired to the Matrix, God like omnipotence? He's practically impervious to attack as demonstrated by his skirmish with numerous clones of Agent Smith; he can wish bullets to stop and be redirected on a whim; and if he gets tired or bored of fighting, well up up and away he goes. For heaven sake he can even resurrect people in \\"Reloaded\\"! It is quite obvious that Neo is intended to have a Messianic role that borrows from Christian imagery, but the whole Lazarus routine he performs on his beloved borders on cheesy. <br />At least in the predecessor to this film there was a process of self-actualization that had to take place before Neo could fully manipulate the Matrix. During that time he was vulnerable to injury and death. Hence, opponents like agent Smith were truly menacing villains precisely because they were real threats. Now agent Smith, or should I say Smiths, are nothing more than punching bags for the virtually invincible Neo.<br />Even many of the intellectual challenges faced by Neo have been removed. He no longer has to discover for himself that the world he has been immersed in is purely a façade, a nod to the solipsists' school of thought. There is no longer a question about his role as a savior, where in the first film his status as \\"The One\\" was questioned by everyone with the exception of the unwavering Morpheaus.  <br />With no major intellectual issue to address, except for an expansion on themes of freewill and determinism, there isn't much to stimulate the mind in this picture. Unfortunately even these issue were treated poorly because they were addressed in a most convoluted manner, when Neo and the image of the architect of the Matrix have a dialogue that used language that was so heavily laden in esoteric computer jargon that even a technically sophisticated person would have a hard time making sense of it (I am speaking as programmer by the way).  <br />All in all it is unfortunate that the Wachowskis did not leave the first film alone. I am glad that they reloaded their pockets from the profits made from this picture. It's just sad that we had to unload our wallets in order to see it.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash's London Calling is beyond words, it's one of the greatest cd's of all time, and a lot of people would agree.  From start to finish, there is not one bad song.  Rock, reggae, punk, and ska, this album has a varied of musically tastes and could please any music lover.  Starting off with the title track London Calling, the energy and brilliance of this album does NOT end until an hour+ later with Train in Vain.  Some of my favorite tracks:  Wrong'em boyo, I'm not down, and the radio-friendly hit, Train in vain.
B00004VWAF|5.0|It's no secret that this album was bashed by many critics and jazz purists alike.  However, this album was not made for them, so that was to be expected.  Miles experimented with newer sounds on this release, and definitely succeeded in creating something unprecedented; who else would have thought of mixing the concepts of Karlheinz Stockhausen and Paul Buckmaster with those of James Brown and Sly Stone?  Only Miles.  Also, he originally purposely left the personnel off of the album in order to confuse and annoy the critics even more.  That idea represents exactly what On The Corner is: rebellion against a system of \\"organized\\" conformity.  While most of his colleagues were still playing the same old rhythms and tunes with all acoustic material, Miles decided he needed to upgrade to instruments like electric basses, guitars and keyboards.  He even plays an electric trumpet throughout on this release.  He also added a lot of instruments that were used less in the \\"jazz\\" idiom, like sitars, tablas and African percussion.  The first suite, consisting of \\"On The Corner\\", \\"New York Girl\\", \\"Thinkin' One Thing And Doin' Another\\" and \\"Vote For Miles\\" is all based on a repetitious rhythm with all sorts of surrealistic musical ideas going on around it.  Miles solos with the electric trumpet and contrary to what many say, it's not that hard to differentiate between the guitar and trumpet on this album.  Miles does, however, sound very much like a human voice.  He really gets some good licks in on the JB-influenced \\"Black Satin\\", which is driven by a beat that is straight from Brown's \\"Cold Sweat\\".  It's almost as if this tune is a East Indian flavored version of that song.  If I remember correctly, he doesn't even play on the song \\"One And One\\", and then the album moves into a weird run together of tunes on \\"Helen Butte\\" and \\"Mr. Freedom X\\".  The former has a few straight ahead jazz-like moments, as Dave Liebman and Sonny Fortune play some nice saxophone solos and Miles heroically solos throughout.  The latter, sounding like a sly tribute to Malcolm X, is pretty much summing up this strange, strange recording.<br />While many did not like this album, there are more and more who are understanding the true meaning of it.  It isn't unlistenable or horrible at all, at least not in my opinion.  Miles also plays well on here.  Recommended for the open-minded Miles fan.
B00008PW2D|2.0|I am an avid watcher of Sex and the City, I adore the show. However, I think other fans will agree with me when I say that Season 5 was pretty much the lowpoint of the series. I record all of the episodes of every season and watch them frequently . . . I haven't touched my Season 5 tapes since it aired.<br />Initially, it was supposed to be 13 episodes (instead of the normal 18) to accomodate Sarah's pregnancy. We were supposed to get 8 episodes in the summer and then she was to return to the show for 5 more episodes the following spring. As you can see, that never happened. We were left with 8, \\"okay\\" episodes. <br />My main complaint and its a big one, is the pricing of the DVD \\"set\\", if you can call it that. This is the shortest season of the series, 8 episodes, compared to the normal 18. Now why in hell would I pay just as much money for 8 episodes as I would for 18? I mean, maybe if they'd added some special features to this set to make up for a lack of episodes, I might consider buying this. However, knowing what I do about the Sex and the City DVDs I own, I highly doubt that anything has been added. <br />In short, I cannot recommend this purchase simply because HBO is asking the same from us (monetarily speaking) and only delivering about a quarter of what they have in the past (episodes and episode quality). Even though I love the series, I will not purchase this item.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|I am one of the biggest fans of Maynard's voice that ever was, and when I heard this album I just wanted to cry - and not out of joy.  I am sorely disappointed with all of the songs on this album.  It is definitely not up there with Mer de Noms.  This effort seems to have been very weak.
0375703764|5.0|It seems to me that this is one of those works where people either absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it.  I love this book. I've never read or heard anything that could keep me so (insanely) interested. I'm working my way through my third reading of this book, and every time I read it I pick up something I've missed before. Like Navidson, I keep going back into that house, looking for answers (for ANYTHING) to make sense out of the sorrow and chaos; anything to put all the pieces together. The house only offers more questions, and the answers can only be found inside yourself.  If you are considering this book, I definitely recommend purchasing Poe's album \\"Haunted\\" as well.
0793563836|4.0|This book is great for a beginner to the bass.  I agree with another reviewer that it might rely on the tablature a little too much, but I think for a beginner the tablature is very helpful.  Don't become addicted to it though, or you'll never learn anything.  Otherwise the book is great, along with the accompanying CD.  It's much more fun to learn the bass with a band to play along with.<br />Buy it buy it buy it!
0553277472|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite books.  An autobiographical cross country journey with philosophical insights thrown in.  I was skeptical at first, but after receiving this book as a gift, I was hooked.  I've hooked other friends as well.  Highly recommended.
6304913176|3.0|this one packs a wallop but some things are way to dumb. the aliens are top notch and way to many to kill. the battles are awesome and the cast is lively. the part where the head alien sucks the brains from his victims is gooey and fun and Casper Van Dien(Sleepy Hollow, Python), looks like he had a good old time riding that bug.
B00005JLTN|5.0|There are many complaints and cry-baby like reviews that should be ignored.  There are many people that do not fully understand and can't grasp the concept(s) of The Matrix Reloaded movie.  Many people hate this movie because they don't like the idea of thinking.  Instead they want to fall into that mindless zombie-like phase that turns their brain into mush.  Matrix Reloaded is a great movie that answers questions that left us thinking after the first movie.  Matrix Reloaded also gives us many clues and hints through out the movie for many raised questions that will be answered in Revolutions.  One reviewer stated &quot;Why didn't Neo just simply fly away in the first place when he was fighting against all those agents.&quot;  The answer is simple: purpose, besides what's wrong with a little practice going up against all those agents?  Everything has purpose.  This review that I am typing has purpose.  It's purpose is to inform people that this is a kick ass movie for people with half a brain.  Free your mind when you watch this movie.
B0000AGQ26|5.0|a funny as they come and probably the best Lampoon next to Vaction and Loaded Weapon 1. John Belushi, you gotta love his character and my favorite moment of his is when hes spying on the sorority girls, funny as hell. other funny parts include shooting at the horse, Stephen Furst in the horse pen, where Belushi's trying to cheer Furst up by bashing bottle over his head and the part where the man with the guitar is singing, Belushi takes his guitar and smashes his guitar against the wall and then says. &quot;sorry&quot;, ah hell its all funny
630469797X|5.0|Being in the right place at the right time with a camera is much better than having a script and actors. When I first scanned the documentary section of the video store in 1983, I came across this gem. I knew zombies were real from reading about them in books when I was 12, but I never knew there was proof of them captured on video. I was disturbed by their violent nature and their hunger for human flesh, but that's life when you're a zombie. Mr. Romero (better known as the Joker in the Batman TV series) took his crew out for a shopping spree when the violence broke out. Truth is much stranger than fiction, and this documentary proves it. After watching this film, I have sworn off eating human flesh ever again.
B00005JHAD|5.0|boy oh boy did Guy Ritchie create another masterpiece, its hip and original and sparking with funny dialouge and a lively cast, including Pitt with his garblemouth talking fistboxer. cool shootouts and fights and funny names like Boris the blade  and Franky Four Fingers(Benincio Del Toro, though he is killed too quick in here). the best scene is when the dog snatchs the diamond and eats it and Dennis Farina starts shooting and then he shoots out the window as the dog jumps out and then he realizes he shot his friend Vinnie Jones, just hilarious
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The best song in this soundtrack is &quot;The lonely Shepherd&quot; by Zamfir. Evokes the most powerful and poignant of emotions!

0385504209|5.0|I was introduced to the books of author Dan Brown only three weeks ago, but have quickly absorbed all four of his published works. It is easy to see why some are comparing the work of Dan Brown and James BeauSeigneur (THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY). Both Brown and BeauSeigneur deal masterfully with the more mysterious features of religion, politics, and science. Both bring to light amazing bits of information, which they weave into the intricate patterns of their stories. Both are highly imaginative and write with a ring of authenticity that makes for a compelling read. While Brown compresses labyrinthine plots into brief time periods to provide page-turning suspense, BeauSeigneur trilogy is of epic proportion, covering several decades. While Brown applies the mysteries of history to the drama of &quot;today,&quot; BeauSeigneur uses both history and prophecy (from perhaps a dozen major world religions) to transport the reader from the world of today, to the very dawning of a new age in a story reminiscent of the scope of Asimov's classic, FOUNDATION.<br />One other difference is that BeauSeigneur has taken the novel (pun intended and forgiveness is asked) approach of including footnotes in his books of fiction. By doing so, he all but eliminates the necessity of suspending disbelief. Few authors employ such strong factual grounding as to make footnotes useful, but I believe Brown's work (and his readers) would benefit from BeauSeigneur's innovation.
078322558X|4.0|a solid thriller with Willis as The Jackal and he is hiring to kill a man, Gere is the man in prison who knows The Jackal's evern move. good beginning with the club scene then goes into that famouse scene where the guy gets an axe in the back of the head and then it gets good with Willis switching faces and putting beards on. by the end we have an assassination attempt, a great chase threw the subway and a killer ending. Willis has never been better, Gere with a great Irish accent, Poitier always enjoyable.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix Reloaded is one of the best Action/Sci-Fi movies of the 2003 summer.  Everyone seems to always want bigger and better.  You got it here.  <br />In comparison to other movie releases, and sequels, this movie left me in the theater wanting more.  My wife actually watched this movie and became a fan.  She slept through The Hulk!  The Wachowski Brothers know what they are doing.  Make an epic, kick ass, action movie to enjoy as a trilogy.<br />The Matrix will always be better than then Reloaded or Revolutions. Why?  Because its the original!  Only a few sequals ever offer the same or better quality than the 1st.  Scenes like the Kung Fu training, Lobby shoot out, and learning what the Matrix was with Neo can only by done in the 1st movie.<br />The Matrix series is not movies of eye candy like other big budget movies that have been released in the past.  It has an in depth story, dynamic characters, drama, action, momments of laughter, and you don't get bored.  These are the reason we pay to go to the movies and buy DVD's.<br />Lift your intelligence above the computer animation and pay attention when you watch The Matrix series.  Yes, that means listen to the dialogue, it will make sense.<br />I have said my two cents.  Thank you.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|from the horrifying beginning to the horrifying end, this movie is purely a adrenaline pumping ride, fueled with a believeable creature and a good cast, but that crazy lady who sees visions seems a little miscast and annoying some times. favorite part has got to be the ending. followed by a sequel 2 years later
B00005JM02|5.0|(This review is for the cinema version)<BR>I tell you what, everytime I go to a Pixar movie, I keep expecting Disney to have taken control of the creative genii at Pixar and turn out a load of junk.  Each time, I'm wrong.  Finding Nemo was incredibly fun, it was warm, and--amazingly--not patronizing.  Usually kids movies talk down to kids and adults alike, trying to hamhandedly teach a lesson.  Not so with Pixar movies.  You should get this DVD.  I know I will.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|this cd reminds me a lot of vapor transmission by orgy...everyone was expecting another candyass but that wasn't even the goal...although not much of thirteenth step is like mer de noms it still produces a sound very unique to APC...i bought this cd for the state of mind it produces not because i wanted to compare it to anything else...because just like the first cd it produces great emotion in me...the very sound of the rythmic guitars and maynards voice make this cd a must own...i will admit though you have to listen to the whole thing once to really get a feel for it but after you do, it sticks with you and you won't be able to get it out of your head
B00009V7RF|4.0|This CD's definitely worth buying. It's alot more inventive and fun to listen to than most of the rap crap out there. &quot;Shut Up&quot; and &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot; are great tracks. And whoever thinks that song title's offensive...get a life. There are alot more things to get worked up about than a simple song.
B00005M989|5.0|Grow up people and stop giving this collection of masterpieces low ratings because you don't agree which of Prince's songs are the best or because of Prince's wars with Warner Bros.  Yes, many fans would prefer to own his full collection of albums, but it's downright ridiculous to give this collection a one-star or two-star rating for such reasons.  There is no doubt that these hits on this CD are some of his greatest songs ever written and some of the best songs in pop music history.  This is a fine collection of music, especially for the younger generation who are force-fed [stuff] from Britney Spears and Eminem.
B00005JLWN|4.0|The marketing surrounding this critically hailed and audience neglected film, says &quot;Forget the Matrix&quot;.  Not hardly.<br />I can't really understand all the connections, honestly... the stories are apples and oranges, the action is apples and oranges... the costumes... well... okay... the Clerics look like they're jacked right in to battle Agent Smith.  But they don't borrow from any of the action style of the Matrix whatsoever.  Instead, they adopt a new-fangled gun battling called &quot;Gun-Kata&quot;, which essentially allows for the master of Gun-Kata to walk into a room full of armed enemies, instantly calculate positions and trajectories that will allow them to move and fire precisely enough to hit the enemies in kill zones and have their own body in a position to avoid the line of fire from any of the enemies.<br />Sounds complicated, but it's beautiful to watch on screen.<br />This movie looks like 1984, Minority Report, and the Matrix all in one.  In the future, there is no war, because there is no emotion... it's outlawed and controlled by a drug which everyone must take at regular intervals.  Anything which spurs emotion is outlawed as well:  art, music, literature... even their windows are fogged over so that they cannot see the sun rise or set, for fear it might inspire emotion.<br />There are plenty of plot-holes in this film... but they're easy enough to overlook and just have fun.  For example, Taye Digg's character is Cleric Christian Bale's new partner.  From the beginning, Digg's becomes suspicious of his partner and even shows some clear ambition that he wants to be the top Cleric like Bale.  Ambition isn't so much an emotion, but it can lead to violence too... they don't account for that in the film at all.  What about greed?  They don't really explain if the drug counters these things.  Digg's ambition though, could clearly be read as motivator towards something bad happening... not to mention he smiles way too much for someone who isn't supposed to &quot;feel&quot;...<br />Anyway, that being said... the movie is fun.  The action is limited to the beginning and towards the very end, while the middle is devoted to watching this Cleric unravel as he misses a dose of the drug and begins to struggle with newfound emotion.  There are a couple of neat twists, but overall, you will enjoy this morality tale unfolding while at the same time watching bullets fly like mad.<br />It's a shame it was overlooked in theaters.  Here's hoping it gets a new life as a cult classic.

B00006ZCFH|1.0|I have been a long time fan of Erykah Badu.  Her first two albums are still in my top ten of all time.  What drew me to her was not only her groove, but her stylistic ingenuity and thoughtful lyrics.  This new album, overall, has neither.  The entire thing is essentially filler, as if she was just recording a live jam that really was not going very well.  It does have a groove, but it just gets boring even after the first song.  This just never happened with her other albums. The few highlights on this album are danger, think twice and ,yes, I like the remix of love of my life, primarily due to the fact that bahamadia is a goddess in her own right.  Erykah, please make something meaningful next time.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I think it is rather harsh and unfair to judge Matrix Reloaded as a stand-alone movie.  It is part of a trilogy and everyone should see Matrix Revolutions next month and then consider the trilogy as a whole.  Plus, I realize some people have impossibly high expectations for this movie.  I mean, seriously, how could you possibly top the idea of the &quot;matrix&quot;?  Reloaded built on the groundbreaking idea explained in the first Matrix and the audience can't possibly ask for more.<br />But even considering Reloaded by itself, it is still an outstanding sequel.  In terms of visual effects and action scenes, Reloaded is so far the best ever in American film history (let's see what Revolutions will offer!)  For those who enjoys the philosophical implications in its prequel, Reloaded answers some questions yet raises more issues.  It just keeps digging deeper into your thoughts.  Yes, the rave scene was a bit too much but I can certainly appreciate the point of showing humanity (vs machines).  The additional characters also add some spice to an already interesting storyline.<br />Revolutions - how will it end?  I hope it won't be a conventional &quot;happy ending&quot; in which humans triumph over machines and the entire matrix is destroyed.  I'm looking forward to a more open-ended, thought-provoking ending.  Will Neo die to save human mankind?  Since Neo is a remainder of an unbalanced equation, can he possibly and actually be a last obstacle to human freedom?
0671027344|5.0|I found this book on a shelf in a huge bookstore, among large hardbacks. It looked lonely, so I picked it up. And here I am four years later now a sophmore in college and am still effected this little green book that I read straight through on the way home. I have read it countless times, the binding is worn, the front cover falling off, and I still go back to it. This book has become part of me, a sort of literary home if you will.<BR>   So many of us look for something inspiring, not just mere amusement, when we walk through the stacks. Here it is. I am not saying that this book is for everyone, because it's not. It is for those who know what it is like to want something more. Charlie will change everyone, he can teach us all something about not fearing our humanity or our sadness. I found myself in this book, I hope that you can too.
B000089RVX|5.0|While I'll admit that I have one of the most eclectic CD collections of anyone I know (Live, Dave Matthews and Enya all live happily next to each other in one section of the rack), I've always steered clear of the stuff that usually gets lumped together with the &quot;goth&quot; stamp on it. So you'd think that a group like Evanescence wouldn't have much of a chance of getting into the collection. However, what I've found here is nothing short of the most addicting sound I've run across in a long time. I expected a Linkin Park-style album with a bunch of tracks like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; - the catchy, albeit overplayed first single. What I found, though, was an album with more depth, emotion, and haunting sound than has hit rock in a long time. The first 3 tracks were as advertized: heavy, minor-chord, guitar-riff driven anthems with Amy Lee's powerful voice soaring over the top of them. When I got to &quot;My Immortal,&quot; however, I had to pull the car over. I don't know when the last time was that a song made YOU tear, but the unbelievably haunting and angelic sound of Amy and those strings struck a chord in me that I didn't even know was there. Needless to say, I was hooked, and Fallen has been the shower music of choice every morning since. Ok ok, so the group is basically Moody, Lee, and a bunch of hired-gun studio musicians. And yes, the themes explored are dark, painful and at times almost disturbing. But prepackaged teen-angst it is not. What it IS, is an enchanting melodic ride through the more painful parts of life, centered around a voice that could sing the &quot;Hokey Pokey&quot; and give me chills. Or maybe I'm just a goth in a yuppie's body after all...
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you liked Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, then you will not be disapointed. This album is definitely based on formulas used in Hybrid Theory, but is a pretty good effort considering the amount of time in which it was produced. The curse to any band that releases a killer album such as HT is that it is next to impossible to top or equal. This comes close to equaling. I bought it on the day that it was released, and have only appreciated it more and more since.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I bought this, not sure what to expect, and for the first few listens of the first four songs or so, I honestly didn't know what was going on.  That was at first.  But I kept on listening to it, always from the beginning just to be sure that I didn't miss anything in this, a concept album about a family in a small country town whose lives are interrupted and changed by the powers that be.  The music, the storyline, and Neil Young's guitar playing and lyrics grew on me, to where I had to listen to the entire thing.  It is a brilliant piece of work that will overwhelm you once you listen to it for the first time, non-stop, from start to finish.  With 10 songs clocking in at 78 minutes (four of the songs are well over 10 minutes each), it is definitely a marathon session but there's a reason for it.  The lyrics as well as the music tell the story, and even when the story may seem confusing (the narrative in the booklet does make things clearer), it will soon fall into place.  My favorite songs on here are &quot;Bandit&quot; and &quot;Grandpa's Interview&quot;, in fact &quot;Bandit&quot; is a song that could stand out on its own.  There is a bonus DVD within, featuring a complete acoustic live performance of the entire album, which is even more revealing as Young narrates and strings everything together.  It not only hints at aspects of his musical career (some of the characters in the story poke fun at the man singing the songs, asking &quot;where does he come up with this stuff?&quot;), but also a look at America, what it was, what it has become, and what it should be.  Pure genius.  Thank you, Mr. Soul Man.

B000067CPX|1.0|If you've read my reviews along with this one for \\"By the Way\\" by the Chili Peppers, then you know I have a major problem with the music industry.  In listening to \\"By the Way\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, it dawned on me that the artists are more to blame than the music industry for this type of slop.  With no other career options or any type of creative inspiration, The Chili Peppers release \\"By the Way\\" which is a horrible, market driven piece of crap that doesn't have anything in common with the work they did early 80's to 1991, lets be honest anything after Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a farse.  Its a sad state of affairs that with so much money and so much music prowess The Peppers put out crappy, unimaginative music like \\"By the Way\\" instead of tutoring the talent that is to come.  We are all doomed and aparently these idiots only care about their money.  Welcome to LA I guess.
B000065BPB|5.0|Every sound is produced to ENHANCE the listening pleasure. Crystal clarity with serious fluid quality.  Die Form to D Product and Roni Size to DJ Krush and Andreas Scholl to The Fat Lady Sings are all brought to you the way each artist would have wanted it only for you.  Adjust them and they will fit.  Crank up the volume and you will slowly but surely crank it down.  They will knock your socks off -twice.  Black Headphones from Germany -get the message and get some -twice.
B000054OXU|2.0|I read the recent biography of Neil Young called Shakey...even he considers this one of his worst albums. The sound is terrible. The worst of 80's production technology. It all sounds like it's in a tin can which makes sense since basically the musicians didn't actually play together. There are a couple of good songs like &quot;Pressure&quot; but this one really doesn't stand the test of time.
B000092Q7O|4.0|A film that could be watched together with Schindler's List, or Annie Frank so that we could have a full picture of the darkest holocust so real and so vivid...<br />There is a lot of justification for Polanski to win an Oscar as the best director and likewise, for the film to win the Gold Palm Award.  The acting of Szpilman was good too; but as to whether he deserved an Oscar turned on how well the other nominated films that year were and who the judges were etc. But that doesn't matter too much in any event. <br />As a piano music lover, I'm neither disappointed nor too gratified: there aren't a lot of piano music anyway. To be exact, there was only one Beethoven sonata in any event and the playing was nothing as exciting as \\"Song Without End\\" where the actual pianist was Bolet. <br />However, an average viewer should be able to find the the music appealing enough and should be able to finish the whole film in one breath rather impressed, or even stunned. Recommended.
B0000025DV|5.0|After the ground-breaking &quot;A new world record&quot; with sounds of hovering spaceships, this album sounds a little bit closer to every day life.
B000002H6C|2.0|A great deal of Metallica fans consider this to be their last great work. I disagree. This has to be one of the flatest sounding albums I've ever heard. Most of the album sounds uninspired. The drums have absolutely no punch at all, the riffs are flat, the solos sound miniscule, and as pointed out by many other reviewers, Jason's bass is completely inaudible. He should have stayed with Flotsam and Jetsam. The only songs that I like are &quot;To live is to die&quot; and &quot;Dyer's eve&quot;. Those two songs and the lyrics are, in my opinion, the only good aspects about this album. Well, at least it's light years ahead of &quot;St. Anger&quot;.
0739307312|2.0|The story is a fine mystery I suppose...but the endless cryptograms and ciphers got pretty tedious.<br />  Any book with Templar Knights the \\"Holy Grail\\" and an albino assasin gets a star just for trying.<br />  I heard the author on a local radio program try to push the feminine goddess concept, which on its face sounds reasonable...but with deeper study you'll find its just another heresy in a long list of Pagan concepts that stretch from Babylon on down to our present day. Throw in a little British Israelism and some DaVinci mysteries and SHAZAAM...we got a bestseller!<br />I probably would have given another star if not for two things...on Audio recordings how frickin hard is it to pay an actress to read female lines?  I'm sorry but even at his best the voice actor here makes a delicate French cryptologist sound like Francois the village drag queen.<br />  Second...I was doing ok with the recording until Langdon asks Sophie..\\"You witnessed a sex ritual didn't you?\\"  and then tried to explain it being something not about sex...but a divine ritual of the Goddess.<br />  Yeahhhhh...Riiiight.  How many Masonic Templars have used that line?<br /><br />  Probably would work at a Tantra convention I guess.<br />  Theologically... what a bunch of HOO HAA!
076790592X|5.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a very tough read for me, and it confused and befuddled me.  Tuesdays with Morrie, however, proved to be everything that Zen and the Art of Mototcycle Maintenance was not.<br />Tuesdays with Morrie proved to be simple and straight to the point.  We talk in the world of today about how it is a virtue to be simple and effective in the intended message, but Tuesdays with Morrie is truly a book that can cut right to the chase and get the intended point across.  Throughout most of the book, the intended message of the book is the deterioration of a man nearing his deathbed and how he can cope with all of the challenges of the disease called ALS but better known as Lou Gehrig's disease.<br />Morrie Schwartz gets any intended messages across through clever, short aphorisms that can be easily explained.  By easily explained, I mean these can be explained without any exteneded research.<br />The story that Mitch Albom had to tell was told in just the right length, not too long that it dragged out and confused the readers, but on the same token, the book wasn't too short that there were still some gaps that needed to be filled.<br />Tuesdays with Morrie is the antithesis of a book like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and in this case, that's a good thing.
0385507755|1.0|...and spare the world the tedious whining he tortures us with in &quot;A Million Little Pieces.&quot;  I was attracted to the book by the cover artwork, which is brilliant.  Too bad the story itself isn't half as good.  By page fifty, I kept wishing the narrator would meet a painful, bloody end.  While there was the potential to make this an insightful and educational story...instead what we get is a pathetic monologue that goes nowhere, and takes a long, long time to get there.
B000001Y42|4.0|...But I really like this album. I'm not a fan of their's at all. In fact I decided to write a review of this album after listening to their latest one (Results May Vary) which I thought was complete garbage. &quot;3 Dollar Bill&quot; I think highlights Limp Bizket in all thier glory. It's raw, it's aggressive and it's funky! The band does a great job of changing it up throught the songs. Wes surley had the musical muscle and creativity in the band as you can see by how bad the new album is. If you like this CD, pick up Biohazard's &quot;Urban Dicipline&quot;  which I would say is THE birth of rap/hip hop/ metal/hardcore. Even predateing Rage Against the Machine! Good stuff...
B00008H2LB|5.0|I found this album to be absolutely fabulous. Those who think that Linkin Park sounds like N'SYNC obviously do not listen to N'SYNC very much and therefore have no real basis of comparison. The only reason I can think of that people would say this is because every song has a melody and Chester actually sings notes instead of randomly screaming. The songs are very powerful and full emotion that you can really &quot;feel&quot;. I think that no matter your tastes in music, you will enjoy this album.
B000002IOJ|5.0|OK, I was a huge thrash fan back in my early years of grade school/high school. My &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; cassette tape nearly had to be thrown away it was so worn out! So you can imagine my happiness when I recently saw a used copy of this CD for sale online. Perfect listening for anyone interested in the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; thrash bands of the period. Especially anyone new to the metal scene thats looking for the &quot;classics&quot;.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I was looking at all the one star reviews and felt like I should contribute another 5 star rating. Now I have only been a Radiohead fan since OK Computer, and I wasn't what you'd call a diehard fan, either. OK Computer was the only CD of theirs that I'd bought until a couple of years ago when I picked up Kid A. At first I hated all but a couple songs because it didn't even sound like the same band. But I would listen to it every now and then and when I actually sat down and paid attention to it, I discovered that it was actually a great album. So then I bought Amnesiac and Hail To The Thief, and those albums are equally brilliant, and now I AM a diehard fan. The music and lyrics on both of these albums are great. They may sound pretentious or &quot;too different&quot; from OK Computer to some people, but to me and a lot of other fans they sound fresh and creative. As for all these people who think that a band is only good if they keep doing the same stuff over and over, and say that people who claim to like this album are just trying to be &quot;cool&quot;, all I've got to say is &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; You didn't like it, and you had no problem saying so, so why do you think that the 4 and 5 star reviewers would feel a need to praise something they really don't like? Just who are they trying to impress? A bunch of people they'll never meet? Get real. Radiohead is a great band, and if they put out something that sounds terrible, then so be it, but that just hasn't happened yet. As for the folks who are mad at the band for criticizing President Bush, you need to wake up and realize that not everyone is as in love with the man as you guys are. In fact I would definitely say you are in minority since most of the planet can't stand the guy. And it's really lame when someone stops listening to a band because they have a differing political opinion, and then they get on Amazon and scold the band for speaking their piece. Most rock musicians are leftist, you should know this by now, and yes, they do have the right to make political statements on their albums. You have the right to whine and complain about it, as well, but it's just a little ridiculous since no one really cares. If you want to hear a rock record that talks about what a great man Bush is, you better make it yourself, otherwise it ain't happenin'.<BR>Anyway, if you like to listen to bands who aren't afraid to change and experiment with their sound while staying true to what they're all about, Radiohead definitely fits that description. IMHO, they're the greatest band of the past decade and they've earned every bit of the praise they're getting. Never mind all the people who dis the band, they're just mad cause Radiohead refuses to put out a yearly rehash of OK Computer or The Bends. They've been there, done that, and they choose to move in a different direction, and I for one am happy with the way they're going. I can't wait to hear their next CD.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Despite what other reviews you might read here, you have to consider one thing:\\"Matrix Reloaded\\" is Science Fiction, therefore, anything goes. The movie is basically a superhero cartoon, albeit, stylized and updated, complete with computer and techno jargon. The sequel to the astonishing \\"Matrix\\" stands well on its own (although, it is almost imperative that you watch the first installment in order to fully appreciate this sequel).The Wachowski bros. had the immense task to outdo themselves and outdo the expectations of the loyal following \\"Matrix\\" spawned, and that was no easy task. \\"Matrix Reloded\\" is vistually \\"loaded\\" with action-packed scenes and mind bending special effects (the highway chase being probably the highlight of the movie). The development of characters is interesting, as we get to see Neo's and Trinity's romance intensify and get some background on Morpheus past love life. We also know that even within the Matrix, there's a conflict between what's right and wrong (won't say much, since I don't want to spoil the movie for you!). Keanu Reeves perfomance of Neo is again, stiff! But it suits the character well. If there was anything annoying about this movie was, probably, the dance scene in Zion.Sure, you get to see some nice looking bods, but that's about it. For a group of people who are about to embark on a grand scale war with a superior enemy, dancing would be the last thing on my mind!  One more thing: this is a movie that needs to be seen at least a couple of times to fully grasp the psychological and existential undertones of the plot. They are mind blowing, but perhaps a bit too deep for your regular teenager. Having said that, \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" is a blast, and one of the best sequels I've ever seen (Living proof that NOT all sequels stink!).
B00005JLKB|5.0|Clark Kent's journey to becoming Superman is the most intriguing show on television. Lex's foreshadowing of his eventual villainy is intriguing. Clark and Lana's relationship is young love at its strongest and weakest moments. Chloe and Clark's friendship is a passionate and heart-rendering tale. SMALLVILLE is the show that mixes not only action, suspense, and drama, but romance, foreshdaowing, and mystery. All this, plus BRILLIANT writing, exceptional acting, and incredibly moving music make this my favorite show on tv. The first season is a great introduction tot he show. Clark and Lex begin as friends. Clark pines after Lana. What Clark doesn't see is that Chloe and Lana are both for him, the perfect combination of journalistic drive and sensitivity. The episodes that are the real highlights of this season, in my opinion, are the following:<BR>\\"Pilot\\"-An intro to the characters and a retelling of the classic tale of Superman.<br />\\"Cool\\"-A relatable and heart-rendering episode. The episode that got me absolutely hooked!!<br />\\"Zero\\"-A foreshadowing, thrilling episode about Lex's past. And the impact his past may have on his future. <br />\\"Nicodemous\\"-Lana at her sexiest!<br />\\"Tempest\\"-A thrilling cliffhanger.<br />The DVD features are great. I recommend this for fans of the show, and of Superman, and, basically, I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0000B1OFI|3.0|Thought it would be more of a mafia type of movie, which I would have made it more interesting, however it's more about American crooks and I must say pretty boring too.
B00005JLYW|4.0|All the main actors put in a well-done, comedic job. Drew Barrymore is sexy, and so is Cameron Diaz, and all the angels are so wonderful to watch. This is a particularly silly film that is fun to watch when you just want to relax and have a good laugh. I LOVED the \\"Cape Fear\\" parodies. Those were soooooo funny! I am a huge fan of the thriller starring De Niro and Nolte, and there are these very funny parodies of the film throughout \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\". GREAT MOVIE!! Recommended for anyone with a silly, lighthearted, fun sense of humor. :)
B00009EIQE|5.0|Buddy Guy is one of the great Blues legends, so almost anything he does is going to be worth your time.  This album is no exception.  I've covered enough ground in the Blues genre to know good acoustic music when I hear it.  Buddy Guy sings with feeling and well-nigh grace, and, I may be wrong, but I think I heard a little guitar in there too. <br />What I particularly appreciate about this album is that it is consistently good throughout.  So many blues albums these days have a few good tracks, with the rest being rather unbearable.  This, by contrast, is made up of mostly blues standards, and Buddy Guy brings credit to them all.  So while this album can't claim high marks for being artistically original.  It will suit you just fine if you're looking to chill out to a fantastic acoustic sound.
B00004S876|5.0|Classic Toto. Beware of the ENHANCED CD however; it only plays on digital (enhanced audio cd) CD players - and won't work at all in a regular audio CD player. Get the non-ENHANCED version instead if you don't have a specialty player.
B000009DUY|2.0|I admit it. I read all the extremely positive reviews, and was duped into thinking that this album was somehow set apart from all other movie soundtracks.  So, I ran out, and purchased it.  However, after listening to it, I was truly disappointed.  There is nothing striking or significant about this piece.  The movie is outstanding, and the music within the movie context is fitting.  However, extract the music from the movie, and what you have are 10 tracks that all sound about the same.  To sum it up in one word...boring.  Now, if your interested in powerful, moving music that stands apart, might I suggest the Schindler's List Soundtrack...the violin solos by Itzhak Perlman are truly outstanding.
B000068OSK|4.0|The main drawback of The White Stripes self-titled debut album is the production. Jack produced it himself and I believe he later stated that he went a little crazy on the reverb. (Hey, give him a break, it was his first time.)    Whatever you do, don't let that be a hinderance in picking up this great album. After falling in love with De Stijl and White Blood Cells I was initially put off by the rough sound this album unleashed. I've also found this to be the case with a few of my friends who also like the Stripes. I listened to it once and sat it on my shelf...it wasn't love at first sound. But a few tracks eventually caught my ear (Jimmy the Exploder, Cannon, Screwdriver) and when that song was over the next song started to hook me. Before I knew it, it was the only CD I found myself listening to.    While it still may be many fans least favorite album of the White Stripes catalog it's one with it's own charm and it has some of my favorite songs. If you're looking for a radio friendly album look elsewhere. I've found that the raw sound that initially turned me off now makes the album special and it wouldn't be the same, or as good, without it. Jack White insists this is the record he is most proud of and it's easy to hear why.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Warning - Spoilers ahead . . .<br />When I first saw the film, well, I didn't like it too much.  It seemed to be over-packed with CGI Fight scenes and a storyline that didn't really mean anything.  While Zion is under attack, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus must find the keymaster to unlock the doors to the mainframe and end the war, thus freeing Zion.<br />This entire storyline, to me, seemed contrived, making the fight scenes seem meeningless, their overzealous and sometimes long running effects just becoming tiresome.<br />But, then I got it.  Weeks after seeing it, it finally clicked.<br />They symbolism of these films is much deeper than the average action-movie viewer is usually given.  Yes -- the entire &quot;The One-Saves the world&quot; storyline is meaningless, and that's the point.  While paying too much attention to events within the computer-generated fantasy world of the Matrix, the real world, and Zion, fall into greater danger.<br />We are introduced to two 'french' characters, programs, which exist simply to experience life.  While they are among the long list of villians in this piece, they are also the key to the story.  They describe the situation in as much in the film, seeing our heroes as mere puppets in a meaningless plot, which, in fact, they are.<br />While are main characters are engaged in a meaningless task, struggling to achieve goal after goal in a virtual world, events of the real world are dire, and, just perhaps, if more attention were paid to the real-world events, perhaps the situation would not be so dire.<br />It is not until Neo discovers that his existance as 'the one' is simply another level of control set in place by the machines, that the entire struggle within the virtual world of the Matrix has no real meaning, only then does the truth come to light, just in time for this second chapter to come to a close.<br />Think about it, how many people do you know who obsess on politics, or sports, or their favorite television show, oreven the Matrix itself?  We engage in meaningless struggles to achieve goals that, in the end, really have no meaning but to feed our own ego.<br />A very profound statement to be made by an action film, that is, if the third and final installment draws this observation out.<br />As I see it, the value of this second episode is entirely dependent upon the content of the third chapter, but the potential is much greater than most people give it credit for.<br />Thank you for your time.
B0000019HU|5.0|One of my five or so favorite albums of all time.  Perfectly written, executed, and recorded.
B000059HCN|5.0|This is not a happy movie, and there are no upper moments in this film either. It is a steady discend to the abyss of hell. This picture is a powerful and direct example of what drug addiction will do to a person. Great acting, great score, simply great. Overall: EXCELLENT.
B00005YW4H|3.0|This album is magical, although is not all that, as many people stated, this album is simple and does not pretend to be anything but good chillout music, this cd attempt to keep you listening and is not in any way radio friendly, you will have to enjoy the whole album, many songs stand out and many fade in memory, but after all this album is worth it for someone, who's not into jam music!, just good relaxing beats.
6303398480|2.0|This movie builds up pretty good to the moment when the soldiers cross the wormhole, but it is downhill from there on. The egyptian theme is fine, but the rendition of it is poor and limited. This film feels almost rushed with little care to improve depth and details of the story and characters. Overall: MEDIOCRE.
B000083E79|5.0|Great, I owned this GH and the If You Could Turn Back Time Collection, this is the essential Cher for any fan or casual Cher listener, the Very Best Of Cher includes all her #1's and best tracks, I do not consider they left any song out, the best thing they did is include de Edited version of &quot;One By One&quot; in  their Junior Vasquez Mix, what a great pleasure, this collection and the previous mention are all you need! if you're not a Cher fan, great package greatest hits!
B00000IPAX|1.0|&quot;Beelzebubba&quot; by The Dead Milkmen is much funnier than &quot;Enema of the State&quot; by these unoriginal, pseudo-rebelious, 'get on TRL to build a bubble gum pop lover and frat boy fanbase' meatheads.  Additionally, the Milkmen's offering is not nearly as repetetive; they obviously get the point that a CD is not suppose to have 10 tracks that are nearly identical.  Sublime's CDs are also an alternative, if you want to hear a little musicianship mixed with gut-wrenching, vile humor.  Blink 182's humor is simply adolescent, Tom Green (of MTV fame...  HMMMM...   Now things are starting to make sense.) foolishness that became very stale some time ago. <br />But if you really -i mean... REALLY- want a good laugh: listen to Default's &quot;The Fallout&quot; (See my review on this CD for a story regarding this comedic gem, if you please.) or Tantric's self-titled CD [They have a song called &quot;Revillusion&quot; that just cracks me the hell up.].  Enjoy!
B000002UB6|2.0|The Beatles started off as as what we call today a garage band of rock and roll and as John said when Brian signed them and put them in suites, &quot;We sold out then...thats why we never improved as musicians&quot;<br />I would have to add that they sold out as Rock and Rollers as well and the original attempt to &quot;Get Back&quot; to their roots with this album failed. Why? Because though they acknowledged their desire to get back to their roots, they had too long abandoned them to silly songs about Nowhere Men and Sgt Peppers and Savoy Truffles. Oh they could still belt it out when they wanted too, witness Helter Skelter, this kind of noise would not be heard again till AC/DC, HS was pure rocknroll.<br />The Beatles should either not have left or gotten back alot sooner with alot more. Unfortunatley they didnt know that the  the nonesense posing as poetry turned music would deafen them to the cries of Little Richard and Buddy Holly yelling to them from beyond to love them enough to sing them once more.
1400034205|5.0|I own a First Edition of this book(it is for sale) and have read it, but when I viewed the original film with Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney and Anne Baxter, it really touched me!<br />Larry Darrell, who has served in World War I as a pilot, is touched deeply by the war. He comes back to his fiance' (Anne Baxter), but is restless.  He goes off to Paris and than India to find the meaning of life.<br />During his time in Paris his fiance' visits him. She toys with the idea of tricking him to get him to marry her, but instead releases him and returns to America with her family.<br />In America she becomes engaged to a very rich man, marries him and bear two daughters.  But in her heart she still loves Larry.

However, her uncle sold his stock and holdings before the crash, making a good deal more money to add to his pile!

B00005JLYW|5.0|Even as a female I liked this movie and can not wait to see this version of it. As a fan of the Matrix movies I can tell you this has better action scenes then even that. The dirtbike scene is an especially good example as it's style allowed for a more real feeling then the harsh (obvious) computer affects of the Matrix (reloaded).It's best to see the first movie before seeing this sequal though as there are some reffrences to it.For what this movie is I give it five stars. If your looking for a good action show with tuff women, laughs, cool affects and great stunts then this is the movie for you.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I have never seen a DVD that made me so happy, or so contemplative. <BR>I greatly enjoy many of the Phish DVD's because I like seeing artists react to their fans, but I see the Talking Heads as bringing together so many innovative elements.<BR>If you are even THINKING about purchasing this DVD, please do not hesitate. While it definitely reminds me of my childhood, when my parents would play their albums during lengthy car trips, I have never ever been more pleasantly suprised than the first time I saw this DVD. In fact, my boyfriend and I watched it 6 times in one day!!! Everything about it makes you reaffirm your life and question your motives. I love it. I can't say enough good things, seriously.<BR>Buy it.
6305428042|5.0|Three aged witch sisters (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy) are brought back to life after three hundred years when a teen virgin taking his little sister (Thora Birch) trick-or-treating scoffs at a local legend and lights a black flame while trying to impress a girl.<br />It is light-hearted and fun but a little scary for a Disney flick as the witch sisters must find children and suck the life from them to regain their own youth.<br />Good vehicle for Midler and Parker as the bumbling witches wisecrack their way through an action-filled Halloween night. Ten-year-old Thora Birch (American Beauty, Ghost World) is typically witty and very cute.<br />Some themes are a bit racy for a Disney feature and very young children might find some scenes a bit scary, but these are what help make this movie entertaining for the whole family. It's Halloween fun.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|There were too many disappointments to mention, not the least of which were, in order of depressing-ness: (1) trinity &amp; neo looked old &amp; tired similar to how Spock &amp; McCoy looked in some of the later Star Trek movies (which is really sad given it was only their second movie), (2) the zion footage just didn't work, (3) the encounters between neo &amp; the agents got old quick, (4) the philosophical ramblings were confused &amp; rather boring, (5) etc.  <br />It's hard to understand why after such a successful first movie it took so long to make a second, and why the script wasn't better.  I'd say the movie was worth about four dollars.  Can't win 'em all!
B000089RVR|5.0|This was excellent.  I loved every song on it.  The best song was Sand in my shoes.<br />There was one surprise though.  If you play the song See the sun and fast forward to about 7 mins there is a whole different song on it.  I thought that was pretty cool.
0316666343|5.0|This was a fabulous book. I loved the perspective on death that Sebold presents and how you can really feel your emotions swing as do the characters'. Highly recommended, but don't expect to be able to put it down.
B00005R8FI|5.0|As a lyricist,, he was terrible. As a singer, hopelessly off key. But as a musician -- immense. I saw this band at the FIilmore and the recording faithfully delivers the electricity and wonder that this music produces. Johnny Almond, Jon Mark and Mayall of the anthemic &quot;Room to Move&quot;. And then California -- a clarion call to a mythic image of the West in the seventies. The bonus tracks are great also.This CD is a must have. It is a classic. And perhaps the most creative work John Mayall ever produced.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Only listened to the previews.<br />Sounds pretty odd for DM.  Sounds a little forced, like a band that has lost its creativity.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|It's amazing how one's perception can change the second time through a movie.  The Matrix Reloaded got better.  Keanu's easy-going acting style is perfect for the role of Neo, and Laurence Fishburne is just plain awesome as Morpheus (even if he did put on a few extra pounds).  This movie has everything you could ask for; a plot you have to think about, great action sequences, one of the best Dolby mixes ever, and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The special features are terrific.<br />I highly recommend this DVD.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Well, as it has been said in many reviews, there's nothing new here. So what. Jet draw upon and nick everything that's good about rock-n-roll. A bit of swagger there, a pinch of drunken chaos here. Couple that kind of stuff  with a simple back to basics rock record and you get music that will definitely please the rocker within. Get Born is a great debut. A debut that is basically a hybrid of ACDC, a little Oasis, and a lot of \\"Taken Care Of Business\\" (Rollover DJ). Some might see this as unoriginal and predictable. Again, it IS all this, and that my friends, is a good thing in this day and age.  Lots of high-marks throughout the records' 13 tracks. Are You Gonna Be My Girl and Rollover DJ are really great, fast paced stompin' singles. I also really like Take It Or Leave It, and Cold Hard B...., another couple of raw energy rockers that please the 70's rock soul. My only complaint is that those, with another 2 tunes from Get Born, have been included from the Dirty Sweet EP. (I always like EP's to have something not found on the full lengths) Anyway this is a great rock record. Don't expect it change your life, but do expect it to get you moving.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|The collection of songs found on this CD are pop treasures.<br />The new material is great however it does make listeners want to hear more new songs performed by this legend.<br />This is a muss have for any lovers of great dance music.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The fact that anyone would mention ELP and Genesis in the same sentence as Radiohead gives away the fact that such a reviewer is clearly old and is officially out of touch with current music. Remember, your grandpa never liked the Beatles dude. Sit in your rocking chair and relax and let the next generation enjoy their music. Of course, this is not pink floyd, but come on, who really wants it to be? Radiohead are more than just a cult band, they are one of the largest bands in the world. But in any event, if that is the way we judge music, by dismissing cult bands, then I guess Justin Timberlake and the rest of the boy pop groups are true geniuses, and these are the groups that we should be revering. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't review what you don't understand. Remember Genesis brought us invisible touch, not just lamb lies down...talk about selling out. And Pink Floyd today - I mean come on, talk about prostitution. This Radiohead album is a great one that only gets better with repeated listens. The guitar playing is brilliant and is unlike what any other band has accomplished. Pentatonic scales are not so relevant now as they were in the 70's and any guitar player can riff on those. It takes real talent to play the way these guys do, but if you disagree, ride an elevator and listen to learning to fly muzak style. Don't review what you can't understand. It just betrays your advanced age.
B00005RFAI|5.0|this was an awesome cd... very sad here is my review for the songs<br />1. Missundaztood- 7/10 the ending is kinda stupid but has a good chourus also her voice isnt that great in this one.<br />2. Dont let me get me- 9/10 very good slow song but kind of overrated but still good.<br />3. Just like a pill- 8/10 very cool song with deep and personal lyrics/on the same path as dont let me get me.<br />4. Get the party started- 6.5/10 i use to love this song but she repeats the same line too much and it get annoying after a while.<br />5. Respect- 7/10 good beat but the opening is so stupid but overall a good song.<br />6. 18 Wheeler- 9/10 i love this song! it tells us she doesnt care and that shes ready to face the world.<br />7. Family Portrait-10/10 very sad and sow but tells she tells us alot about her childhood and its so sad.<br />8. Misery-2/10 worst song on the cd, its so stupid and she just keeps going on, boring.<br />9. Dear diary-8/10 one of my favorites, cool sound and very deep and personal<br />10. Eventually-7.5/10 at first i hated this song cause it was slow and didnt make sense but now i really like it, it is slow but good<br />11. Lonely Girl-9.5/10 this song rocks! i love the chourus and linda perrys parts, good beat and i love the lyrics.<br />12.

B000002U9Y|3.0|This is definitely the most hit-or-miss Floyd record out there, but not because Syd Barrett was missing or any of that nonsense.  The ideas here are great, and most a lot of the songs on here are instant live classics, like Set the Controls and the title track.  If you don't believe me on that one, watch the Live at Pompeii video.  Outstanding.<br />Now... the main reason the songs that miss on here do miss is because of production.  They were using the worst studio at Abbey Road, which only had a four-track.  So you'll have to forgive them.  In any case, they do manage to astound regardless of their production restraints with songs like Let there be More Light, which is a space rock classic, and which i would have loved to see live; Corporal Clegg is a cynical, poppy, just plain fun song.  Remember a Day is great with Wright's vocals and wonderful guitar solo.  Seesaw likewise.  The version of Set the Controls on here is disgraceful, though... horrible production, and it seems they cut the tape in several sections with no editing whatsoever.  It's also way too fast-paced; the live version would unravel slowly, and featured a way more prolific jam.  Live at Pompeii and UmmaGumma versions are much better.  The title track suffers the same fate, and ditto on the live/studio comparisons.  Syd's only song on here, Jugband Blues, is not up to par with either his solo or Piper material, but is still enjoyable enough.<br />All in all, a few very enjoyable songs, but the ones that suck just bring the whole thing down.  The ideas are there, but the development is lacking.
B00000099Y|5.0|Most of you are correct that this album is one of the most genius albums of the last decade but most people don't get why. Do yourself a favor, take some LSD wait an hour and put this cd on, then you will really undestand lyrics like &quot;I feel this coming over like a storm again&quot;. Listen to it the way the artists intented it to be listened to. You will then appreciate the full genious of this album.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this DVD. Lord of the Rings has been one of my favorite series as a child, and watching the film allows me to bring back every aspect I had in its full entirety, plus with bonus scenes, the fun never ends!
B00006CXXU|5.0|As a pop fanatic who is now pretty much grown up, I think that Christina's music has grown too.  I love listening to old-school Britney, Spice Girls, and N*Sync songs, and Christina's more mature style fits into my collection perfectly.  Each song has a unique melody and meaningful lyrics that I can relate to.  You would not believe how many of these songs say exactly what I feel.  I bought the CD after I went to the Justified/Stripped concert and have listened to it everyday since.  The lyrics and beats are addicting, soothing, spectacular.  My favorite tracks are:  The Voice Within; Loving Me 4 Me; Get Mine, Get Yours; Walk Away; Beautiful; and Cruz.  Everyone should own this CD because it illustrates every emotion possible.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido's return after four years, marks an album that is easy to listen to and has a lighter relaxed feel to it than her 'No Angel' album. As 'No Angel' has a greater element of urgency and edge to it, 'Life For Rent' is sampled at a slower pace as each song reveals a snapshot of a moment in a dynamic life. I have to agree with other reviewers that 'Life For Rent' definately is an album that grows on you and the more you listen to it a new layer of life is exposed.
6305718954|4.0|I feel compelled to write this because after reading many of these reviews I am forced to ask the question &quot;how many of you so-called critics actually watched Stigmata?&quot;<br />I love this movie but I'm also realistic enough to admit its faults. The acting is great, I enjoy Gabriel Byrne and his understated performance, he did well with a script that is cumbersome at times.  The film is beautifully shot, and the techniques used give it a surreal quality, while the editing definitely could have been better (I kinda liked the deleted scene of Alameida's suicide).<BR>But to address some of the more foolish statements made...yes, some of the explanation process within the movie is a little simplistic but I hate to be the one to break this to you-not everyone is Catholic, not everyone went to catechism, I didn't but I was able to follow some of the dogma that is the foundation for the Catholic church.  When Frankie attempts to seduce Kiernan, it is because she is a) being influenced by Alameida, a devoutly religious man who suffered the stigmata and b) as it is explained, stigmatics suffer from demonic attacks and temptation because of their belief and faith.  Okay? <BR>I won't defend every aspect of the movie, because although I really like this movie, no movie is ever perfect and up to everyone's standards.  I think sometimes &quot;critics&quot; take things too seriously, look for every little mistake and if you're busy doing that then how can you possibly be watching (or 'gasp'actually enjoying) the movie?
B000002U8G|5.0|Here's a track by track breakdown:<br />One of These Days: A nice bouncing bass line, Dr. Who Synth lines, and  wicked lyrics make this one a 5/5<br />Pillow Of Winds: A sentimental favorite of mine, and of the prettiest songs ever. Listening to this reminds one of a falling feather. 5/5<br />Fearless: Amazing!!! Life Changer!!! Holy moly!!! The accoustic guitar is so clear and perfect and the singing is so amazing!! It's so well thought out and delivered with a level of sensitivity that is only achieved by the greats.This one is written from deep within. 5/5<br />San Topez:  Catchy song. One that you may not like at first but just you wait you'll find that you'll have &quot;As I reach for a peach...' stuck in your head. 4/5<br />Seamus: Seamus is pronounced Shamus. It's kind of like Sean/Shawn. On this one Floyd plays some deep blues with a real dog adding a nice effect. Not a life changing song, but short and pleasant. 4/5<br />Echoes: Pure genius!!! This song foreshadowed some of the greater themes to come on Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and so on. This song is a well orchestraded psychadelic masterpiece. 5/5<br />Final note, the genius of Fearless and Echoes makes up for any blemishes (as tiny as they are) that this album may have. This album is up there with the greatest albums ever made in my opinion and should be a part of any serious CD collection for a fan of rock music.

You'll understand her plight being the natural born shopper that you are. You can't help but like Becky.  She is the friend we wish we all had.  The inner shopaholic in all of us. So go out and spend spend spend... some money on this book:)
B0000AQVCL|5.0|These guys rock! When I first heard Jet, I thought they were a British band - but it turned out they come from Melbourne, Australia (my hometown). Critics say that their music isn't new, it's been done before...but hey - they make it fun.<BR>  Highlights for me are &quot;Rollover D.J.&quot; (one of those crazy, dance around the living room songs), and &quot;Look What You've Done&quot; (slow rock ballad)...but one could easily listen to the CD straight through without the urge to skip. <BR>  Check out The JET Player<BR> to hear samples of their tracks.  :)
0141007885|4.0|But allow me to try. Clearly the subject is complicated by a number of factors. The Cultural Revolution, The Great Leap forward are all elements of Chinese History that no one likes to talk about within China. As it was put to me recently in Shanghai, &quot;it's like knowing your parents have done something wrong yet we still object to hearing any criticism towards them from others&quot;. In this context China has numerous historical examples of barbarism towards their own, and in this instance Chairman Mao is the parent.<br />This societal denial complex and the shame of not protecting Nanking is added to an equation which includes the gross inability of the Japanese to see themselves as the aggressors in the of this war. This is because they are the last sentence of the last chapter of WWII, and it was the opening saga of the cold war, a Uranium atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The Japanese continued to refuse to capitulate and a subsequent Plutonium Bomb was then used on Nagasaki. It took a further week for Japan to submit. This gives an indication of the resolve and turmoil of the Japanese over their final decision to surrender. So there appears to be a guilt and shame complex on both party's side although with different dynamics.<br />That said, Iris Chang writes humanely and eloquently about the thin veneer of civilisation that witholds human natures' aggression the world over. It is by no means an anti Japanese book, but there is a coda that unless responsibility for the rape of Nanking is acknowledged and apologised for, future generations of Japanese will never purge their historical guilt.<br />As for the Japanese revisionist attempts on these reviews to even suggest that the rape did not happen, there are sufficient Japanese subjects still alive who have testified that it did. Japan is once more a civilised nation that contributes massively to aid in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and their conscience is appeased by these generous humanitarian acts. But until the school text books tell it like it is, then the notion of honour for Japans' future will always be questionable.the school text books tell it like it is, then the notion of honour for Japans' future will always be questionable.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|You know want to know one of the reasons why Tarantino's films are so great? The soundtrack. He--knows--his--music. Once again, he delievers us with a great soundtrack for Kill Bill. In my first listen, it was good, but AFTER I watched the film, it was even better.<br />Nancy Sinatra's &quot;Bang Bang&quot; is hauntily terrific. The upbeat song &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,&quot; by Santa Esmeralda, the head bobbing &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot; is also a terrific track.<br />Can I also add that I really like The 5,6,7,8's! Where have I been?! I need to go to Japan!<br />Also, if you like The Green Hornet, you will enjoy this soundtrack. :)
0385507755|4.0|I work for adults combating concurrent mental illness and substance abuse.  Most of them are chronically homeless, frequently incarcerated, and their bodies are scarred from fights with their dealers, their pimps, and their so-called friends.  Many of the women have their front teeth missing (making them appealing to John's who want oral sex).  Most are barely literate.  They don't have hope now, and can't remember a time they ever did.  Unlike the author, they have no families to fall back on, no one who will hunt them down to save them, no one who will care whether they live or die beyond the dealer they owe money to.  Yet somehow, this book accurately reflects so much of their internal dialogue.  This book is about pain...wrenching, murdurous, inescapable psychic pain.  It offers a glimpse of what is experienced by many of the nameless people you pass on the street and avert your eyes from.  It promises no solutions or redemptions except for what worked for this one specific, fortunate-in-some-ways individual, which is (I suppose) how it must be.  I highly recommend it, but only if you are strong enough to live with the resulting uneasiness it is bound to leave you with, especially if you are the type of person that hopes to leave this world a better place than what you found it.
0151006903|5.0|Baudolino is a great book, but not Eco's best. The meticulous detail of Rose/Focault is here, but seems to be streamlined. The Eco wit and sharp humor, however, is there. Baudolino is a born liar, and spins lies that take him from his peasant Genoa to the kingdom of Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor! <br />Eco makes Baudolino so believable a character that you might begin to think he truly existed. The first two thirds of the book have you turning the pages at a quick pace, wanting to find out just where Baudolino is going to end up or who he's going to affect with his grand lies. It's the last part of the book I find a bit tedious. Eco takes us into a more complex fantasy world from that point, and it seems like he's trying to cram a lot of information into that 1/3. It is said that he spent 6 years writing the first half, and then 6 months writing the last half. Could that have affected the book? <br />Eco is one of my favorite authors. I wholeheartedly recommend Baudolino. You will chuckle while reading this book, and possibly try to look him up in a history book!
B000084T18|4.0|This album isn't as bad as some people say, but if you like rap, you might like this album, his lyrics need some work, his first single &quot;In da club&quot; which is catchy with a tight beat done by DRE. his second single &quot;21 questions&quot; which is an excellent song with a tight beat also, but it have been played on the radio too much, but there are some pointless songs, and they seem like they were written in a matter of 10 min, like &quot; like my style&quot; and &quot; poor lil rich&quot;, other than that, this album is worth the price of admission
0887308589|5.0|The reason for the remarkable success of Scott Adams' Dilbert cartoon strip is obvious; he has captured the flavor of modern business and held it up to the light of truth, revealing all of its quirks, crazy strategies, and downright insanity for all to see.  Dilbert is the working man's hero; while we toil away in our little cubicles, waiting for quitting time and weekends, Dilbert and his pals are fighting back - well, not fighting, but they are doing all kinds of complaining, the same complaining most office workers do, albeit not so forthrightly.  The Dilbert Principle is the book that made a cult comic strip a treasury of American humor; taken outside the frames of his heralded daily comic strip, Scott Adams is even funnier and more insightful than even many a Dilbert fan would have thought possible.  He's been there, and he knows what he is talking about.<br />In this bestselling book, Adams basically defines corporate culture; telling us many things we already know yet doing so in a fashion that is brilliantly funny.  His explanation for the craziness of business today is a simple one: People are idiots, which is something I've been saying that for years.  Adams includes himself among the idiot population.  We all do stupid things from time to time, and those who do more stupid things than others wind up in corner offices with windows and a secretary while the majority of folks toil away in their sensory deprivation chambers (or cubicles).  Adams explains the nature of this beast we call the workplace, illustrating his points with the help of over 400 Dilbert cartoons and reinforcing even the most seemingly inane assumptions he makes with actual case reports of real people who have written to him of their own experiences.<br />The Dilbert Principle covers almost every aspect of the workplace: management, performance reviews, marketing, business plans, budgets, sales, those awful meetings, projects, etc.  He shows you how to get ahead at the expense of your co-workers, delineates the lies of management so that you can be on the lookout for them when they come, defines modern terms such as downsizing in the simple, more direct meanings of days gone by.  He describes the process by which one becomes a leader, exposes team-building exercises and group projects as the useless vehicles they almost always are, and provides advice on keeping afloat in the business world by means of hoarding information, avoiding doomed projects, and surviving those you can't avoid; from there, he goes on to offer his knowledge on topics such as: how to participate in a meeting based on the things you want to get out of it, and (as if most of us even need a refresher on this) how to avoid actually working while at work.  <br />The whole book is just brilliant, hysterical satire built on things millions of us know all too well, and one finds oneself nodding or agreeing with far too many of the silliest notions and business practices Adams rakes over the coals.  The book is a fountain of knowledge, with each page containing terrific quotes along the lines of three of my favorites: 1) The best thing about the future is that it isn't here yet, 2) The great thing about the truth is that there are so many ways to avoid it without being a &quot;liar,&quot; and 3) The only constructive criticism is the kind you do behind people's backs.  If you are a Dilbert-type worker (and odds are pretty good that you are), you will find comedy and a sense of comradeship with Dilbert and his cohorts.  If you really want to get ahead and assume the increased lack of intelligence needed to become a manager, though, you should pick this book up for one chapter alone: Machiavellian Methods penned by Dogbert himself.
0385507755|1.0|As an author, I'm not keen to insult the work of others, but this book is infuriating. It struck me as disingenuous in the extreme. I would hope the book IS fiction, even though it is  ostensibly an autobiography, since the author speaks boastfully of beating a man, possibly to death, while in a homosexual panic. One of the most blatant lies in the book is his assertion that the treatment program he attended demanded that he have root canals and tooth extractions performed without anesthesia.  This ridiculous lie caused him to lose credibility, very early on in the book. <br />The author's tone is self-aggrandizing, needlessly cruel and childishly petulant throughout. The characters are drawn with such broad strokes, and are so conveniently designed to serve at the altar of this author's ego, it's impossible to believe they are not fictitious. The one thing I do like about this book is that it provides a very clear example of the miserable attitude, anger and ego-based thinking that so often accompanies the \\"white-knuckle\\" brand of sobriety of which this author is so proud. There are many, many fine books written about addiction and recovery.  This book is not one of them.
B000002IOW|5.0|After i heard the hit singles &quot;Show don't tell&quot; and &quot;The pass&quot; i wondered about what is the rest of &quot;Presto&quot;...i alredy knew Rush and i had few of their albums in my collection.many of Rush fans were telling me that this is one of their weakest albums of all time and that i should leave it on the shelf.but it bought it - and i found that it is propably the bst Rush album up to now!<BR>i understand why people don't like this - the production is polished (typical late eighties sound),the tracks are no longer than 5 minutes (rush is famous for marvelous 10 minutes -up long progressive suits) and songs aren't catchy after first listening...but definitly if that album will grow on you,you can't stop listening it.<BR>Geddy plays his bass here more gentle although some crazy bass lines are still to be found.there are almost no sytnhs but Geddy is using a bit electronic sound very subtle...(&quot;Show don't tell&quot;,&quot;Scars&quot;).Alex Lifeson Proves that he is one of the best &quot;Atmospheric&quot; guitarist in the world.and Neill proves that whatever he plays on his Drums he plays it the best.<BR>Generally - if you love good Rock music or if you like RUsh you will surely love it...their best,their most moving (but i mus admit that &quot;Moving PIctures&quot; are also on my private top 3 rush albums) and most catchy...surely,a huge piece of music!
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|all i have to say is that if you have the strokes first album then you have a copy of this one too. Their is nothing different at all. very disapointing since I liked their last album. But if i want to listen to it i can put it in the CD player, I don't have to go out and pay money for the same album with different titles. If you like the strokes than it's good album it's just nothing new.
0440238153|4.0|I liked the Golden Compass and I REALLY,REALLY LOVED the Subtle Knife, but this book was not up to par with the Subtle Knife.  Also alot of it was kinda disturbing, i dont like the idea of 12 year old lovers, creeps me out. And his ideas or theories in the book about dark matter and such, are kind of silly to me, im a physics major, but it was cute.     Im not sure that I understood all of it, Dr Malone was to go through the window to do something, but how she do it.  Was it just telling them stories? I thought she was supposed to tempt them. I didnt get that part. I did love her friends though, the mufla, oh i forget how it was spelled, but how cute were they?  I love the way Pullman has her friend Atal ask questions about humans because they're so freakish.       The end of this book, though, is just retarded, he is just trying to drag out some drama from this story, like these poor kids need any other bad things to happen to them. It upset me that he split them up, they could have found a way. Splitting them up like that after, well i wont say to give away part of the story.     If you have read the other two read this book to get closure, dont expect it to be better than the second though.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Just surfing around Amazon.com and I stumbled across Gavin's CD and decided to listen to clips.  Just the clips captured me and as soon as I got the CD I put it in my CD player and fell in love!  This is one great, talented musician.  &quot;Belief&quot; is one of the most thought provoking, metaphorical songs I've ever heard.  What a poet!  This is a must have CD for anyone who loves talented, singer/songwriters.
B00000G3PA|1.0|The story would like to tell us that it's easier to train a group of oil driller about outerspace instead of training astronauts on how to drill. <BR>Is the story writer an oil driller and would like to lift the status of an oil driller? or just another way to twist around logic so that it will make an interesting story? sigh..
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I got this CD after hearing the single and reading quite a few favorable reviews.  When I popped it into my CD player and listened until the end of Blue (track four) I was completely and totally blown away.  The first four songs on this CD combine nearly flawless vocals with amazing bass/guitar work with good drum work.  In fact, the first four songs prompted me to remark to my girlfriend that this could very well be one of the best CDs I've ever heard.  <br />Okay, moving on beyond track four: a nosedive of epic proportions.  After track four there are 8 songs that can be classified as ho-hum at best, with the exception of track 10, which is a slightly better than the filler that is track five through twelve.  <br />That said, it can be very difficult to find a CD these days with 4 great songs, and certainly the Thirteenth Step possesses 4 really solid songs.  Track 1 is maybe the best rock song I've heard in quite a long time and it runs in excess of 8 minutes long, and when it's over I find myself wishing it would run another 8 minutes.  <br />The bottom line is that the CD is decent.  It's not good, in that a CD can't be judged on less than half of it's content, but it's not bad as it has 4 terrific tracks.  It's just okay.  It's not fair to compare this to the work of Tool, so I won't. (Lateralus is a far, far, far better work)  But in comparison to APC's debut, I'd say this is a better album for the most part in that 3 Libras was the only song I would've classified as great from that effort.
0671027387|5.0|This is an outstanding, well constructed novel.  Very exciting, great characters, plausible story, fantastic plot twists.  You will probably do an all night reading session once you pick it up and read about the sled dog incident at the beginning.
0345347951|5.0|I loved this book.  Personally, it is my favorite Arthur C. Clarke Novel.<br />Whatever you do, though, don't read too many reviews that describe the plot, as your enjoyment of this book will suffer if you get too many hints about what is going on.  The real joy is exploring how things unfold, and how the storyline progresses -it is basically about Mankind's reaction to Aliens coming to earth.  (And that's ALL I have to say about the plot!)<br />It is just one of those cool books where more and more things unfold, and things start to get eerie and interesting, and at the very end the book comes to a fantastic close with a \\"punchline\\" that throws everything into a new light (kind of like in movies like \\"The Usual Suspects\\" or \\"The Crying Game\\".)<br />If you loved any of Clarke's other books like Rendezvous with Rama, 2001, the City and the Stars, and The Light of Other Days, then this book is definitely something you want to give a read.  And if you've read this book and are looking for others, then the ones I just mentioned are also reflective of his best work.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Watch the movie twice - you'll love it the second time.  Admittedly, it is a complicated movie, and sometimes difficult to follow, but after 2 viewings you'll understand the bulk of it.  It is truly an exceptional film.  Many people don't seem to like it because either they don't understand it, or they made assumptions about it.  I urge you watch the move with an open mind and let it grow on you.  I don't want to make it seem like it was bad the first time - far from it.  In fact, the mind-blowing special effects and fight-scenes kept me on the edge of my seat!  But there is far more to the film than this - and you will absolutely love it once you understand this!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|To give the Wachowski brothers credit, they didn't attempt to duplicate the first film. While Reloaded doesn't suffer from middle film syndrome but it does have the Tween syndrome; it's missing the freshness of the first film (the baby)and doesn't have the maturity of what one hopes will be in the last film (the adult). OK, enough psychobabble nonsense. What works in the film are the various characters and the set pieces. There's still plenty of unanswered questions and the story is far from resolved (closing on the strongest cliff hanger since The Empire Strikes Back).<br />Is Reloaded a perfect film? Well, frankly no and for many folks it will be disappointing because of the lack of resolution (many people forget--and I'm not suggesting the quality is comparable to Empire from the Star Wars series--that it made the least amount of money of the original trilogy). It's entertaining and continue to break new ground.<br />Zion is under seige. The Matrix has discovered its location and is using huge drilling machines to reach the city. The Matrix is preparing a massive attack with hundres of thousands of the metallic Squid that act as its mobile army. Morpheus, Neo and Trinity are still waiting to hear from the Oracle.<br />The commander of the city's forces believes that Neo is not the savior of humanity and believes that the cryptic prophecy that Morpheus believes in is garbage. Nevertheless, Morpheus is granted his request to go back and plug into the Matrix when they receive a message from the Oracle for Neo.<br />Meanwhile Agent Smith has, quite literally, become a free agent. His encounter with Neo which should have destroyed his program, has freed him. He is now able to use his abilities to change other programs into duplicates of himself and infiltrate human minds. His goal is still the same; he wants to find the way into Zion so he can destroy it and Neo for his own &quot;personal&quot; reasons.<br />The stunning set pieces include a sequence on a freeway (built not too far from my home in Alameda, California)where mass destruction takes on new meaning. There's also a number of stunning fight sequences. I found the fight sequence with the mulitple Smiths and Neo to be too protracted and fake looking. It's clear which sequences were completely computer generated. The major flaw with the film is its lack of focus. The brothers throw everything that was successful from the first film into the second whether or not it has a place. The result is a film that goes off into too many action sequence tangents.<br />Matrix manages to be bigger and bolder than its predecessor. Clearly the brothers felt the need to top the first film. Instead, they should have relied on their instincts and crafted a much different film. There's elements of that different film buried under the weight of this sequel. Reloaded tries to be all things to all people when, in fact, the brother's should have followed their muse and created something different from the first film and as startlingly fresh as well. Reloaded is a good sequel that provides much action without much advancement in the plot.<br />It's a good sequel that could have been a great sequel. Nevertheless, the film is fun if you don't take it too seriously or focus on its flaws too much. I mentioned Superman in my title. The problem with Superman is that he's seemingly invicible. The human qualities of Superman make him interesting and when he's in peril it can be rather boring; everyone knows he'll win because, well, he's Superman. Let's hope that the third film doesn't fall into this predictable rut as well.built not too far from my home in Alameda, California)where mass destruction takes on new meaning.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although Firefly took a while to get its feet (around the 5th episode) once it got its space legs it was the best thing on TV last year (2002). It had wonderful characters who were given depth by an amazing cast, challenging plots, and an amazing look and feel.<br />Futurama, The Tick, Firefly, and Andy Richter Rules the Universe were four of the best shows on TV. FOX cacelled all of them before their time. How can a network that is so good at developing cutting edge shows be so amazingly horrid at nurturing them once they hit the air so they can find their audience?

B00003CXPD|1.0|Billy Elliot is perhaps the most overrated film of the last few years. And I say this becasue the direction of the film is awful, the narrative is MTV-like, and there are too many cliches and superficial characters that make this film completely forgettable.
0446678430|4.0|I would first off like to address the person who said that Kiyosaki &quot;ignores the fact that 9 out of 10 small businesses go belly-up in the first five years&quot;.  First off, negative thinking will get you nowhere. Second, in my reading of this book, Kiyosaki in fact mentions this fact at least THREE times in this book in sufficient detail.  Kiyosaki acknowledged this as a fact but also mentioned that it also means that 1 out of 10 small businesses are succesful.  Meaning you have to be willing fail 9 times.  You learn more from failing than winning.  If everything was easy then everyone would be rich.  He mentioned that one of his friends lost $1,000 on 14 straight trades, but made $50,000 on the very next one.  The reason why a lot of people do not like this book is because they are perhaps expecting a &quot;get rich quick&quot; scheme; we already have enough of those.<br />For those that understand where Kiyosaki is coming from, his intention is NOT to tell people HOW to get rich quick, instead it seems to me that his main goal is to get people out of the context that they have to work for others and depend on these people in order to be rich.  For most people this is not going to happen, as long as your working for someone else no matter how much you make, you will NEVER be truly free.  Until people realize this they will be forever trapped in this world we call corporate America.<br />Kiyosaki does an excellent job in this book, he again hammers home the fact that &quot;How&quot; to get rich is not nearly important as &quot;Why&quot;.  Once we have our &quot;Why&quot; the &quot;How&quot; part becomes easier.  The points and &quot;lessons&quot; he uses in this book can be retitive, however this is nessacary in order to get his point across.  One point that he made that continuously sticks out in my mind is that the more money you make at your job, the more you become dependent on your job to take care of you.  This is why he said his &quot;Rich Dad&quot; made him and his friend work for free so they can come up with ways to make money on their own.<br />If any of us were forced to work for free, I think we would be VERY motivated to find other ways to make money. In this case our &quot;Why&quot; would be simple.  The reason why our &quot;Whys&quot; are so hard is because most of us our &quot;blinded&quot; by our salaries.  But in reality we are working for nothing.  The money we do make is taxed heavily and even worse, our companies could reduce our salaries or even worse lay us off anytime they get ready.  After we are laid off, what do most of us do? - Find another job and the process starts over again.  I admit I am still caught in the rat race at 26 but after seeing what my company is starting to do and how they treat their employees, I am beginning to realize the importance of working for myself and not for someone else.<br />Again the point of this book is to find our &quot;Why&quot; in order to get out of this rat race.  Many people will not like this book because it gives very few specific examples on how to get rich. (He does however mention Real Estate and the Stock market numerous times). Different things work for different people and the key is to FIRST find your &quot;WHY&quot;.  After you find your &quot;WHY&quot;, THEN find what YOU like and WANT to do, not just blindly DO what someone else did to become rich.  If you are looking for a book that will change your CONTEXT and thinking about money and WHY you would want to make it for yourself, then this book is for you, however if you are looking for a &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot; program, then you are better off staying up late and watching the endless informercials that come on TV.made him and his friend work for free so they can come up with ways to make money on their own. <BR>If any of us were forced to work for free, I think we would be VERY motivated to find other ways to make money.

B00005JM02|5.0|Recently, I saw Albert Brooks on Late Night with David Letterman, talking about Finding Nemo. Brooks, who stars as the voice of Marlon, the daddy fish, had taken his son (who, I believe was about five years old, the equivalent human age of Nemo), to the premiere. After about five minutes, Brooks said his son leaned over to him, and quietly said, the way a grownup might, \\"I cannot watch this movie,\\" and walked out. Late in the movie, the son returned, having obviously been crying. Leaning over, Brooks assured his son, \\"You are not Nemo.\\"<br />Such is the power of this fish story about father and son clownfish who become separated, and must struggle to find their way back to each other. Marlon is a loving but neurotic and overprotective father; Nemo is a frustrated young fish who wants to be independent and see the world, and resents his father for preventing him from doing so. We see an ocean (read: the world) that is a terrible, heartless, and yet joyous place that we frail fish must confront, as best we can, because there's no alternative.<br />The animation was done by the wonderful folks from Pixar, who are the closest thing to the reincarnation of Walt Disney. There is simply no comparison between the animation of the typical, visually flat, politically correct, contemporary animated movie (many of which are produced by Walt Disney Pictures!) and Nemo. In Nemo, the ocean floor looks like the ocean. And the characters are all ... characters. They are all physically distinctive, wonderfully written, and performed by gifted actors who - if you'll pardon the cliché - will alternately make you laugh and cry. Of particular note are Barry Humphries as Bruce the Shark, Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the Pelican, Willem Dafoe as Gill, Allison Janney as Peach, and of course, young Alexander Gould as Nemo. Ellen Degeneres, in particular, steals every scene she's in, as Dory, a gregarious fish whose memory leaks like a sieve. But this is Albert Brooks' movie. The Academy should give this man a special Oscar for the most moving voice work my wife and I have ever heard.<br />Thomas Newman, of the musical Newman clan (Alfred, Lionel, Randy) has produced a score that is subtle and unobtrusive much of the time, but at dramatic moments takes over, and is more impressive, with repeated viewings. He deserves his fifth Oscar nomination for Nemo.<br />Andrew Stanton's (Toy Story, Monsters, Inc.) screenplay, written with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds, brims with intelligence and wit (e.g., in an AA-style group of recovering - and frequently lapsing - sharks, the members intone, \\"I am a nice shark, not an eating machine.... Fish are friends, not food\\"), and Stanton's direction does not waste a scene. Every moment in Nemo will either charm you or move you. In fact, as my wife remarked, for all of its many comic scenes, this is one of the most moving movies you'll ever see. We've already seen it several times with our three-and-a-half-year-old son, who loves it, and yet with each new viewing, we notice things we'd previously missed.<br />Though I wish Nemo would win all of the big Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Screenplay), I doubt Academy voters will choose it over its live-action competition. And yet, I will be very surprised, if a better picture -- live action or animated -- is released this year. Finding Nemo is truly a find.<br />Originally published in The Critical Critic, October 17, 2003.

B000002MP2|5.0|This album is hands down the most influential of the 90's. Without this album there would be no sum 41, new found glory, blink 182, etc. This album opened the doors for a nice \\"pop\\" sound to hard rock music.

6304211740|3.0|Zefferelli certainly knows how to shoot a beautiful picture, but the script, the acting, and the casting were, overall, very disappointing in this dramatization of, what I would call, one of the most romantic novels of all time.  Anna Paquin's performance as the young Jane Eyre (though verbally limited by the script) was by far the best one in this production.  The adult Jane looked the part, except for being much too tall, but any attempt to capture the fire and spirit of the character was found greatly lacking by this viewer.  William Hurt is a fine actor, but I think he was sadly miscast in this role, capturing none of the passion nor the physiogymy of Edward Rochester.  Like other reviewers, I was not enough moved by the love story in this production.  I think the greatest fault was found in the script, which was very milktoast in comparison with the lush poetry of the novel.  The changes to the plot, I could have forgiven had they been handled in a fashion that kept the spirit of the book; I recognize that it is nearly impossible for a feature-length film to do complete justice to all the subtleties of a 19th century novel, but the deviations of plot seemed to serve no function - why, for instance, not do as they did in the 1944 film, and leave out the relationship with St. John Rivers altogether?  It was a confusing inclusion which served no logical purpose, and only prolonged the timing needlessly.  The best thing I can say about this film is its physical beauty - an ironic thing to be said about a story whose theme discredits superficial beauty as an attribute to be admired!
1563890410|4.0|With this fourth instalment to the Sandman series, Gaiman finally takes the time to introduce us to Dream's elusive siblings, the Endless. Although we briefly encountered several of them in The Doll's House, Gaiman allows us to spy in on the family dynamics as all six (or is it seven; note the one empty chair) sit around the table together and bicker and argue as most families are wont to do. The brief little write up for Desire, Despair, Destiny, Delirium, and Dream in the introductory chapter is most welcome, but why not one for Death? <br />Although the art was generally good, I found it a little off, at times. In particular, I didn't like the depiction of Dream or Death. I much better preferred how they appeared in Preludes and Nocturnes. To compound this problem, the text oftentimes had inconsistent images of both Dream and Death. I'm not sure why Dream sometimes appeared strikingly different in different cells on the same page, and I must say I found such occurrences distracting.  <br />I have no complaints on the story, however. Gaiman raises the bar here, and deeply immerses the text with the various myths held by civilizations past and present. Gaiman is obviously very familiar with these themes; his firm control of the narrative and adept insertion of these various complicated mythologies provides the reader access to people and places no other graphic novel does. Further, only someone with as puckish a sense of humour as Gaiman could contrive a situation where the Norse God Thor would put the moves on the Egyptian cat Goddess, Bast. Thor appears to be quite the party animal, too: drinker, swearer and maker of rowdy jokes.  <br />Like the other texts in the Sandman canon, I highly recommend Season of Mists. It is with this tome that Gaiman flaunts his `literariness' and proves that comics are capable of high art, too.
B00005MP58|5.0|It is very rare to see justice done to a favorite 19th Century novel by a 20th Century film, but this is one exception, as it is remarkably true to the original work.  I could even go so far as to say that the dramatisation improves upon the book - the characterizations of both Mr. Bennet and Mr. Collins were brought to life in the film so as to add to a reader's appreciation of them.  Eliza and Jane were perfectly cast, and beautiful actresses, to boot; Mr. Darcy was uncannily portrayed by Colin Firth to the degree that I shall never read the book again without picturing his face (with a fond memory!).  The music was a delightful feature in this production - as a musician myself, one of my favorite parts is to witness Mary Bennet's abysmal rendition of Handel's \\"Ombra mai fu\\" (in English) and the ensuing reaction by the crowd!  Such is the example of a delightful subtlety in comic timing that occurs repeatedly in this film.  I cannot say enough good things about it; I am rarely this pleased by a dramatic treatment of a great literary work.
B00005JL2O|3.0|The third Austin Powers movie, Goldmember, is a fair entry into the series.  The opening credits are great.  The film drags a bit, though, until it finds direction and places itself firmly onto the comedy track.<br />Worth a look.  Rent for a few real belly laughs.  Buy if you're a devoted fan to this irreverant special agent series.
B000002AVF|5.0|The perfect evolution from &quot;Music Box&quot; and my personal favorite album together with &quot;Butterfly&quot;...<BR>-Fantasy - It's impossible to sit still during this song. Wonderfully sung and incredibly sweet...<BR>-Underneath The Stars - The epitome of romance. You'll be *drifting, drifting, driftiiing*... Very much like Fourth of July from &quot;Butterfly&quot;.<BR>-One Sweet Day - I want this song played at my funeral. Gospel Mariah at her best.<BR>-Open Arms - One of the few songs she didn't write herself, but she sings it wonderfully. Very powerful.<BR>-Always Be My Baby - The song that got little me interested in music when my dad bought this CD for my mom. ;) Upbeat and kind of a preview of the genre Mariah was just about to embrace big time - R'n B.<BR>- I Am Free - I interpret this song as one of those universal &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; songs that could be about God, a guy, a girl... Gospel and very beautifully sung. Interestingly few words, too.<BR>- When I Saw You - Starts out like I Am Free, the rest of the song has parts that make one wonder how she can sing for that long without breathing. Really beautiful ballad.<BR>- Long Ago - Mariah's first real R 'n B song. Very... Slick.<BR>- Melt Away - Even slicker. Beautiful ballad that's sung quite low.<BR>- Forever - From the moment it begins, one recognizes it's a typical '50s song... But with a big touch of Mariah. Simply gorgeous.<BR>- Daydream Interlude - Dance song that's lyrically very reminiscent to Fantasy, but that's only logical since it's called &quot;Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix&quot;. It's basically built up of shreds of lyrics and music, giving it a very dreamy feel.<BR>- Looking In - One of her most personal songs. It's Mariah telling the world that she's really just an insecure being even though to an outsider, it may seem like she has the perfect life. Reminded me of &quot;Outside&quot; from the Butterfly album.

0446677450|5.0|Very poorly written but the information is worth the drudgery of reading it. The author repeatedly reminds us that an academic education does not guarantee success. His inability to write proves that he puts a de-emphasis on academia. However, he stresses that to be wealthy, you must learn about how money works in your personal life, your taxes and investments. Not being wealthy, I discovered many eye-opening ideas I had never been aware of. I am glad I read the book. It has motivated me to begin now to work on wealth. If you can get past the author's inability to quote a clich, you will find valuable information you have never read in any other book of its kind.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have been an avid Mac fan since Rumors, released when I was a teenager.  This album has the sonic mix missing since Tusk, thanks to the full return of Lindsey Buckingham.  It is amazing to hear this reverred band back in top form after more than 20 years.  I wouldn't compare this album to any of their previous efforts.  It is angrier but at the same time more reflective showing the emotional maturity Buckingham and Nicks have achieved, than anything the Mac has put out, with some expected social commentary that seems a bit pretentious but the personal commentary they are making is Mac at its best.  It is almost impossible to pick a favorite track on this very tight album but if forced to chose one, I would pick Nicks Running Through the Garden.  To me, it sums up so many of the personal and professional difficulties Ms. Nicks has been through anf translates to me personally, you can also hear the amazing rhytym section of McVie and Fleetwood. and Buckingham's unique sensibility.  In time, this album will be listed as one of their best efforts ever.  My most fervent wish is the 2 separate &quot;goodbye&quot; tracks at the end are not prophetic and this great band is not bowing off the world stage.
B000005RYQ|4.0|A very good collection for the casual fan, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; gathers the Police's most succesful singles, and since they were mostly a singles band, that's pretty much everything most people will need.<br />All their most accessible songs are here; &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;, &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot;, Can't Stand Losing You&quot;, the larynx-shredding &quot;Roxanne&quot;, and of course Sting's and Andy Summers' subtle reworking of &quot;Stand By Me&quot; - the classic &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;.<BR>(What? You don't believe that song is based on &quot;Stand By Me&quot;?<BR>Listen to the chord changes. Or ask Keith Richards, because I hadn't noticed it either until I read an interview with him where he mentions the Police and those two songs.)<br />Anyway, unless you're a hardcore Police fan (in which case you probably have all of their albums anyway), this is pretty much all you'll ever need.<BR>A fine, throrough compilation.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great relaxation CD.  I like to play it in the car, and it really helps me keep my sanity when I'm driving in traffic.  It's mellow and still fun.  Norah does a great remake of Cold Cold Heart, a song I remember from my childhood.  You have to have a sense of irony to turn a honkey tonk hit into a jazz remake.<br />The song Lonestar is another favorite of mine because I can rock my son to sleep when it's playing, or by singing it to him.  We &quot;dance&quot; to it, and it really takes his edge off.<br />This album is a great intro into jazz because it's cool, but not too complicated.  It's pleasant to listen to, but still invokes some jazz changes and great performances by the &quot;house&quot; band.  It's refreshing in that it's not over-orchestrated.  I listen to it again and again, and find myself singing the songs when the music has stopped.<br />I absolutely love this CD.
0385504209|4.0|A fun, fast read. Brown's book is exciting and great. Great for some free-time reading.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Why are so many people hung up on the style of this cd? This is Enigma's 5th album and i think one of their best. No artist is making the same music after 5 albums. So stop criticizing Michael Cretu for not putting any gregorian chants on this album and changing his style a bit. One of the things that make this cd so great is that it flows so well. From begining to end. Hopefully, somehow Enigma will have a much needed hit in America. They more than deserve it. &quot;Page of Cups&quot;, &quot;Boum Boum&quot;,&quot;Following The Sun&quot; are the highlights here.-Classic Enigma- aLSO WORTH NOTING IS &quot;tHE lOOK of Today&quot;, which is a very different song for Enigma.Very club oriented and obviously influenced by the island of Ibiza, which is where he resides. Michael Cretu is one of the most talented people out there. He has been putting out some of the biggest hits all over the world. First with his own songs(1985's &quot;When Love is The missing Word&quot;), then with his wife Sandra (Maria Magdalena) and now with Enigma. Here's to hoping that he never stops. Only one complaint from me--make Sandra the featured vocalist of Enigma again. To me and i'm sure many others she will always be the voice of ENIGMA.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Having only very recently become familiar with these talented Swedish boys I must say that DAMNATION is one of the more beautiful metal recordings I've ever heard.  The only thing I can really compare it to currently is the new Perfect Circle CD (also wonderful).  I'm not going to fully dissect every song here but they're all winners.  IN MY TIME OF NEED is probably the standout one for me at the moment (and i've only been listening to it for about 3 days).  The use of the Mellotron on many songs is incredible.  Really gorgeous.  Finally, I'd like to give props to sarcastic Metal Freek who wrote one of the best reviews of a cd i've ever seen.  keep it up!
B0000042H4|5.0|If you like Birgit Nilsson's Brunnhilde, you must listen to her Elektra and Salome with Solti. Those are astounding performances that will leave you breathless. Even if you do not have any affinity for the music of Richard Strauss, you must listen to Nilsson's Elektra and Salome. They are simply performances for you to hear and marvel at. She is stunning from start to finish, and it is not just singing everything loud. While other sopranos sing everything loud and make the performance unattractive, Nilsson is able to control her voice so that she is able to take top B's both fortissimo and piannisimo. Her phrasing is astounding. Don't miss it.<br />Of course, this most famous of Ring is mandatory for any opera colection. You will be poorer without this legendary set in your collection.
0553565915|1.0|If you are someone who 'wants' to believe in an afterlife, but are the LEAST bit skepical in its existance, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK !  This book will increase any doubts that you now have.<br />  I am sure that her comments on love of your fellow man are sincere, however I find the whole &quot;story&quot; quite disturbing.  This book belongs in the catagory along with Jack and the Beanstalk and Humpty Dumpty.  Jesus pleading with her to reconsider her decision to stay, meeting with the Council to evaluate her decision, warring Incredible Hulk like angels rushing off to fight demons ?? ...  c'mon, ....  she needs to check with the hospital records to find out just what type of drugs she was on prior to her trip to near sainthood.<br />  I am somewhat skeptical of NDE's, but I am also one who is searching for a reason to believe in them.  Betty J. Eadie's &quot;trip&quot; to heaven has only increased my uncertainty.  I now have increased doubts about the credibility of other authors in this same field.  I truly regret reading this book.
B000089RVR|5.0|If you love DIDO's 1st CD you will like &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, ALthough I have to agree that her new cd has more slow songs then the 1st, its still a great CD. My favorite on this album is &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;Dont Leave Home&quot; &amp; &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;. Overall DIDO has an amazing voice and even if I cant relate to some of her song lyrics the music and her voice is relaxing. Cant wait for the 3rd!
B00008BXJJ|5.0|AC/DC never fails to please me in the studio and here they are live and they still sound amazing, and tight, in time. All the songs are great and the sound quality is awsome, this is one of the better live albums I have ever heard along with How The West Was Won by Led Zeppelin and A Little South Of Sanity by Aerosmith.<br />  All the songs here are AC/DC classics You Shook Me All Night Long, Let There Be Rock, Sin City and many more classic and they all sound great, even the Bon Scott songs sound great through Brian Johnsons Voice.<br />  Like I said this is one of the better live albums you will ever here!
B00007JVBI|4.0|&quot;You Are Free&quot; is an enjoyable CD to listen to as &quot;background&quot; music, much like &quot;Moonpix&quot; but more varied and interesting. It completely masks the fact that (save for her vocals) Chan Marshall as a live performer, despite what the reviews say, is completely lacking in musical talent and comes across as obnoxious, not &quot;fragile&quot; or &quot;shy&quot;. Bottom line - if you like her other CDs, get this one as well because it's great, but definitely do not see her live - you will be disappointed.
0385504209|5.0|This book is interesting, fast-paced and well-written. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Even if you don't believe the theories it contains, you have to marvel at the possibilities... The only slight disappointment was near the ending (it seemed a bit fairy-talish...). Despite that, it's a definite must-read.
B0000028M7|5.0|Geez, what to say about this record. The one that got me into heavy music in the first place. It isn't like Meshuggah heavy or anything, but it is definitely metal to me. Staley was awesome and Cantrell can come up with these brutal riffs that are like someone running their fingernails down your back, peeling skin off every inch of the way.<br />This is basically the record that broke Alice. I think everyone has heard \\"Would?\\" at least once. Facelift sold a lot of copies too, but this record would define these guys. And it's easy to see why. For a major label band this is some twisted stuff. If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be a strung-out wasted junkie, then here's your CD. Take a look at \\"God Smack\\", which is, in essence, a pop metal tune. But the lyrics are depraved: \\"So your sickness ways a ton.... and God's name is smack to some\\". That's wild. And to think that this record went multi-platinum with people singing along to that kind of stuff. It makes me giddy. Mostly because people aren't being force-fed by the record labels. People bought this because they dug the music, not because MTV played their videos.<br />The songs are all classics. I can't say that about many records. I know the words to all of these songs and if you asked me to perform them for you I would regurgitate them word for word. The first two tracks are killer, nice and heavy tunes. \\"Them Bones\\" is a great opener with a sweet riff from Cantrell. Staley is the highlight, though, with his twisted vocal delivery. It sounds evil, and they actually made a really cool video for this tune. Great song. \\"Damn that River\\" is just straight-forward kicka** heavy metal. I defy the elitist \\"real metalhead\\" morons to tell me that this track ain't metal. Maiden and Megadeth used the same kind of song structures and no one questioned them, simply because they played faster. Pantera also uses the same song structure, but no one questions them because Phil screams instead of sings. But I digress. Cantrell's riffs are what make this one and trust me, it is heavy. Everyone knows \\"Would?\\", I think. Great song and I'll leave it at that. Then you have epics like \\"Rooster\\", \\"Rain When I Die\\", and \\"Dirt\\". Slow, brooding, heavy tunes complete with signature Cantrell bendy riffing and Staley wailing that leaves you feeling as though you've heard something great. And then you have psychadelic weirdness like \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Sickman\\" that just beg to be listened to alone in the dark. I would be remiss if I didn't mention bassist Mike Starr, and drummer Sean Kinney. Starr's bass lines were heavy as hell and a big part of the Alice sound. Just check out \\"Rain When I Die\\" and you'll see what I mean. Kinney had this uncanny ability to blend his drumming right into Cantrell's riffs, combining them into almost a whole. Once again check out \\"Rain When I Die\\" to see what I mean.<br />AiC has always been grouped into \\"grunge\\". \\"Grunge\\", my a**. This is a freakin' metal record. The term \\"grunge\\" should only apply to the posers like Creed and Nickelback who try, I repeat, TRY to ape this sound (and the sounds of the other 3 big Seattle bands) to sell records. Alice was one of a kind, the likes of which we'll never see again. If you listen to the aforementioned bands and haven't heard Dirt then I suggest that you toss that watered-down crap and listen to the real deal. Rant over.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Just wanted to say something in response to Terrence Reardon... he said &quot;Hail to the Thief is a intended swipe at our good President G.W. Bush and Radiohead are crying over spilled milk.&quot;<br />I'm sorry... President Bush is spilled milk?
6305428042|5.0|I am an adult who loves to watch the disney channel.  Everytime Hocus Pocus come on I get so excited.  This movie is worth the money you will pay for it.  It is definently underrated and should be given more credit.  Bette Midler is fantastic in it.
0783117523|5.0|Incredible-  this movie really effected me.  I cried days afterwards. I bought the DVD and haven't been able to bring myself to watch it again.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|A friend of mine kept pushing me to watch this film during summer. Regret that I didn't take his advice to see it on big widescreen. Finally, the stupid me wait till the DVD comes out for rental. Wow, what a great movie, good dialogs, good plot, especially the most classic famous mini coopers chasing scenes. Even though this is a remake from the one in 1969, still an excellent entertaining one! &quot;I trust everyone, I just don't trust the devil inside them.&quot; If you don't have a clue of what I am talking about, you got no imagination. That's why you're always the number two!
B00005JKN9|2.0|This movie was very boring to say the least! Don't get me wrong the plot was actually quite good, but it was just too stretched out of a movie to enjoy (even The Lord of the Rings movies are fun to watch). This movie should have been an hour and a half...not three hours. In closing, if you like movies that are unispired and are headache inducing, then look no further because this movie is for you.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This movie blows...<BR>Cartoony CGI, Bad writing, poor plot development. <BR>The Bros. W. claim that this was always made out to be a trilogy.. too bad this one seems ridiculously forced.<BR>I would rather watch my wife watch Lifetime network..<BR>Nuff said.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|I really only expected to get some good driving music out of this CD, so I was pleasantly surprised when I found it to be much more. It was great to revisit the stuff I listened to in high school. Sure brought back some good memories. Great sound, great voice and a lot of fun!
B000084T18|2.0|i really and truly do not see what all the &quot;fuss&quot; was about, 50 has a below average voice for rapping, his lyrics are shallow, but Dre, is behind the beats so you know they gonna be catchy, that is the only thing that saves 50 .
0156027321|4.0|For the most part I enjoy Martel's writing, especially the tidbits of clarity about life. But I did get a bit bored at times, not completely engaged. So did my tiger. But we persevered and for that we are glad. Didn't make either of us believe in God any more nor less, however.
B00005JL7Q|1.0|Let me see if this appears comical or enlightening to you: A shallow bachelor (Hugh Grant) lives for absolutely no reason except to snag single women, to have sex, and then to leave them worse off than they were before meeting him. In the process, he learns to prey on single moms, who are already emotionally damaged from prior relationships. <br />He lies about having a son and uses this connection to meet up with a woman in the group. Through another display of broken families and shallow relationships, he meets a 12 year old boy who he hates from the very beginning. This kid's mom tries to commit suicide, only to have her son see her in a near-death state. He even discovers her suicide note. She gets better, and the plot basically ignores the immense emotional issues associated with such a drastic act. Sure, the mom cries all day, but mother and son never spend more than 1 minute talking about it, and don't even scratch the surface of the issue. The 12 year old boy is bullied and picked on at school, and his suicidal mother has not idea. <br />The plot goes on, the bachelor tries to snag another single mother by lying about a son, and the story ends with an anti-climactic pseudo-cleansing of the viewer's emotions. The boy sings in the school Rock and Roll talent show, and gets boo-ed off the stage until the \\"heroic\\" bachelor comes on stage and plays a terrible song with him on guitar (this is moments after the bachelor comes to the talent show in order to dissuade the boy from committing \\"social suicide\\" by singing a song in the show).<br />Does the bachelor learn anything? Does the viewier gain anything? Does this movie portray anything worthwhile? No. No. No.  Sure, support this movie if you want to see the world continue to move towards immorality, suicide, selfishness, and broken families. Hail it as amazing if you are hoping to see more marriages end in divorce. Regard it highly if you disregard the institution of marriage and don't idealize healthy families.But for me, these aspects of society are not at all funny, enlightening, or entertaining to me. Sure, you could say that the bachelor learned something. The only problem is that the movie never clearly depicts this development. The viewer is left to hypothesize about the changes that the bachelor makes.<br />So, if you want a movie that insults your intelligence and leaves you worse off for watching it, then feel free to rent About A Boy. Just don't believe the reviews that say it's a comedy, it's enlightening, or it's the best movie of 2002. It' not. I wish I could give it zero stars.
0385504209|2.0|As a simple mystery it is nice for a sunday read but I was able to figure out ALL the clues WAY before the characters - and I'm NOT in Mensa. As a couple of supposedly intelligent people with their lives at risk the main characters made a boatload (think Titanic)of blunders.<br />Much of the 'factual' information is blended with a large portion of theoretical and not well grounded research. The Gospel of Magdalen has been around for quite a while - not news to me. If this book is about feminine power why are there No strong independent female characters? The female lead couldn't get herself out of a paper bag without a clue from 'ole grampa. The Goddess org. is led, dictated by, and set up by males - like little boys with secret codes, keys, passwords to the treehouse type stuff - what truly defining and powerful parts do females actually have here? There is no balance of power between Female/Male here. It plays on the fears of feminine/goddess thinkers and anti Catholic sentiment. For book sales it thus belittles what is an important and I believe historic movement in human thought.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is rainy day music, indulgent but inviting.  The radio hits, especially &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, are good, but &quot;3x5&quot;, &quot;Great Indoors&quot; and &quot;Not Myself&quot; are the standouts.  For me, these songs are thoughtful (without being too serious), unassuming, sweet and genuine.<br />However, this guy is getting a lot of flak from critics and it's particularly disturbing to me because I was an English major and I'm deeply committed to the necessity of criticism.  Except when it comes to John.<br />First with this CD, and then with his new one, which I haven't heard, everyone's annoyed with the way he balances on this line between art and commercialism.  He's too contemplative to have a Justin Timberlake kind of following but he can't get any real artistic credibility--his musical hooks are too catchy, his voice is too reminiscent of the dreaded Dave Matthews (I don't know of another artist with a fanbase as rabidly possessive!), his lyrics too trite, and he's just too cute overall.<br />And I'm saying, why?  Who cares?  I don't listen to John Mayer because I think it'll delve into the depths of my tortured soul--and maybe critics should stop assuming that John intends it should be so.<br />Why must a pop artist who doesn't dance or appear on the cover of &quot;Esquire&quot; have motives of 'heaviness'?  I, for one, keep &quot;Room for Squares&quot; in rotation as a sweet, diverting CD that makes me feel good.  I think many of his lyrics are really clever, whether or not they stand up to whoever these critics want him to be.  I don't think he's a musical or philosophical genius--which is maybe why his music feels so comfortable.  He could easily be a friend of mine from high school, who has achieved something that makes a lot of people happy.  Good for him.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This is an action movie, who cares what it is about? The effects are well done and the choreography is top-notch. Why is everyone confused about Neo being able to fly? He is the One, he can control the Matrix to a certain extent.<br />Oh yeah... this is supposed to be a review of the dvd....
B000002UB3|5.0|I think this is on of the best Beatles albums ever. The first half starts you off with some classics like Come Together, Something, and Here Comes the Sun. Then it gets into some nice slow songs like Oh! Darling and I want you. And who can forget the funny, yet slightly disturbing, Maxwell's Silver Hammer? The second half is beautifuly sturng together into one continous piece of music, starting with the strange Sun King. Golden Slumbers is a great song wich flows seemlessly into Carry That Weight, another great song. The short ballad Her Majesty finishes off the album nicely, but does sound a bit out of place. Over all this is a very good album and I would recomend it to anybody who is intersted in the Beatles.
B00005QCVY|5.0|To the reviewer below who asked why they don't release a widescreen version, the answer is that they didn't start making movies with &quot;widescreen&quot; aspect ratios (1.85:1 or 2.35:1, usually) until the 1950s, to compete with television. Before that movies were made with the &quot;Academy Standard&quot; ratio of 1.33:1, which is the same proportions as non-widescreen TVs (although before the 1930s it was 1.37:1). What this means is that the DVD actually is showing you the original aspect ratio, as the director intended it to be seen.
B00005S6K8|4.0|We own and enjoy both the 1954 original and this remake.  I have to tell you in many ways we like this film better--the original cast had the powerhouses--Bogart and Hepburn.  But this film has more talent when considering both the leading and supporting roles. Julia Ormand makes a delicious transformation from latent teen to vivacious young woman. Nancy Marchand is the perfect matriarch, and Dana Ivey delivers wonderfully as the dry-humored secretary for Linus. You won't regret buying this one.
1565847032|5.0|...and very fine explainer, that is Noam Chomsky. I do not understand why anyone would label this book &quot;controversial&quot;. He does nothing but state facts (often government-documented facts) and express opinions. When he doesn't know, he says so. This kind of behavior is controversial? If so, then heaven help us.<br />But it IS controversial, because many of my fellow citizens have been persuaded to stop seeing, and stop thinking. When that is the case, even the most well-documented, thoroughly proven facts become controversial. Very sad.<br />The (well-proven) export of terrorism by the U.S.<BR>The (palpably obvious) lack of real distinction between Republicans and Democrats.<BR>The (thoroughly documented) U.S. suppression of independence movements world-wide.<BR>The (again, well-supported) derailing of the Mideast peace process by the U.S. and Israel.<BR>Etc, etc, it is all here.<br />There are a couple of weak areas: Chomsky's espousal of anarchism (perhaps I just &quot;don't get it&quot;) and his failure to understand that there were, in fact, very plausible reasons for assassinating Kennedy (Chomsky understands why King was offed, but doesn't get Kennedy, who, in my opinion, was obviously killed to support Johnson's life-long ambition to be President).<br />All is all, an excellent book which confirms and greatly extends many of the conclusions I have come to over the years. Part of the reason I have chosen to live outside the U.S., I suppose.<br />Buy and enjoy.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|What a treat to have this album available in a &quot;new&quot; package. For once, the additional tracks enhance the collection rather than just adding a few insights into the recording process or the cultural context of the time. When this album was first released on vinyl, I was a bit disappointed as I was such a fan of Coltrane's &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; - and I was acutely aware of the comparison. With the passage of time, this album stands on its own - as more than an homage - and as more than an example of a rock musician attempting to stretch his personal music boundaries. Carlos Santana presents an act of courage here and we are its benefactors. He was to continue in this vein for a few more exquisite albums (&quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;Borboretta&quot; especially), before returning to a more &quot;commercial&quot; sound. <BR>One more thought before I end - How About A Reunion?????
1587990717|5.0|The premise of this book is that we tend to trust winners more than they should be trusted: many of them could have \\"won\\" (however you want to define the term) by pure luck.  Nassim uses the investment traders as an example... say that there are 100,000 investors.  50% of them make 25% on their investments in the first year, and 50% lose 25% in their first year.  10 years later, through pure chance alone some lucky guy might have made 25% each year, becoming filthy rich, just by luck.  Next year, he might lose it all (50% chance).  And this scenario takes place often enough for Nassim to think that something very close to this is happening in the real world (outside of hypothetical examples such as this one).  Another example you've probably heard of... given enough monkeys and enough typewriters, a monkey is bound to write the Iliad.  But does that necessarily mean that you should sign him up to write the sequel, The Odyssey?<br />The key to making intelligent guesses about who succeeds based on pure luck and who has actual skill is to examine the initial size of the pool from which the winners were picked.  Usually, the losers are invisible... you don't see all the companies that failed with equally valid business models when you look at the Fortune 500.  In a world with 6 billion people, it is no surprise that some people happen to be filthy rich... it doesn't necessarily mean you should trust their advice on \\"how to be successful\\" however.  On the other hand, if the Iliad came out of a scenario where there were only 10 monkeys, chances are higher that Homer's been turned into a monkey.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book... it was very enlightening for a non-expert of probability, investment strategies, and randomness like myself.  Expert opinions may differ, though, which even he admits.<br />He has a revised version of chapter 11 out on the internet that is really good too ([...]
B00005Q4CS|4.0|For about one hour and forty minutes, Requiem for a Dream was the most harrowing - and entertaining - drug movie I'd ever seen. The solid story of four intersecting lives in a rapid descent to hardcore drug addiction, performed to perfection by all the actors, combined with truly original and dazzling imagery as the camera concentrated on those moments when the fix comes in. <br />I cared about these people. <br />And then the screenplay committed the cardinal sin: ripped my willing suspension of disbelief into shreds when one lead character was in need of immediate medical attention and instead was given grounds for a major lawsuit (not giving away the spoiler for those who haven't seen it). <br />In that moment, Requiem went from being a brilliant film to being the best-produced Partners for a Drug Free America commercial, ever.
B0000959N0|1.0|When I popped in the Daredevil DVD, I had no idea what I was in for, and now I know why they say Ignorance is Bliss.  <BR>       Apparently the casting agent knew this screenplay would need all the star power it could get its hands on to give it even midget legs.  And they were right, Ben Aflek, and Colin Farrel are just some of the people in this movie that I hope were paid really well for what they had to go through on camera.  The movie starts out with a kid and his boxer dad living happily together, but one day, the kid gets toxic stuff in his eyes.  He wakes up blind, BUT sounds he hears produce images in his head.  Later in the movie, the kids dad is paid to throw a fight by \\"The kingpin\\" wich he fails to do.  The dad is then beaten, and killed, so now \\"Daredevil\\" has sworn to avenge his father by killing everyone who commits a crime.  <br />Colin Farrel on the other hand, plays and even MORE stupid charactor.  A man who is deadly with anything he can throw, \\"Bullseye\\".  There is a scene where bullseye actually chokes a 90 year old woman by bouncing a peanut off the back of an airplane chair, into her throat and choking her.  Now, I like alot of violent movies, but is it just me, or is that unnecesarily sick?  <br />In conclusion, a blind superhero who uses sonar to fight people, In my opinion, is just kind of a bad idea.  On top of that, the writing tries real hard to be witty, but really just doesnt cut it.  And the bad guys, are just lame.  So, I give it 1 star.  Now, there are people I know who did like it, so maybe I'm being to harsh, but I'm telling you just from my own expierience, the movie, which I watched with another friend, gave us alot of unintentional laughs, and we found ourself cought in alot of \\"What the heck?\\" and \\"Oh come on!\\" moments.  I personally, would not recommend it to anyone older than 13, or anyone who isn't a big fan of comics.
B00004XONN|5.0|This surely is one of the most delicious albums I have ever heard!<br />Thom Yorke and the other producers have created a true marvel in modern music.  Intelligent, thought-provoking, melodic sounds and lyrics have helped accomplish an amazing feat.  They have alienated some of their own fans and have gone to a new 'higher' level of talent.  I still enjoy Pablo Honey &amp; OK Computer, but Kid A has taken top spot in my Radiohead collection.  I can listen to this CD with bizarre frequency and never seem to get bored.  I almost get a rush when I hear the opening beats to certain songs.<br />Some fans may be scared, but they must give it time.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie is a classic.  It's a very zany comedy, don't expect it to get serious for even one second.  Besides the hilariously funny scenes such as the gasoline fight, the model \\"walkoff\\", the brainwashing scene, and the orgy, there are a lot of more subtle jokes that you can miss if you're not paying attention.  This is definitely a movie you need to watch at least twice in order to catch everything.  Every scene with Will Ferrell and his look-alike poodle is great.
B000002UAO|5.0|I have noticed that while &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Pepper&quot;, &quot;The White Album&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot; usually battle it out for &quot;Best Album Ever&quot; (Beatles or otherwise), it is &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; that I hear the most whenever I am over other people's homes.  Because of this, I have come to the conclusion that while it may not be their very best (I'm a &quot;Revolver&quot; fanatic), it is arguably their most user-friendly, collecting as it does their finest collection of songs before all that psychedelic weirdness set in.  <br />The folk-rock sound of Dylan and The Byrds is most evident, especially on the jangly &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;.  Acoustic guitars are everywhere and the lyrics are either a gentle brand of social commentary or<BR>a magnified look at relationship troubles.  Often overlooked are the rockers, which were the most sophisticated up to that time: &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Think For Yourself&quot;, &quot;The Word&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; all feature original bass work (esp &quot;Drive My Car&quot;) and a slightly heavier guitar sound that looks forward to the next effort.  Fuzz bass is utilized on &quot;Think For Yourself&quot;, hammond organ appears on the anthemic &quot;Word&quot; and a sitar pops up for the first time on &quot;Norweigan Wood&quot;, which served notice that the group were beginning to look for fresh new ways to widen their style.  All applications of new ideas are successful, especially George Martin's vari-speeded piano solo on the touching &quot;In My Life&quot;, which many might mistake for a harpsichord.<br />This was the last Beatle album to contain real filler, however: Ringo's contribution &quot;What Goes On&quot; mimicks &quot;Act Naturally&quot;'s light rockabilly placement at the beginning of side two, and Lennon's &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;, while not awful, still remains one of the weakest closing songs on any of their albums.  Had singles been allowed to be on the albums, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; might have been hugely strengthened by the inclusion of &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; to open side two and &quot;Day Tripper&quot; as the closer.  As it <BR>stands, though, there are enough pure classics on this work to <BR>make it one of the top albums of all time.
B00001MXXH|5.0|this has to be one of the greatest comedies of all time and certainly one of the top 5 teen comedies ever.  It has John Hughes with Matthew Brodrick, who is outstanding.  this film shows what every highschooler wishes they could have been.  The supporting cast, everyone from Principle Rooney to Ben Stein (who is actually quite well spooken, very articulate and highly intellegent.  And still willing to do his famous line when asked.  I've heard him.) Charlie Sheen is great as the druggie who helps put some perseptive into Jeanie's life.  Mia Sara is great even if she say's that she overplayed her role.<br />This is a great, entertaining romp through Chicago on any teen's dream day.  Watch it to believe it and have a great time.
0966638328|5.0|Dear Leatrice-<BR> <BR>Although I LOVE color, it's the mixing of color and how color effects people that baffles me.<BR> <BR>As a business and life coach, especially in business, often my clients ask me to guide them and their graphic designers.  (which believe me is worse than the blind leading the blind)  Personally, my wardrobe resembles Skittles and my home is a more subdued version.<BR> <BR>However, I often refer graphic designers and web designers to your book and most of my clients end up with a copy as well.  <BR> <BR>Thank you for writing such a clear concise book that give real information about how to combine color.  <BR> <BR>I'll never be an expert, but your book gives my suggestions a little more credibility and helps my clients make better choices.<BR> <BR>Interesting what you say about the light where you live.  Here on Cape Cod, the light has a definate yellow cast.  Many of Edward Hopper's Cape Cod paintings show the odd light.<BR> <BR>Thank you!  Great books!
B00009ATIX|1.0|I have been watching the DVD version of this movie for an hour, and still have no clue what the point is.  If I were in a movie theater, I would get up and walk out.  About the only high point for a female viewer would be to see George Clooney's rear end.  Totally confusing movie.
076790592X|5.0|What are life's greatest lessons and what is it that really matters in the end?  Your job? Your car? Or, is it the relationships that you create with others and the lives you touch?  A proffesor and man of great spirit and wisdom, Morrie Schwartz knows the answer and has very little time to share his knowlege of life before his very own comes to an end.  Reunited with Mitch Albom, an old, yet favorite student after a deadly health diagnosis, Morrie reaches out to him in a way that will change his life forever.  Now, yours can change too.  Mitch, after meeting with Morrie every Tuesday until he died, shares with the world the beauty of their friendship and perhaps some of the most important life lessons there are.  From Mitch's college days, to Morrie's interview with Ted Koppel, every page is heartfelt and composed wonderfully.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will want everyday to be Tuesday...
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer slowly gained pop acceptance into the pop world in early 2002 *largely thanks to constant VH1 exposure* and by the summer of 2002, his first single &quot;No Such Thing&quot; was a pop radio staple and &quot;Room For Squares&quot; began selling like hotcakes. Although, he's gotten a lot of slack for supposedly imitating Dave Matthews, I personally don't care. &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is a great listen and really shows John's songwriting abilities. <br />Although &quot;No Such Thing&quot; has been majorly overplayed, it's still a great song and a big album highlight. &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; was the other massive hit off of this album and John sounds great on it. &quot;Why Georgia&quot; is a catchy guitar driven track as is my personal favorite song on here &quot;My Stupid Mouth.&quot; Other highlights include &quot;Neon&quot;, &quot;City Love&quot;, &quot;Back To You&quot;, and &quot;st Patricks Day.&quot;<br />Obviously John Mayer did something right with this album considering its still relatively high on the charts over two years after its initial release. If you enjoy this, I also recommend his latest album &quot;Heavier Things&quot; which is an equally enjoyable listen.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This movie has way too many fighting sequences that, in my opinion, only serve to try and detract the viewer from the absence of an intelligent script.  Furthermore, many aspects of the movie did not make sense.  For example, the viewers first glimpse of the control room (looking so organised and futuristic) gives the impression that Zion is going to look similar in appearance. This was not so, and left me confused, as did numerous other scenes that I will not mention in this review. Neo flying everywhere?  There was too much of that.  And can the writers explain the reasons (apart from a deliberate attempt to extend the film) for some of the senseless dialogue?  The whole trouble with this movie is that too much emphasis was placed on special effects and not enough credit was given to the intelligence of its intended audience.  Many people waited for this sequel only to sit down to a great disappointment.  It is a terrible thing to walk out of a cinema discussing the things you hated about a movie you've just seen, don't you think?  I already wasted good money on the tickets.  I'm not about to purchase the DVD.
0060007737|3.0|I've been branding for most of my life. It's an intrinsic and essential feature of my profession. I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know - that is, until I saw this book. It claims to cover everything, and I must admit even I would be hard pressed to come up with 22 laws. Personally, I find some of the concepts apparently introduced in this book a bit far-fetched; I can't imagine how an idea like &quot;branding people's minds&quot; could be put into practice, nor, indeed, why you would want to. And as for &quot;branding over the internet&quot;, well, to me that's just pure science fiction. Branding is a fairly personal thing, though, and everyone has their own tricks and techniques. I applaud the author for treating it as a serious enough subject to warrant an entire book.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Some reviewers take this stuff just too darn seriously. It was a good movie. Did it keep you interested? If yes, then you can walk away not feeling screwed out of a rental fee. If not, well, that's life. We enjoyed it, it was time well-spent together.
0385504209|4.0|I admit, I was clueless about the hype surrounding this book. I just knew that it was on the bestseller list. So, I saw it on the library shelf, and thought I'd give it a whirl.<br />My favorite books are thrillers and mysteries, but sadly, the stuff that's being churned out these days is pretty much garbage. I didn't start this one with much hope, either.<br />Boy was I surprised! I am a former Christian minister (now a \\"New Ager\\") who's just now starting to explore the Divine Feminine. (You know how taboo *that* is, right? And believe me, it ain't just Catholicism...) I knew that El Shaddai meant many-breasted one, but that was about it.<br />The information in this book blew me away. It all made perfect sense to me. (Although I can certainly see how it would enrage Christians!) It's very rare that you find a book that is both an engaging work of fiction *and* a deliverer of historical and mystical ideas. It has whet my appetite to explore the Divine Feminine and this aspect to spirituality that I've been missing out on due to my upbringing.<br />For some reason, I felt the first 3/4 was the best part of the book, but it was very satisfying on all levels--even the ending. However, Brown gets into too much detail with architecture, the looooong cat and mouse part at Westminister Abbey, etc. A good deal could have been trimmed from this book.<br />The characters are memorable and unique: an Albino monk, an Englishmen in Paris who walks on metal crutches, a hot-head French capitan,... I felt as if I could see each and every one.<br />Setting wise, all the French streets and architectual references were lost on me, but the details didn't take away from the pace of the novel, nor the intrigue.<br />Technically, Brown did everything he was supposed to: ended the chapters with hooks, shifted perspectives fluidly, \\"showed not told\\", etc. It's formulaic...but formula *works*.<br />You'll enjoy this book if you love good fiction and if you have an open mind.
0780626966|5.0|This Box set I heard contains All 7 movies and a special 8th Disc only you can get in the DVD Box set. I've just ordered this and I've seen all the Freddy videos except Freddy's Revenge. The only DVD I've seen from this box set I rented at our local video store was Number 5 Dream Child. I've heard that Dream Child also has an uncut version which does not appear on the DVD only on the original old version tape. I must track it down then. The DVD that I saw was great. It was really remastered very well. The sound is a lot better then it use to be it seems though that the sound kept getting louder then quieter.<br />The Movies I've seen in order are:<BR>New Nightmare: A Nightmare On Elm Street 7<BR>This movie was really good I would have to say this is my all time favorite even though I loved the other ones. Heather is in this video with her kid Dylan. Freddy seems to be after Dylan and Heather will do anything to make sure it doesn't happen. This movie is a cross between Freddy in Dreams and Reality. He's trying to get into our Reality! (Viewed On VHS Tape)<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street <BR>Nothing better states the first video is always the classic and it is. I bet the remastered version is really good. I saw the very first version on Media Video. You can barely see Freddy's face in this one which though makes him look more creepy. This one is a classic too. My favorite death scene is in which Nancy's boyfriend(Johnny Depp) gets sucked into his bed and blood splatters the walls. This movie is great! (Viewed On Original Media Tape- Not Remastered)<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors<BR>This one was very different from the others to me it seemed a lot creepier. The death scenes are a lot more graphic then from number 1. Nancy comes back in this one as a Pyschologist. The most memorable death scene I think is the one where Freddy's fingers turn into hypodermic needles i think thats what they are called and kills one of the girl warriors. This movie was really good as well though! (Viewed On Original VHS Tape- Not Remastered)<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 5: Dream Child (Rated R Version)<BR>I've heard there is and uncut version to this film on the original tape not on the DVD. My local store had it but it was always check out now I know why. Greta's death scene was the best memorable scene Freddy chokes her to death while feeding her non- stop while the uncut version has Freddy cutting into Greta's stomach and force feeding her own guts and I heard the motorcycle scene was much more graphic then it was in the R rated version. Even though the DVD version was pretty graphic it seemed though that Greata's death scene was toned down. This movie though I really like! (DVD Version from The Box Set Viewed)<br />A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master<BR>My mother and my sister and her friends watched this one with me. We though this one was very cheesy in a way, but I seemed pushed to like it. I know it would be a lot better remastered. I liked a lot of some of the death scenes not very graphic except a really weird one at the end when Freddy forces a bar down on this girl breaking her elbows in which it looks like you can see her bones, but it's weird cause it's not she turns into a bug (a Cockroach) to summarize it and Freddy squashes her in a bug hotel. I did like this movie but not real well on death scenes. (Original VHS Viewed)<br />Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare: A Nightmare On Elm Street 6<BR>This one use to creep me out the one about Carlos, where Freddy shoves a cotton swab stick through Carlos' ear. The was still one of the memorable death scenes in this film, but very funny when Freddy scratches a board and his head blows up. All in All me and my sister laughed in this film. I actually really like it. You should check it out. (Original VHS Viewed)<br />I havent seen Number 2 yet I probably will when I receieve my box set Monday October 20, 2003. I got my for a cheaper price for 83.64 brand new includingshipping. It's really hard to put these movies in order for best to most stupid cause they hold something great about em, but all i can say is this one box set you have to own! I will be sure to Rent the orignal version to Dream Child or even buy it off ebay or something!
B0000AK7AC|1.0|One of the benefits of DVDs is the ability to skip to any part of the movie easily.  This benefit is exceptionally true when you have kids and they want to watch a movie.  Normally, you can skip the trailers and head right to the movie or at least the main menu.  This DVD makes you go through each of the many trailers before you can get to the main menu.  You can't fast forward through them or skip them.  You must wait until the trailers have completed then select \\"Play\\" from the main menu.  Because of this, we would have rather bought the VHS version of the movie.  With a tape, you can at least fast forward through the trailers!
B000031WYP|5.0|This is the ultimate live recording of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana. The audience noise doesn't even exist in the recording. Karajan's choice of casting characters is very good. The La Scala Orchestra plays excellently like both Karajan and Mascagni himself wanted. And the La Scala chorus is the same way. Carlo Bergonzi is a Beniamino Gigli-like Turiddu and really sounds excellent the whole way through, especially in &quot;O Lola, ch'ai di latti la cammisa&quot; or &quot;No, No, Turiddu&quot; or &quot;Compar Alfio, Lo So Che il Torto e mio&quot;, or even in &quot;Mamma, Quel Vino e Generoso&quot;. Carlo Bergonzi is the best Turiddu ever. And Fiorenza Cossotto as Santuzza is as great as Mascagni wanted Santuzza to be like. Cossotto is like no other Santuzza: One who never oversings and one who's not a &quot;Zinka Milanov acting like Maria Callas&quot; like singer. She sings &quot;Turiddu mi tolse l'Onore&quot; and &quot;Voi lo Sapete, O Mamma&quot; nicely. Mariagrazia Allegri sings the role of Mamma Lucia excellently and she sounds as old as Mascagni wanted the character to sound. Giangiacomo Guelfi is the loudest and greatest Alfio to cast. He's a super-villain in &quot;Il Cavallo Scalpita&quot; and &quot;Ad Essi Non Perdono&quot;. This is by far the only Cavalleria Rusticana for people to get.

B00005JLPK|5.0|Julie Taymor is in the driver's seat for this wonderful look at the life of Frida Kahlo, one of the greatest artists of the 20th century - but this is a collective effort in the truest sense of the term.  Selma Hayek, who turns in what is very likely the performance of a lifetime as Kahlo, is listed as an executive producer - and the contributions of all involved in this masterful film are important and noteworthy.  The cast and crew have managed to tell the story not only of the romance between Kahlo and the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, but also of a time and atmosphere that we will - sadly - unlikely see again.<br />The Revolution in Russia - and the possibilities it presented for the working classes worldwide - lit a fire in the hearts of many, igniting hopes and passions for a better world.  Each person touched by this flame saw it illuminate their life and their work in an individual way - and artists were certainly no exception.  Diego Rivera's murals are legendary and timeless testaments to that passion.  The passion that stirred between Rivera and Kahlo is a legend of its own - Frida knew full well before she even met Diego of his reputation as a womanizer.  The love the blossomed between them drew them together despite - and very likely because of - the things that existed within each of them that, in many relationships, drive people apart.<br />Taymor's film uses incredibly beautiful - and moving - images to augment the live action.  Many of these are taken from Kahlo's works - there are a couple of scenes in which one of Frida's paintings is transformed into live action, to wonderful effect - and some are completely original, created especially for the film.  A couple of these latter scenes are based on traditional images from the Mexican Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), and are chillingly effective - and not without humor.<br />The horrific accident which left Kahlo's body damaged for life certainly didn't kill her spirit - and it is this spirit, combined with the innate talent she possessed for turning her inner feelings into art, that make her work eternally relevant and inspiring.  We all carry around pain inside of us that accumulates over the course of our lifetimes - Frida found a way to access that pain, to make it visible to others, to express it and process it.  We could all learn a lot from her.  Kahlo and her work should be more widely known - something that has begun to be corrected in the last couple of decades - and held up as a role model, not just for women and Hispanics, but also for human beings in general.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras (you can check out the list above) that make the viewing experience even richer - unlike some releases, where the viewer is left with the feeling of sorting through filler.  The film itself is worth the price of the DVD - the extras just sweeten the deal.  This is a labor of love - members of the excellent cast working for scale, as they did - and it shows.irit, combined with the innate talent she possessed for turning her inner feelings into art, that make her work eternally relevant and inspiring.

0790734850|5.0|Proving to be much better than originally anticipated, L.A. Confidential was a hit with critics and managed to win Oscar's for Kim Basinger (Best Supporting Actress) and screenwriter Brian Helgeland.  Based on a series of James Ellroy's novels which takes place in 1940's Hollywood; L.A. Confidential manages to be one of the best mainstream film noirs in recent memory, and thanks to the brilliant directing by Curtis Hanson and the memorable ensemble cast (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, and Danny DeVito) helps make this film something truly special.  The DVD itself is one of Warner Bros.' better DVD packages; containing multiple parts of behind the scenes material that is actually worth watching.
B000002GJH|4.0|When I first heard the Vedder/Cornell colaboration on the song &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; I was quite enamered with the album.  Im a huge Pearl Jam fan and not having heard any of the other tracks I made the assumption that Eddie Vedder did the vocals for the entire album.  After I purchased the cd and listened to it all the way through I was upset to find that Cornell did the singing on the remainder of the album.  Disheartened, I put the album on the shelf and forgot about it.  Months later, bored, i put the cd in for another listen.  After hearing the tracks a second time they didnt sound as bad.  After the third listen they sounded pretty good and after the fourth try i actually enjoyed the c.d.  My respect began to grow for Chris Cornell and the album spawned my future love for Soundgarden.  Something about his screaming, impassioned vocals coupled with the heavy looping guitar work of the boys from PJ appealed to me.  The cd is now one of my favorites from the alternative era.  Check out the catchy hook from &quot;Reach Down&quot; and the off key guitar riffs from &quot;Four Walled World.&quot;  They will take you straight back to 1991.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|What can I say about this CD? I and probably many other fans have longed for the return of the vocals of pre-1984 Ian Anderson. Listening to album after album and tour after tour of Ian struggling with his once unique voice left me wanting the Tull of the 1970s (a note to the uninformed - A Tull concert is still an event not to be missed). Now to hold a CD of Jethro Tull where music and Ian's vocals blend so magically is truly a gift to the many fans everywhere. His vocals are not truly what they were, but only the most discerning ear will notice much difference i.e. &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot;. Put it simply, this CD is a sequel to &quot;Heavy Horses/Songs From the Wood&quot;. So, if you liked Tull of this era, you will want this CD.
B000002B1M|5.0|A definite must have in any hip hop collection. This album wasn't given a chance from the jump,  Too much is made of the commercial appeal of this album & 2pac similarities from 'I Gave You Power', when it was really more like 'Stray Bullet' from Organized Konfusion. For starters Nas 1st referenced 'keep a tech 9 in my dresser' in the 'Back to the Grill'(remix) with Mc Serch in '91. Standouts are 'Take it in Blood', 'Suspect' & one of the Mobb Deep collabos 'Live Nigga Rap' in which he just paints pictures of the urban life & struggle so many of us live & breath. It's hard to actually write this review since I listen to this album everyday & consider all but 3 cuts my favorite. So here they are: If I Ruled the World-too commercial, Nas is Coming ft Dre-I just expected much more, Street Dreams-again too commercial. Just imagine trying to critique 'rap artists' nowadays for been 'commercial', when that's what they have to be to afford their lifestyle. Bottom line just buy it-I did twice- or borrow it from a friend & see for yourself. Don't hurt yourself snoozing.
6305807930|5.0|Dario Argento's INFERNO, the sequel to the great SUSPIRIA, is the director's most difficult film; it was hard for him to pull this one off and it took a lot of time. In the end, however, it was all well worth the effort. INFERNO establishes its link to SUSPIRIA in the beginning, as Rose Elliot (Irene Miracle of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS fame) reads the book &quot;The Three Mothers&quot; by one E. Varelli, an architect and alchemist who built three houses for the Three Mothers, who are really evil beings who rule the world through sorrows, darkness and tears. Rose, in fact, might live in one of those dwelling places, a hotel in New York, which is the dwelling place of Mater Tenebrarum, Mother of Darkness. (SUSPIRIA covered Mater Suspiriorum, Mother of Sighs/Sorrows.) Anyway, her brother Mark (Leigh McCloskey) comes to New York and gets caught up in the weirdness that ensues.<BR>As I said before, Dario Argento had a real difficult time filming INFERNO. He bypassed the witchcraft of SUSPIRIA in favor of alchemy for this story. Fortunately, he had help from another Italian horror legend: Mario Bava (TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE, BLACK SUNDAY, SHOCK), who filmed an amazing underwater sequence in the beginning which is a sight to behold and is really scary. Some think that the music student with the cat (Ania Pieroni of TENEBRE and Fulci's HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY) in the scenes in Rome is a representation of Mater Lacrimaurum, Mother of Tears; if that's so, what a great setup for the third film that would have been. While not as mind-blowing as SUSPIRIA, INFERNO is a wild experience in its own right and has an equally awesome music score (here by prog-rock vet Keith Emerson) and scary imagery and lighting reminiscent of an EC Comic book.<BR>BTW: Have you noticed any similarity between this and Fulci's masterpiece THE BEYOND? I mean there's the house that maybe concealing some sort of evil, there's the gruesome murders at random, and there's the awesome score! Anyway, you have to see THE BEYOND, and I'll explain why in another review. But give INFERNO, Argento's purest film, a try but watch SUSPIRIA first so you'll understand this movie better!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Brilliant arrangement of 2 guitars playing chords in repetition.  It sounds a lot like Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and sometimes singer has a voice like Jim Morrison (see beginning of &quot;Leif Erikson&quot;).<br />Good album with only one weak song &quot;Roland&quot;.  Favorite songs: &quot;Obstacle 1&quot;, &quot;PDA&quot;, &quot;Hands away&quot;.
B00005JM09|2.0|There is a noted similarity between this movie and the second Planet of the Apes movie (Return to the POTA).  Each movie is a rehash of the previous, but no longer fresh or as smart.  The characters run out of room to escape fate, and the world ends.  Been there...
B000056VJ7|5.0|If there is one album that anyone needs to make their collection complete, it's this one.<BR>Thanks to Jim Steinman's masterful writing skill, there's no question that this is the complete package of music. The rock half of the album is constituted of &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot;, &quot;You Took The Words&quot; (who CAN'T recite the opening to that on demand?), &quot;All Revved Up With No Place To Go&quot; and &quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&quot;, but for my money, it's the ballads that make the album.<BR>&quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; is beautiful and &quot;Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad&quot; is classical, but by far the best track on the whole ablum is the wonderful and orchestral &quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot;.<br />An album doesn't stay in the UK Charts (by far the most significant charts on the planet) for over 400 weeks for nothing. Bat Out Of Hell is THE album to own, no question. (My money is that it outsells &quot;Thriller&quot; by 2010).
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The first X-Men movie really had a lot going for it, despite the limited time and and budget that Singer had to work with.  Fanboys have been drooling to see what he can do with a longer shooting schedule, bigger budget, and wider studio support. X2 is the amazing result of all three.  I'll have to rank this with one of the best comic book movies ever, along with Tim Burton's first two Batman films.  From the onset of the movie, which starts off with a jaw dropping sequence involving Nightcrawler's assasination attempt of the president, to Storm's summoning of hundreds of tornadoes to destroy two fighter planes, the action, drama, and special fx have been upped to a spectacular degree.  Singer has the rare ability to cater both to a mainstream audience and to die hard fans like me.  The whole movie is accessible to people who have never picked up the comic book, but for those who have been reading it for years, Singer drops in several nifty novelties.  As usual Singer infuses what would have been otherwise a dry action movie with a much more deeper social commentary on prejudice, intolerance, and the politics of difference.  The conclusion of the movie serves as a nice cliff hanger/fanboy appreciation/ tear jerker moment as Jean transforms herself into a certain fiery cosmic entity...I can't wait for the next one!!!!
B00005LQ04|5.0|Two weeks ago, at 5:30 in the morning, I watched SUSPIRIA for the first time. No wonder why this is the most popular horror movie from Italy; this movie is not just a horror movie, it's an entirely new experience! SUSPIRIA is about an American ballet student attending the Tanz Academy in Germany and the weirdness she encounters. I won't go into the plot too deeply, or anything else about it, because it really doesn't matter and it doesn't make much sense anyway. But I will say that the effect of SUSPIRIA is akin to a nightmare; it's as if Dario Argento went into somebody's mind as a nightmare was happening and captured it all on film! The sets, the lighting, the photography, the special effects, and that music score all make the expeirence unforgettable!<BR>The Limited Edition is the best way to own SUSPIRIA. Along with the beautifully remastered movie (THX-certified no less), the Limited Edition includes a 25th Anniversary documentary with interviews and anecdotes from Argento; co-writer Daria Nicolodi; stars Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Udo Kier; the band Goblin, who made that awesome score among others such as Argento's DEEP RED; and others. It also includes the CD soundtrack, the ultimate bonus; now you get to listen to Goblin's awesome compositions on your stereo or CD Walkman and get chills! Also in the Limited Edition are 9 lobby cards, the Chapter listings, and a great booklet including a Jessica Harper interview. As an Argento fan (or a SUSPIRIA fan), it would be inconceivable not to own this awesome DVD release of this incredible movie!
B00000099Y|5.0|this cd starts out with an amazing &quot;Stinkfist&quot; that completely grabs the listener and also provides amazing lyrics, all the way through the end it is a piece of art.  The cd cover is art, the music is art, this is the best Tool cd that has came out.  But my favorite song is on Undertow &quot;Sober&quot;.  Overall 100/5 stars.
B000060K4P|5.0|Ghostbusters is just one of those movies that leaves it's footprint on our culture's collective consciousness.  &quot;Who ya gonna call&quot; brings out an automatic response to anyone who lived during the 80s and even for many of those who were born after the 1984 debut of Mr. Stay-Puft and Slimer.  The Ghostbusters (1984) disk has everything a die hard fan would want, yet has interesting info on the filmmaking process to keep the casual movie watcher occupied.  It has several documentaries made during filming and a 15 year retrospective with cast and crew.  The director/star commentary provides amusing anecdoetes with Reitman and Ramis' silhouettes a la MST3K.  There are oodles of production photos,  concept sketches and even before and after SFX shots.  The only thing I regret it doesn't have is the music video performed by Ray Parker Jr.  <BR>   Ghostbusters II certainly doesn't equal or surpass the original, but it is still an entertaining film in its own right.  Definately worth buying for the film, but unfortunately, the second disk doesn't offer hardly any of the special features that the original has.  Cast biographies and 3 trailers make up all this disk has to offer.  <BR>Both disks have a crystal clear picture and while the sound may not be up to par with more modern films, you can still hear the thrum of the proton packs and the rumble of the Marshmallow Man's footsteps with excellent clairity.
B00006LLNV|5.0|Soundtracks are usually mood music, and would not stand out without attachment to images of their film.This music would stand out anyway.The compositions are impressive enough to be traditional mexican favourites(of the yurning kind), which is why it is hard to believe that a relatively young/modern-world or 'non-mexican village old man' person wrote them.<br />The instruments are crystal clear (some are actually made of glass)and combine well together.Modern ones fit emotionally satifyingly with the old ones.No culture is lost in the process.The singers are excellent at crying whilst still hitting the notes. As sadness and tragedy is its motif, this cd is &quot;emotionally very heavy&quot;.
B000002L68|3.0|I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm in love with this cd and the movie. The movie just moves me to pieces. But come on, there were alot and I mean ALOT more songs in the film that were not included on the cd. I wish that they would stop excluding certain songs, for whatever reasons, off the movie soundtrack. If you're gonna have it in the movie, then have it on the cd too. That's just my arguement. <br />Maybe this cd doesn't deserve the 3 stars that I'm giving it. I'll admit to a large percentage of the songs on it, I love. Like &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;, Mariah's version doesn't come close, and &quot;Take me with you&quot;.  I only wished songs featured in the movie, were featured on the cd. Prince wasn't the only artist in the movie, so his work should not have been the only songs on the disk.
B000089RVR|5.0|I am really impressed by most songs in that album...<BR>It is relaxing, great to hear. Just get it! And if you<BR>liked her first album, there is no way you will<BR>not like this one.
6304696566|5.0|Let me be the first to say that I am by no means a fan of the western. I find them to be generally cliched and conventional, and rarely original. However, The Searchers is one of the greatest movies of all time and it avoids all the western cliches, telling an emotionally resonant story amid the backdrop of the uncivilized west without a single duel on an abandoned road. As a result, it has been proclaimed the King of the Westerns for years, a judgment with which I must agree.<br />The plot is legendary. John Wayne gives a great performance as Ethan Edwards, ex-Johnnie Reb and newly returned to live quietly with his brother's family when Commanche warriors kill them all and take off his niece to be raised among them. Edwards then begins his obsessive search along with sidekick Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) to kill his niece, figuring her to be better off. The frank examination of racism in this film was unusual for the genre and time period, and the depth of the characters and their respective arcs make this film one of the greatest ever made.<br />Unfortunately, the film is flawed. When watching it it is impossible to forget that this is a fifties-era western because of the presence of cowboy music and the cartoon-like introduction. Not that I favor changing it, but it sort of takes one out of the movie. I guess my beef is that it is a film of its times, rather than transcending it completely. Aside from this there is very little wrong with the film and it has aged well.<br />In short, this is a movie that belongs in the collection of anyone who loves a great film, even if you, like me, don't like the western in general. Its complexity and excitement make it still interesting and exhilarating today.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This well-paced, exceptionally acted, taut, moving drama, casted a line into my living room and pulled me in, never to release me until the last frame.  Everything of human triumph and tragedy, the essence of the life experience, comes out here, very believably.  Joan Crawford was a bit before my time, but I will never forget her now.  America's artistic tapestry is the richer for having her acting woven into it.  Watch this movie some evening when you damned well deserve the best the silver screen has to offer (and when distractions will be minimal.)
0440238609|5.0|These are beautiful, original stories. Some people were put off by the athiest message, but that's part of what I found so refreshing about it. (Nobody complained about the stifling religion in madeline l'engle's work) If you would have paid attention, however, you would have seen that the message was a powerful and positive one: Live life to its upmost and love it. That the most important place is where you are. That ordinary human beings (Lyra was meant to be ordinary- she is an anyone Girl) have the capability of doing great things.<BR>Live life so that you'll have a great story to tell once you meet \\"the after-death harpies\\", as it is. The other part I found refreshing and lovely about the dark material books is just the story in itself. The daemons, the pansebjorns- it was all just wonderful. And for a time I was really there. Not to even be compared with harry potter. These far surpass those stories in literary merit. These are beautiful books, Pullman!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is extremely amazing. I didnt expect it to come out the way it did. The thing is alot of people tend to hope bands make albums as good as the last album. Alot of people need to understand that both bands Tool and A perfect circle never made albums that sounded alike. I have to give A Perfect Circle well due respect because they experimented with thier sound early in the bands life instead of making many albums that sound like Mer de Noms. People should expect by now that Maynards vocal talents progress with each album in each project. Though I was suprised this album was alot lighter than Mer de Noms I liked it the second I poped it in and pressed play. This album also expresses alot of the bands talent and wide range of sound and thats why I have to definately give this 5 stars.
B0000AI44Q|3.0|I have been a Neil Young fan since &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot;, and own a whole lot of his albums.  I like all his styles, and I believe he is one of the greatest recording artists.<br />Musically speaking, I think &quot;Greendale&quot; would have been better as an EP, of if some of the songs weren't as long or as musically predictable.  The first four cuts are wonderful, and I like the last one, &quot;Be The Rain&quot; quite a bit.  Those five songs are more interesting for me, as they are more than just two-chord numbers.  The longer cuts (up to 12 minutes) on this CD seem interminable due to their two-chord structures... extremely repetitious.  The lyrics are fine, but I lose interest after a few minutes due to the repetitive nature of the music. I keep waiting for a chorus, and one never happens.<br />Lyrically, I think Neil is in good form.  The lyrics are full of his usual clever twists and turns, and I believe his gift for writing profoundly touching verse is still there.  While I find the concept of &quot;Greendale&quot; a bit meandering and unfocused, I feel that Neil did a decent job of compacting his conceptual sprawl into a single CD.<br />I give the lyrics 4 stars, the music 2 stars, and the overall concept 3 stars...  <br />Now, as for the enclosed DVD...  I would give that at least 4.  Hearing Neil talk about the town of Greendale in between songs helps flesh out his concept, and the whole thing seems to make more sense in this context.  I won't listen to the CD very often, but I know I'll return to the DVD.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I haven't heard anything that has gotten into my mind, my heart and my psyche like this in ages. I think I'm dreaming with Damien Rice as the soundtrack! If you like Luka Bloom, or Peter Murphy, or Dylan, or Bruce Cockburn, you're going to love Damien Rice. But that's not to say he's derivative...he's his own man, and the unique addition of the cello and Lisa Hannigan's ethereal accompanying vocals make the entire CD even greater than the sum of its parts. I cannot recommend this CD highly enough, it's absolutely priceless...
B0000C8AUO|3.0|I have to admit, the first time I listened to this album I didn't like it all but after a few spins it's grown on me, though there really are no standout songs. Lightweight pop Bowie with a superficial nod to early works.
0385504209|4.0|An excellent read, but it's truly SAD to think that some readers assume that Dan Brown's contrived history is factual and would even base their spiritual beliefs on a book of fiction.  Just read some of the other reviews to see what I'm talking about. It reminds of the guy who watched too many episodes of Highlander and decided he was an immortal! (I'm not making this up.)<br />One reader compared Da Vinci Code to James BeauSeigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy and suggested that like BeauSeigneur, Brown should footnote all the factual material.  While BeauSeigneur and Brown have a similar style and both deal with controversial religious topics, BeauSeigneur can footnote the  facts in his fiction BECAUSE THEY ARE FACTS.  Brown's &quot;facts&quot; cannot be footnoted because they are a fictitious as the rest of the book.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|I've long been a fan of Rufus' dad, the oft-brilliant Loudon Wainwright III, but took a pass on Rufus' first two releases. This was for no good reason other than that I knew Van Dyke Parks was heavily involved with them. Parks, he of the silly bowtie and impenetrably ponderous lyrics, has been a bright star in the galaxy of overrated musicians for--wow--near forty years now. Only Bernie Taupin rivals Parks for sheer senselessness when it comes to lyrics, and while his arrangements can at times be genuinely affecting, his overall persona is just too impossibly twee for me to take seriously. It wasn't until I accidentally heard \\"The Consort,\\" from Rufus' second album Poses, that I began to realize the error of my ways. More accidental exposure, this time to Want One's first single, \\"Beautiful Child,\\" cemented my need to experience the music of the younger Mr. Wainwright--Van Dyke Parks be damned!<br />Happily, Parks is in no way involved with the new album, so my hateful bias against him can be allowed to continue. Because if he had had something to do with Want One, I'd really be forced to reevaluate. It's that good. Baroque pop in the best sense of the word, with ornate, multilayered arrangements that must either be the product of budding genius or heavy hallucogenic drug use. Or both. Whatever--there isn't a truly weak track on this album. It opens with as good a one-two punch as any I've heard recently, \\"Oh What A World\\" (which contains the brilliant line 'Men reading fashion magazines...straight men/Oh what a world we live in') and \\"I Don't Know What It Is,\\" and never really lets up from there.<br />Rufus' clear tenor, though it can be a bit affected at times, is a truly singular instrument. He twists and bends it like taffy, stretching it over, around, and in between Want One's brilliant arrangements. By the time you get to the grand swagger of \\"14th Street,\\" with its dozens of voices singing \\"Why'd you have to break all my heart/Couldn't you have saved a littlebit of it,\\" you either realize you're hearing the sound of an artist truly coming into his own, or you've got used cotton swabs for a soul.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I just got back from seeing the movie for the third time. I just bought the soundtrack specifically for the one song  that is played when Uma chops Sophie's arm off, and then she has that amazing eye contact with Lucy Liu.  It is NOT on the soundtrack and it is driving me crazy. Quentin did the same thing with Pulp Fiction -- he didn't include &quot;Rumble&quot; by Link Wray, which is played when Uma walks to the ladies room when she and John Travolta are in the restaurant.  Please, if someone knows the exact name and artist of the song I am talking about, please include it here so I can go buy it.  Oh, the soundtrack is pretty good and it *does* include the Ironside theme...
B00008CLOA|4.0|This is my favorite album by Pink Floyd and I wasn't disappointed when I bought it on CD!
B000067FP7|4.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD Special Features)<br />Those extras:<br />Commentary:  Not a bad job as Galligan, Cates, director Dante, and Mandel reminisce about the days on set.  Unfortunately Dick Miller was asked to participate as well, but pretty much only backs up everyone else's comments: \\"Isn't that right, Dick?\\", \\"Yes, that's right\\".  Galligan annoys a little with his endless \\"Remember that, Pheebs?\\", a total schoolboy crush in his voice.  But they didn't blow it, it's fun.  There's another track with Dante, Producer Finnell and FX man Walas, though not as fun as it's bogged down in technical aspects.<br />Behind the Scenes:  An odd 16mm, narration-less piece showing various moments on set in between takes.  Interesting, but could've been so much more.<br />Deleted Scenes:  A nice collection of stuff dropped from the film, some amusing, some you see why they cut it.  But one is a real good resolution to the fate of the Judge Reinhold character.<br />Overall:  A pretty good job, little bare in the behind the scenes and interview area, but enough to satisfy.

0783114893|4.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />(THIS REFERS TO THE UK RELEASE)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  Not bad.  Director Harmon and writer Red sit down for a mostly quiet scene by scene chat.  Far too many lulls annoy, but some decent information is provided on locations and on-set anecdotes.  There are alleged scene specific commentaries which are actually culled audio portions of the disc's documentary dubbed over different moments of the film.  Informative but disappointing, sometimes just boring.  Such as Isham's endless bit about inspiration and instruments he uses.<br />Documentary:  Amazing job.  Seven major principles from the film---Director Harmon, Writer Red, Stars Hauer and Howell, Producer Ed Feldman, Director of Photography John Seale, and Composer Mark Isham---are featured in a 45-minute piece on the making of the film.  Unforunately Hauer and Howell come off as major weirdos, Rutger with his comments about how he &quot;enjoys touching males&quot;, and how the film was a &quot;mindf***&quot;.  Or Howell's stoned surfer personality, with eyes bugged he muses about Hauer: &quot;I would tell Rutger, 'Don't stick that f***in' knife in my eye, man!'&quot;.  But Harmon comes off as a really caring filmmaker, so all told, a real treat for a longtime fan.<br />Short Films:  There are a pair on the disc, one a brilliant look at the short directed by Harmon years earlier that got him the Hitcher job.  The other, a forgettable black and white yawner directed by a Hauer, some sort of biography.  Something tells me he agreed to be interviewed if his little thing was included on the disc.<br />Overall:  A big thank you to Momentum Films for taking the time and care to give us fans gobs of great features to get into.  Unfortunately, you'll have to import this from Europe and have a region free DVD player, as that's the only place featuring all the extras.
B000002LBH|5.0|This album came out the year I graduated college, and while I knew NOTHING about The Smiths at the time, I knew that \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" was almost scarily beautiful.  I didn't know it was a complilation, so imagine how I felt hearing these great songs come tumbling out the speakers one after the other.  Catchy guitar pop sounds, twisted and dark (for the time) lyrics...  the mixture of sweetness and sadness was, and still is, irresistable.
B00005J6UP|4.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to the DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  Good, if perhaps a little too crowded.  You have Donner along with all of the kids, and the presentation is a bit odd as well:  every now and then the film shrinks and the cast appears in a small box as they make their comments.  Fun to see them all grown up, but it's a bit chaotic, with Feldman fancying himself a comedian (at one point calling himself Corey HAIM), and He Quan utters maybe ten words through the whole thing.<br />Deleted Scenes:  A number to choose from, but only for rabid fans looking for ANYTHING new to savor.  Otherwise needless moments that deserved to be axed.<br />Behind the Scenes:  Nice featurette of on-set antics is fun.<br />Music Video:  Cyndi Lw-ah-puh's silly contribution to the film features nothing from the film but wrestlers(??) and other nonsense instead.<br />Overall:  Longtime fans should not go away hungry after the decent amount of work put into this.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|OK, yes, the first time i saw this movie, i thought it couldn't stand anywhere near the first one. However i went with a few different friends and eventually saw this movie three times in the theaters, and have since seen this alot since i bought the dvd. As with The Matrix, The Matrix: Reloaded doesn't make any sense and seems like nothing more than fights and elongated scenes, but if you look deeper into the movie, such as the Architect scene, and REALLY listen to what the Merovingian says, so much more answers as to what the matrix is are revealed, and, as usual, double the questions. This movie connects the dots for many of the questions you asked during the first movie, and also raises some new questions. Yes, The Wachowskis did make the fight scenes more numerous and longer this time around, but can you blame them considering how many people would not stop saying &quot;I know Kung Fu&quot; and raving about the fight scenes in the first one? For all the nay-sayers out there who watch it once and completely crap all over it, watch it again and again and look deeper than what you have been looking, because there is real substance there, and just like the first one, it takes so much more than just one viewing to realize how amazingly well written these movies are.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Like Prince, Erykah Badu is an artist, one concerned more with her craft than her bank account. Sure, there are a couple of commercial tracks here, but Miss B is more into her soulful heritage than she is with making the charts. She excels lyrically and melodically with an album that brings out the best of the past and the present.<br />For those critical of the album's length, they might want to consider that many of the longer releases by other performers make their &quot;extended&quot; playing time with mostly filler. &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; has not an ounce of &quot;fluff&quot;.<br />Badu's devoted fans, of all age groups, will relish this seamless blend of TRUE R &amp; B. And hopefully, her legion will grow to include a wider MAINSTREAM audience.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Yuck! this is the worst CD ever!<BR>Take my advice and don't waste your money on this garbage!<BR>They shouldn't even be classifying this as MUSIC!<BR>She's trying to be a singer? what a joke!

B000002KGT|5.0|Things were in a bit of a tumble in Fleetwood Mac inbetween the recording of their self-titled album with Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.  The McVies had divorced, though they were still in the band, and Buckingham and Nicks were no longer a couple.  The spate of broken relationships can be seen in most of Rumours' songs, which to date has sold over 25 million copies and is one of the Top Five best-sellers of all-time, but there some hopeful songs mixed in as well.  Again, the backbone is Mick Fleetwood's drumming and John McVie's bass, with Buckingham's fiery solos, and Christine McVie's rich, high-octave vocals.<br />&quot;Second Hand News&quot; tries to blunt the left-handed feel of &quot;I'm dumping you, but you can sleep with me on so-and-so a date&quot; with &quot;been down so long/I've been tossed around long enough/couldn't you just let me go down and do my stuff&quot;.  The subject's girl has clearly found soemone else, making the subject, &quot;second hand news.&quot;<br />&quot;Dreams&quot; is one of those songs I don't mind hearing time and time again.  Yeah, I've heard cover versions by Letters To Cleo and the Corrs, but nothing tops the original.  Yes, go if you want to be free, exhorts Stevie, &quot;but listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness/like a heartbeat...drives you mad/in the stillness of remembering what you had/and what you lost.&quot;  Her voice hasn't gotten scratchy like it did in her solo years, but has that husky tone to it.  And whether it's the bass that runs like a pulse through this song or the harmonies sung:  &quot;Thunder only happens when it's raining,&quot; it's magical.<br />The &quot;finally found someone right&quot; is reflected by the lyrical solo guitar and matter-of-fact lyrics and vocals by Lindsey Buckingham:  &quot;You don't know what it means to win&quot; he sings.  No, I don't, and I wish I did.<br />The healing, celebratory &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is my favourite song here, due to the opening synths and keyboards by Christine McVie, combined with the upbeat drums of Mick Fleetwood and the guitar solo inbetween the second and third verses.  Lindsey and Christine take turns with verses.  Best verse:  &quot;Why not think about times to come/and not about the things that you've done/if your life was bad to you/just think what tomorrow will do&quot;.  And that immortal chorus:  &quot;Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow/don't stop, it'll soon be here/It'll be, better than before/Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.&quot;<br />The upbeat &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; cogently puts its simple break-up message with great rhythm and another fiery guitar solo at the end.  Lindsey basically presents a choice:  &quot;If I could/I'd give you my world/open up, everything's waiting for you&quot; or &quot;you can go your own way/you can call it another lonely day.&quot;<br />The piano love ballad &quot;Songbird&quot; is one reason why I love Christine McVie's smooth and warm high-octave voice.  So to the future Ms. Hamlow, I would say, &quot;To you, I'll give the world/to you, I'll never be cold&quot; as the song says.<br />All the band wrote &quot;The Chain&quot; of the opposites poles of love, be it the blowing wind against the sunrise, running in the shadows versus breaking the silence, love versus lies.  The accusatory line, &quot;I can still hear you saying/you would never break the chain&quot;.  The title of this was used for the box set that came out in the 1992.  The part where McVie does his bass solo, which is then eclipsed by Buckingham's fiery solo is a highlight.<br />&quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;, which reached #9, is another wonderful Mcvie tune, and her voice is wonders when she sings &quot;believe&quot; in &quot;I never did believe in miracles/but I've a feeling it's time to try.&quot;<br />The engaging &quot;I Don't Want To Know&quot; sung in unison by Buckingham and Nicks, sporting a nice light guitar that goes a-hand with the bass and drums.<br />The lament &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; is another stark ballad by Christine McVie, where she sas &quot;if there's a fool around, it's got to be me.&quot;  She then poses the searching question, &quot;Why are you right when I'm so wrong/I'm so weak but you're so strong.&quot;<br />Another quiet number of bad love, &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; given an eerie touch with Nicks' quavering vocals.  The harmony choruses with Buckingham and Nicks ask the universal question:  &quot;Did she make you cry/make you break down/shatter your illusions of love/is it over now, do you know how/to pick up the pieces and go home&quot;.  It's after the second repeat of the chorus, that Nicks' voice soars, giving way to Mick Fleetwood's thumping drums, which ends one of rock's best known and best-loved albums.ot;Oh Daddy&quot; is another stark ballad by Christine McVie, where she sas &quot;if there's a fool around, it's got to be me.&quot;  She then poses the searching question, &quot;Why are you right when I'm so wrong/I'm so weak but you're so strong.&quot;<br />Another quiet number of bad love, &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; given an eerie touch with Nicks' quavering vocals.

B000002KON|5.0|September, 1988, my boyfriend picked up this CD at a supermarket and played it for me during a long drive through central Nevada.  After hearing it twice through, I was hoping he would play it a few times more (but I was a little embarrassed that I couldn't get enough of it).  Since then, I've discovered the Kinks' Village Green Preservation Society and a few other albums.  Years later, I still feel compelled to reach for this album (I have the record version too) and simply bask in the wonderfulness of it.
B000002GGU|5.0|I first saw and heard Bryan Adams when he that duet, \\"It's Only Love\\", with Tina Turner on her Private Dancer concert.  Reckless had that song on there so I snagged that up right and proper in 1985, and at the time, that was the hardest rock I was listening to in my musical youth.  Keith Scott was some guitarist, I'll say, which perfectly mirrored Bryan Adams' raspy voice!<br />The stomping drums and hard AC-DC-type chords of \\"One Night Love Affair\\" defines the hard-driving sound prevalent on this album.  The premise of love without commitment is double-edged, as after the night is over, \\"now we're left with nothing.\\"  This song was featured in the party scene in the Real Genius movie.<br />\\"She's Only Happy When She's Dancin'\\" is another discontented look at the unrewarding 9-5 grind I've noticed in certain 80's songs.  Like Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever, \\"when she's dancin'/[it's] just her heart and her soul and her fantasies.\\"  Lou Gramm of Foreigner helps out on background vocals here.<br />\\"Run To You\\" tells the story of a guy torn between two women, one who's loyal and true but with a love that's cold, the other being the one he'll run to.  It's veers between ballad-style rock and intense hard rock, particularly Scott's guitar riffs before Adams sings the chorus to the end.<br />Now, my favourite song here.  \\"Heaven\\" proves Adams can do wonderful ballads, and he does piano here.  The guitars and drums kick in at the chorus.  The second verse is a future I hope for:  \\"Oh, once in your life you find someone/who will turn your around/bring you up when you're feeling down.\\"  This truly deserved its #1 peak position!!  Oh, and never mind DJ Sammie's cheesy oontsa-oontsa version!  The original rocks!<br />The verses of \\"Somebody\\" sounds like a hard rock version of those of \\"We Don't Need Another Hero\\".  \\"I need somebody/Hey what about you?/Everybody needs somebody\\" is trite, corny, but hey, it's true, right?  But it's also fraught with peril:  \\"When you're on the front line/and watching them fall/it doesn't take long to make you realize/it ain't worth fighting for.\\"<br />The nostalgia of the rocking \\"Summer of '69\\" really tugged me.  Basically, it's the story of a guy who started a band with his friends, saw some of them quit, until he himself met a girl.  Things didn't work out, and he wonders why.  \\"Oh when I look back now/That summer seemed to last forever/And if I had the choice/Yeah, I'd always wanna be there/Those were the best days of my life\\", he affirms.  I detect a real tear in his heart there.  If I could go back...<br />\\"Kids Wanna Rock\\" is one of the two most ferocious songs here and he rails against disco and new wave in a song whose intensity rivals punk.  \\"For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut and waste your life away.\\"  Well, yeah, I noticed the weird haircuts, but there wasn't anything wrong with them.  I still love the intensity of this song.<br />And then, the song that introduced me to Bryan, via Ms. Turner, \\"It's Only Love.\\"<br />\\"Long Gone\\" is a humorous take on a bad situation, where in a divorce, all he gets is the clothes on his back.  However, he says, \\"But in a matter of time/she'll back for the rest of me,\\" the reasoning behind that being \\"sooner or later she's gotta realize/that all my feelin's were for real.\\"<br />The last song, \\"Ain't Gonna Cry\\", rivals \\"Kids Wanna Rock\\" in magnitude.  What kind of girl is he singing about?  How about one where he says \\"I needed you like a disease.\\"  Whoa!  He also veers towards a bit of rough when he sings, \\"Next time maybe re-arrange your face.\\"  So for those of you who've rid themselves of unwanted girlfriends, remember this:  \\"I ain't gonna cry over you/You're history--history.\\"  Yeah!  Some wild \\"yee-ha\\"'s echo during the fiery last minute, which ends in some Hendrix-style theatrics.<br />This spawned at least five singles and was the beginning of Bryan Adams' reign of greatness, until he became synonymous with mawkishly sentimentally ballads.I love every song on Reckless and that's an honour I usually don't bestow on albums.  Not a filler track in sight!  So for those of you Gen Y cynics, take good note!  Reckless is a time when he rocked, and rocked HARD!!I love every song on Reckless and that's an honour I usually don't bestow on albums.  Not a filler track in sight!

B000005RTG|4.0|i have only recently discovered deep purple on a compilation CD of my dads, and my first impressin of them is that they are absoloulty fantastic. the first sone i heard was balck night which is matched only by this CD, whose samples i have just heard via a deep purple webpage. it is one of the best albums they have ever made: the endless talents of deep purple never fade or die. if you would like to contact me about this  article feel free.
B0000CDL93|5.0|JFK is a brilliant and indepth story about the day America cried. What this movie does not do is tell you what you already know about 22/11/1963, but rather the evidence New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner, in a wonderful performance) stumbles across and slowly pieces together to create the greatest conspiraacy theory man has ever known, including that of the Lunar landing in 1969 never happening!?!<br />Director Oliver Stone takes what facts are already known about the assassination, as well as informed guesses, and weaves them smootly into the story of the investigation that occurred several years after JFK died. They include the 'magic bullet' theory, Mr X and the military's involvement, and the underworld connections of the CIA.<br />This two-DVD set also includes a very interesting commentary by Stone, where he talks about his interest in Kennedy's murder and the attention to detail in the movie.<BR>The documentaries are interesting to watch once, after you've seen the film, but are useless otherwise as they are complicated and repeat issues addressed in the film.<br />Kevin Costner is wonderful as Jim Garrison, showing how the man cared more about a murder mystery than his family and the lives of his employees.<BR>For those relatively unfamilar with the details of JFK's death, such as myself being an Australian teen, it is easy to understand why people still want answers and why they haven't got them yet.<BR>Also, for fans of legal dramas or with a passion for the law it is very interesting to watch the trial of a businessman connected to an anti-communist, as Garrison continually brings evidence into play.<br />An outstanding film about an unforgettable time in history, put together by the master of historical dramas, Oliver Stone. For people with an interest in JFK's assassination, or modern history, this DVD is a must-have.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The movie is terrible. I'm going to bottomline it for you. The first matrix was good, YES. The first matrix was intresting, action packed and awesome... YES. The second matrix movie, this one, not only uses the exact same ideas from the first one, but also decides to throw in some of the worst and most boring scenes ever.<br />I can't see why people keep saying. \\"Well it looked great, the twins rocked!\\" Yea, the effects are good. But that doesn't make a good movie. You won't automatically love a book based on the cover would you? Thats what people are doing.<br />The movie had virtually no plot presented. It starts with nothing, then tells you about the oracle, then the key maker. After that we learn there is an architect. Why are we going to see the architect? Why are we seeing the oracle again? What is the point and motivation? We don't even get to see Zion do anything except rave.<br />Ok so the reason the movie is bad is a terrible plot, wasted talent, and yes one huge reason that people don't seem to grasp. Useless scenes. I mean, ill name some/<br />-The chinese dude fighting Neo.<br />-The rave, which lasted 18 minutes.<br />-That one progammer and his uninteresting wife giving that chick and piece of cake.<br />-The 15 minute breifing about turning off the power to 2 buildings.<br />-The 15 minute fight between neo and 20 agent smiths. Mind you that he just leaves at the end, which he could of done the whole time.<br />-The scene where we learn about Link from Dozer's sister or whatever.<br />-The architect talk, which lasts about 30 minutes. Keep in mind that his confusing speech doesn't tell you anything except that the wachoski brothers have a really weird idea.<br />Honestly, the worst scene is the architect. He just confuses and acts weird. like 15 men and 7 women start a new zion? Why? Why do u want to destroy zion and remake it? Why do you allow the one to live?<br />The most horrible thing though? The sound. Punches and kicks are so weak. They are more like swipes. The sound guy did a terrible job, because the punches and kicks don't make you go, \\"Whoa THAT WAS AWESOME\\". Instead they sound stupid and weak. Like, add more base and they would of rocked. The first matrix didn't have this problem.<br />All in all? Why do people keep giving this movie 5's? Because it is the sequel to the Matrix. Honestly, the movie is boring, more of the same fights and less of the great story. This is one of the worst sequels ever, sorry wachowski brothers, but your vision isn't that great.<br />Also, the movie only has 3 and a half stars. Mostly because hundreds of people spammed it with 5 stars before it came out. Honestly, there are so many movies around with 4 stars that 3 and a half stars has to tell you something. It tells you that this movie is bad, because so many people dislike it. Don't believe those people who rave about the architect, he was confusing and dumb.re like swipes.

B000062YB1|4.0|Great album, starts with the extreme speed of war ensemble. I think that Tom Araya's vocals are just perfect, and probably are the best in thrash metal. Dave Lombardo's drumming is awesome, check out the title track!.<br />Thrash metal at it's best, a record that settled high standards in its genre.
0156027321|3.0|This was an OK book.  I was suckered into buying it because Amazon thought if I liked Bel Canto, I'd like this book. This was no Bel Canto, by a LONG shot.  I did like parts (the zoo minutiae especially) but found myself skipping over page after page about 2/3 through.  It became a grudge match.  What on earth did all the religious stuff (to which I am not averse)have to do with the rest of the book?
B0000248L1|5.0|I was so into Metallica, Megadeth and Pantera when i first listened to this one. And i was like: &quot;who are these guys, they rock!!&quot; <br />Alice In Hell is a mind blasting experience. A fast, crushing set of killer riffs and solos, great vocals. The speed on this one is amazing, the whole album is great, all tracks are remarkable. Good harmonies. Nice changes. It has it all, a must-have in your collection.
B000002H33|5.0|I'd always heard about Metallica and wondered what the fuss was all about. This stuff was from the 80's and people still talked about it. So I decided to give it a listen.<BR>If you're a teenager that listens to Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park and you feel like if there's something missing, then you better check this out and prepare for some real music. Believe me, after I heard this album, my 'Meteora' cd has been collecting dust. I don't know what to do with it. <br />All the songs are brilliant - so it's hard to pick standout tracks. But the tracks that one may immediately warm up to on a first listen include &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Battery&quot;, and the title track.<br />The new Metallica is also good, but you should check this out first - it's timeless music. I'm still relatively new to metal, so I don't know if this is the perfect place to start for a beginner, but it's where I started and it's been a hell of a ride. Buy this, then Lightning, then Justice. Thank me later.
B000050IE6|5.0|Opeth is a gifted band. They move between styles like no other. In Still Life there's a bit more &quot;clean lyrics&quot; than in it's predecessors. The music is always great, beautiful and evoking passages, follow by explosions of brutality. <br />Like a lot of people, i recommend this album ONLY if you're used to &quot;growling&quot;, otherwise, you'll find yourself hating this masterpiece (and all other Opeth albums) because of that.
B00000I41J|5.0|Just great.  The intro to Autumn Leaves is inspired, the intro for Love For Sale is good, and both standards are delivered better than any other performance I've ever heard.  I find this CD better listening than Kind Of Blue...definitely a worthwhile acquisition, and a good introduction to Cannonball and Miles.  Straight-ahead jazz.
B000002HMH|2.0|The &quot;Black album&quot; was a big step towards &quot;mainstream music&quot;, but it stayed pretty much inside the metal genre. All bands at some point tend to experiment with other styles, and the result of that is almost the same everytime. Metallica's case is a little bit complex. They went through a whole change, and the most impressing was the change of look. The photos in the booklet, tha hair cuts, i have nothing against that. But it shocked everybody. For old metallica fans..with their high-mental-inertia the change was too much, and the sold out was finally completed. <BR>All of the speed is lost, and their solos too.<br />The album has a good song, though:<br />Until It Sleeps.
B000002AS3|5.0|Up until 1994, mainstream music in Britain consisted of manufactured boybands and forgettable dance songs. Oasis changed all that when they released their debut album \\"Definitely, Maybe.\\" The critics grabbed Oasis with both hands and they were soon the most significant and popular British rock band since the Beatles. Definitely Maybe isn't my favourite Oasis album, but it's probably my second.<br /><br />\\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" is easily Oasis' finest hour, but we owe a lot to Definitely Maybe because it's the album that made Liam and Noel the icons they are today! Definitely Maybe soon became one of the fastest selling albums in the UK of all time. Fuelled by critical praise and fantastic songs, they ripped the charts apart. It was just what Britain needed. The 1990's was my favourite decade for a number of reasons. Oasis are definitely one of them - maybe the main reason.<br /><br />\\"Rock 'N' Roll Star\\" opens the album spectacularly. With hard drums and loud guitars, this represents everything that Oasis are about. It's the first song on the first Oasis album, and it's where it all began. Sit back and soak up the nostalgia. \\"Shakermaker\\" was Oasis' second single and charted at No.11 in the UK in July 1994. Guitars and drums roll around the arrangement perfectly here, clapping adds rhythm and Liam's vocals are so zesty and full of life. \\"Live Forever\\" was the best single to be released in 1994, easily. The classic guitar solo, the high vocals, the memorable chorus, the lyrics, the simple yet effective video. It's everything you could ever want from Britain's top band.<br /><br />\\"Up In The Sky\\" maintains the album's upbeat tempo and live-life-to-the-full statement. This was the song to listen to in your car in the summer of 1994, booming it out from the speakers, driving like a loony! Absolutely fantastic! \\"Columbia\\" is a monster rock anthem that begins wonderfully driving its force into the brains of everyone it encounters, forever etching the guitars on their memories. The singing is kept to a minimum, focusing on wonderful brash guitars and \\"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\\" screams towards the end. \\"Supersonic\\" was Oasis' first-ever single in the UK and peaked at No.31 in April 1994. A catchy guitar starts off the song before the song rocks out with \\"I need to be myself! I can be no one else!\\" The lyrics are just awesome and the chorus is just so full of energy and an attitude that represented Britain in the decade.<br /><br />\\"Bring It On Down\\" starts wonderfully like someone running in a race, and soon fires up to became yet another rock anthem. It's not really one of my favourites, however. \\"Cigarettes And Alcohol\\" has some rather poor lyrical content, but if you can get past this and focus on the brilliant guitar riffs then you might see it in a totally different light as one of the best songs on the album. \\"Digsy's Dinner\\" is the most uplifting and happy song on the album. It uses Beatlesque styles in both its lyrics and the melodies. It's a good song, plain and simple. It's not hard rock by any means. \\"Slide Away\\" runs for almost six and a half minutes and is pure Gallagher excellence. The lyrics are good, and they have a certain catchiness to them that makes this a particular standout. The album closes with the fantastic \\"Married With Children.\\" It's a wonderful acoustic song with some rather comical lyrics. The acoustic style of the song makes it totally different to everything else on the album, and separates it from the razor-sharp edge of the other ten tracks.<br /><br />I heard some people moaning about how the songs from this album did rather poorly in the UK charts, but you only have to look at how many times they re-entered the charts over the course of almost three years: Supersonic peaked at No.31 in the UK, re-entered the charts 5 times and spent a total of 14 weeks on the chart. Shakermaker peaked at No.11 in the UK, re-entered the charts 5 times and spent a total of 15 weeks on the chart. Live Forever peaked at No.10 in the UK, re-entered the charts 6 times and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart. Cigarettes And Alcohol peaked at No.7 in the UK, re-entered the charts 9 times and spent a total of 35 weeks on the chart.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Definitely Maybe is an album for anyone's collection, whether you are simply looking for great music or a fantastic rock band. At the time, this was the fastest selling debut album in the UK ever. This record was soon broken by Oasis' \\"Be Here Now\\" in 1997 which sold a staggering 700,000 copies in its first week of release - incredible if you remember that the UK has five times less than America in population terms! Could you really imagine an album selling 3.5 million in seven days in the States?! I know I couldn't! Of course, Be Here Now, sold so many copies as it was the follow-up to the second biggest selling album in the UK ever, \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" with sales of almost 4 million in Britain since 1995.

B000002WCJ|5.0|I Began listening to Helloween back in 1995. I Bought Keeper 1 and loved it so much. Then a friend of mine said, &quot;well, there's part two&quot;...no kidding??!!, i thought it was just a name!!...<BR>Great, that's what i thought when i heard this one. just great. Eagle Fly Free it's beautiful and powerfull, the best song on the album.<br />But there's this one little thing... Rise and Fall...what was that??..
B000001FS3|5.0|This is a truly beautiful album. Except for the song &quot;Exit&quot; every song is just brilliant. And when you watch these songs performed live on the Rattle and Hum album you appreaciate them even more. This album changed my life....
B00002Z88D|4.0|Some of Metallica's songs suit very well in an orchestral arrangement: Nothing Else Matters (obviously), The Unforgiven, and most instrumental ones. I really missed Orion and To Live is To Die. But some songs just get a cacophonic sound, battery and One!!, come on!! you can't make a symphonic version of those...<BR>Anyways, most of the selected songs were pretty much ok with this new sound.
0571202284|5.0|I've only read through about 50 pages of this book so far, but... omigod what an awesome book!  Definitely should be on the shelf of anyone serious about character animation, whether you are doing 3D digital animation or traditional hand-drawn animation.  Williams goes into incredible detail on motion, 'tweening, timing, and also has some great anecdotes from working with some of the legendary animators from Disney and Warner Brothers.
B000002LRX|4.0|Angel Dust is a hell of an album, it explores many styles. I think that Mike Patton put on this one some of the Mr. Bungle crazyness and schizophrenia. The ONLY thing is that you can't be a Patton-band newbie in order to enjoy the whole cd. If so, you will find this record way too bizarre and ...mm...messy.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|I don't understand how being a musician can make one appreciate this lousy disc any better. Being a musician myself, I gravitate more towards Maiden's vintage 80s music for inspiration than this tepid set of rehashed, mediocre riffs and boring lyrics. HOW CAN ANYONE LISTEN TO POWERSLAVE AND THEN CONSIDER THIS THE SAME BAND?!?!?!?!I think I realize what is going on here: the people that got into Maiden in the 90's are the ones who enjoy this tripe, whilst the older fans, who were there when they truly were gods, can easily see this as the cheese it is. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND LISTEN TO POWERSLAVE, THEN TELL ME THIS IS NOT GARBAGE! It's night and day, folks. No comparison.<BR>Please do not pay attention to those who say this is actually listenable. They are merely tone deaf and would buy anything with the Iron Maiden name on it, regardless of the quality.<BR>\\"Wildest Dreams\\" is the weakest opening track of any of their albums; the title track is one of Steve's most ridiculous lyrical concepts (so he was just hanging out in the Everglades one day, huh?) and is more funny than scary; and Paschendale--apparently the most highly regarded song on here--is just another history lesson the band forces us to sit through. If I wanted to take a history class I'd go back to school! The last thing I want from an escapist artform is to be bludgeoned with the miseries of people I don't care about. Personally I'm getting tired of Maiden's neverending war stories and contrived pseudo-philosophy. They are the ultimate one-trick pony, one-song band, and with this album show that they have run out of ideas since four songs begin almost identically.<BR>DOWN THE IRONS!! PLEASE!!! DOWN THE JANICK!
B00000JG41|5.0|Mr.Bungle evolution took them into a more mature production. way more mature. Great melodies. The song structures, oh-my-god...i mean where are all of these music ideas coming from??. Constructing songs like these isn't a task for just a regular musician. These album is all what you could expect in the evolution of a wacked out band like MrBungle. Melodic songs, great changes, experimentation, many styles covered, awesome, AWESOME vocals, Mr. Patton's work is outstanding!!. It's a perfect album. Best of the best: Sweet Charity, None Of them..., Pink Cigarrette, Vanity Fair, and of course, the greatest GOODBYE SOBER DAY...sshack!...sshack!sshacka!sshacka!sshacka!sshacka!...etc...
B00000099Y|5.0|I am really confused... Was it that everybody who doesn't like Tool thinks that we who do like them because they are &quot;geniuses&quot; and &quot;ground-breakingly intelligent&quot;. I personally like the music because it is GOOD music. Not because I think tool may be ground-breaking or if I think they are geniuses. Because my opinion in that aspect is meaningless. It amazes me to see all these people bash this CD because it is not &quot;true-metal&quot; or it is not as &quot;Original&quot; as everyone says it is. People, people, people.... GROW UP! Learn to look at a band or music as a band or as music, not as a genre or in comparison to anything else, even the bands own material. Now shut up, stop bashing Tool, and try listening to Tool as a new band that no one ever heard of not the &quot;Emmensly Overrated Angst-Ridden Cult Classic&quot; that you all seem to look at them as. God dammit people...
B000002W9P|5.0|Keeper Of The Seven Keys it's an awesome album. Even if you compare it to some &quot;90's or 2000's&quot; albums of the genre. The beautiful melodies, the double-bass drumming, the guitar harmonies and the great volcals settled the standards to a whole sub-genre in heavy metal. Outstanding. <BR>On top of it, you have a 13 minute song with rythm changes, evoking arrangements and remarkable guitars.<br />I Still think that Kiske's vocals are in number 2 of the all time heavy metal best vocalist. (1st: Dickinson, 2nd: Kiske, 3rd: Halford).<br />Go Buy this classic of classics.
B00009ATKS|5.0|&quot;Happy Music For Happy People&quot; is perhaps a new dawn for Mogwai. Having almost completely abandoned their once trade mark slow creep to raging cacophany style, Mogwai opt for a 'wall of sound' steam-roller of guitars, drums and various other 'noise' producing instruments. First seeping into the listeners mind, then enveloping them in an almost narcotic haze, &quot;Happy Music For Happy People&quot; seeks to be the most seductive 'downer' album of all time.<br />The 'emotion' of this album is similar to that of Radiohead's masterpiece of inertiatic melancholy &quot;Ok Computer&quot;. As the opening track &quot;Hunted By A Freak&quot; suggests there is a hint of paranoia in Mogwai's tunes these days. Infact it is best to think of &quot;Happy Music For Happy People&quot; as an entity or person with whom you are experiencing the world around. The early paranoia gives way to an insignificance as the album progresses, and if you close your eyes you can almost envision yourself walking through the streets of a town, the noise of life muted by sheets of rain, and the colours dimmed in a pervading mist of grey. Your destination is of no importance, rather the journey is thought provoking, no epiphanys, but an overwhelming sense of awareness of life. The music is awash in guitars that drizzle, snippets of vocals the flow like water down a drain, and they steady background plod of drums. <br />You are not going to play &quot;Happy Music For Happy People&quot; at a party, or as something to get the blood pumping too, well not unless you wish to sonically wither all listeners into a near catatonic state. This is music for headphones, an album to submerge yourself in when you are in an introspective mood wishing to be left in solitude. This a cohesive journey, a slice of emotional reflection that flows from song to song. <br />I will not say you are going to pick up this (or any Mogwai) album and be enthralled with what you hear. People who like songs that are well defined and get straight the point will find Mogwai boring. Though if your willing to simply listen and not care about the destination (or even moving at all) you might just find an album you will hold dear for many years to come.
B00005JLTN|2.0|Ok, we have to all agree that The Matrix was one of the coolest movies we've seen but the sequel isn't as good. Looking at the trailers, we thought it might be very good but instead it wasn't. I noticed that there is too much dialogue, worth of trash. Just too much dialogue, too long dialogue, too boring dialogue, there's more dialogue then action sequences and it's boring. Reloaded isn't as good as it looks. But if your a die hard Matrix fan, you should get it, it has hours of bonus features. Watch for Revolutions which looks pretty good.
B00003CXI0|5.0|My family and I were so engrossed in this movie.  My kids never sit still during movies.  This is a movie that you have to own.
B00003CXXS|1.0|I think it's self-explanitory. But for you idiots, this movie sucked
B000000W5P|4.0|Pretty solid album from the Stones, not one of their best, but the title track is one of my favorites.  Speaking of which, if anyone wants a great laugh, scroll down to &quot;cranky <BR>reviewer&quot;'s comments from 10/10.  Ohh man did I almost pee my pants when I read that.  Mick says something about practically every different type of person, but this reviewer gets offended by the one thing said about black people, makes no mention of anything else said, and then offers the advice to listen to Justin Timberlake.  LOLOLOLOLOL!
B00000DGUG|3.0|Alanis Morissette followed up her debut with this long, complex album. Rather than cut it down to a normal length, she filled the disc. Although there aren't any really bad songs here, the best ones (So Pure, The Couch, Joining You, and Baba) make the rest feel weak. If she had cut this album down to 45 minutes, she would have had a follow-up that was more focused (musically) and more diverse (lyrically) than her debut.<br />I still listen to this album a lot. It's underrated. The fact that it sold fewer units than Jagged Little Pill is supposed to reflect a drop in quality, but that's not the case. JLP was kind of a fluke, a great album that was released at just the right time. This CD is just as good, but it doesn't have the timing that made the debut such a big deal.
0380789019|5.0|I read this book years ago but i can distinctly remember how good it really was. Ive read too many books but when I remember this book i still remember the feeling that goes along with it- the true mark of a great book. If nothing else you will be left in awe of Gaimen's talent. It was just so so good.
B0000AYL17|5.0|A good Album.  This album has all the elements that make up a good Steely Dan Album.  The lyrics are witty and the music is blues, jazz and rock mix.  The rifts are beautiful.  It is way past worth listening to.  This album is a new terrain explored.  It encompasses  a sharp perspective and a wry look at fast lane living. I rate it a 4 star album.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|This movie tries to recreate the world of H.G. Well's Time Machine.  Guy Pierce starts as the time traveling hero.  In the beginning of the movie, he loses his fiance in a tragic mugging, so he tries to use his time machine to bring her back.  Unfortunately, he experiences some difficulties and he is tossed into the distant future.  There he encounters a peaceful and gentle people.  It seemed as if he had found paradise.  However, this world has a terrible secret.<br />The bad point of this movie is that the Morlocks are a bit disappointing.  They just look a little stupid, like blue monkey puppets, and they don't inspire any fear.  They need to be a bit more dreadful.  Also the leader of the Morlocks was far too easy to defeat and it was way too easy for the hero to enter the Morlock lair.  Also Guy Pierce doesn't come across very well in this movie.  The role calls for someone driven by deep emotion, but the expression on his face barely changes at all during the whole movie.  Overall, this movie is mediocre.
B00003CWOL|3.0|Bartleby and Loki, two angels banished to Wisconsin for the rest of eternity, have found a loophole in God's Law and are on their way to take advantage of a planetary indulgence  at the centennial celebration of a small Catholic church in New Jersey.  Since proving God to be fallible would make everything cease to exist and with God MIA, an unlikely team of mortals and heavenly hosts come together to try to stop them.<br />Overall, this is a fun movie.  It is not a movie for those easily offended, however.  To be honest, we rarely watch our DVD version but catch it on TV whenever it comes on.  I wish there were an \\"edited for TV\\" version on DVD. The foul language really does not add to the movie in the least and, for me, gets in the way of enjoying it.  Jason Mewes' sex obsessed character is funny but the edited version gets the same gist across without having to wade through the language.  I would give the edited version 4 stars because it really is an enjoyable movie.  However, I put 3 here because of the language and the fact that I can't put three and a half stars.<br />As far as religion goes, I don't think that this was intended as a theosophical treatise.  It is a comedy and there are a lot of religious zingers.  Chris Rock, as the thirteenth apostle, claims not only that he was left out of the bible because he is black but that Jesus was black as well.  Salma Hayek, who plays a prodigal Muse (Greco-Roman mythology) insists that god is a woman. George Carlin plays Cardinal Ignatious Glick has a whole new program to get \\"butts in the pews\\" including a very funny Buddy Jesus. Alan Rickman as Metatron (the Voice) gets peeved about people who's religious knowledge comes from Charlton Heston films.  Altogether, lots of laughter but really a superficial dealing with real religious questions. If you get offended on religious grounds, you are taking it WAY too seriously.
B000002MFN|3.0|\\"Erotica\\" isn't a bad pop CD, but I don't think it's Madonna's best. Musically, the album has kind of an early trip-hop sound that's sexy and edgy, but what the album seems to be missing is an emotional core. Despite her tough persona, Madonna's music has always had a warmth and sensitivity to it that seems to be lacking on this CD. Even \\"Rain\\", the album's one real romantic ballad, seems a little forced and cold. The album also overuses the kind of spoken word vocals that sounded good on \\"Justify My Love\\", but become boring after being used on almost every song on this CD. There are several good tracks: \\"Erotica\\" is creepily sexy, \\"Bye Bye Baby\\" is a fun dance track, \\"Waiting\\" aches of need and desire and \\"Thief of Hearts\\" is a nasty dis of a scheming girlfriend. But if you want to hear Madonna at her best, combining cutting edge dance music with sincere vocals, check out \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"American Life\\".

B00005NTN5|5.0|Before the Wachowski brothers became cultural icons with their \\"Matrix\\" films, they directed this stylish film noir about two girls who fall in love and try to steal two million dollars from the Mob. Visually, the film is full of all sorts of cool camera tricks and visuals, which hint at the incredible affects they would later utilize in the Matrix trilogy. It should also be noted that the intruiging and effective mob plotline came before HBO's groundbreaking \\"Sopranos\\" series. So this movie was ahead of its time in many ways. But the best thing about this film has to be the chemistry between Corky (Gina Gershon), a tomboyish ex-con, and Violet (Jennifer Tilly), a mobster's closeted girlfriend. They generate more romantic and sexual heat than the vast majority of heterosexual Hollywood matches.
B0000029DD|3.0|Upon first listen to this album, I agreed with the overwhelmingly popular sentiment that Jeff Buckley was a voice for the ages, and Grace an album for the decade. After spending several years with Grace, I still hail the voice but no longer the album. While Buckley's falsetto leaves a lasting impression on the ears and perhaps the heart, further listens to the actual music and lyrics on Grace leave less of an impression. Apart from one catchy single (Last Goodbye) and 2 outstanding covers (Lilac Wine, Hallelujiah), Grace is left with several subpar fairly trite alt rock songs. <BR>It took years for me to realize it, but Grace simply isnt as great as the voice behind it.
0783117523|4.0|\\"Gia\\" is a decent film that is elevated due to the extraordinary performance of Angelina Jolie as the title character. Jolie won a Golden Globe for her brilliant portrayal of a young woman who was intensely sexual, deeply vulnerable, vivacious, and self-destructive. The film covers Gia's life as she goes from being a punky kid to the world's first supermodel. Along the way she has plenty of access to drugs and easy sex, but few opportunities for real love and support. Tragically, she contracted AIDS from her IV drug use and died before she was able to create a meaningful life for herself. The film is a little exploitive when it comes to portraying Gia's lesbian relationship, but Jolie's performance elevates the film above pure titillation.

B00005AQF7|5.0|The Best Snoop Album one of the greatest albums ever feat gin and jucie,what's my name and others a classic.
B000089RVR|4.0|When I first bought this album, I must admit I was extremely dissapointed. Maybe I shouldn't have bought Siobhan Donaghy's 'Revolution In Me' CD the same day because that album is an under rated gem and easily one of 2003's best and unfortunately when placed next to Siobhan's album 'Revolution...', 'Life For Rent' sounds pretty poor in comparison.<br />That aside though, with further listens you begin to see the true beauty of 'Life For Rent', 11 well crafted breezy, mellow songs.<br />'White Flag' might give off the impression that this album might be a clump of 'No Angel' out takes but really it's not.<br />The title track is a warm, wonderful atmospheric gem which should definately be the next single.<br />Other favourites on this album are the relaxed 'Don't Leave Home', 'Mary's In India' and the more upbeat, summery tune 'Sand In My Shoes'.<br />For myself the song that stands out the most is easily 'See You When You're 40', I'm not over exaggerating when I say this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />It's not a classic, but it is still a worthwile purchase. Make sure to pick up that Siobhan Donaghy album aswell.
B0000039QA|5.0|It seemed that with the release of his debut masterpiece 'Ready to Die', Biggie was instantly crowned the King of the East Coast. It was a title that he was undoubtedly deserving of, so when it came time to succeed his instant classic, Biggie and executive producer Puff Daddy decided to release the epic 24-track 'Life After Death', figuring that if they couldn't surpass the near-perfect quality of 'Ready to Die', they would at least surpass it in terms of quantity. It seems to me after listening several times to this staggering epic, that even if this had been Biggie's first album, he would have still gained mass success and even if it's release hadn't been marred by his tragic and senseless murder earlier that March, hip-hop fans would have still laid down the money to purchase this daunting double-CD set. His explosive lyrical talent, sharp wit and larger-than-life personality, is the showcase of this truly great album. He is never short on rhymes and never stumbling, as he moves swiftly from one motif to another, forever retaining his sense of gangsta suave. It is this uncanny marriage of urbane sophistication and ruthless aggression that makes Biggie so engaging - he finds a perfect balance between his money-making playa persona and the raw reality of the big kid from Brooklyn hustling on the corner. While his debut album's lyrical content was eerily prophetic, the content here is disturbingly and heart-breakingly prophetic. Many of the songs revel in death, such as 'Somebody's Gotta Die', 'Niggaz Bleed', and 'You're Nobody (Till Somebody Kills You)', and it seems as if Biggie saw the end coming. If you've seen any of the final interviews with him, especially the ones done after 2Pac's death, he seems consumed by fear and paranoia, and listening to this album it's very obvious. But the most truly saddening aspect of the album comes not from the harsh and dark imagery foreshadowing his untimely demise, but in the more positive and inspirational pieces like 'Sky'sthe Limit' and 'Miss U'. They are a testament to his good-hearted nature and his hope for the future, and make his death feel all the more tragic. But it will still bring a smile to your face hearing him bounce postively on uptempo tracks like the G-Funk flavor of 'Going Back to Cali' and perrenial anthems like 'Hypnotize' and 'Mo Money Mo Problems'. While the entire album does contain occasional clunkers, courtesy of some mediocre production, Biggie's booming voice commands your attention and respect, and makes the daunting listen pay off in the end. It's true what many have said. We lost the two most talented rappers in the game when we lost Biggie and Pac. And the overall state of hip-hop as well as mainstream music in general has been going down the drain ever since. That is not to say that there are NO rappers who are keeping it real or releasing quality music anymore. It's just that the ones that are staying real aren't getting the attention and respect they deserve from the Top 40 and these so called hip-hop station DJ's
B00005JLTN|1.0|Total disapointment at its worst. Too many fight scenes and not enough intellegent script. The fight scene between neo and the agents became so boring; that I went out for a cup-a.

B00009P1O0|5.0|1.Walk on- 9.5/10<BR>2.See the Sky about to Rain 9/10<BR>3.Revolution Blues 9/10<BR>4.For the Turnstiles 9.5/10<BR>5 Vampire Blues 8/10<BR>6.On the Beach 8.5/10<BR>7.Motion Pictures 8.5/10<BR>8.Ambulance Blues 10/10    <br />Being a huge Neil Young fan, I was very excited when On the Beach finally came out on CD, along with American Stars n' Bars, Reactor, and Hawks & Doves.  On the Beach is a very short album but nevertheless a classic.  This is his flawless classic after Harvest and After the Gold Rush.  The album starts off with the rockin upbeat, Walk On, a rock and roll gem.  Next we have see the sky about to rain, I enjoy this song a lot since I am more of a Neil Young folk fan than his raunchy stuff he does with Crazy Horse.  Revolution Blues has a very good beat to it and would consider it a classic.  For the Turnstiles is a very cool song, I first heard this song when I got Decade and I thought the adding of the Banjo was excellent, it is one of those different types of songs that get better with each listen.  Vampire Blues is Neil's poorest effort on this cd, it has a blues flavour to it and is still good but doesn't compare to the rest of the album.  On the Beach, the title track is a powerful song with a good edge, I enjoy this song and would reccomend listening to it.  Motion pictures, a great folk tune, relaxing to listen to.  Ambulance Blues!!! What a way to finish!  The money for this album is worth it just for this song.  I have been a Neil Young fan for a long time and would put this one way up there on my list of his favorite songs with Old Man, After the Gold Rush and Like A Hurricane.  If you have never heard Neil Young you will like him after hearing this song.  Overall On the Beach is an excellent album to buy for the beginner Neil Young Fan, and his Die Hard Fans.  i highly Reccomend it.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Simply put, I've always enjoyed the Jayhawks, especially Hollwood Town Hall. This is one of their better albums. I'm no expert on music, but it seems like they've returned to their earlier days, and in a very crafted way. Good job Jayhawks!
B000068UXF|2.0|Studer is great as long as she stands still and just sings.  Her &quot;acting&quot; is humorous if nothing else.  Lipovsek is painful to watch with those stupid facial expressions.  Marton's voice is nearly intolerable and she looks perpetually annoyed while waddling around the stage like a penguin.  Richard Hale is very good.  Ditto Terfel.<br />The videography is pointless.  The sets are...well what sets are there in this opera beside the house?  The casting of the extras must have been courtesy of the United Nations. The camera is fixated on Solti...no evidence the orchestra even exists.  Sound is good.<br />Typical uneven opera by R. Strauss.  But made much worse by this overrated production.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I'm so sorry to strongly disagree with the bad reviews here.  C'mon people, this a science fiction movie, WHAT did you expect?  Realism? Go get a Discovery Channel DVD then!!  If you ever saw the first episode of The Matrix, you may remember that the movie is about an UNREAL WORLD, where every single natural rule can be broken by the &quot;ONE&quot; (that's Neo).  This is a GREAT science fiction movie, for those who didn't like it, well, they obviously didn't like Superman, Batman, Star Wars and Spiderman either, right? So, you people ARE NOT into Science Fiction.  I don't like romantic movies, so I keep myself away of those kind, and you can imagine that obviously, my review about a romantic movie will always be useless.
B00002Z88D|5.0|'S&amp;M' is the best Metallica album of the ninties.It combines (mostly) the best of their extensive back catalogue,(although missing off 'The Unforgiven' was a horrific mistake)with Michael Kamen's San Francisco symphony beauty and power.Kamen had previously arranged the orchestration on 'The Unforgiven' from 1991's 'Metallica'.The only major Metallica album not represented here is 'Kill'em All', their 1983 debut,which seems a shame ,but if you listen to it you'll see it's way too frantic.<br />The best songs here are not necessarily the best Metallica songs.Indeed, 'Nothing Else Matters',usually a torrid ballad, positively sparkles when backed by the orchestra.Also 'The Call of the Ktulu','One','The Outlaw Torn','Bleeding Me','For Whom the Bell Tolls','Of Wolf and Man' and the ever brilliant 'Battery',in which the spainish guitars in the inro are swapped for the orchestra's string section,which adds a whole new depth once the main riff comes in.Also of note is the intro cover of 'The Ecstasy of Gold' from the 'Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' soundtrack,where the orchestra is used to full classical potential,and so are the 2 new tracks,'Minus Human' and 'No Leaf Clover'.The former is a slow chugging power song, but the latter's twinkly guitars and distorted verse paving way for an acoustic chorus is rather superb.<br />Everything has it's downside though,and on 'S&amp;M' it's a couple of songs that are completely ruined by the orchestra.'Sad But True drags even more than it's Black Album counterpart,'Fuel' sounds as average and uninspired as ever,if not more so,and the biggest crime is the brutal mutilation of the once-brilliant'Master of Puppets',the only track which is rendered completley unlistenable.Hetfield's singing is all over the place,Newstead can never make the bass rumble as much as Cliff Burton did,and the orchestra slops all over it.<br />That said,that is about all that is bad about 'S&amp;M'.It's a qurky, but very listenable album with,although too much off 'Load' and ReLoad' for a greatest hits album for my liking,it srtill has tons too offer the listener.
B0000DD79B|5.0|When I heard the news about Simon &amp; Garfunkel reuniting, I was just so overzealous and completely excited for the two of them. Largely, because the generation I grew up in, never gave any sanctions to the two of them reuniting and performing together. Still, they thought of Paul Simon solo, largely because of records like Graceland and Still Crazy After All These Years. Nevertheless, the duo reunited for some gigs, but not really as a full-forceful duo again. But, no that they are truly touring again, it is an absolute celebration of the duos unbelieveable legacy.<br />The Essential Simon &amp; Garfunkel, is a double-album consisting of 32 tracks from their most legendary career, with songs that have been truly considered as American classics today. The music is still as unbelieveable and wonderful as it was still the 1960's all over again. There are just so many good songs here to this milestone, it is like watching on thin air. From classics like Bridge Over Troubled Water and Mrs. Robinson, to timeless songs from protest and problems that have undergone throughout our lives, like The Boxer and The Sound Of Silence. Still, there are just a few additonal songs that haven't appeared on many Simon &amp; Garfunkel Greatest Hits records including Bleecker Street, The Dangling Conversation, and Song For The Asking. This is truly the first affordable Greatest Hits package to come out of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's musical journey, since 1999.<br />Out of all the new acts to really come out, and the Britney Spears wannabes to try to really make it out in the open, none of them can stand that test of enjoyment and time like Simon &amp; Garfunkel. If you have any of the previous Greatest Hits records by the duo, keep them, and add this to the pot as well. It is just a wonderful delight for a duo that has done the unthinkable today, to see Paul Simon &amp; Art Garfunkel, reunite once more.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has created a masterpiece with this album.  Combining masterful piano ballads with driving guitars and intelligent lyrics with vibrant melodies, Coldplay had gone the extra mile to make sure that this album is all that it could be.<br />A few highlights on the album are &quot;Politik&quot;, which is a wonderful opening to wet your appetite for the rest of the album.  The next song, &quot;In My Place&quot;, is probably the best song on the entire album.  It includes simple guitar riffs and lyrics that paint a wonderful picture.<br />The album continues with &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;, one of the few songs that has a driving guitar as the lead instrument.  Next comes the song that has won Coldplay quite a few awards, &quot;The Scientist&quot;.  This is a touching love ballad with a finale that includes a driving guitar and melodic groans that sound as if it came from the heart.<br />&quot;Clocks&quot;, probably the song with the most radio-play from this album, starts with a piano riff and continues with cryptic lyrics that requires a second listening to catch all of the thoughts being expressed.  The final song that I will mention is &quot;Daylight&quot;, which has a great lead guitar in it, creating the main riff that the other instruments mold around perfectly.<br />To put it simply, this album is one of the few albums that I can listen to from beginning to end without having to skip any track.  It's refreshing to see a band that uses it's classic rock roots to it's advantage by creating a sound reminiscent of Pink Floyd and The Beatles (ballads).  It's also nice to see a new band that writes lyrics that MEAN something.<br />In conclusion, if you want a CD that has meaning and sounds that show effort by the band, then this is for you.  If you like mellow music, then this is for you.  However, if you don't think it's music unless the group can do synchronized dancing or rap, then this is not for you.
6305972591|2.0|I admit when I was six years old, this movie was a little creepy and made me think twice before passing a cornfield. Now, I look at it and wonder how I even made it past the second scene without falling asleep. The only tense scene in this movie is when Joseph is running through the cornfield. Other then that, it's a movie to watch when you're bored and having nothing better to do. It's not scary, and Isaac's ranting and raving can get on your nerves after awhile. If you want good horror, then read the short story by Stephen King.

B000065V1V|5.0|This CD proves David Bowie is still a great artist. There are no bad songs, and four are some of the best he has ever done.<BR>&quot;Cactus&quot; is a creepy song, which was not written by Bowie. The lyrics are rather strange and the acoustic guitar adds to the erriness. &quot;Slip Away&quot; is in my opinion the most beautiful song Bowie has ever done. His singing, which has never sounded better, accompanied by the piano is quite fantastic. Next comes &quot;Slow Burn&quot; the best rocker on the album. David's lyrics are very cool. The guitar solos are also a highlight. The track &quot;Everyone Says 'Hi&quot; is a very simple song, yet one of the most gorgeous song ever. It's hard to say what makes it so. Wheather it's the pleasent lyrics, the acoustic guitar, or everthing combined. It doesn't matter, it's just a terrific song. As stated earlier there are no disappointments.&quot;I Took a Trip on a Gemini Spaceship&quot; is a little repetitive, but hardly a bad song. Overall it is one of the best David Bowie albums of all time!
B000003N7G|1.0|Coltrane's A Love Supreme is the most overhyped jazz album in history. It is music?  Maybe.  But I find it to be unlistenable, despite several efforts to find something good in it.  Coltrane did some good work with Monk and with Miles Davis.  His ballads albums are good (My Favorite Things; Ballads).  But most of his later work is disappointing to one who likes classic jazz and hard bop.  I can't blame an artist for wanting to do something really new and creative.  But &quot;creative&quot; is not necessarily good.  Is my negative view of A Love Supreme a minority view?  Obviously, most of the Amazon reviews are positive.  But this is not a random sample of jazz fans.  People usually buy what they already know they like.  (Except me--I was a sucker for the hype and bought it before I heard it.)  And people are more likely to take the time to write reviews of books and CDs that they like than those that they don't like.  But for those of you who haven't bought it yet, be aware that Coltrane's A Love Supreme is mainly of historical interest.  It is not the kind of music that most jazz fans would want to listen to over and over again.
B00008NRI8|2.0|I suppose I expected too much after just watching Miss Congeniality. This movie was slow and too political. It constantly insults conservatism but gives no grounds for doing so. As liberalism often does. Now, I could insult Democrats all day, but I'd do it with facts and give reasons for doing so. And don't get me wrong, Republicrats aren't much better than Demopublicans...however, conservatism is a lifestyle and for some reason it's the only lifestyle Hollywood, liberals and just humans in general have full rights to degrade and insult(by the way, conservatives are not ALL red-necks). That just seems very HYPOCRITICAL to me.<br />NONE of that changes my original point...this movie is hardly funny(if at all), not all that interesting and not at all entertaining. The mushy ending felt forced, in fact...it felt so forced, I wanted to smack the both of them and serve them their future divorce papers right there!<br />I'm only glad my friend let me borrow his copy...poor guy, he's the one that bought it. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY!
B000065V1V|5.0|After almost 35 years in the music business, David Bowie proves that he still has the mobility to make terrific music as he did in his younger days.  &quot;Heathen&quot; presents his artsy side with alternative rock music.  He experiments with different sounds and instruments to give the listener more than just music in an album.  This is a one-hour journey of his creative mind.<br />Pete Townshend and Dave Grohl offer their wonderful guitar sounds.  Townshend's &quot;Slow Burn&quot;(Grammy-nominee for Best Male Rock Performance) part is the main focus of the song.  Grohl's &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot; part gives it the added hardcore edge that symbolized Bowie's last few years.  Remakes of classics live up to the original: &quot;Cactus&quot;, &quot;I Took a Trip On a Gemini Spacecraft&quot;, and &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot;.  <br />One may think that as a constantly evolving artist, he's done everything.  &quot;Heathen&quot; proves everyone wrong.  In fact, he proves that he still has much more ideas to express, and that he will be around for at least another 35 years.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Rock &amp; Roll = The Who = This DVD!<br />It MUST be heard in DTS or Dolby 5.1 -- LOUD.  Two speakers in front is just not good enough.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|My DVD player will play the bonus features DVD, but it keeps rejecting the feature film DVD.  Anyone else having this trouble?  Does it have to do with Warner's decision not to encode anti-piracy protection onto the film DVD?  <br />About the movie: I saw Matrix Reloaded twice in theatres, and enjoyed discussing it for weeks.  It has flaws, but who else out there besides the Wachowskis tries to put so much into their films?  (Peter Jackson does... but who else?)  Call this sequel pretentious or whatever ... but I call it a good effort, and great eye candy.  (And in any event, what else are you gonna do to fill your time until May 2005, when you get to watch the suckers camp on the sidewalk for a month just so they can be the first people disappointed by George Lucas' final Star Wars puppet show movie? <br />For such a &quot;groundbreaking&quot; movie as Matrix Reloaded, I would have appreciated more behind-the-scenes material, with slower, less intelligence-insulting edits, and more detail.  (I would have paid for a third DVD of such extras.)  Overall though, &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot; belongs in your sci-fi collection.
B00009TB5G|5.0|One of the more frustrating things about reading the reviews about either of the first two Jackson-directed Lord Of The Rings movies is that a substantial portion of the population has tremendous difficulty understanding what an incredibly difficult job it has been to adapt such rich and complex literary masterpieces to the screen. The Lord of the Rings books have enough content to keep the imagination running for days and months, yet they also have the unique ability to teach us important lessons about the human condition. <BR>   One reviewer wrote \\"Jackson should just make the movies as Tolkien wrote them.\\" What said reviewer doesn't appear to realize is that the magic in Tolkien's work lies in its ability to interplay with the individual reader's imagination. In order to adapt in such a way, Jackson would have to have every perspective film viewer read the books, then give input into the adaptation. Even then, all viewers would have to have had the exact same experience while reading. Impossible.<BR>    The other problem is that to cover all of the content in the books, each of the films would have to be many hours longer than they are.  Just like every other director, Jackson had a budget and time constraints. Since it would be impossible to do a completely loyal adaptation we have to look at and judge the movies within their own genre. Look at what has been accomplished. A coherent story (a miracle in and of itself) mixed with great acting, grandiose cinematography, and seamlessly blended special effects produce a truly amazing cinematic experience.  We experience everything from comedy to drama to fantasy to action in one experience.  While other directors seem to lose their films' humanity when integrating mind-blowing special effects (a certain G. Lucas comes to mind), Jackson does everything possible to create a real world with real characters. Please stop crying for a \\"pure\\" adaptation when you know such a thing isn't possible. Enjoy the movie for what itis: one of the great cinematic experiences of our generation.
B000099T2L|3.0|When I first heard &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; on the radio, I thought the entire records was going to be like that.  After I bought it I found out that it's the opposite; most of the songs are ballads.  Although not perfect, I think Beyonce's debut is very good.  Songs like &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, &quot;Speechless&quot;, &quot;That's How I like it&quot;, &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot;, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and the title track are very goods.  The others pale in comparison.  A good buy, if you like R&amp;B, specially the slow type.
6304288433|3.0|As the movie's slogan reads, &quot;The Nightmare Isn't Over Yet&quot;. The original cast and crew return for the sequel to one of the all-time greatest horror films. While the film is supposed to take place on the same night as the original massacre, it was actually filmed three years later. Many members of the cast, most notably Jamie Lee Curtis have aged since then but hey, it's all in fun, right?<br />Michael Myers isn't dead and he's still killing teenagers like nobody's business. His shrink, Dr. Loomis is still trying to warn the residents of his old neighborhood but little is being done. The original victim, Lorie Strode is in the local hospital so it's only a matter of time before Myers shows up there and perfoms surgery on the staff.<br />&quot;Halloween II&quot; is not quite on the level of its classic predecassor but it is still a worthy sequel. It does rely a lot more on gore than the original but this is to be expected. Donald Pleasance is the real star here. With Curtis nearly catatonic through the majority of the film, Pleasance really steps up. His portrayal of Loomis is such an intergral and often overlooked piece of the Halloween series. Without Pleasance in the latter films, the Halloween series has become just another run-of-the-mill slasher series but these earlier films were real treats.
B000099T2L|4.0|I am not a fan of Beyonce Knowles because of her image and her excessives runs on her vocals. However, after listening to this cd, I had to admit I do like it.  I love the slow cuts.  They are very well written.  The tracks are banging.  Congrats to B., I really wish she'd sell more music than her body.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesday With Morrie Is the best book I have ever read. it is the tale of a young man who gets back in touch with a favorite professor after hearing his name on the news. He finds out that his dear Professor has Lue Gehrig disease he decides to visit every tuesday. This book depicts the misery of a crippling disease and how a man full of wisdom preaches life long lessons within days of death. This book shows passion between young and old. Love between living and dying. And lessons that take minutes to learn but take a lifetime to understand. I recommend this book to anyone who can read at the level it is written at.
B00002E224|5.0|I remember when this movie came out a few years ago that I thought the concept of the movie - two strangers meet on a train, and get to know each other -- but both must leave never to see each other again -- sounded intriguing.  I was right.<br />I rented this movie and thought the movie was charming, funny, poigniant, and very realistic.<br />Ethan Hawke ( a very underrated actor - please make more movies!!!) and Julie Delpy (where has she gone?) meet on a train going to Vienna.  On a whim, both decide to spend the day and night together.<br />This is not an action movie!  There is dialogue - people talk and you get to know them as they get to know each other.  Both actors do an excellent job of acting.  The nervousness, the anticipation - it is all there.  The audience ( and the charecters)  know what is going to happen - but the fun is the conversations these people have  in getting there.  Meaningless, stupid, funny, interesting; the converstations are interesting because both people know they likely won't see each other again - so they can confide in each other.<br />The scenery is great.  Having been to Vienna, the sights are wonderful.  I even went to many of the same places as the charecters.  The fountain they sit at is above the Vienna State Opera House.  At the end of the movie, you will see a line of people - those people are waiting for standing-room only tickets for the opera!!  It made me remember my time in Vienna. I waited in that line to see the opera.<br />I must confess I met a girl on a train as well in Europe - and this movie brought the same memories of that time.  The movie is romantic, and cool because the guy lives out a fantasy thing for traveling in Europe.  Oo la lah. (I didn't get so lucky! : ()<br />This is a charming movie, and well worth seeing.  It is so sad at the end ( I won't ruin the resolution), but the writer/director R. Linklater handles the ending with such beauty and subtle touch that it makes the movie even more 'true.'<br />This is truly bravura filmmaking.  No, it isn't \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" but in my opinion, it is similarly quality filmmaking.  This movie is like \\"My Dinner with Andre.\\"  There is simply something about it that makes your heart sing.  Yeah, just from two people being together. No sex, no drugs, no rock and roll, just simply human communication.  Simply exquisite.  See it. (And it isnt a chick movie!!)<br />UPDATE FOR ALL YOU \\"BEFORE SUNRISE\\" FANS - THERE IS A SEQUEL COMING - EXPECTED IN 2004!!!!/>This is truly bravura filmmaking.

B00005JL1C|4.0|Some Kind of Wonderful is a great film.  The songs are catchy and the story is cute, but a bit slow at times.  The actors are perfectly cast.  Overall a great teen love story.      The DVD on the other hand is a bit strange.  The video is really soft, more so than the original print.  The colors are muted a bit.  The effect is there in the original, but it appears enhanced on this DVD.  I'd really like someone to do a Special Edition version of this disc.  It deserves some extras.    All in all, it's not a bad disc for a great 80's film.  Highly recommended for the casual viewer, and something to watch til a SE comes out for the big fans.
B000002UWP|5.0|Sem duvida o melhor trabalho dessa dupla adorvel.
B000002HJA|4.0|Before Kyuss splintered and Josh Homme went on to form the equally brilliant Queens Of The Stone Age, the band released the excellent valedictory &quot;And The Circus Leaves Town.&quot;  Although this album doesn't quite live up to the lofty standard established by the utter masterpieces &quot;Blues For The Red Sun&quot; and &quot;Welcome To Sky Valley,&quot; it still showcases the creativity and instrumental virtuosity the band was known for.  At the same time, it's perhaps Kyuss's quietest album, turning down the raging sandstorm of sound that characterized &quot;Blues&quot; and (to a lesser extent) &quot;Sky Valley.&quot;  For the most part, &quot;And The Circus Leaves Town&quot; is the kind of album you could play while kicking back with a beer on your porch and not annoy the neighbors.  And since it's predecessors had more of a &quot;play it in your car at full blast with your window rolled down so everyone in a quarter-mile radius can hear it and know you have better taste than they do&quot; vibe, that's a pretty big departure.  It's still stoner rock, but stoner rock of a somewhat different and less fearsome stripe.<br />Of course, it wouldn't be a Kyuss album without a few slabs of headbanging metal, and the opening &quot;Hurricane,&quot; &quot;Tangy Sizzle,&quot; and the concluding epic &quot;Spaceship Landing&quot; all fill the bill quite nicely in that regard.  Kyuss could lay down a groove with the best of them, and these songs just provided final, convincing proof of that fact.  Featuring Josh's pounding riffs and John Garcia's signature wail, these songs all rank right up there with &quot;Green Machine,&quot; &quot;Allen's Wrench,&quot; and a few sections of &quot;Sky Valley&quot; among Kyuss's most infectious moments.  Likewise, the woozy, sludgy quasi-psychedelia of &quot;Thee Ol' Boozeroony&quot; and &quot;El Rodeo&quot; fits in snugly with the band's prior instrumental output.<br />It's elsewhere than Kyuss stretches out their sonic palette.  &quot;Blues&quot; and &quot;Sky Valley&quot; did have their share of quieter moments, but not to the extent found here.  Josh's guitar wattage isn't as abundantly evident as before, and John's ratio of singing to wailing actually gets to right around one-to-one.  &quot;One Inch Man&quot; and &quot;Gloria Lewis&quot; do contain the sun-baked riffage that Josh has made a very nice career out of, but they're more notable for two of the most relaxed and easygoing tempos of the band's career.  &quot;Phototropic,&quot; &quot;Size Queen&quot; and &quot;Catamaran&quot; also contain a few heavy moments, but they're still remarkably mellow for Kyuss songs.<br />In the end, I can't endorse this album as heartily as &quot;Blues&quot; or &quot;Sky Valley.&quot;  However, those albums were such classics that they established an incredibly high target, and I'm not sure &quot;And The Circus Leaves Town&quot; was intended to &quot;match&quot; them anyway.  Viewed on its own, this is still a remarkable album with the potential for hours of fruitful listening.  So I say kick back and enjoy it.ot;Blues&quot; and &quot;Sky Valley&quot; did have their share of quieter moments, but not to the extent found here.

B0000057C5|5.0|This album is so incredible. Although in my opinion, their worst, it still soars so far above American music. So many songs in America have the depth of a rain puddle. The songs on this album...God, the symbolism is incredible. The most stunning song is the shamefully underrated Klavier. When I listened to it, I started the cry. The lyrics are just that....beautiful and sad. Spiel Mit Mir provides a bit of a preview the gothic metal undertones present on their third album, and the way Till sings it is just chilling. Its so hard to classify this band because with almost every song their style changes completely. What's more, is they do the transitions so well. Definitely well worth the cost.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign in Blood is one of the most intense albums I've ever heard and will ever hear, it's AMAZING. Every track is a brutal sonic assault, and the lyrics are way above average. Undisputed Metal Classic, and one of the best CDs of any genre and any era.
6305744793|5.0|I wouldn't have bet that anyone could pull it off.  The original series had such a unique and whimsical voice, I assumed that a movie maker would either overplay the feel of the film or just miss the point entirely.<br />But Barry Sonnenfeld gets it!  And the cast is top-notch.  Christina Ricci is more menacing than words can express.  The late Raul Julia nails the character of Gomez.<br />Wonderful in its humor and its overall feel, this one is a keeper to enjoy over and over again.
B00009APK1|5.0|&quot;The fate of the world will soon be decided. The dominion of evil grows even stronger. There is a union now, between the Two Towers: Orthanc and Barad-dûr...&quot;<br />December 2002, the second in the trilogy of movies from New Line, The Two Towers finally released to theaters, and into the waiting eyes and ears of millions. I was among the first of Americans to see the movie, on its second viewing in the United States. (I was there to see it the next morning when the office opened) When it released to DVD, I was among the last on the first day of its release to scoop it off the stand. <br />Of course, the second movie is pretty worthless unless you have seen the first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring. If you haven't, I'd suggest renting the extended edition DVD from your nearest store and viewing it first. (Make sure you get the \\"Special Extended Edition\\")<br />This is a review for those who still haven't seen it yet, and perhaps want to, or who are wondering what the mania is about. (Orlando Bloom)<br />PLOT: The Fellowship is dissolved. Boromir of Gondor fell in battle defending Merry and Pippin, hobbits of the Shire, from the Uruk-hai, blood-thirsty, maniacal orcs that have undergone a super-sizing courtesy of the traitorous wizard Saruman. Merry and Pippin were taken captive by these Uruk-hai. Aragorn the Ranger, eventual heir to the throne of Gondor, and his friends Legolas the Elf and Gimli the stout dwarf give pursuit to the Uruks in order to save Merry and Pippin. Frodo and Sam have departed on their own, bound for Mordor and the fiery Mt. Doom in the very center of the dark lord Sauron's realm - the one place where the Ring of Power can be unmade, thus giving victory to all the free peoples of Middle-Earth.<br />Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, in search of the hobbits, find themselves in Fangorn Forest, where they find Gandalf the Grey, who heroically withstood the hideous Balrog, and fell in Moria into darkness of Khazad-Dûm. He is now Gandalf the White, more powerful than Saruman himself, victorious over death, sent back to life to complete his labors against Sauron. This foursome journey to the land of Rohan, to the Golden Hall of its King, Théoden. When Gandalf heals Théoden from the spells cast by Saruman spy Grima Wormtongue, Théoden comes to realize the great peril his kingdom already lies in, casts Wormtongue out of his kingdom, and leads his people to the fortress of Helm's Deep, on the heels of a massive hoard of Uruk-hai, an army bent on one purpose alone: dying. No! You'd think so the way they fight, but they are actually bent on destroying all the peoples of Rohan, and Mankind.<br />Frodo and Sam, meantime, have found Gollum, the twisted Ring-addict who attempts to take his \\"precious\\" back, but when dominated by the two hobbits, promises to lead them to Mordor. <br />GOOD: You might call be a little biased, because I'm a big Tolkien fan, but this movie is like nothing you've ever seen before. Quality of acting combined with ground-breaking special effects, set against the breath-taking landscape of New Zealand as Middle-Earth all come together to make the second of the three best movies in modern cinema. A spectacular musical score by Howard Shore merely ices the cake. The high points of the film include a battle at Helm's Deep that makes the Alamo look like a backyard game of cowboys and indians, and a last-ditch cataclysmic charge that is downright apocalyptic. Granted, \\"Evil\\" gets almost glorified in its ugliness, but there is an ultimate sense of Good for which every hero in Middle-Earth strives for, and in some cases, dies for. This is summed up in a poignant soliloquy by Sam after a particularly powerful demonstration of the terrible sway the Ring of Power possesses. When, in despair, Frodo laments \\"What are we holding onto, Sam?\\" Sam states in potent courage \\"That there's some good in this world. And it's worth fighting for.\\"<br />As far as effects go, this movie is the cream of the crop.Orcs ride entirely computer-generated hyena-like wolves called Wargs. The Ringwraiths now  ride entirely computer-generated fell dragon-like beasts. The desiccated and psychotic dual personality of Gollum is created entirely by computer, and performed by Andy Serkis to perfection. <br />BAD: As said before, evil is a bulwark of a force to reckon with, and its ugliness is often glorified. One Uruk-hai beheads another and his macabre crew dine on the corpse. An Uruk head is later shown impaled grotesquely next to a pile of burning carcasses. In battle, both orcs and their steeds are slashed, hacked, beheaded, stabbed, beaten, pummeled, run through, pierced, skewered, cloven, chopped, sliced, speared, severed, axed, you name it. Though it must be clarified that in most cases the battles take place in low light, and we don't have massively explicit gore. However, these malevolent creatures are the epitome of evil, and are shown with a frightening realism that might frighten your small kids into sleeping in your bed for the next 14 years. (I personally won't go anywhere NEAR my Palantír)<br />THOUGHTS: Being a Christian, I've interacted with some who hate the Rings trilogy, and some who love it. Being that Tolkien was a Christian, and worked allegory into his work (whether he meant to or not, it's there), I think much of the ideas in the genre are downright Christian in their own right. Many contest the seemingly occultism and wizardry prevalent in the film(s). One must realize that these characters with this power are, if you study the histories of Middle-Earth, actually beings put on Earth by Angels to provide balance to the evil principalities. Understand that these wizards are not like pimply-faced Harry Potter at all. They have a design for existing: to take place in the battle against evil.<br />Excellent movie, entirely, and I recommend it highly, except for kids.
6305949980|5.0|Well, I can't decide, so I usually watch this classic several times between Halloween and Christmas.<br />Oh so charming and delightful in its production values and its performances, &quot;The Nigtmare Before Christmas&quot; draws from so many classic sources (both film and literary) that it serves as an homage to the entire last quarter of every calendar year!  It has a great sense of whimsy but also of creepiness.  It is destined to endure for generations.<br />If only it could have been longer...
1573301051|4.0|I agree with most of the professional music writers that Aretha Franklin was the ONLY true &quot;diva&quot; on that stage at the Beacon Theatre.<br />The other women were diva-wanna-bes and ALL seemed intimidated by the undisputed Queen of Soul.  They had  reason to be a little afraid, Franklin took command of the stage and the show!  I wish she had sung a couple of alternative songs, but she knew she could take it easy with this group. If Franklin had to deal with Patti LaBelle, Natalie Cole and Bettye LaVette, you would have seen SOME show!<br />When she decided she'd had enough, she left her co-stars behind, fighting to wave away the dust.  During &quot;A Natural Woman,&quot; it became The Aretha Franklin Show, with Sister Ree dominating the proceedings (with Celine Dion trying desperately to stay afloat).  She drowned.<br />Aretha went into a surprise gospel number (&quot;Testimony&quot;) which none of the other singers knew.  They dutifully transformed into background dancers and handclappers as Franklin sailed forward.<br />All in all, I enjoyed the show, but calling Shania, Mariah, Gloria and Celine &quot;divas&quot; just makes a joke of that word.
0790731479|4.0|This is definitely a guilty pleasure.  As often as I think I'm not supposed to be liking this film, I can't help it.  The cast is what does makes this a solid and rewatchable vehicle.  It also has the steady feel of a Burton film, with great production values and a great sense of its own ability to frighten and delight all at the same time.
0060934913|4.0|Anthony Bourdain writes like you imagine he'd cook, with a quick, spare style, a flair for detail, and a way with words that leaves you hungry for more at the end of each chapter. Kitchen Confidential is set out like a meal, with sections entitled &quot;Appetizer; First Course&quot; etc., so I feel justified in stretching this culinary metaphor a little further: just as Bourdain makes it clear he doesn't like to mess with the natural flavours of his food, so his earthy use of language gives Kitchen Confidential a true to life flavour. In the mould of other star chefs in print, such as Marco Pierre White, the author comes across as strongly opinionated, at times almost arrogant. However, he is able to undercut this self-centred approach with a healthy dollop of self deprecation, as he does with great comic effect mid way through the first course when he describes his young self swaggering into the kitchen of his second job, wearing a light-blue Pierre Cardin suit: gin some deranged, early seventies bout of disco inspired hubris, I chose to make my entrance in gull-wing shouldered Robert Palmer-wear, just itching to show the local yokels how we did it in New York City.h With a set up like this, there is no way for the young Anthony Bourdain to go but down, and fast: &quot;Then, grabbing a saute pan, I burned myself. I yelped out loud, dropping the pan, an order of osso buoco milanese hitting the floor, and as a small red blister raised itself on my palm, I foolishly- oh, so foolishly- asked the beleaguered Tyrone if he had some burn cream and maybe a Band-Aid.&quot; At this point you know the hapless hero is riding for a fall, just like those horror flick protagonists at whom you want to shout: gDonft open that door! Donft play that cursed video tape!h- but of course they do anyway. In any case, the predictable humiliation that results from this scene motivates Bourdain to attend the Culinary Institute of America, and propels him into a career as a rock enf roll chef, bouncing from restaurant to restaurant, snorting drugs, picking up an odd-ball collection of semi civilized friends, seemingly always just one step ahead of complete disaster. <BR>Interspersed with the anecdotes from his career are morsels of advice: gHow to Cook Like the Prosh tells you what kind of knife you ought to buy; and snapshots of the sometimes gruesome workings of the restaurant kitchen and the marginal characters who work there. The organization of Kitchen Confidential is somewhat schizophrenic, but what makes it such a rewarding read is the vitality and humour of Bourdainfs writing. Here is a sample from his &quot;Mission to Tokyo&quot;: &quot;The best course yet had arrived: a quickly grilled, halved fish headcIt was unbelievable: every crevice, every scrap of this sweet, delicate dorade or Chilean pompano (I didnft know from looking at the partly charred face, and by now didnft much care) had responded differently to the heat of the grill. From the fully cooked remnant of body behind the head to the crispy skin and cartilage, the tender, translucently rare cheeks, it was a mosaic of distinct flavours and textures. And the eye! Oh, yeah!&quot;<BR>Suffice to say that Bourdain makes eating fish eyes sound like a mouth-watering treat. <BR>If Kitchen Confidential can be faulted at times for a lack of direction, Anthony Bourdainfs writing certainly can't. He aims to entertain, and on this count, I put down Kitchen Confidential completely satisfied.
0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton has made a GREAT film that incorporates the greatest aspect of classic horror: creepiness, suspense and just the right amount of humor.<br />The production values are superb and have Burton's fingerprints all over them.  The performances are great, from Depp's whimsical but squeamish &quot;Constable&quot; Ichabod Crane to a supporting cast that is, simply put, to die for.<br />Where I fault the film (it would be a 3 1/2 for me) is the loss of Washington Irving's original vision.  Ichabod Crane is not the hero of the story.  He doesn't rid the town of the Headless Horseman.  Of course, this doesn't quite fit the bill for a Depp/Burton vehicle.  This would have made a fun sequel -- what happened after Ichabod disappeared.  As it is, it is a very shaky reworking that over-analyzes Crane's childhood and introduces too many plot and character changes to really make it recognizable.<br />Would that Burton had brought the original story to film with this much energy and whimsy and spookiness.  Alas, it was not meant to be, but it's still a good film overall.
B000001AFY|3.0|What a guilty pleasure is to hear Diana Ross voice, she's has the sweetest voice in the business.  Her self titled album of 1976 was a definition between her adult contemporary ballads of 1973's Touch Me In The Morning, 1974's Last Time I Saw Him and the disco beats of 1979's The Boss, 1980's diana, &quot;Love Hangover&quot; was the first attempt for miss Ross to conquer the world of disco, and my oh my!, this is so good, more than 7 minutes of sweetly moaning and singing by Ross, a total dance classic!, &quot;The theme from Mahogany&quot; is one of the most mellow slowly and sweetly ballads that Diana deliver, not a personal favorite but still a classic, the delivery of two perfect pop gems like &quot;I Thought It Took A Little Time&quot; and &quot;One Love In MY Lifetime&quot; where kind and generous but didn't achieve that success that Diana deserve simply because the world was in love with Disco, I'm my humble description I must say that the other tracks that didn't became singles where jazzy ballads, a reminder of Lady Sings The Blues, that will satisfy any ballad lover in the world, overall this is an amazing masterpiece by Miss Ross, that tried to fall in the peoples taste of those years by adding a Disco track between delicious crafted pop contemporary gems, and fail to become Diana's biggest hits just because, Mahogany already came from the soundtrack, Love Hangover 12&quot; outsold the album, and the rest of the tracks where simply not enough to sell a record. Sadly this is now hard to find in CD, but still if you can get it you will taste the talent that Diana had as a performer, and this album cover has to be one of the best she ever did.

B00000ILDF|5.0|Fincher is maybe the most interesting director to contribute to this particular franchise and, let's face it, it shows: after the failure that was \\"Aliens\\" we get this, the most gloriously dark and bleak sci fi film to be seen anywhere. Weaver's Ripley aside, all the cutely sympathetic characters whose survival we are encouraged to root for through the anodyne &quot;Aliens&quot; are casually killed off before the opening credits and we are transported to the world of an abandoned prison colony supervised by the magnificently nasty and brutal Brian Glover. Apart from Weaver and Glover's characters everyone in the colony is gripped by the most asinie form of religious fanaticism which makes the bleak refusal of any sort of redemption implicit in the ending all the more satisfying. No cute little girls, no big automatic weapons, just a bunch of defenseless lost souls at the back end of a world that has given up on them being chased around in the dark by something murderous that they are unable to kill. A serious return to form by Geiger's evil black salivating thing: if only it had ended here!
B0000A36J5|5.0|I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings and I bought the Fellowship Extended Edition. With the extended versions it opens the story up to you. It gives you more of the story and fans of the book will be especially please that alot of left out scene's were put in the extended edition dvd. The Ent Draft scene i was especially pleased was put in the extended. The extended editon is the ideal gift for a fan of LOTR.
B000009EAD|5.0|I am ashamed to say I have only been an Iced Earth fan for two years after I picked up a copy of Horror Show.  Since then I have I have filled out my collection with all of their CDs and Something Wicked in my view is still their most wicked today.<br />This CD has everything: an &quot;off to the mark&quot; song like Burning Times, slower songs like Consequences and an epic like the ending trilogy (Prophecy, Birth of the Wicked and the Coming Curse).<br />The songwriting, production and musicianship on this CD are spot on.  Barlow's vocal emotion on this CD is just great and you'll catch yourself singing (for someone like me in my car with no-one else around!) to such tunes as Watching Over Me.<br />If you are a first time buyer do yourself a favour and buy this, the Dark Saga, and Night of the Stormrider then everything else.  If you are really smart buy the three CD version of Alive in Athens now.  Something Wicked is highly recommended to all who like Metal!

B0000C9V3T|5.0|Wow, great soundtrack, all the memorable stuff is in here.  Unfortunatly one of the most emotive songs in the film is polluted by the RZA, who barfs words all over it.  It's really sad, because he's a much better lyricist than what he spat out over his track on the album.  Oh well, everything else is good, including the tracks mixed by him.  I just wished he had kept his mouth shut on the one track.

B00005JMCN|2.0|I think a lot of people--grown-up people, anyway--really want to like this film for what it aspires to be. And it's a movie that had a lot of potential--good actors, good characters, good concept, good sets, good cinematography, and a not too bad horse. There's lots of really good stuff. But having a lot of really good stuff doesn't necessarily make a really good movie, and Seabiscuit is Exhibit A. <br />A lot of people have commended this movie for its unhurried leisurely pace. I say nonsense. This movie is just plain slow, and it's slow because someone wasn't willing to make the cuts necessary to tighten it up. Good story telling requires discipline, and that's where this film falls short. What's left is a potentially great film that falters at the gate. Definitely one to rent first.

Quality of acting combined with ground-breaking special effects, set against the breath-taking landscape of New Zealand as Middle-Earth all come together to make the second of the three best movies in modern cinema. A spectacular musical score by Howard Shore merely ices the cake. The high points of the film include a battle at Helm's Deep that makes the Alamo look like a backyard game of cowboys and indians, and a last-ditch cataclysmic charge that is downright apocalyptic. Granted, \\"Evil\\" gets almost glorified in its ugliness, but there is an ultimate sense of Good for which every hero in Middle-Earth strives for, and in some cases, dies for. This is summed up in a poignant soliloquy by Sam after a particularly powerful demonstration of the terrible sway the Ring of Power possesses. When, in despair, Frodo laments \\"What are we holding onto, Sam?\\" Sam states in potent courage \\"That there's some good in this world. And it's worth fighting for.\\"<br />As far as effects go, this movie is the cream of the crop.Orcs ride entirely computer-generated hyena-like wolves called Wargs. The Ringwraiths now  ride entirely computer-generated fell dragon-like beasts. The desiccated and psychotic dual personality of Gollum is created entirely by computer, and performed by Andy Serkis to perfection. <br />BAD: As said before, evil is a bulwark of a force to reckon with, and its ugliness is often glorified. One Uruk-hai beheads another and his macabre crew dine on the corpse. An Uruk head is later shown impaled grotesquely next to a pile of burning carcasses. In battle, both orcs and their steeds are slashed, hacked, beheaded, stabbed, beaten, pummeled, run through, pierced, skewered, cloven, chopped, sliced, speared, severed, axed, you name it. Though it must be clarified that in most cases the battles take place in low light, and we don't have massively explicit gore. However, these malevolent creatures are the epitome of evil, and are shown with a frightening realism that might frighten your small kids into sleeping in your bed for the next 14 years. (I personally won't go anywhere NEAR my Palantír)<br />THOUGHTS: Being a Christian, I've interacted with some who hate the Rings trilogy, and some who love it. Being that Tolkien was a Christian, and worked allegory into his work (whether he meant to or not, it's there), I think much of the ideas in the genre are downright Christian in their own right. Many contest the seemingly occultism and wizardry prevalent in the film(s). One must realize that these characters with this power are, if you study the histories of Middle-Earth, actually beings put on Earth by Angels to provide balance to the evil principalities. Understand that these wizards are not like pimply-faced Harry Potter at all. They have a design for existing: to take place in the battle against evil.<br />Excellent movie, entirely, and I recommend it highly, except for kids.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|This movie is the best.  It's not supposed to be R I mean I'm 10<BR> years old.  I think that and so do my parents.  At first they wouldn't let me watch it but then we watched it together and they decided it was appropriate.  My parents are really big freaks about violence.  I mean they almost didn't let me get the first one.  I don't know why people think this movie is horrible.  The special effects are awesome.  So this movie is the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life.  It is also my favorite.  So, the parents who read this should decide better about this movie if they have sons that want to see it.  Not if they are under 10.  But anyone above 10 should probably be able to watch it because it is not such a bad movie.  So watch the movie and decide for your self.  Now go watch the movie or FREE YOUR MIND!
B000002LKF|5.0|My favorite CD of all time, this album continues to be the ultimate spiritual experience each time I hear it.  It took me many years to warm up to this album.  Each time I grow as a human being I understand more of the music and love it more.  It offers a massive sensual experience, especially in lines such as &quot;soil as soft as summer, the strength to push like spring.&quot;
B000066C6F|3.0|The movie is really pretty silly -- but frankly I like to watch the aerobics parts of this whenever I need inspiration to work out!  I know I could never look like Jamie Lee, but still, she looks incredible (not just her bod but everything).  And I like it that her character is fairly independent and gutsy and doesn't take a lot of crap from Travolta.  And I think the movie DOES capture the aerobics culture of the '70s.  It's funny, also, that Travolta's laptop is a novelty to Jamie Lee (&quot;Is that a computer?&quot;) - when they're so commonplace now.
B00005R2M3|2.0|This album is ok, i probably would have given it three stars but i only gave it 2 cause this album was rushed. You could just tell by the lenght of the songs and her only having 13 songs in the album. She took three years to make this album, but what did she do in those three years? just take vacations or kick it and sleep at her house or what? Cause it seems she took all those three years off and recorded this album in the last minute or something. She says shes a perferctionist in her work but i dont think so cause her music doest sound like it. All of her albums seemed rushed now dont get me wrong im a former shakira fan and love her album donde estan los ladrones but it also seems rushed. After her first album she took a long time to release donde estan los ladrones like laundry service and dell sounds rusehd 2. She only has 11 songs and most of them dont go over 3:30 seconds. If she didnt lag so much she probably could of released all her three albums a year apart from eachother like ummm Miss Spears who also rushes her work but unlike shakira she doesnt lag so her work comes out a year apart from eachother but her music sucks but anyways. If u want to listen to some real music Buy Stripped by my gurl christina aguilera, stripped is the best album i heard, now shes a chick who takes a long time to do her work to but it shows. Stripped took a year and a half to do and it really shows its the best album i heard, and it was only a year and a half and shakira it took her three years. For shakira to release a good album like stripped it wuld take her 10 years of work.
B00009MEKF|3.0|I enjoyed this movie even though the plot twists and turns were mind-boggling and gimmicky.  The action is fast-paced and the mystery is tantalizing even though the way it is worked out is pretty hokey and very confusing.  I watched this movie four times before I finally had it (mostly) put together and then some of it is still contradictory .  Having said all that, I would still recommend it because it is fun being surprised (even with bogus and non-sensical surprises) and the performances are pretty good.  Travolta's character suited him, Connie Nielsen was adequate but boring, Samuel L. Jackson was his usual very loud self, Giovanni Ribisi (a really interesting actor usually) hammed it up., Tim Daly and Harry Connick, Jr. were there mainly for recognition purposes, and the lesser stars were more than able to hold their own with the luminaries.  However, if you want a good Travolta movie, I'd recommend Domestic Disturbance.
B00008K7AM|1.0|It's official! The days of 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Billy Madison' are over.  After seeing 'Little Nicky' a few years back, I prayed to the movie gods that it was just a fluke.  But after suffering through 104 minutes of school-age jokes and tired sexual inuendo, I have lost hope in seeing anything from these producers that doesn't insult my intelligence.  To be fair, some folks will like this movie.  Sadly, I'm not one of them.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Fantastic Album. Brave new world was good. THIS IS MUCH BETTER! This album fits in right where maiden left off with Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. I simply do not understand the negative criticism. Every song is awesome. I really got my money's worth and would recommend to any maiden fan.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Like a good wine, some aged cheese and fine company, Jethro Tull just keep giving you a reason to believe that it may be worthwhile just hanging around in this world a little longer. Their music, so beautifully and precisely rendered, is breathtakingly invigorating and Ian's solo's are irresistibly captivating and uplifting. This album brings together much of what could be regarded as the best of their &quot;Acoustic&quot; repertoire. It has a real English feel, reminiscent of the folksy Songs from the wood, and Heavy Horses, and although the voice is not as strong, the flautist is forever true to his craft. This is, quite simply, the best Tull album in years. But even if it were not, it's still a Tull album, and is that not something like a little Christmas gift anyway. Just buy it.
B00000099Y|5.0|It's hard to describe Tool's second full length album, AEnima.  Many Tool fans call it their best album ever, and for good reason.  The album mixes dark lyrics with hypnotic, sad guitar lines, and incredible rythmic drum beats.  The last song, third eye, is one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's the type of music where you can close your eyes, melt into it, and let it take you somewhere.  There is a large amount of depth and content to be found in the album.  I could go on and on about Tool and this album, but just know if I could recommend any album in the world to you, it would be this one.  Go buy it.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|The 1990's was a shocking decade for Maiden in my opinion, firstly with Adrian Smith leaving in 1989, the class of the band seemed to go with him. Ever note in his solo's counted. Then &quot;No Prayer For The Dying&quot; which was a half arsed sounding affair, nothing memorable really on that album. Bruce Dickinson's voice was also a shadow of it's former God-like self and Yanik Gers was all notes without feel. Then &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; which had some awesome moments, definatly a better album by far from the woeful former, but still the Iron Maiden songwritting formula had reared up it's ugly head far too many times for it to be missed and it was starting to sound old hat. <br />With Bruce leaving and Blaze Bailey stepping in on vocals, I knew the first nails in the coffin were in place before I even heard 'X Factor' but nothing could prepare me for such an appaling rehashed and predictable sound. This album sounded like a cheap garage covers band writting Iron Maiden songs. I smashed this album within a week of purchacing it and had to contain the bitterness that I felt for the band that had once given me such musical pleasure. You take Bruce's trademark vocals away from a band like Iron Maiden, you take the life away with it. I strongly believed that 'Seventh Son' was going to be Iron Maidens last real album. Sad but true, I was a grieving lad, I just couldn't handle what this mightly band had become. <br />I  was facinated with Iron Maiden at age 7, when I first heard 'Number Of The Beast' and Bruce's voice amazed me (even at that young age). When I picked up bass in the late 80's, I became a diehard and Steve Harris became my biggest musical influence. He probably taught me more about the instument, even to this day, than anyone else and for that I hold him and the band in the highest regard, even though I stopped listerning to them come 1995. Having such a glorious run of killer albums in the 80's, I just had to be content with that and move on from theband, as I could not relate to anything they released in the 90's. I just moved on and I supposed the band became a fond memory of my past.<br />Then came the news in 1999 that not only Bruce but Adrian were returning to the band, recreating the the best Maiden line up in history. I bought 'Brave New World' as soon as it was released. To be honest, I was disappointed with the album because it lacked the spark and magic of the great 1980's albums as well as an absence of twin guitar harmonies. To a certain extent, it was to be expected considering it had been more than a decade since this line up had been together. It also was very predictable but it was far better than anything they had done in the 90's. <br />With the release of 'Dance of Death' I was prepared for another disappointment but was pleasantly surprised at how fresh this album sounds. Nowhere near as predictable as their last 5 albums, Bruce sounds as powerful as he did in at his peak and the songs are so meldodic. The Maiden formula is present in the song writting but somehow not as cliche as the last 5 efforts. The production is faultless, the songs are really catchy without being cheesy and the guitar work is very clever. It is quite a heavy sounding album with ballsy guitar tones and Harris's bass is back up in the mix again. Nicko really never has missed a beat, even when the band was at it's lowest a few years ago and the sound engineer has pulled a killer drum sound on this album.  <br />The last album that sounded this good regarding songwritting and structure was 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' back in 1988 which is a damn long time ago. Not many bands get a chance to get back to the peak of their glory days but finally, I think Iron Maiden have reach it again.<br />The only thing that is really weak in my opinion in regards to this album is the cover artwork. The grim reaper Eddie is fine but the silly looking computer generated characters around him look pretty pathetic. But it's the musicalcontence of the album that really counts.<br />It just goes to show that nothing is as good as the sum of it's parts as the return of Bruce and Adrian have shown that just a little bit of magic goes a long way.<br />A year ago, I never thought I would write a review of Maiden that is a happy as this one.<br />Never give up on a dream........it just might come true!
B000000993|4.0|This is Tool's darkest album, more &quot;rock-ish&quot; than AEnima and Lateralus, with less digital effects, and more staightfoward guitar riffs.  Thats not to say that the music is any less complex than normal.  Maynard's ingenious lyrics focus on religion for much of the CD, one of Tool's big themes.  Every song on the album has a place in my mind, as with every Tool song on ANY album.  This album creates a feeling of heaviness around you when you listen to it, like something is dragging you down, like gravity was more powerful.  Its hard to explain the feeling, its just something you feel.  Its not music, its art.  I would recommend you buy it.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|No one can beat Howard Shore...but Quentin Tarentino comes awfully close here.  What a wonderful blend of old school American and new/modern Japanese numbers.  Who in the heck are the 5,6,7,8's and when can we expect their debut US album???!??!  The songs dealing with O-Ren Ishi are the best....and the snippet of Lucy Liu and the council is absolutely superb!  I have always like Lucy Liu...but now I have a newfound respect for her.  Uma Thurman does a good job in the movie too...and this soundtrack appropriately accents that.  I think that most of the highlights are here....however....I do have to agree with the other reviewers that a couple tracks were left off.  But, maybe these will appear as part of Kill Bill v. 2.  Who knows!!  All we can do is wait for the next movie, the soundtrack, and the DVDs!  Hope they come soon.....
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Matrix Reloaded is the most awesome sci-fi movie of 2003!  It has action, romanance, and of course Matrix sci-fi stuff.  The first movie in the Matrix triology was seen as something that couldn't be beat.  Suprisingly, Matrix Reloaded beats it.  I recommend this to everyone and you won't regret it.  The ending (which I won't spoil for you guys) is just such a mystery it will leave you craving for Matrix Revolutions which comes out next month?!?!  Matrix Reloaded is a movie that everyone will like, so go rent or buy it.
0792162803|4.0|if your a fan of will ferrell you have to own this. the other characters are good and molly shannon is funny as always but will ferrell is like the funniest man ever and this is a must have if you collect his movies.playing the &quot;popular jock&quot; type, his scenes are the funniest in the movie.

B00003CXXP|1.0|Unfortunately for fans of Spielberg's earlier work, this movie is a tendentious ode to sentiment.  I'm not sure of the point of the movie (perhaps we are to marvel at Jude Law's comic talents while trying to emulate a robot??)  If that is the intent, count me a fan because Law makes me crack up, but I would be surprised if that really was all Spielberg tried to convey in this overwrought movie.  Rent the movie if only to see Law at his comic best; otherwise, there ain't much of interest here.
0345440900|1.0|This book came highly reccommended by a friend but I was extremely disappointed. I am a child and adolescent psychiatrist, as well as a parent of a wonderful two-year old boy. I liked some of her ideas but for the most part I felt that the writer failed to take into account different temperaments', styles' of parents and children and instead focussed on her routinized plan as a caregiver (and not as a parent).
B0000C8AVM|3.0|For some this is the end all be all of Bob Dylan's career. I highly disagree. Every thing he did in the 60's is 10x better. What is the best Dylan record is hard to say since he put out so many great albums. I would steer someone towards Freewheeling, Highway 61, Blonde on Blonde, or even Nashville Skyline before this. This to me is one of those albums like the later Kinks work where all of the critics fawn over it and it makes you scratch your head and go what about 'Face to Face'?
0385504209|4.0|Actually I haven't read the book yet ( but you can count on it now!). I am here to give a short rebuttal to the person signed as &quot; a reader&quot; from Brookline, MA ( see Real Junk, October 18). This reviewer says: &quot;...there is no such profession as 'symbologist'...&quot; - But YES there IS dear reader!  And -surprise,surprise- one of the most famous of those, certainly the most visible in the public's awareness, is none other than Professor Umberto Eco. who is a specialist is SEMIOTICS, which deals with the language (and of course, the meaning) of  &quot;symbols&quot; of all kinds. What Brown has done,was simply to call it (this profession, that is) another name. My point is that such profession DOES exist and is enjoying excellent health. I thought you'd like to know.
0792844890|5.0|When my sister and I were kids, we used to love watching Spaceballs. Then, for years, I didn't see it. When I found in a local store, I decided to buy it.  When I put it in, all my memories of the movie came back.<BR>   I like to play Spaceballs after a hard week becuase it makes me laugh and forget my troubles when I see the ridculous situations this lot finding themselves in.  Rick Moranis is perfectly cast as Dark Helmet, a dorky and silly version of Darth Vader.  It is so funny, what happens to him and his oversized, hard-to-breathe-in helmet. Let's not forget John Candy as Barf, a maog, half-man and half-dog.  I love his costumes with the turning ears and his bushy, getting-in-the-way tail.  And Mel Brooks kicks it up as the President, one like you have never seen before.<BR>   As always, there has to be a love story. This one is between Lone Star, captian of a space-flying Winnebago, and Princess Vespa, the beautiful and snobby princess with an oversized hair dryer and her infamous matched trunks and bags.  In spite of their differences, Vespa and Lone Star find true love.<BR>   The plot is full of fun, romance, laughs, and adventure.  Dark Helmet and President Skoorb trying to steal Drudia's suuply of fresh air to save their own planet, Spaceball.  In order to do so, they must capture Princess Vespa to hold her until the airshield code is revealed.  Lone Star saves the princess from their evil grasp, however, he loses her again to the Spaceballs.  It is up to him to free her from the unwelcome grasp of Dark Helmet. A funny yet dramatic climax arises, but the good eventually triumphs over evil.  Do not miss the little details in this movie, they are so funny.  A spin-off of Star Wars, this movie is so funny.  Don't miss out on this, watch it at least two times in your life.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I would like to be Tom Waits for five minuits, just to experience what it's really like to be so shamelessly brilliant. &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; is unquestionably one of Waits' best albums (not that he has ever made an even mediocre one), and it's on my list for the 10 best albums ever made. This is the one to choose if you want to introduce Tom Waits for a newcomer. First time I heard music from the album was at a cinema, watching Jim Jarmush's magnificent &quot;Down by Law&quot;. It goes without saying that film is a must see for fans of Tom Waits, not just because he has a prominent role in it, but because the atmosphere of the entire film fits the universe of Tom Waits like a glove. Seventeen years later, I never get tired of listening to &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;. An album like this one is simply more than our sad world deserves.
0385504209|1.0|This book is complete and utter nonsense.  None of its &quot;history&quot; is correct.  There is no profession of &quot;symbologist,&quot; for example.  And that's not all the nonsense.  The plot is transparent and predictable at every turn.<br />All this could be fun, but it is written with pompous seriousness.  In addition to inventing weird history (powerful secret societies, details of the search for the Holy Grail), the book misinforms about or hypes up essentially every real subject it touches.<br />My aching back!  On the best seller list yet!
0486278077|3.0|It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.<br /> The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class.  It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils.  Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.<br />  Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").<br />  When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.<br />This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.<br />However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))<br />(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.<br />Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral.exual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.<br />Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Otto Preminger is probably one of the least understood and under appreciated directors from the 1940's -1960's, but truth be known he was responsible for some of the most interesting, popular and well made movies from this era: Anatomy of a Murder, Carmen Jones, The Man with the Golden Arm, Laura, Advise and Consent. He was one of the few directors that could handle serious subject matter with style and grace without becoming preachy and maudlin.<br />\\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is one of his best: perfect, spot-on casting, eloquent screenplay, truthful performances, and gorgeous black and white photography. Jimmy Stewart, who seemed to be able to realistically portray anyone from any era and social status, plays a small town lawyer hired to defend a soldier, Ben Gazarra for murdering a man accused of raping his wife, Lee Remick. Gazzara and Remick are first rate but it is a non-actor, real judge Joseph N. Welch who almost steals the movie away from all three principals, which only proves that Preminger was a smart cookie...a smart cookie, indeed.

It's the story of a young and sexually repressed woman of the British upper class who is unhappily married to a paralyzed husband. She encounters a gamekeeper on her estates whose scandalous attentions awaken her senses. This BBC production is technically flawless and hallmarked with beautiful outdoor scenes, authentically detailed indoor sets, brilliant acting, and outstanding direction.

0385504209|1.0|Da Vinci' code for Catholic bashing<br />Our Sunday Visitor // Amy Welborn<br />08 June 2003<br />Who says that Catholicism doesn't influence American culture? The number one best-selling fiction title in the nation, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (Doubleday, $25) has \\"Catholic\\" on practically every page. Granted, the word is usually awfully close to words like \\"repressive,\\" \\"patriarchal,\\" and \\"brutal,\\" but you have to take what you can get.<br />Or do you?<br />Since its release in March, the book has surprised many by becoming a best seller. The word on the street is that it's an \\"intelligent thriller,\\" challenging the reader's mind with a suspenseful plot, but also with lots of culture and learning.<br />But \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is neither learned nor challenging - except to the reader's patience. Moreover, it's not really suspenseful, and the writing is shockingly banal, even for genre fiction. It's a pretentious, bigoted, tendentious mess, and the uniformly positive press - including a rave in The New York Times and a fawning National Public Radio interview with author Dan Brown - should give us serious pause.<br />But if you think you might like a book whose ultimate effect is something like Umberto Eco proudly presented by Fox Network, here's the plot, such as it is:<br />(Be warned, there are \\"spoilers\\" ahead. A book this bad deserves to be spoiled, but if you don't want to know what happens, stop reading now.)<br />A curator at the Louvre is murdered in a gallery, but before he dies, he manages to leave clues and arrange his body in a significant way. His cryptologist granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, and a visiting American academic, Robert Langdon, whose specialty is religious symbolism, are drawn into the case and discern that Grandpere Sauniere was trying to leave a message - not about his killer, but about a Big Secret.<br />Catholic conspiracy<br />Sauniere was part of an ancient secret society called the Priory of Sion, for centuries charged with protecting the Big Secret. The Big Secret threatens to disrupt Life As We Know It. Naturally, the Catholic Church has spent the last thousand years making sure that it doesn't get out.<br />So, what's the Big Secret? Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, who was pregnant when He was crucified. Their child's descendents are still alive, anonymous and protected by the Priory.<br />The Priory is also the guardian of the real true faith Jesus and Mary Magdalene wanted passed on: the celebration of the \\"sacred feminine .\\"<br />The Da Vinci Code, then, is the story of the big race to reach the Holy Grail - which turns out to be not the chalice of the Last Supper but the remains of Mary Magdalene, mostly.<br />Sophie and Langdon race against the Church, primarily represented by an albino Opus Dei adherent taking directions from a bishop and mysterious \\"Teacher.\\"<br />They race from clue to clue left by Sophie's code-loving Grandfather, puzzles left everywhere from the Bank of Zurich to the Church of Saint-Sulpice to Westminster Abbey to the paintings of Leonardo DaVinci.<br />Da Vinci, the story goes, portrayed his devotion to the Holy Grail of the sacred feminine into his Last Supper. The figure at Jesus' right is not a male, but Mary Magdalene, who is his partner in the gospel of the sacred feminine.<br />Same old lies<br />Hardly any of this background is original. Most of it is derived directly from the fantasy-disguised-as-history work \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail,\\" and the rest of it is cobbled from other bits of well-worn and risible nuggets of esoteric and Gnostic conspiracy theories.<br />Brown's treatment of the Roman Catholic Church is unoriginal as well. He uncritically repeats, among many other lies and distortions, the canard that the Church was responsible for killing five million accused witches during the medieval period.<br />And, I bet you didn't know the divinity of Jesus Christ thing was invented by the Emperor Constantine as a way of shoring up his power:<br />&quot;'My dear....until that moment in history, Jesus was viewed by His followers as a mortal prophet....a great and powerful man, but a man nevertheless. A mortal.'<br />\\"`Not the Son of God?'<br />\\"`Right.' Teabing said. `Jesus' establishment as `the Son of God' was officially proposed and voted on by the Council of Nicaea.'<br />`Hold on. You're saying Jesus' divinity was the result of a vote?'&quot;<br />Whoa, dude!<br />You get the picture.

B00009UW0N|5.0|If there is one movie you do not want to watch by yourself on halloween night with every light in the house turned off, its Halloween. Possibly the most eerie movie ever made. When me and my good friend were 10, we watched this movie exactly 11 times in 5 days. If that didn't tell you just how good it is, let me go into detail. The acting was the best. Jamie Lee Curtis really knows how to get scared without actually being scared. The movie was filmed at the right time. The colors were awesome. At night there was this midnight blue sort of shade casting down on the characters. At day it just had the Halloween feel to it. By that I mean there were dead leaves on the ground, peoples houses had jack-o-lanterns on them, and there were trick-or-treaters running around. Micheal Myers was not really scary when it showed him doing nothing, but he was freaky when he was trying his best to catch people. Micheal was doing more of a new scary movie thing, he was walking slowly and calmly, he hid in the dark where nobody could see him until he slowly appeared in the shadow and grabbed his prey. I hope I encouraged you to buy this wonderful movie. If you don't have it, and I encouraged you to buy it, go for the \\"Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition.\\" That edition is the best.
B0000AM6LY|2.0|Going back many years , Simply Red was fresh and new. Another listen to those old albums makes Home even more disappointing. His voice is amazing and unique, the jazzy undertones are almost enough to breath some life into this dull collection, but none of it pulls together. <BR>I just can't recomend this album, as it is so deeply flawed by a complete lack of imagination. The exception is Sunrise, a sample mix with a dance beat. This is almost representative of what they Could be doing-but even Sunrise is not fully up to par. There are weak moments in the song that remind one of the rest of this album. So many artists these days who might be considered &quot;adult contemporary&quot; seem to have fallen asleep at the microphones...Give 'em a cople of shots of espresso, and whatever else requires inspiration. Listen to some of the great new young talents like Jason Mraz, Ben Taylor, or even Dido-while she may not be the most original, she makes great tunes. And for my $15 bucks I at the very least want some good tunes...<br />Final Verdict-I won't throw it away, but it won't get much airtime for me either.
B000002KYH|4.0|This CD recorded in 1982 is still<BR>great when Rod still had it.<BR>The CD is missing the Great Pretender which is no big loss<BR>but also I'll Guess I Will Always Love You<BR>which is a minor loss. So if you like the older Rod stuff<BR>it is worth buying. This is a real live CD not touched up<BR>so it is not perfect but still is Rod's best live CD.
B00005YW4H|5.0|One of my all-time favorite jazz albums, Come Away With Me is sweet and sultry... The arrangements are simple but the music is compelling and her voice is inviting and wonderful.  Highly recommended...
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido is a fantastic artist! Her songs are great. You'd think that &quot;Thank you&quot; would be hard to follow and although that may be true in the case of singles alone, overall this album proves that statement wrong. &quot;Life for rent&quot; is a lot like &quot;No angel&quot; and so the 4 million people in the US and the 6 million others that bought her album can buy this expecting the same thing from Dido. Whether it's pop (Life for rent) or new age (White Flag-first single from this album) every single is great in it's own way. Every song is so sweet, serene, and soothing that this album is also something for all Enya and Enigma fans. &quot;No Angel&quot; always manages to be in the Vh1's \\"All time greatest albums\\" list and it deserves it-not just because of the album itself but also because of the artist, Dido. And that makes &quot;Life for rent&quot; just as good. Dido sticks to her music; she doesn't try to do what many other musicians have done, i.e. experiments gone wrong. If you're still not convinced look at this way. Even bad boy rapper Eminem couldn't resist loving Dido's sweet tender songs!
B00006CXXU|3.0|I was completely unimpressed with this album at first, which was surprising after all the good reviews it received.  So I listened to it again.  And again.  Until I figured it out.<br />First, you have to accept that this album carries a strong feminist message, and Christina's producers don't try to hide it.  It's one of those cases where the artist's managers decide: \\"OK, we are working for a certain audience here, and we hope we sell enough copies to that particular audience, and we realize that there are people who will probably hate this record, but hopefully it won't affect us.\\"  And they accomplished exactly that.  This album will first and foremost appeal to women.  Even more so it will appeal to young women, especially those who feel insecure, unappreciated and mislabeled by today's standards.  That doesn't mean that an adult male with an open mind will not enjoy this album.  He might.  But this product wasn't put out for you guys.<br />Despite Christina's vocal talent and pretty good production value of this album, if you disagree with this record's messages, which are delivered somewhat over the top, you will not find this CD worth owning.  The fact that Lil Kim was invited to deliver the punches in Can't Hold Us Down only stresses that this album will please those who were predisposed to like it and upset those who weren't.  When Lil Kim tries to decide what should be considered promiscious and what shouldn't, we know something is wrong.<br />Let's move on to what else this album has, aside from politics.  Well, the good news is that it still has pretty good radio-pop-megahit value.  Both Dirrty and Fighter are excellent songs with top quality intrumentals, despite being typical (music video) material and overplayed in clubs.  Infatuation is a Spanish-flavored ballad which also came out pretty well, and Get Mine, Get Yours is an interesting track about casual ..., provocative, guilty and pleasant.<br />Another obligatory mention is Beautiful.  I personally don't like the song, because it tries so hard to be empowering that it comes out cheesy, not to mention how overplayed it is on the radio and (tv).  Finally, if you're curious about the collaboration with Alicia Keys, it is simply weak.  The two young female singers definitely have a bigger potential than the mellow and lacking track they delivered in this album.<br />I give Stripped three stars because a) many people will like it, and b) you have to give Christina at least that.  She has a lot of potential, and I hope her next album will carry less commercial propaganda to woo the female audience and more true Christina Aguilera using her voice and producing beautiful music to capture the mega audience that Whitney and Mariah used to have, because she deserves that.  For now, her work is Stripped of true substance, as she remains limited to her current fan base, not too different from rappers who make songs about arousing women by objectifying them on the dance floor and then pouring Cristal on them.
B000084T18|5.0|this is one of the greatest cds ive ever heard
B00000JLWW|1.0|Titanic is, quite possibly, the single most disappointing moment in motion picture history. And I've sat through most of Leslie Nielsen's pictures, so I know what I'm talking about.<br />Jack is a penniless artist who wins his passage home to the States in a poker game. Rose is a spoilt upper-class socialite, who is being forced into a loveless marriage in order to avoid financial bankruptcy. The Titanic is a magnificent ocean liner, more opulent than many palaces, more diverse than many cities. Thus the scene is set for the greatest romantic epic of all time.<br />Except, somewhere between Rose and her Hat stepping out of the taxi at the dock, and Jack getting made over in Kathy Bates's husbands' old Tuxedo, it all goes horribly, horribly wrong, and what we are left with is over three hours of terrible acting, overstated sentimentality, and really, really cringeworthy melodrama.<br />The problem with Titanic is that the Boat is the true star of the picture, and to this end, the movie works well, with some beautifully realised shots of a very convincing ocean liner. Strange, then, that the idiot writers decided to tack on a mawkish and simplistic poor-boy-meets-rich-girl 'human interest' story, the mundanity of which unfortunately eclipses the majesty of Cameron's direction and colours the entire mood of the film. Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet are very fine actors (see 'What's eating Gilbert Grape?' and 'Sense and Sensibility' for proof of that) but their capibilities are lost in a terrible script that mixes contemporary dialogue with unrealistic period situations and the whole performance never quite manages to be realistic or believable.<br />A doomed love story in a historically epic situation could have been a masterpiece, but instead, thanks to the Hollywood Machine's endless underestimation of the intelligence levels of their moviegoing public, 'Titanic' descends into something embarrassing and over-long. It could have been so good, but it's not. Simple as that. For blockbuster romantic epics, check out 'Gone With The Wind', 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Chinatown'. For an exercise in how to jazz up a half-baked script with some lovely special effects, get 'Titanic'. But remember, it's more than three hours of your life that you'll never get back.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|when i watched this i didn't know what to expect. well i liked it. it was a cool movie. seth green , charlize theron , mos def , and edward norton all had great performances. it was supposed to be fun. it excelled on that part.
B00005JLYW|2.0|Attacking \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" is a bit like shooting secret agents in a barrel; there's just not a lot of sport in it because it's way too easy to do.<br />Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore return as the giggly, jiggly trio who, we're supposed to believe, are amazing, expert crime fighters.  About the only way this material stands even a chance of succeeding is if the filmmakers treat it like some over-the-top, live action cartoon (or is it video game?) - which is pretty much what they've done.  Unfortunately, it turns out to be a cartoon almost totally devoid of wit, creativity and charm.  The plot mainly consists of finding ways to get the girls into campy costumes and situations.  Thus we have the angels as nuns, the angels as welders, the angels as exotic dancers.  The problem is that this cutesiness wears awfully thin after awhile, especially since that is pretty much all the screenplay manages to come up with in the way of entertainment.<br />The stunt sequences - which consist mainly of tedious slow-motion shots of the girls flipping through the air, karate-chopping the bad guys and dodging bullets - are so excessive in nature that we begin to understand what a detrimental effect \\"The Matrix\\" (however inadvertently) has had on filmmaking in the past few years.  When any physical action - no matter how contrary to the laws of physics and gravity - is possible, how are we supposed to care what happens to the people involved?  If no one seems to be in any real danger, all possible suspense is eliminated and we are left admiring the work of the special effects team and very little else.  The \\"Charlie's Angels\\" films are not alone in this regard, but they do serve as handy warning signs of the potentially debilitating effect of this trend on the future of action movies.<br />About halfway through the film, Jaclyn Smith, one of the angels from the original TV series, shows up to dispense some veteran advice to one of our intrepid little cherubs.  Though long past her prime, Smith is so goddess-y beautiful in her brief moments on screen that, not only does she outclass all three of the leading players, but she makes us, heaven forbid, even feel a twinge of nostalgia - however faint - for the original series.  Frankly, I didn't think that was possible.  Credit the makers of this fiasco for achieving at least that much with their film.bs.

B00005221M|3.0|Great film, if you get it in the right format. I ordered this DVD through one of the &quot;New and Used&quot; distributors on Amazon and what I received was not the edition listed here. When ordering, make sure you are buying the 2002 Enhanced Widescreen issue of this film. If the date on the case is 2001, keep looking. Earlier versions are disapointing, with poor sound quality, a grainy picture and a less-than-full widescreen. The one I received also has absolutely no extras, although the case claims it has a theatrical trailer. Make sure you get the right version to appreciate this film for what it is.
B00007LL7O|3.0|If you have heard (and loved) Visions or Episone, youre not going to find nothing new on this album, but more self indulgent guitar/keyb solos(Stratofortress), and an older and a little bit exhausted voice(example, Learnig to Fly) of Kotipelto. <BR>Good songs: Eagleheart, Soul of a Vagabond, Find your Own Voice, Fantasia and Learning To Fly.(I expected some more of &quot;Elements&quot;)<BR>Although this album is not excellent(nor disapointing), some songs fit in the all time Strato-clasics.<BR>Maybe this album is just for huge Strato fans.
6304696566|3.0|The Searchers is as much a visual masterpiece as it is a work of story-telling art. A classic John Wayne, John Huston team up that's as interesting just to look at as it is to follow.<br />If you're looking for a lot of extras on this DVD, you won't find them here. Picture and sound are high-quality, though, and do justice to this artsy-looking masterpiece. A good solid addition to any DVD collection.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna has done, in fact, besides this album, I only own Music and Ray of Light. I liked this album from the first time I heard it (unlike the other 2 albums which had to grow on me). No, Madonna does not have spectacular vocal skills nor is she a master lyricist, but she does have a raw edge on this album that does not seem contrived. The lyrics seem very personal and the vocals vulnerable, which adds to the appeal of the album. Some of the other reviews I have read put down the fact that Madonna sings about troubles she had growing up and various problems as an adult - don't discount someones history just because they are now rich. My favorite tracks are Nobody Knows Me, Love Profusion and I'm So Stupid. Don't listen to this cd expecting typical Madonna - you won't get it. But do take it as a stand alone work not to be compared to previous work.
