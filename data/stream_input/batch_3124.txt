B0053KWDES|5.0|I purchased this to solve the well known problem with low audio output from the Nintendo 3DS/XL. Now I can listen to the game music/sound effects at a proper listening level. The bass boost also puched up the weak low end nicely! Audio is clean and balanced without any distortion or hiss. If it can make this quiet device shine, it can work with anything! Nice affordable solution for underpowered devices. Recommended!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Very good movie with the action, climax and spectacle occuring early on, but the after effects kinda dragged on and on.  Denzel polished and believable as always.  Would watch (only) the action scene again...well done.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|It,s alright but without the free version you can't do anything with your deck. At least you can do the campaign...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! So addictive. Everyone I know is playing. Fun colors and puzzles that make you think about your next move.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Awesome program, and lots of PROGRAMS available, not just games!  I'd recommend this to anyone who has an interest in getting into gaming, yet still wants an application with varied functionality!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel was very good in this movie. I wouldn't want to be on that plane though. Good effects and acting.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|WE GOT A BAD CD.  THE MOVIE STALLS OUT AND SKIPS.  I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT BUT WE DIDN'T OPEN IT AND PLAY IT RIGHT AWAY.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE WE LOVE THIS MOVIE AND WANTED TO ADD IT TO OUR COLLECTION.
B003204MQS|4.0|There aren't many scary movies anymore that give me the creeps, but this is one of them.  I love the story line through the series of these films.  I love the twists and turns in them also.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Alice in chains is one of the best bands ever. This Is a great album. Wish they were still making music.
1423101464|5.0|Thanks for this purchase.  The item was for a birthday gift.  This purchase was delivered in a timely fashion and was well received by the birthday person.  Thanks.
B002CMXAYW|4.0|Funny. A great spoof on rock bands of the day. Rob rieiner did a great job on this movie. Can you guess who the singer is?
1423101472|5.0|Great birthday gift.  The birthday individual was very surprised and happy for this gift.  I would highly recommend this item.  The item was delivered in a timely matter.  Thank you.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|It started with the tone of an adventure, which drew me in. Then, as more and more of Alma's story immerged, it gave me insight into lives of some women in her time while at the same time impressing and enlightening me as to how botanical knowledge grew - hers was a different kind of adventure. Only halfway through, but I'm sure the rest of the book will not disappoint.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I a m a big John Grisham fan.  I like his books for what they are, entertainment of a light nature.  This certainly fills the bill.  &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; is my favorite of his books and I enjoyed the chance to spend time with Jake Brigance and the Clanton characters again.  The book's premise is interesting but the ultimate resolution is a little too easy to see coming.  But it could be I have read the author so long, I know how he plots and thinks.  Count me as a long time fan who was not disappointed.  Entertaining for sure though not among his very best.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|This Superman in my opinion is far better than any of the Superman movies released in recent years ( I will admit the Return of Superman was very good but this actor brings the serious side of Superman to light, similar to the comic books and cartoons).<br /><br />Yes, the one's with Christopher Reeve especially # 2 was good. However, the special effects and story line are just super and where this movie should be in 2013. Much like Star Trek into Darkness and Ironman # 3, the story line, action and sci-fi are really just excellent!<br /><br />I agree with the majority that this movie should get the respect it deserves with actors like Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, etc etc... This movie you could literally watch every week just like Ironman 3 and Star Trek 2. For some reasons all the part 2's and part 3's are far better than even the first one's.<br /><br />This movie is really just the best written script on Superman- period! I mean to see Superman beat the hell out of Zod (finally) is just awesome!<br /><br />I say watch and enjoy!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good to see some old characters and the next step in life.  Classic Grisham!  No spoilers here.  I read the book over one weekend, couldn't put it down. I was sorry to see it end.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I am enjoying reading all of her books.  I wasn't crazy about the ending - but love the way she writes.  The books are so relaxing and intriguing at the same time.
0062502182|4.0|This is a very good read by one of the most popular Brazilian writers.  He gives us lots of think about
B00ARF92HK|3.0|entertaining B movie.  Not great art by any stretch.  But if you've got time to kill, go for it.  Nothing else to say -Is this 19 words yet?
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This is a story of a young very poor boy in Africa who studied largely on his own and was able to develop a major new source of energy for his village which had a big impace.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad you finally got it for the kindle!!! It was one of my favorite games and one that my whole family enjoys
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Does exactly what it is designed to do. I have a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. I take my air on trips now instead of the pro. So much easier to lug around. The only issue is not all hotels have wifi in the rooms yet. Some day hopefully all the hotels will get on board.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has everything it is definitely worth while and deserving of your attention. I love everything about this book
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Love the perspective the book is written in.  I was drawn in with the first page!  This historical fiction is a great read.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Was happy to get this product.  I look forward to being able to use it.  It will be attached to my laptop case for use when I am traveling
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|I find the book well-written, clear, easy to read, up-to-date, covering well most of the CSS topics on levels from beginner to advanced. As a hobby web-designer, I worked with CSS before, but because I do not work with it daily or even regularly, I needed repetition and completion of my knowledge. The book fulfilled my needs perfectly well.<br />I would appreciate even more information on the responsive design, but this topic is still a bit new, so perhaps it will be elaborated on  more in the next version of the book.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|It is a fun app- I like the different looks.  I am not completely certain what I am doing the picture seems to turn upside down everytime I save it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am a Candy Crush Junkie.  I wake up at 5:00 am to play, and I play every night before I go to sleep.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I Loved the book, sad to see it go but , happy it will continue on in some way! Looking forward to the series continuing with other characters
1476727651|5.0|All I can say is awesomeness! Again GO Stephen King! I just love Clive Baker, King and Koontz! And had a reasonably priced!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can not wait until the next chapter comes out. A delightfully entertaining puzzle game. I stayed up way too late trying to solve this!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two. This one was awful. The ending was so unnecessary. Save your money, party people. Skip it!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was slow and did not live up to the standard the first 2 books set.  I anticipated the release very much and downloaded the very day it came out, but unfortunately, it didn't deliver.
B002ZG974M|5.0|Everyone from 9 days to 90 years should watch this!  Even if you aren't  a &#34;kid person&#34; the example of different cultures, different ways of life and how similar we really are all is beautiful.  The music is lovely as well!  A perfect baby shower gift.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was a frustrating read for me because of the way the characters behaved.  It seemed that the whole time I was reading, I wanted to reach through the pages and shake some sense into them.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A great page turner.  Hosseini continues his brilliance with this book. Not yet done but reading now. I love it.
0061733199|5.0|This book is incredible.  It has everything.  I put it in a ziplock bag and put it right inside my survival kit. I won't go into all the features it has, and it would be easier to list the things that aren't in this book.  If you are ever in a survival or emergency situation, you're going to be glad you own a copy of this book.  One of my favorite features were several color illustrations of various common plants, mushrooms, reptiles, and fish to help you identify which are dangerous and which are edible.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|While I LOVED the first 2 books the last book was the biggest disappointment I've had in quite a while. The whole book felt rushed and disjointed. I felt like the last book was just Veronica trying to justify an ending that she wanted from the beginning even if it no longer fit. It was an \\"I do what I want\\" moment with no consideration for her loyal readers. I also felt extremely lied to to find out that she told publishers when she submitted Divergent that this was how it would end (of course publishers told her don't tell anyone people wont like it) They were right. The way this book ends made 0 sense! All the characters have to do things completely out of their nature in order for it to come to fruition.  It's like u spent the first two books being told.....this is who they are. Then in Allegiant the author decided.....screw it forget what I told you in the first two books....they actually act like this....and my reasoning is ....just because!  She makes events happen at the end that make are completely againstthe character's natures but she gives you no reason why their natures suddenly change. She even sends people on random missions to do NOTHING. For no apparent reason other than bc if they didnt her ending would never be able to come to fruition.  When this book ends you are left feeling nothing but confusion and loss. If u love the first two books in the series,  do NOT read Allegiant. ...u would be better off to make up ur own ending.
1250030951|5.0|I heard such good things about this book, so despite the fact I thought it was YA and I don't read YA, I read it. The good things were true. And I don't think it is YA.<br />We meet twins Cath and Wren as they start their freshman semester at the same college. But Wren doesn't want to live with Cath, she wants her own experiences. Cath is at a loss with all the changes. She is also obsessed with writing fan fiction for Simon Snow, a Harry Potter like fictional character. She has quite a following and this was something she and Wren both loved to do. But Wren is hanging out with new friends, going to bars, dating guys. Cath is nervous around her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend, and doesn't want to go to the student cafeteria much less go to bars. So she sticks to what she knows.<br />There is also the issue of their dad who is bipolar. The girls have taken care of him since their mom left years ago. Cath worries that he isn't taking care of himself, worries about her sister's drinking.<br />Rowell really brings depth to her characters; she made me care about them. I wasn't bored with the story. It didn't seem like a done there, read that book. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Awesome player, plays movies good sound and video quality on most types read by androids, and it is very user friendly
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Best Bond movie of the Daniel Craig era. Plenty of action, drama, and suspense. Great movie for fans of the Connery-era Bond films as well as the more recent ones.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Do not read this book because you were told it's for animal or dog lovers. The narrator hates who he is (a dog) and longs desperately to be human. He also looks forward to being reincarnated as a human because that is the next step up. This novel is written with the very archaic viewpoint of animals being less evolved than, subservient to, and jealous of people. I did not feel that I was inside the mind of a dog; I felt that I was inside the mind of a man who, instead of taking the time to truly envision what it would be like to be a dog, envisioned what it would be like to be a human trapped in a dog's body.<br /><br />That being said, the book is an adequate story about a man struggling with adversity, and the parallels between life and car racing. It was a decent read, aside from a few issues:<br />The symbolism and motifs are well conceived... but then the author feels the need to explicitly point them out each time.<br />You don't develop a strong bond with any of the characters, so it's difficult to become emotionally invested in what happens to them.<br />There is an inconsistency between the beginning and the end, which, if you are a stickler for details, is hard to move past.<br /><br />Read this book if you enjoy racing. Read this book if you want a story about a man and his family dealing with difficult circumstances - it has many of your classic &#34;man versus ___&#34; conflicts that create drama. Read this book if you have creationist leanings or would be intrigued by a story that illustrates why dogs would rather be human. Or read this story if you find that you sometimes miss the nuances of symbolism and subtext and would like a little help along the way.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Action starts in the first 9 minutes and continues until the end.  Good movie.  I would have liked a different ending but overall it was entertaining.
0811879542|5.0|This book is really interactive and fun. And, it is also good for helping my kids learn how to follow directions.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of Grisham's best reads with a great twist at the very end. Highly recommend if you enjoy reading Grisham.
0142403873|5.0|I saw a little girl on Halloween dressed as the Gruffalo and she was so excited that I knew what she was. This book is so clever and funny. And, it is really fun to read. I love the lesson at the end, that wit wins out in the end.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm still a fan of the series. But I don't like how Veronica Roth chose to end the story. I understand it, I just don't like it.
0142501123|5.0|My kids love this book and I love reading it to them. In fact, we read it so much I may need to purchase another copy, as ours is thrashed!! Julia Donaldson is so clever!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The title says it all. Concise ,on target  and No Ads makes it easy to use and to appreciate....and it is free.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I got this app because it had really good reviews and now that Iv had the app I can see why it works so good I recommend you get it!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It made me cry and that means I was involved, and that's what makes a great book.  It also made me think about my relationships.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|this is a very cool game I mean really why I think this is because it has lots of planes full of fun
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Useful information! Interestingly, when I applied the information from this book into my life I found a totally new world! I was fully amazed during a staff meeting of my company by applying the information inside this book. Really practical and easy to learn.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Enjoyable<br />We enjoy law practice show.  This one particular show  very good and the language is clean, suitable for family viewing.
0374530718|3.0|my rating i gave it a three was because i didn't like the book not becauzse there was anything wrong with it.
B0031R5K68|4.0|It's probably not Dan Brown's best book. But it's still capable of giving you an urge to keep on reading. Just not as good as Angles and demons, but that's probably because A&D is that great. Worth it, buy if you can, probably worth having in your collection.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Great writing. Very interesting way of telling a story. Really loved the characters. I felt like I was back in the 70's in NYC!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|It's so convenient for the shed. I have no electricity there, so now I don't have to worry about taking a flashlight out with me when I get my pellets at night.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|CORNY BUT AWESOME! Very entertaining! Predictable, but well done , I want to know how everyone is such a bad shot except the good guys?
B00G9B1MEM|1.0|This app would be great if I could get it to work. After I finish each game it freezes and I have to shut it off to play again. Tried to reinstall the app with the same results.
B00FWB5G1K|5.0|exquisite composition from the swedish gods of prog.  yet another offering from the fk's i look forward to growing on me.<br />and yes, i am embellishing a bit, but i love these guys, have seen them many times, met as well. i also love the message of the album - wake up! you're the ones in control, but if you choose not to decide, you've still made a choice. sorry, couldn't help the rush reference, prog fan and what have you :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|game works great. It is more fun than Bejewel 2. I like the extra bonuses you get. I don't mind getting stuck on a level.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, mainly because Denzel is such a great actor.  But it is exciting and worth a view.
B00G32OMF8|1.0|Watched maybe 45 minutes with about three screen changes and lots of sparring dialogue.  Maybe screenwriter issues?  Turned it off, kissed $4 goodbye.
B00932ANQM|3.0|If I were a woman this would probably get 4 stars, but I'm not so it's just okay.  Recommend for anyone who wants to watch something for their girlfriend.
0143124838|4.0|As a TV personality, journalist and sometime model, Alexa Chung’s unique style launched her to celebrity status and inspired a generation of young women to embrace the obscure “indie” movement. When Mulberry named a handbag after her, the “Alexa” became the new It bag. She was called up to guest star on Gossip Girl, seated front row beside the likes of Anna Wintour at Fashion Week, and, with the rise of social media, she became an Instagram and Twitter icon. She also became a new subject for the invasive paparazzi and a potential target for the tabloids. In her new book, It, Chung creates an anthology of her personal style evolution and opens up about who she is, in front of the camera as well as behind it. Combining her personal photos and drawings with classic snapshots of her style icons and short bursts of quirky anecdotes, It becomes Chung’s unique way of communicating to her friends and fans as she laughs at herself, celebrates her personal journey (the triumphs and pitfalls alike), and encourages her readers to embrace what makes them unique, whatever it is.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about It was the honesty with which Chung approached her life and image. In the world of fashion and celebrity, people could be quick to label a book about oneself as tasteless and vain, but Chung’s inimitable combination of self-deprecation and confidence are what make It work so well. Partly a study of the different loves that built her celebrated style, her narrative also manages to poke fun at the iconic status that’s been attributed to her, focusing instead on her very relatable feelings of awkwardness and vulnerability through the years. She sings the praises of her inspirations – everyone from Annie Hall to George Harrison to Jane Birkin to the Spice Girls – and chronicles her attempts, failed and successful, to emulate what she found so alluring about them. In this way, she encourages her fans of every age to find what speaks to them in style, art, and culture, and live in response to whatever feelings it evokes.<br /><br />Of personal heartbreak Chung writes openly, though not revealingly; this was something else I loved, as it demonstrated how to share what matters in a world vastly determined to perpetuate oversharing. Even writing briefly on the double-edged sword that is social media, her succinct and meaningful words struck an enjoyable chord. While on the surface It’s beautiful, artistic presentation makes for the perfect hipster coffee table book, the narrative and the book’s deeper nature are an opportunity for self-realization and insight. A catch-all of inspiration, It is as much a love letter to anyone who’s ever felt uncool as it is a celebration of what the world has labeled as Alexa Chung’s own infinite coolness.<br /><br />(Review © Casee Marie, originally published on November 7, 2013 at LiteraryInklings.com. A copy of the book was provided for the purpose of review.)
B004Q3UL56|3.0|What can I say?  It's an okay movie, keeps your attention but nothing to get too excited about.  Up to the viewer.
0761172726|5.0|I have bought this calendar for years (at least eight years).  It is choice for keeping track of everyone's schedule and appointments.  Although we are only a family of 4, the extra column at the end is useful for non-specific activities.  I don't know if I like the added pocket (in the last few years).  It tends to be a catch-all junk pocket.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|Got as a gift and my Beatle fan recipient is very happy to have it.  Brings back a lot of memories and it's a great tribute to George.
B003VANOFY|5.0|the best headphones i bought ever. its been a year and they still work like the 1st day i received them. i bought other headphones for my brother during the same time and similar prices and those other have all died!!! this one is still going strong!!!! the others i bought where the creative wireless wrath versions with 7.1 surround sounds, but did not last as long as these ones.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I hated the ending to this one! I loved the first two books immensely, but the ending of this book ruined the series for me. I was hoping Veronica Roth loved the characters as much as the readers do.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham, has done it again. Couldn't put it down,great reading. I have read all his books and enjoyed them all.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Downloaded this and must say it did clean up some files I did not even know I had. My kindle is running a little faster now. Give it a try it might better your system. I like it and will continue to use it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I like it, it helped me accomplish what I needed to do to post my resume which was very great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So easy to use, so sharp and anyone can hop on it as long as they're connected to our wifi! Love it and highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome replacement for regular cable or satellite.  Been using the Wii for Netflix and friends, but this is much better.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|Watched this for the second time and it still held up! Engaging from beginning to end! Ryan Gosling is great as always.
0385537131|5.0|JOHN DID A GREAT JOB, AS USUAL, ON THIS BOOK.  THE ENDING WAS FANTASTIC AND AS HE OFTEN DOES, JOHN GAVE THE READER A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CULTURE THAT WAS INVOLVED.  I HAVE READ ALL OF JOHN'S WORK AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO NOT HAVE TO ENDURE ANY PROFANE LANGUAGE.
0143116738|4.0|Excellent book and very inspiring. Enjoyed the stories of various success stories of others. My only disappointment was the lack of &#34;how to&#34; find your Element.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|In my kids words (they are the ones watching this show): &#34;best show ever&#34;. Just do not ask me why.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Very dissapointing ending. I kept waiting for something good to happen, but the book just dragged on. I was expecting so much more.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel was great. Good story, not what I expected when I sat down to watch it. Definetly a great movie
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I would recommend this book to any young adult or teenager who enjoys fast action books. It takes place in a futuristic dystopia and never lets you catch your breath before moving to the next thing. If you like dramatic romance mixed in, it's definitely perfect for you.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|One of his best novels! I always wondered what happened to Danny . Glad he turned out ok! I will never look at RV's the same again!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great album I liked every song. Epic intro and epic songs. Whoever is a fan of FUN will really enjoy this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me reading to find out what happens next.  So much action packed into such an amazing novel! Definitely recommend!
0812550706|5.0|Im only 9 years old and I love to read and I just finished reading the book yesterday and I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So, so good.  A heartfelt and lovely story for young adults or any adult.  A truly great lesson can be learned from this book.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I really love the album. Lana Del Rey's voice is so beautiful. Her music is amazing. Its a great price too!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Love It. It's so easy to use. I can download my reading material very easy. I would recommend it .
B004EF65QA|3.0|It was an okay story.  Some of the stories I have recently read, I didn't want to end, but this one not so much.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I don't like all the bad language in a movie.  You don't have to use the F word everytime you speak.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|Breathtaking. A friend -- who is now banished into lack of an intelligent opinion purgatory -- told me two years ago that this novel was not worth the time so I neglected it. The movie was wonderful so I gave the novel a stab and it rewarded right away. Sonmi is one of the greatest characters I have ever encountered. I am really looking forward to Mitchell's other work as a result of this gloriously refreshing bath in the sacred waters of a well crafted novel. Do yourself a favor and get started with this great novelist right away.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I can spend hours playing with this simple, pointless little thing. Not worth cash because you can make it yourself with an afternoon of free time, but I got it free.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I got a kick out of this album, I've been listening to it a lot, no one does pissed off better.
B00358ESI4|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. It is a little graphic but the characters were very convincing.  The movie depicts the struggles of the soldiers and the families at home.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Simple and Good app for the Kindle Fire to manage pictures.  Easy to use and serves my purposes very well.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great series...a MUST READ for everyone.  Teens can't get enough of this series.  Can't wait for more from Veronica Roth.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|The doll is adorable, and smells so sweet.  It is the perfect size for my 1-year-old granddaughter to cuddle.  I would definitely recommend this doll for a first baby doll.
B008K93302|5.0|Push, pull up vids, play. Perfect! I load my own files, so having control is important… and ease of use is, well, preferred. This is the one I chose to keep!
B00G32TD98|5.0|Suspenseful and scary beyond belief!  This movie keeps you on the EDGE of your seat and the fact that it is based on true events makes it that much more exciting!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Simple, works, bam… and free. Some ad info may be on the bottom, but easily ignored (or reviewed). Easy to use and gosh,  too great not to, they before you purchase something &#34;better.&#34;
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|One of the greatest films ever made, this is a vivid time capsule of London in the swinging sixties and --at the risk of sounding pretentious-- a superb intro to philosophy. Sound and vision. Alas! I do have a criticism of the 2004 DVD. There's something wrong with the audio, it's impossible to increase the volume past 'medium'. This is odd. I don't want to watch it 'full blast' but don't see why one is forcibly confined to 'medium'. Anyway, I think the philosophical approach would be not to not buy it, but rather to be aware that it's an issue. If Warner can fix this in a future DVD that'd be great.
B004GYY714|5.0|Listened to local radio stations while a couple thousand miles away on the Kindle fire HD.<br />A basic page of stations by genre, and yup, there was WXRT for news and tunes from home while a long way away. This is a smart cure for homesick travelers, you who are on the road (thanks CS&N) and students jonesin' for a favorite station or sound. LOVE!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is a great way to take books with you to any place you want with out the weight of the book and the damage of pages. It is very user friendly and very fast to download. The customer service department in fantastic!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Awesome picture quality and great audio. Enjoyed watching it again even though I have watched this movie several times earlier.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Good app! 😄😃😀😊☺️😉😍😘😚😗😙😜💛💙💜💚❤️💔💗💕💖💞💘 it is a very good app and I like it a lot. It is a little different from the apple one tho
B00ERIUO02|5.0|The long-awaited third album by Katy is her BEST yet! Invest in the Deluxe Version, you'll be glad you did! It's Fun, Sexy, Cheeky, Clever, Heartfelt and Deeply Personal! You will love it, the very first time you listen! EVERY song is a potential hit! You can't say that about her prior work. I have to tell you, Katy had a lot to live up to, although she said she wasn't trying to outdo herself, well, she just did!<br /><br />Track synopsis:<br /><br />1. Roar*. A new anthem about female empowerment. We've all heard it. Even my elderly friend knew this one! Love the video, so cute, colorful and clever! The album's FIRST #1 song! (hear that GaGa?)<br /><br />2. Legendary Lovers*. Wishing for that great love. Like those of legend, like Cleopatra. Love the tribal chant. &#34;Aah, ooh&#34;!<br /><br />3. Birthday*. The first song I really gravitated toward. Listen closely to its subliminal message, it's not about treating him like every day's his birthday! The &#34;love child&#34; of California Gurls and Peacock! lol. Cheeky, fun and bouncy! &#34;So let me get you in your birthday suit. It's time to bring out the big balloons!&#34; (I can already see all the balloons coming out of her top from behind-!)  A great song of celebration for the New Year. The 3rd release. Hear that Katy?<br /><br />4. Walking on Air*. It's an instant club hit! Simple and infectious, a feeling of ecstasy in the ultimate love! (do I hear a Mariah note in the bridge?) Katy was said to emulate the queens of the 90's (like CeCe).<br /><br />5. Unconditionally*. As of this writing, her current release destined to become the album's 2nd #1 hit! Accepting someone for whom they are. &#34;Acceptance is the key to be totally free. Will you do the same for me?&#34; Words to live by, wish I'd heard them sooner!<br /><br />6. Dark Horse* (feat. Juicy J). Enticing! I have to tell you, I didn't like this one at first, now I absolutely love it! A Hip Hop dream! Even the rap is clever and enjoyable. &#34;Once you're mine, there's no goin' back.&#34; I guess she's gonna get you with this one just like the familiar phrase implies. The song all of America is gravitating toward. (the 4th release?, if not 3rd)<br /><br />7. This is How We Do*. A face paced clever, cheeky hit! The Song of the Summer 2014, so move over Miley! The ultimate party song. &#34;It's NO BIG DEAL&#34;...Tamer than, but not unlike Last Friday Night/TGIF...&#34;suckin' real bad at 'Mariah Careyoke&#34;, lol! Ill bet Mariah's lovin' that!...&#34;Uh huh, I see you!&#34; lol I laugh every time! (release #6, just in time for summer-?)<br /><br />8. International Smile*. THE stand out of the album for me! Great bass line, totally infectious! I dare you to listen to it just once!OMG, listen closely. It's actually about an international flight attendant friend of Katy's who gets everyone to join the Mile High Club! lol<br /><br />9. Ghost. From my most favorite song, to my least favorite song. Actually, there's nothing wrong with it. It's a very poignant song about break up--by text! It reminds me of 'The One that Got Away', her first fall from #1 on &#34;Dream&#34;. Cleverly executed, as if it were a loss: &#34;Rest in peace, I'll see you on the other side.&#34; NOW she &#34;sees-thru&#34; him!<br /><br />10. Love Me*. I love this one! Loving yourself when the one you loved didn't give you the love and respect you deserve. (#5-?)<br /><br />11. This Moment. Learning to live in the moment by seizing the day. 'Thumpety'!<br /><br />12. Double Rainbow*. The unofficial title track, it's lyrically stunning! It's even sung with vulnerable emotion! Walking a like path through life with your soul mate. Although it applies to everyone, I see it as a big Gay Anthem during Pride. &#34;A double rainbow is hard to find...every step, I'm keeping you in mine&#34;.<br /><br />13. By the Grace of God. Very Powerful and Emotional! Oh My God. This song is autobiographical! What? We almost lost Katy? She survived a suicide attempt!&#34;I wasn't so tough, lying on the bathroom floor...I looked in the mirror and decided to stay. Wasn't gonna let love take me out, that way...Every morning, there is no more mourning.&#34; A very low key, piano driven, yet powerfully orchestrated song. A hard song for anyone who relates. One of her greatest songs ever! But, is it commercial?<br /><br />From the Deluxe Version: (a critic wrote that these are the most forgettable songs on the album, when they're the BEST!)<br /><br />14. Spiritual. WOW! This song is Magical and Spellbinding! I'm absolutely hooked! THE ultimate, most deeply spiritual relationship. Channeling her inner Sarah McLachlan! lol. Katy, &#34;you make me float&#34;! Will it be like 'A Part of Me' and become a separate release to get people to buy this extended version? (not to mention another #1 hit!)<br /><br />15. It Takes Two. Honest and vulnerable. Admitting it takes two to blame, and to apologize. Both of you have to want to work on a relationship. (Yeah, again--words of wisdom, too late! lol) Hmm--do you hear Kelly Clarkson on the bridge? lol<br /><br />16. Choose Your Battles. Wow--powerful! &#34;Why are you trying to make me your enemy? All I really need is a little peace. I just want to be your lover. Oh, this is not a competition, so baby why the ammunition? I don't want to be the last one standing. Choose your battles babe, then you win the war. Stop digging your own grave when there's so much to live for.&#34; Enough said. Words to live by. Even the music sounds like a back and forth battle. Great execution Katy! Love it--but is it too intensely personal to be a commercial hit?<br /><br />*denotes (future--hopeful) releases
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this game is awesome I count put it down when I got it when my kindle died I got so mad I was risen a darting car
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Pendergast is back in fine form.  I read this book in 2 days.  The action just keeps on coming.  I've read everything by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child and this is one of their very best.  If you've never read them you might be a little confused but not much.  It just makes you want to read the rest of them.  Go ahead and dive in - you won't regret it.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|nice to be able to watch a whole season over a week or two, rather than only once a week.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Started the Mistborn book sample and ordered the trilogy. Couldn't wait for it to get in the mail so I got the kindle matchbook version and read the whole book before it arrived in the mail.<br /><br />Very detailed! Very thought out. It has twists that you never expect. The ending even though predictable unfolds in a completely original way.<br /><br />Blown away. Can't wait to read the next books!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I already have one of these but this one as a gift. I have confidence that the receiver will have as much success as I have with this great little sharpener
0316322407|5.0|This is an amazing story and the price was excellent.  It is a favorite read and I have recommended it several times.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|gripping tale of Daniel Torrance's adult life and the challenges he is presented and how he overcomes them! Great read!!
006202406X|5.0|On the edge throughout. Actually felt a bit down turning the last page. . . but then any great story should leave you with many emotions, many conflicts and much thinking going on long after that last sentence.
B00488I8KE|5.0|Full and straight to your face assault from Motorhead! Better than motorizer and hammered (not bad albums but this one is very very good!). Heavy riffs, rock n roll groove and that feeling of raw power and mood to boost up a party are all here!<br />The more I listen to it, the more I like it!<br />Refrains that cannot leave your memory, very good sound and the three of them in a very inspiring time!<br />Thank u MOTORHEAD!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Constantly kept my attention, never a dull moment.  I might read it again right now!
B00EMGUT1I|4.0|Yes! Motorhead are back and still rockin hard. It is amazing after all these years they do not have a bad record.<br />Fresh riffs, thunderous sound and the groove! The bluesy influences appearing at least on two tracks.<br />Fast tracks and mid tempo rock n roll ones are all here. The recipe is unique and we love it!<br />Nice digipack edition. Push play once again!
B007TMON8M|4.0|Well, lets start. This app can be a major boredom buster, but then, after a few tries, I will get bored again. But dont get me wrong, this app has challenges that are fun to face and even better to achieve. So a final word from me: THIS APP IS VERY GOOD. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO YOUNGER CHILDREN, FOR FRUSTRATION ISSUES. THIS APP IS A GREAT PASSTIME, BUT I WOULD ONLY PLAY IT FOR 30 MINUTES AT MAX. I REALLY LIKE THIS APP, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ALL THOSE HARD LEVELS TO PASS.
B004H0M8EA|3.0|It is not the type of book that I want to start and finish all in the same day but it is okay.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragons. The most amazing, wonderful, powerful, awesome things to ever make it to fantasy. In this amazing app, you get dragons of all shapes and sizes to be at your service. This app is one of my personal favorites. The setup is perfect, allowing the player to do all sorts of things. The only problem with this game is the extra in game money. But guess what? These people fixed that problem as well! You can get this money by simply gifting it to your in game neighbors. And vise versa! So this game has everything to chase away boredom and keep the player hooked, waiting for more! So a final word from me: THIS APP HAS EVERYTHING FROM FIRE TO WATER. SHARE IT WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY, COMPARE DRAGONS, AND HOPE FOR RARE BREEDS TO APPEAR IN YOUR OWN GAME! GO HAVE FUN!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome show even if you don't like law you would enjoy this. The characters are great and the story is even better
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This app really did blow my breath away. I thought, oh, another free app. Cool, yay, move on with my life. But boy was I surprised! The graphics are absolutely perfect and the whole idea of this app has surely sent it skyrocketing! With so many animals to find, this game I can safely play for hours on end. Since the new update, this game got even MORE interesting! Release the animals back into the wild to save their kind! Brilliant! So a final word from me: AMAZING GRAPHICS. THIS APP IS A GREAT DEAL. PERFECT FOR EVERYONE, AND WILL BLOW YOU AWAY. VERY GOOD SET UP, AND GREAT IDEA FOR RELEASING. I AM ASSURED THAT THIS APP WILL GET A PRICE TAG SOON, SO GET IT WHILE ITS FREE. LOVE IT!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Two words: It sucks. Definitely NOT worth all the hype... I guess the females who read this and enjoy it have extremely high libido because it's like reading a porn and ehh.. I'm not up for that. The authors way of writing was high school level... It was boring and she kept repeating the same things over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was just perfect in the challenging sense. Not overly hard but not too easy either. Can't wait for more levels.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Read this in two days! It's actually a great little book. It kept my attention the whole time and it was very visual by the details. Sometimes it did not make sense but then you just have to play around with the words and the way the author wrote it. Other than that, best free book I've read so far! I'm glad I read it!
B007LGPSX0|5.0|How could you not love this  show? I've been a fan since I was in high school and still watch. It's better than the outrageous reality shows. I wish amazon would get the whole series to watch on prime!
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator app has big numbers, a large bright display, is easy to use and was<br />cheap.  What more needs to be said.
B000QE9ERK|3.0|Not very suspensful.<br />Easy to figure out the plot.<br />entertaining enough for a free movie.<br />Depp has done better work,
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|I'm a big fan of Angry Birds including the Star Wars game. But the free edition is so loaded with advertisements and junky video commercials it reminds me of watching TV. Charge me 2 bucks and keep the ads.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Just discovered this band recently and saw them in concert.  Hero is a great tune, but the whole album is great and satisfying.  Love it.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|Sorry, what a waste of material.  I would not buy this thing and if its free, I would throw it in the garbage.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm kind of jealous, in fact.  Mr. Howey is an excellent writer and tells an excellent story.  Thank you for writing this book, Mr. Howey.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|Insipid acting though great eye candy. One knows just where this is going after the first several scenes. The attempt to add a mystical element also falls flat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|better than temple run! gives more levels and more challenges than even subway runner and it has the awesome minions.  what's not to love?
B0063M22QO|3.0|This is a rather easy game. To easy really. But it is good when you do not want to think about your moves.
0061122416|5.0|This is a great book filled with simple wisdom for the child and the adult alike! This is a definite must-read!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminen has nothing left to prove to hip hop or the music world. 8 albums and 100 million records sold worldwide. And EMINEM just did 792,000 first week for the insanely dope \\" MMLP2\\" album. Men lie, women lie but numbers don't lie. Real music lives on over the garbage that the industry attempts to force upon consumers. This new album by EMINEM IS INCREDIBLE. After all these years and classic albums, EMINEM spits rhymes with sniper accuracy. Tracks like \\" RAP GOD\\" AND \\" LEGACY\\" is proof of his jaw dropping lyricism. The MARSHALL MATHERS LP II is a undeniable master piece. It is refreshing to hear a legend of hip hop with nothing left to prove create a album that is lyrically superior to everything else that's out there. Rick Rubin and Dr. Dre did a brilliant production job on this album. Stellar album by one of the all time greatest of hip hop. Salute and a round of applause to Mr. Mathers. The legend lives on!!!!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|As with<br /> all her novels, impeccably researched and gripping.<br />I'm thankful for Kindle' s dictionary as Ms Shriver' s vocabulary tests mine. I highly recommend this book for group discussion.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What an author.  I can't wait for the 3rd book in the series.  Where was I in history class when this was being discussed?  He made it so human.  I LOVED it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing!! It's one of the best books I have read. Would defiantly recommend to all my friends. Thank you E L James
B000R9RGF6|5.0|Awesome CD! Beautiful piano music. Heard one of the songs and loved it but the whole thing is good! Fast delivery...great seller!
0307341577|3.0|This book concerns the murder of a mother and her two young daughters allegedly by the son.  The surviving daughter is a tormented 30 something now who has gone through all the money she got and now faces how to live.  She decides to sell information to a club that specializes in studying murders and finding new evidence, etc.  New information is found through this process but I didn't find the ending that surprising.  The characters were not likable which, for me, makes it hard to get into the plot.  It was dark and disturbing and depressing.  I skimmed parts that wallowed in all of it just to get to what happened.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|loved every minute of it. the story is great from the very first word, even if I don't like denna.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Arcade Fire does it again with their wonderful brand of music. Not straying far from what go them notoriety, this album brings enough change that you truly appreciate their new material. From beginning to end this album is simply a joy to listen to.
B0000669JL|5.0|It was the World Series that drew me back to Bob Marley and The Wailers' \\"Legend.\\" I hadn't pulled it out for awhile, but then Shane Victorino began using \\"Three Little Birds\\" as his walk-on music, and the Boston Crowd would boisterously sing \\"every little thing's gonna be all right.\\" That was enough for me to put this in the car for a couple of weeks, and reminded me of just how great an anthology \\"Legend\\" is. It even surprised me in that I'd forgotten that \\"One Love\\" was squeezed into an episode of \\"Glee.\\" If that doesn't sound of universal appreciation, I don't know what does.<br /><br />It still boils down to the music. Marley championed reggae as a style that could be more than just the sound of Jamaica. In doing so, he became a global superstar, made even more iconic by his untimely death in 1981, a mere 36 years old. That makes \\"Legend\\" all the more amazing when you realize that these sixteen songs came out of a burst of activity that lasted from 1973 till his passing. It's an irresistible mix of songs that included songs that became international hits like \\"Buffalo Soldier,\\" \\"Jammin'\\" and \\"One Love,\\" among so many others. His music inspired many other artists to take songs and make them popular in other means, like \\"Jammin'\\" for Stevie Wonder, \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" for Eric Clapton and \\"Waiting in Vain\\" for Annie Lennox, among others.<br /><br />It's easy to listen to this and feed off the mellow vibes, but Marley was just as much an assertive political figure. \\"Get Up Stand Up\\" and \\"Redemption Song\\" were as forceful songs as anything from the 60's folk-protest years in America. Every song here is potently powerful, be they the \\"Songs of freedom\\" \\"Redemption Song\\" calls for or the lovely \\"Stir It Up\\" (also transposed into an American hit by Johnny Nash). \\"Legend\\" is a CD that holds together as a single album, where every track matters and you'll not be wanting for any track to end so you can get to better ones. Thanks to the Red Sox for reminding me just why I enjoyed this album in the many years since I first listened to it in the 80's.I enjoyed this album in the many years since I first listened to it in the 80's.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I love this movie, plain and simple. I'm a big Russell Crowe fan and the acting is great, the script is wonderful, and the action is amazing. For under $10 this was a great buy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a book I never would have picked up to read, but read only because it was chosen as &#34;book of the month&#34; by our club. I'm so glad I did read it! The device of telling the story from the point of view of the dog, which I would of thought corny, was actually a wonderful way into the story, and - in the end - very moving.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play Candy Crush everyday--several times a day! I can't stop playing this wildly addictive game!! Love playing with my friends!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|`This was Roth's response to her terribly disappointing and upsetting ending: &#34;It’s actually been set up that way. At the end of the first book she almost experiences death … and she sort of plays around with the idea of self-sacrifice …. In the second book the same thing happens …. In the third book, she learns what it actually means to sacrifice yourself. It has to be necessary; it has to be out of love” (Bustle.com)<br /><br />After all that Tris and Four have been through, all that Tris has already sacrificed, this response is simply inadequate. Tris throws herself into danger time and time again, knowing that she is risking life. Whether or not she actually dies, the willingness to put herself in danger to protect others is sacrificial. It is her intention that matters most and which shows she has learned the Abnegation meaning of sacrifice for love and for the greater good. The ending of this book ruined the series for me and many other previous fans. Sadly, Roth’s justification for her choice only adds insult to injury.
0920668372|5.0|This book is a must-have for all parents and children! Such a sweet story, and it never gets old when reading it again and again.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|It was a Fun movie to watch.  Great special effects, acting and story line.  A must see in the Avengets series.
B004ODLUGM|2.0|I didn't remember much of this from my childhood but thought it would be great for my 5 & 2 year old.  Unfortunately, it did not hold their attention at all.  Neither child will sit through anything but the Gruffalo parts...which is VERY limited.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I loved watching it when it first came out and later on television and now I can watch it whenever I want to do so.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A mix of Twilight and Romeo and Juliet. The love story is a little immature, but the character development and storyline is great. Couldn't put it down.
B0001932ZA|4.0|A very suspenseful movie with a lot of action. Schwarzenegger is always good in his movies, but not as governor
B0089LOG02|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  I live near a popular stop in Minnesota, in fact there is a museaum dedicted to the orphans.  I had known of this time in American history where indentured servitude by our most impressionable and vulnerable in our society.  A great quick read with characters who touch the heart.
B00887490Y|5.0|THE TALL MAN<br /><br />As a fan of Jessica Biel and of horror/thriller films I had to check this out. The cover alone was enough to pull me in. usually a purchase based on a cover means a bad flick but not here thankfully. Although I will admit that this movie was nothing like what I thought it would be. Still it was a really good flick that surprised me a bit. This is for sure a thriller but it looks and was marketed as a horror film.<br /><br />Cold Rock Washington has a problem, kids seems to go missing taken by a thief in the night. This thief is an urban legend called The Tall Man. Julia [Jessica Biel] is a woman in this town who has a son of her own. One night at home she hears something down stairs and goes to investigate. She finds the nanny bound and gagged and her son missing. She pursues the abductor that looks just like what the legends describe. Now with her son taken she must do all she can to find him. But not all is what it seems and people are not who they seem, there is a bigger picture that some do not yet see.<br /><br />This was a really good movie and may be Biel’s best performance of her career. She gives multiple layers to her character here, and she as to with the type of character it is. The changes that happen in this film are crazy and I was surprised by how many twists this thing took. I in all honesty did not guess them all but it was a fun ride watching them all play out. This is the movie for you if you want a good thriller with a few twists and turns.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Ninja Kiwi has done it again. They have successfully created another game with paying the $ 2.99 for. Constant updates make sure that this game never gets boring. After a week I'm level 62 with my highest round at 121.<br /><br />Recommendation:Awesome. Worth the money.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its ok. I got it to see what all the hype was about its just like<br />jewel quest but you don't have unlimited moves
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think it is one of the best games I've gotten! It's fun and simple and makes hours of fun! I wore out 73% of my battery playing this! five stars all the way!

B001GH5HN6|5.0|When i was a little bidy baby my Momma would rock my in the cradle, in them old cotton fields back home, and we would listen to CCR's best album.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this so much like omg  every body who has a kindle should download this .If not you are miss
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were amazing, I read them in just 3 days! This book was awful from the start; the characters became dull, the story was full of holes and rushed answers. The chapters switching viewpoints completely threw me off. I skipped over 30% of the book just to finish it. I don't even want to see the movie this spring knowing this is how the trilogy ends.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I loved this book.  Hard to imagine something this amazing in the middle of so much destruction.  It is a great read.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This is a great movie.  I like the Men in Black series.  Great special effects and good acting.  Great actors.
B00ET0PZDO|2.0|I enjoyed the game play but there are not enough levels and I am disappointed there because I would not have spent money on it for a game that short
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|My son loved this movie. He really enjoys this type of movie.  We rent movie on occasion since it can get expensive.
B00FI7XBIS|2.0|I liked everything about this game, but it doesn't play smoothly on the Archos 43 tablet despite Amazon saying it's compatible.  The game plays fine until you fire at objects.  Suddenly the animations freeze and sputter along until the object is hit, then it plays fine again.  Makes it unbearable to play.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed the book a lot  I have most of his books and this didn't disappoint can't wait for the next one
B00B935SUY|5.0|Excellent inside snapshot of rock and roll recording at one of musics all time great recording studios.  Exposes fans to the human side of many of their favorite musicians.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The worst I can say about this book is that it is completely typical to the Bosch novels. A great 3/4 of it is a tight, well written police procedural, as good as they come. It's only in the discordant semi-action hero finale that I begin to drift. Not enough to wreck the book by any means, however.
006202406X|2.0|I am not going to even address the end... It didn't need to happen that way, it could have been different, it wasn't, I have accepted it.<br /><br />Moving on! She adds soooo much plot with not enough time to fully cover it. If there was one more book then this might have worked. Plot would have developed, characters would have developed.<br /><br />She took risks with the ending and it appears it didn't pay off.<br /><br />I know relationships in books have to have rocky spots but I feel like Tobias and tris's lives are rocky enough that they didn't need that useless rocky patch.<br /><br />I would give this book a one star but she did bring in an interesting plot just didn't have time to fully delve in.<br /><br />Blah... I probably won't suggest this series to others any more and it used to be the first thing I would suggest people to read...<br /><br />Disappointed...
B002NJUN44|3.0|OK, not the book and not the most elaborate CGI, but a fun afternoon. Too bad they won't make more to tell the rest of the story.
B00F1J3G9C|3.0|While this app works great to view my emails, opening an attachment (pdf or excel for example) in connection with my office pro suite apps fails for some reason. Switching back to Touchdown app where this isn't an issue. Too bad because I like this app better in terms of just email....
B006LSZECO|5.0|A dark but brilliant novel about people you might not want to know personally but have great fun watching. Lots of nice twists and turns. Memorable characters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|.  It  had a lot of suprising plot twists that made it a real page turner.  I didn’t particularly care for the ending.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|We saw this while we were flying in the SkyMall Magazine.  I looked around and saw it on Amazon for cheaper.  I got it for my husband as a quirky gift and he loves it.  It works with our AT&T Uverse and you decided what the wand movements will be for each items.  We can scroll through the menu, etc.  It is more fun for something when people are over than an everyday use but I would recommend it.  It looks just like the picture!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is well written and a page turner typical of Grisham.  Although it was about southern lawyers, it took a new turn and involved some psudo-historic, albeit tragic, issues.  It was all bundled up into a nice package at the end.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|A modern day version of godzilla. Entertaining with cheap fight scenes. More of a kids flick. Need my money back
B00782O7IY|1.0|The idea of the film is clever, interesting, cute.  I enjoyed watching a silent movie and watching the audience watching a silent movie - no one was wearing jeans.  The dog was great, the acting was good, but the actual movie was flat.<br /><br />When I turned it off  more than 1 hour into it - my questions to myself were:<br />- What have I learned from this flick about... me, life, others, whatever... ?<br />Ans = zilch<br /><br />- How did I feel watching it?<br />Ans = a) some weird combo of bored and I'm from another planet b) who was paid to give the great reviews?  c) maybe I should wait 5 yrs before watching another movie DVD d) all of the above.  ANS = D<br /><br />This movie?  Don't bother !!!  Go read a great book or listen to an audiobook.  There is better entertainment awaiting you.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|I enjoyed the film, but I have to say that I paid for the HD version and ended up watching the standard quality...pretty disappointed with that.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Very entertaining and cute! I recommend it to all ages. I did like the first movie, Monsters Inc. better but this is still very good.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|My elementary school aged kids were laughing silly.  A good movie for family movie night.  Be prepared to answer questions about the original Star Trek.
0061950726|5.0|Read this book on a business trip - excellent!  I believe this is a story that should be required reading in any U.S. History course.
1476727651|3.0|I was very excited to hear about this book being written,  The Shining scared me in a huge way!  I placed a pre-order and read The Shining again just days before Dr. Sleep arrived. What a disappointment. Nothing more than a bloated guide to AA and a sad commentary on milk carton kids. Don't get me wrong! I have nothing but respecct for AAa and the work they do, but if I want to hear about King and his recovery.........I'll read it in the tabloids, right? As for all of the missing  childen, the &#34;true knot&#34;, please! This is an old idea and it''s boring. The book was slowwwwww, dull, and dragged on. I truly expected better and hope that he writes no more sequels.
0316078913|5.0|David Sedaris never disappoints! Of course you have to get his dry, sardonic and witty sense of humor. I recommend this read the same as all of his books.
B000V39KDO|4.0|300 is one of my all time favorite movies! It's a great story with great actors and wonderful costumes. The battles are a bit graphic (not a movie for kids sex & violent). If you haven't seen it, rent it today!
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|average. plot ok but end is quite obvious at an early stage. a bit monotonous at times and one you could put down.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Good movie. Faith based, very clean, but there is a tragedy in the movie that could be difficult for a child to handle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really awesome game even if you never even heard of this I still recommend u download it it is good for all ages as well I guess not like 1 year olds but you know what I mean Lol
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic that EVERYONE must have in their collection. It's a family tradition to watch it together during December. So many classic lines and scenes that you find yourself using to describe holiday decorations. Bought this for a couple who have NEVER seen it and I felt it was my duty to include them in the pop culture favorite!
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|This is very inspiring. This book is one of the best books I've ever read. Great narrative and content. Great price too for the digital edition.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Pretty good in general, but amazing case for the price.  Cable management is above average and the screw-less drive retainers are really easy to use.  Good for a budget personal build, and great for computers you're building for others.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|It had a lot of drama. I love drama movies. I always like Denzel movies...There was always axtuin pack movie
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was a revelation. Unlike the one-dimensional image of the German soldier, propagated by Hollywood, this book shows clearly that the German Air Force was led by men of Honor and Courage - something Hollywood has never had the guts to display. The book focuses on two pilots, one an American Bomber pilot named Charles Brown and the other a German fighter pilot named Franz Stigler and their chance meeting over the skies of Europe. The book clearly shows how the officer corps of the German Air Force generally despised both Hitler  and Goering and that being a &#34;Party member&#34; was not encouraged. It goes on to trace the paths of Brown and Stigler in the Post WWII era. A total page turner that will get you emotionally involved, which is very rare for a book to accomplish.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book even though it is sad.  I cannot wait for the movie to come out next week.  World War 2 was a horrible time.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|based on this rating system, i give it a five. wish we could give half points because realistically i give this album 4.5. the album isn't perfect, but it's still great and gaga did a fantastic job blending the art and pop elements. She doesnt have a bad song on the album.having said that, my least faves are donatella and fashion. which is to say i like them but dont love them.i still listen to them tho. i love listening to this album on headphones.its such an amazing experience.
B005F265CA|5.0|loved comedy and action. grew up on star wars and harrison ford. enjoy western cowboy movies. (extra words to make post)
B008220BLG|4.0|This was a good movie. A good twist on Romeo and Juliet. I am a big Shakespeare fan and I thought, given the zombie craze we are in, this was good.
B00CATSONE|5.0|An easy read but profound points to ponder, serving as a springboard to discovering the genius within.  Also enjoyed the expose of sorts of the utter depths that some men will sink to in order to maintain their status or position in life.  And how those who so often are esteemed by society are as such only because of those they destroyed and trod under foot along the way.
0374533555|5.0|&#34;Thinking Fast and Slow&#34; makes us wonder why simple &#34;Thinking&#34; is not as simpler as we think! Book certainly makes you to keep thinking about thinking
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Engaging, great character development, and fun! The multiple story lines make each episode rich. I can't wait until I can watch the next season.
0316219266|5.0|Brad Stone offers a brilliant and thorough examination of Amazon's origins and its founder, Jeff Bezos. Stone does an excellent job exposing the origins of the company, and its flawed but incredible founder. Exquisitely written, this is one of the finest books I've ever read, bar none. If you're interested in this economic juggernaut or in the retail sector in general,this book is absolutely essential reading. Stone has proven himself to be one of the most accomplished business writers of our time.
B00942V1J4|5.0|I enjoy Love movies and vampire movies and werewolf movies, this puts a great twist of all in one movie.  I enjoyed all the series.  I have all of them on DVD
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Best app ever although it takes about 30 minutes to download.me and my brother<br />have this game.we both love it . it has awesome graphics.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|All this google chromecast is missing is for you to be able to play your local videos on your phones and tablets to your TVs and I would be happy 100% happy besides that it does a great job playing youtube, netflix, hulu plus from my phone and tablets to the tv at 35$ dollars definitely worth the money.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|3D Rocks!  These movies are some of my favorites, and they're even better in 3D! If you have a 3d tv and love Toy Story, these movies are a must!
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|Nhh... it was ok. But I won't go out of my way to see it. Towards the end the girls stopped watching it. Which as you know isn't abnormal for 4 years. It just really dragged at the end.
B0041D843M|4.0|Plenty of scientific information on why eating a plant based diet is healthy for you and the planet.  The information on what a meat based diet is doing to the health of the Western world (diseases of affluence) when compared to less developed places on the planet is eye opening.  A little tough for non-scientific types, like me to read...but I got through it and am moving toward change.  It will be a challenge to eat less meat because it's been a part of my life for so long, but I'm using the China Study cook book to help wean me off meat and use more fruits and vegetables in my diet.
0385345054|5.0|This is a beautiful book with perfect directions and every flower I've created from it, so far, has been sheer joy for me. I might add, I've thus far, deliberately, only used book pages. Crepe paper will follow, but for now, the white flowers are beautiful.
1439102813|5.0|Knowing a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's I found<br />this book to be very true to the course of the disease. The emotions which were expressed by the family members were extremely interesting and touching. The book opened up many avenues of discussion. It also made me and others who have read Still Alice, think \\"what would happen if I got Alzheimer's?\\".
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is one of my favorite singers since I heard her singing I Dream a Dream (not sure if this is the name of the song) and Memories. She can really sing with so much feeling.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I've been a fan of these super heroes for a long time. The movie was well made. It captured each character perfectly. Special eeffects were done effectively. I'll watch it again.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I really like Josh Groban.  I hope to keep buying more of his CD's. He is one of my favorite singers.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It is quite a pleasure to read this book, it really gives a great in-depth perspective on those times. Understanding the history is key to understanding the teaching of Christianity.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Fantastic music, with more sound texture than many other types of trailer music. I love it, and will be on the prowl for more by this composer. I listen to it as I write, but also enjoy listening to it for its own sake. Very impressive. I highly recommend it.
0307236722|5.0|Marth always has great books.  Can always count on Martha to stimulate your desire to get up and make something wonderful.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|ITS A REALLY FUN GAME WITH UPGRADES AND MONEY AND ROBOTS AND FIGHTING. I RECOMMEND. This game is a boss
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Phenomenal acting be the whole cast!  Unlike a lot of crime dramas, there was a great deal of character depth, and the mystery was maintained for most of the season.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This was one of his best books. Time to Kill is a good book to recommend to someone who was born after the 1970s as it clearly  describes the social climate of the time.
1616550414|5.0|If you have liked any Zelda game ever, buy this. You will not regret it. It has so many great illustrations and comes with a timeline so you know how each game fits into the Zelda universe.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel turns in a great performance as a pilot. However, if you are looking for a happy movie to make you feel better then do not watch this one. Had the film ended any differently it would have not been as good. That redeemed the rest of the movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|An amazing story of a boy who ends up in a giant maze and has to find a way to escape before he is slaughtered by the grievers.
B005DJREJS|4.0|This is an awesome show.  I am long past my teenage years but the self doubts and teenage angst are still present in today's high school.  That her mother is so immature and is the one who targeted her daughter to cause the angst is especially cruel.  That would be the one aspect I do not like - the parents.  I know they were young when they had Jenna but could you not make them act a little more mature.  I feel Jenna is more responsible and more adult that they are portrayed.  Sharon M.
0143119680|5.0|One of those books that makes you part of the action, including colours and smells.  My husband appreciated the science part, I felt a twinge of disappointment about the troubled German.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I love these type of strategy games. They are fast paced and fun to play especially while waiting for things like prescriptions or food orders.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Loved this book! Exciting fast paced if you liked star wars and eragon you will be pleased. Check out the whole series
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very easy reading and once you start, the surprises keep coming!<br />I will recommend it to everyone!!!<br />Thank you Pam.
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|I am very pleased with my music, I think Gary Stewart voice is awesome. My cover for the kindle fire is excellent.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is amazing. The cars are great. I have a blast when I play. I am not a game addict, but this is addicting.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|It was not a bad book but in all honesty, hopefully without giving anything away, there isn't a lot that happens. It's a ton of character development which if all fine and dandy unless you want explosions and you want them now.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|great album. :) One of my favorites. If your a Eminem fan its a must to get it. If your not an eminem fan still buy it because its bad ass. :)
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Mr. Stone presents an enlightening review of US history. I found that my own historical perspective was challenged in many ways. He outlines the origins of beliefs that our system of government and economic stability are threatened by humanist systems that would improve the welfare of all citizens, regardless of social or economic standing. Clarity is brought to our international relationships, as UNTOLD describes the gradual changes in policies and sympathies from isolationist anti imperialism, to oppressive and imperialistic militarism. Further, it's historical revelations depict our foreign policies as increasingly subverted by our wealthiest citizens and largest corporations, showing that our involvement in wars most often has roots in economic interests. Though only into his third chapter, my public school and college history educations have been shown as so warped as to be most correctly described as disinformation. That is to say they were deliberately written to present a fictional viewpoint that supports economic elitism and reactionary political beliefs. While all his objectivity elucidates, Mr. Stone and readers of UNTOLD would be better served had he hired a skilled writer to bring order to his narrative. And all readers should bear in mind the adage that all histories tend to equivocate.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is amazing! So glad i can watch it straight from amazon on my ps3! Cant wait to buy the next episode, I recommend this show to everyone! :D
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Mr. Grisham always brings his characters to life.  His story lines are very good.  This one didn't have the suspense of &#34;The Firm&#34; but it did keep you guessing.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend reading it to all mystery readers.  The ending is a surprise.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I swear this game is a must have, except you can't connect facebook<br />Real steel action. The paint, robots are a little expensive but cool
0385743564|5.0|Awhile ago, I found myself reading the fantasy anthology Unfettered and I reviewed all the stories within. Brandon Sanderson is one of the contributors to this great anthology but unfortunately I decided to skip his story as to not spoil my future reading of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Mr. Sanderson is well known in the fantasy reading community for his contribution of the Wheel of Time series. Since I skipped his story, I felt compelled to read some of his work and lo and behold I found Steelheart.<br /><br />Steelheart setting is the not so far future where some type of astronomical event, &#34;Calamity&#34; has occurred. This event coincides with the recognition of super human abilities of some people on Earth. Cleverly, Sanderson spins the not-so-original super hero theme with what I like to call the Anti Super Hero! Maybe they should be named the Super Villains! In any case, these super powered people seemed to follow the well known motto that power corrupts and super power corrupts… Superbly?!? Well lets just say that these 'Epics' as they are known in the story are not here to help mankind but to help themselves to ultimate power. But as history tells us, where there is corrupt power there is almost always rebellious groups against it and here Sanderson introduces &#34;The Reckoners&#34;. The rebels of the story are non-epics that dedicate themselves to the extermination of epics. The Reckoners are the medium through which Sanderson develop the plot and our protagonist, David. David has been wronged by the leader of the city he lives in, an Epic named Steelheart, and through and with the help of the Reckoners his goal is to exact vengeance on this Anti Super Hero!<br /><br />So we got motive, we have setting, we have supporting characters but what about the plot? The narrative is told from a first person perspective, that is the eyes of David our protagonist. It starts with the reasons for his hatred to Steelheart, then moves to the finding and acceptance into The Reckoners all the way to exacting revenge on Steelheart. There is love in the air, desire to do the right thing, great action sequences in pursuit of epics that are getting in their way and plans on how to defeat an invulnerable Epic. Sanderson keeps you turning pages, slowly unveiling the mysteries behind the powers and weaknesses of these epics. He cleverly uses the supporting characters, making me to care for them and to want to know more about what will happen in the end with The Reckoners crew.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. It must be the combination of me wanting always the underdog to win or my desire to believe in super powers. I mean seriously some of the powers these guys have are super cool. I think Mr. Sanderson has a winning start here to what I can feel will be a great series. If you like super heroes as much as I do and want to see the underdog win in the face of impossible odds then you cannot go wrong with Steelheart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game, but very addicting.  I find myself going back time after time all evening to see if I've got more lives to play.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Starts off strong and then just draggggggs on. The concepts are cool and different. But the plot loses itself towards the end. Like forcing the conclusion.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Awesome!  Amazing!  One of the best movies I've seen this year.  The effects are fantastic and it has a great story.  My husband watches it over & over.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|Mr. Bocelli is one of my favorite artist and will give me hours of enjoyment through the holiday season.  Thank you
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I never receive help that is posted to me from friends to achieve next level and the game always wants me to buy the next level....it can be a  Fun challenging game but not worth giving money to with all the other puzzle games on apps to play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book takes you to the brink of what is socially acceptable and what one will do for love. Truly amazing.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Geeks, nerds, gamers, and normal readers of well-written literature will enjoy this spiritual journey. Fascinating characters, strange circumstances, and a grand quest.
B0096PAA6E|1.0|would like to return both of them if I knew how.  There wasn't a return slip included, would appreciate instructions.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|This is a puzzle adventure game.  You have to figure out what to do next.  Quick and simple, but fun.  I wish it was a little longer because I was enjoying it so much.<br /><br />I will definitely look for future games from &quot;echo lake&quot;
1932100660|5.0|Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!  My husband still quotes this book to people about all the unknown things that are done with our food.
B00G91WB3S|1.0|Tech-wise the movie looks great. 3D kept me a few extra minutes. The sound is impressive... but sickeningly violent. Really good acting. A few noble notes of the humane. Then everything blows up real good. I fast-forwarded two thirds of it. I hated it big time. I will be more hesitant to rent and buy blow-up movies. Too bad. It could have slowed down, lost the military element, and stayed with interesting aspect of Clark Kent dealing with facing the past and the future. -via satellite pay per view... I would have bought the blu-ray, but I don't have 3D blu-ray player. Glad I saved the money.
1439102724|5.0|My all time favorite author.  I have read everyone of her books.  She takes topics that can be controversial and does an excellent job of showing both sides of the topic.  I get quite involved with her characters and regret when the book is over.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|You need a pre-amp with this mic, the quality is good but I ended up having to use a pre-amp between the mic & my dslr to pick up any audio. Also that battery thing is wonky.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Ever since I updated my phone I can't get the objects to show up after I hit enter.  I get to the green screen with the word I typed and I cannot get anywhere!  Please fix!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|The best extended edition I've ever seen.  Fantastic extras in the special features, and although only a few extra minutes in the movie (compared to hours in the LOTR trilogy), they add quite a bit.  The little demo playing on the menu for the first disk is worth it alone for fans.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible end to a series I loved. The writing, the flow throughout & that ending. I wish I had never read this book.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Still the Granddaddy of scary films.  Anyone with a little old time religion in their background will still get a shiver from this film.  A bit dated, but as I watch, I am struck by the incredible sound effects throughout the movie. Kudos to Mercedes McCambridge, for a vocal terror fest.  So sit back with your sweetie, crank the volume and snuggle through a golden oldie which forever changed the landscape of creepy films.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is the best show I never heard of.  It's clean enough for the whole family and action packed enough to keep everyone on the edge if their seats yet the relational side of the show is deep with emotion as well.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|tris DEAD.WORST ENDING POSSIBLE.  i wish she ended it so the main character doesnt DIE like in every other book in the world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is addictive, but at the same time, you need to use your brain to plan moves ahead sometimes.  Fun for all ages.
B000007VFU|3.0|I do so love Radiohead and this is one of my fav albums. So, why the 3 stars you may ask? It is due to the very disappointing release of the audiofile pressing &#34;from the Capitol Vaults&#34;. I gladly shelled out 20 bones for what I thought was a great pressing of one of my fav albums only to be so disappointed. The recording itself is very good but the pressing on vinyl is sad and so noisy on side B that it is not really listenable. EMI/Capitol - don't you guys get it! If you are going to ask $20 for a Audiofile recording, make it as promised. This  will be my last &#34;Capitol Vaults&#34; vinyl purchase.
B000P0J074|5.0|Classic! one of the best of Tim Burton's movies with great scares, scenes and music! a fun movie for halloween or even just for a laugh!
B00E0KPG7S|4.0|The best of the Delta Machine maxi singles.  Two strong remixes, the Maps and the Little Vampire remix highlight what is the best of their three maxi single releases thus far.  I can't decide which is better, the Maps or the Little Vampire, but both make this worth the price of the single.<br /><br />Track 1 is the real dud.  A grinding, broken beat attempt at a remix that really makes the song sound awkward.  This the only track to skip out of the 5.  I must admit that when I first heard a sample of the Jim Jones Revue remix, I was left scratching my head, however after listening to the remix in its entirety, I have actually grown to like this version. It's sort of a what if Depeche Mode was a garage rock band, giving youa glimpse of what Depeche mode would sound like if they ditched all the electronics and synths for rock instruments.  A very innovative and daring mix, and I applaud Depeche Mode for allowing this type of remix to be released.  Then again, how on earth did they let the Jim Scalvunos mix through?!<br /><br />The last is a welcomed radio mix, which I thought should have been included on their opening maxi, Heaven, and instead they included the album version.  The radio edit is a slightly alternate mix of the album version and these types of bonus tracks should be mandatory on every single, to get at least one normal sounding version of the song along with all the remixes. The Soothe My Soul maxi left out any normal version at all.<br /><br />There is a 12\\" single out of this song with all different remixes than found here, however as another Amazon reviewer noted, none of them are very good and you're better off skipping the vinyl remixes and just staying with the ones on this maxi.
6305428042|5.0|Classic! a halloween must fun for the whole family and myself and everyone I have watched it with enjoys it a lot.
B0013O123Q|1.0|This movie had to be the worst I've ever seen.  The rape scene was especially disgusting and sickening.  I wish I had never rented it.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Loved the zombies.  Didn't like the marginilization of the USA. The Walking Dead does a much better job all around.
B004G606K8|5.0|I read this book and series years ago and loved it so much I got the Kindle edition for my son.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Has worked well in the car for months now.  It is sturdily built and has a very Apple like feel to it.  Glossy very good quality plastic.<br /><br />I took a star off because it does not have an LED indicator light on it.  It sometimes backs out of the cigarette lighter port in the car by a few millimeters and loses contact, so the phone is not charging and I notice it when it's too late.  Every other charger that I have, in the house and those that I've used in the car before have a small LED which is very useful.  I miss that feature here.<br /><br />Charges my Android phone very quickly.

B00FPH51LQ|5.0|I don't know why this played so badly at the theaters is was better than I thought. I guess I should not believe the ratings and go see it my self because this was good.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Probably the best book I've read all year and I read a lot of books. I really got involved with the characters and I think the writer is amazing.  So glad I purchased it.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I could not relate to this story is was boring and the special effects couldn't carry this movie for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a waste of time. The plot was weak, and the characters didn't have much substance. If you want a good read, check out books by Karen Marie Moning.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this Game! Great fun for the whole family!!  Love playing on Facebook with my friends and family! Have it on my Kindle and Phone!!!!
B00FGM0IEU|4.0|This documentary doers agreat job of telling the story of the Muscle Shoals sound and why it was loved by musicians and singers of every genre of American popular music. The interviews of people like Aretha Franklin , Keith Richards, Wilson Pickett, and Bono illustrate why this place was so special. The story of Muscle Shoals is the story of what America can and should be: a place where excellence is recognized and race, socio-economic status, and age do mot matrter.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Got the game about 5 months ago and deleted it because it was the same thing over and over, but they got an update and it is now one of my favorite games
B0074EIQQU|5.0|I was completely stunned when I heard this album. It took only 2 full playthroughs to realize they have produced a masterpiece. The music has so much power. The songwriting is great as well. This album reminds me of how I felt when I first got into \\"deloused\\". There is less of that jam session quality that \\"Frances\\" had which is not good or bad its just different. This album exhibits all the qualities I love about the mars Volta. Like the title says, this is one of my top 5 albums. Check it out
B00E5Q9VSW|5.0|I don't know the other two reviewers, but they should keep on writing their thesaurus-inspired reviews, because their misguided drubbings of the Brahms Violin Concerto made me go out and purchase this album.  Kavakos is nothing short of spectacular, and I am going to tell all my friends to buy the album.  This is a cerebral performance which brings out not only the complexity of the piece, but a clarity of purpose which has not been achieved since the violin masters of the 20th century.  Kavakos may be the greatest violinist of our time, and he deserves our respect.  His cadenza at the end of the first movement is a thing of beauty.  He pays deep tribute to the composer and his majestic Strad.  The second music inspires joy, and the third movement is bold and empowered. I don't need to use snooty big words that nobody uses to describe a masterpiece.  Pure and simple, Kavakos gets it, and the orchestra gives him the space he needs to accomplish greatness.  Play this album in your car in rush hour traffic.  You will be transcended, and your stresses will melt away.
B000YMHOUS|4.0|Unique  premise  for a  plot.  I  love  how this  black  and  white  world  gains color  as  its  inhabitants  are introduced  to  new  ideas  that  expand  their  view  of  life. Definitely  rated  appropriately.  Not  for  children  under 13'
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book was totally captivating. I could not put it down for one second.  Another wonderful job by the great John Grisham.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Simply genius. I could go on to back up that claim, but one only has to do a google search for what professionals have already wrote on how well crafted this album is. Give it more than one chance, and listen to every word.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|Stack the Countries is so much fun. I loved Stack the States and now I have Stack the Countries to challenge our family. The whole family plays the game and you forget you are learning.
B000TETKA8|5.0|I am shocked I never gave this a chance when I was younger. Now that I am older this is a phenomenal album!<br />Bowie never disappoints!
B008K8X0IS|5.0|Inside this you will find exactly the same box as the standard Blu-ray release of Season One. So you can pull that out and have it not look out of place if you want to file it on your home video shelves next to the other seasons of the show. In addition, this usually seems to go for cheaper these days then the standard release. (I bought it almost a year ago when it was on a particularly amazing sale in the lead up to Christmas, and while not quite as cheap now it still seems to be less then the regular version of Season One.) So, as long as that holds true, why not buy this version? You get the same product, plus you get a nifty collectable dragon egg (quite a hefty weight to it) and a nice looking outer box with a somewhat plush front to it.<br /><br />Double check the prices when ordering and make sure it is still cheaper then the standard release... but if it is, it would seem a no brainer!
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Did Preston and Child make their plot so flimsy and transparent in order to make their readers feel smart, or was it an unintentional product of lack of inspiration? Whatever the case, this is certainly not one of their best efforts, but Pendergast the character is as enjoyable as ever. There are still intriguing bits that inspire further research, like the lost final Sherlock story that I'll be googling to discover if there actually is a real &#34;lost&#34; Sherlock tale, or a connection between Conan Doyle and Wilde. Another thing that keeps me reading Preston and Child is their characterization. Sure, there are the over-the-top villains, often given obvious, throw-away personalities, but the regular people in their novels are often allowed to be real people: trying to do a good job in their work, kind, intelligent, surprising. So often in mysteries the authors' defaults for every peripheral character is surly, lazy, dumb and unhelpful. It's tiresome to encounter yet another querulous librarian or fat, dim-witted convenience store clerk. I feel that Preston and Child are genuinely interested in and respectful of people of all types in their real lives as well, reminding me to see people as individuals capable of many things, things that are very often good. This is a long review for kind of a throw-away read; we fans are going to read it regardless of individual reviews, but I think many of us read these books for the real-life mysteries they introduce to us, and the warmly human element at their core.

B00AEFY66U|3.0|Didn't have high expectations for this film version of my favorite novel, but was pleasantly surprised.  While Nick's telling the story from an asylum doesn't make sense in terms of his character (as Fitzgerald wrote him), having him tell the story this way gets Fitzgerald's words onto the screen.  The contemporary music, surprisingly, suited the mood of the novel.  Carey Mulligan's portrayal of Daisy--unlike Mia Farrow's in the 1974 version--makes it seem plausible that Nick, too, could be a little in love with her, and DiCaprio gives a depth and poignancy to Gatsby.  On the other hand...Toby McGuire seems befuddled for most of the film, and Gatsby's overt criminal activities unnecessarily remove the mysterious air that Fitzgerald took pains to create.  The removal of all connection to the idea of the American Dream ignores the part of the book that made it more than the story of a failed love.  I could go on and on about the flaws, but despite them, the movie worked in a lot of ways and it probably would have been less disappointing if I'd not read and loved the novel.

B008JFUPK8|4.0|Like it or not, every superhero movie for the foreseeable future will be compared to \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" Those two epic films are very hard to top, and overall, I have to say that \\"Man of Steel\\" doesn't step out of the Dark Knight's shadow. However, it is a solid, very good foundation. --Spoilers from here on--<br />I enjoyed the movie's fight scenes, especially the battles in Smallville and Metropolis. I, for one, was not upset at all when Superman killed General Zod. Superman will do what he has to do in order to protect the citizens of Metropolis. Batman is the one with the no-kill rule, not Superman. And if you go back far enough in the comics, even Batman killed in the beginning. The movie was not perfect; in fact, for me the weakest point was when Jonathan Kent was standing by the cars with a tornado coming up behind him. He motions to Clark to stay put, so as not to reveal his secret. Then Jonathan stands there grinning and lets the tornado sweep him away. Rather than hobbling to the safety(?) of the overpass that was maybe 20 feet away. That made no sense to me. Even with a conveniently bad leg, he could have made it.<br />While watching the movie, especially at the end, I couldn't help but wonder if humanity will develop a hate-fear relationship of all Kryptonians, not just Zod and his followers. After all, Metropolis and Smallville got smashed up pretty badly, and it wouldn't be unheard of for people to harbor an irrational hatred of another race. I imagine there will be some negative consequences of the giant brawl for Superman to deal with in the next film. The movie itself winks at the audience regarding a sequel, showing us a Lexcorp truck and a satellite belonging to Wayne Enterprises. Hello, Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne!<br />Speaking of which, I was let down to hear that the next movie will feature Superman and Batman at odds with each other. I'd much rather see them team up, because let's be honest, Batman isn't winning a fight with Superman without Kryptonite, which was never mentioned in \\"Man of Steel.\\" I think Lex Luthor could be an epic enough villain to keep both superheroes occupied.<br />So, to my original comment; I think that the next sequel could be a truly great movie, and that's about the only way to get people to stop comparing to the Dark Knight movies: make a movie that is decisively better. When I left the theater after first seeing Man of Steel, the sequel is the movie that I already wanted to see.ight with Superman without Kryptonite, which was never mentioned in \\"Man of Steel.\\" I think Lex Luthor could be an epic enough villain to keep both superheroes occupied.<br />So, to my original comment; I think that the next sequel could be a truly great movie, and that's about the only way to get people to stop comparing to the Dark Knight movies: make a movie that is decisively better.

0062107313|5.0|Story Description:<br /><br />Harper Collins October 21, 2013 Hardcover ISBN: 978-1-44341-022-9<br /><br />From the lavish parlours of Shanghai courtesans to the fog-shrouded mountains of a remote Chinese village – a sweeping, evocative epic of two women’s intertwined fates and their search for identity.<br /><br />Violet is one of the most celebrated courtesans in Shanghai, a beautiful and intelligent woman who has honed her ability to become any man’s fantasy since her start as a “Virgin Courtesan” at the age of twelve.  Half-Chinese and half-American, she moves effortlessly between the east and the west.  But her talents belie her private struggle to understand who she really is and her search for a home in the world.  Abandoned by her mother, Lucia, and uncertain of her father’s identity, Violet’s quest to truly love and be loved will set her on a path fraught with danger and complexity – and the loss of her own daughter.  Lucia, a willful and wild American woman who was once herself the proprietress of Shanghai’s most exclusive courtesan house, nurses her own secret wounds, which she first sustained when, as a teenager, she fell in love with a Chinese painter and followed him from San Francisco to Shanghai.  Her search for penance and redemption will bring her to a startling reunion with Flora, Violet’s daughter, and will undo all that Violet believed she knew about her mother.<br /><br />Spanning fifty years and two continents, The Valley of Amazement sweeps the reader along a deeply moving narrative of family secrets, the legacies of traumas, and the profound connections between mothers and daughters, returning readers to the compelling territory Tan so expertly mapped in The Joy Luck Club.  With her characteristic wisdom, grace and humour, Tan conjures up a story of the inheritance of love, its mysteries and senses, its illusions and truths.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />The Valley of Amazement was truly an amazing book!  An epic tale of the most magnificent proportions.  Amy Tan has written her best book yet.  I couldn’t put it down and at a hefty 589 pages I still read it in just over a day.<br /><br />The book spanned fifty years and two contintents – China and America.  Two women, Violet and Lucia lost to each other through no fault of their own once again meet and try to flesh out what happened to them.  This book made me laugh, made me cry and left me feeling hugely satisfied.  For as long as the book was, I still wanted the story to continue on even further.

1401917232|1.0|For a book that is supposed to be about the undoing of the ego, it is very full of ego.  I got the impression that Gary's sources of inspiration have deserted him, and he cobbled together this book by cannabalizing his previous works, and added doses of his own  ego stuff, including an inferiority complex and the boastfulness, self-promotion, and defensiveness that come out of it.  That wouldn't be so bad; Gary's struggles with ego could be a great teaching tool.  However, when one of his supposed teachers comes out with extravagent praise of Gary, crackpot political theories, and an ad for a vitamin supplement Gary sells, it doesn't work any more.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot from DU, and was looking forward to this book.  I learned something from this one, too, but I don't think it was what Gary intended to teach.

B007BVOEPI|2.0|I love the look of the product but I must say I was quite diss appointed with its design. For one, it isn't designed to hold the iPad in place when it is docked horizontally. Since there is no &#34;groove or stopper&#34; the iPad slides down, which can get pretty annoying. It also has no way of keeping the latch back when it is docked so it tends to obstruct your view. I wasn't expecting a flawless product for 12$, but I will most likely be purchasing another one that has a more functional design.

B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|This game is really fun. For all of you people who have been waiting for a basketball game for kindle you've found one. There are some faults that come along with this game which would make 3.99 a more reasonable price. One of the problems I have with this game is you can't create a player. I would probably bypass that problem if the multi-season mode was actually functional. First off there's no real salary cap on It. And second even you had the number one player at every position on your team it doesn't mean you will even make the playoffs. Lastly there's no draft/preseason. My last complaint about the game is that it takes up quite a bit of storage. I know this all sounds really bad but overall tis is a really fun game. So if you have 8 dollars to spend buy 2k14
0061452068|2.0|I found this book thought provoking, though without putting in a great deal of effort to check the \\"facts,\\" I was quite uneasy about accepting the conclusions. Then I came across this unreferenced statement on page 345, referring to nuclear power plant waste - \\" its radioactivity falls to one-billionth of the starting level in two centuries.\\" So why is there so much concern (in nuclear power plant literature - not in this book) around the storage of spent nuclear fuel? Various other sources would have us storing nuclear waste for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years. Could a writer such as Matt Ridley be so completely ignorant?<br /><br />I think not. While I haven't done the calculations, nuclear power plant waste is initially extremely radioactive and so hot (in temperature) that it must be stored underwater for 30-40 years until a portion of the most highly radioactive elements have decayed - then its safe enough to handle for long term storage. Given the large amount of relatively quickly degrading elements, perhaps one billionth of the initial radioactivity really is lost in two centuries? I don't know. If the statement is true, it's being too clever by half to leave the issue of nuclear power plant waste with this unreferenced statement, and the later (also on page 345) hope that better kinds of nuclear power will produce less waste, without addressing the very real problems of storing the long lived isotopes in nuclear power plant waste.<br /><br />So, be very, very careful of any of the statements or conclusions in this book.<br /><br />The other, more general problem that I have with this book is that Matt Ridley points out that civilization has generally advanced in fits and starts. If one civilization has stagnated, another has taken over using its competitive advantages - eg, Britain using easily accessible coal. The problem with using this philosophy to reassure us about the future is that now we have a global civilization using resources globally, and that all the low hanging fruit has been picked. Coal and oil are transported around the globe, and there are no longer any easily accessed fossil energy resources for a subsequent civilization to start off with. If our current civilization fails, will the next one be able to make the leap in energy sources from wood to open cut coalmines or submarine oil deposits as exploited by the Deepwater Horizon, or, if all these resources have been used up, make the leap from wood to nuclear? I think not. So this time, as we foresee the depletion of fossil fuel resources, we have to get the switch from our current energy sources to the next right. Some deep concern over this issue seems appropriate - much more than the trivial consideration the issue receives in this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|To be honest, I was a little bit skeptical of the rave reviews I've seen for this product. And being a cheapskate like me, you're willing to settle on price as long as the product works. I'm a super deep sleeper so I need loud to wake me up but I hate being startled awake-doesn't start the day off well-so reading the comments I saw wasn't looking good. But it was free so why not try it?<br /><br />It's great. There are so many choices and varieties you can add to your alarms and waking up experience. And I haven't slept through an alarm yet. Definitely recommend this product to anyone. 5 stars well earned.

B00F880BWG|4.0|I have been watching past episodes and want to know where the series is going. Signed up for trial Amazon Prime since<br />I only have basic cable and Netflix service. I find that Prime has most of what Netflix has but also wants to charge per movie.<br />The annual cost for both DVD and on demand is more than your $79 but I can easily see watching more that the difference<br />in per movie and TV show charges over a year's time. Amazon has more on the TV side right now but the cost for a TV episode seems high compared to cost to view a movie. Also, the chances that I would watch an episode or movie more than one time is rather slim so the video library isn't an additional value to me.<br />Bob Brumbaugh
B00A25NLOU|5.0|Despite my advanced years and limited knowledge of ther internet, I loved this darling book!  Like The Midnight Circus, it's a very novel novel.  The characters are so well designed in every way; language, clothes, food preferences, personal traits - you can't help but want to sit down in a room somewhere and eavesdrop on them.  This is a 21st century techno thriller with a splodge of romance, good friendships and the odd scary moment.

B005I4JG80|4.0|I rarely read parenting books and was skeptical of this one, but curious, too. We were about to travel to Paris with our two-year-old and I wondered what sorts of differences we might see. This is not so much a book on how to parent as it is an approachable, funny, and well-researched sociological commentary, and I'm so glad I read it. Whether or not it's entirely accurate in its portrayal of French parenting (which seems to be the basis of most complaints here), this book was an eye-opening read just in what she points out about American parenting. There are so many things I'd just taken for granted that I realize now to be very culturally American approaches to parenting -- and that there are thankfully some other options. Most of the time Druckerman's observations don't idealize the French approach so much as just offer it as another way of looking at things, much of which she's still getting used to herself and some of which she's not particularly thrilled with. If you're feeling stressed out by parenting and are open to rethinking the way you approach date nights, playground hovering, mealtimes and sleep, I highly recommend this book.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|While this book, like the first four, was well written and engaging, Martin seems to have lost his focus.  This part of the Saga seems to meander like an old river.  It will eventually reach its destination, but it is taking the long way.  Nothing is resolved here and waiting for the next installment will be difficult, but it will give me a chance to catch up on some of my other reading.  If the next book ends like this one, without bringing the saga to some conclusion, I may have to leave Westeros and just be frustrated.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|The book was very interesting, but in my opinion, it is the equivalent of a &#34;chick flick&#34; and I do not recommend it to my male friends.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Riordan's children of divinity series are well-written and quite imaginative. They all have been good, quick reads. When my grand child (-ren) reach middle school, I will certainly recommend Riordan's books. This was no exception.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I have this game on all my devices. It us very addictive and I can't stop playing. The major problem I'm exoeriecing is purchasing items yo help finish the levels. I contacted A mason and rexmceived credit fir purchases that did not go through and received advice in hie to sync my Kindle.  Unfortunately I sm still experiencing the problem. So I may have to give it up on the Kindle.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Badly written, Too sloppy, too fast, no good explaination for the Things build up in the two first books. I get the idea of the ending, it just wasn't writen very well.
B0040NOWY8|4.0|Good price, good quality, timely delivery, what else can i ask for?<br />Haven't tried them yet, but if it works out just a bit, i will be buying again.
B00BEEKN26|5.0|One of the best shows I have watched in a long time.  Hooked after watching the first episode!  Highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is devastating and soul crushing, but Veronica Roth is just as skilled an author as ever!!!!! This is a must read!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is John Grisham at his best.  He skillfully weaves a tale with twists and turns that will leave you angered, frustrated and hopeful as the will of a dying man is contested.
B004Q3RDUW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book but not quite as much as the Kite Runner<br />An excellent insight into the Afghanistan problems
B009IJJ5B4|1.0|The actor that plays Sherlock is not engaging to watch at all and Watson played by a woman just doesn't work.  We were really hoping this would be great, but it is just very very bad.
055338595X|5.0|I have not read this book yet but i loved the others and i am so excited to order this book in paper back
B008MWBY6W|5.0|It's a good size to fit everything for the camera and lens I bought.  It's nice and sturdy and will protect the camera.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game for down time. Fat just difficult enough to challenge you without becoming frustrated. The kindle version is the bomb.
B008602KQI|4.0|I've read ghe books, and just really enjoy the movie, I think they did a great job with the creativity and transforming it into a movie
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun to play; different look and different birds.  Sometimes a round is difficult, but eventually you figure out to use an Angry Bird in a different way to get through that round.  Special &#34;prizes&#34; sometimes give you power birds to get through a round.  Several new levels can also be unlocked with high scores.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Another brilliant legal thriller by John Grisham.  Was sorry to finish iy, my husband hasn't read a book for ages but ploughed through this one.
B001NYEGUM|5.0|Classic 50 album, his lyrics are real and his beats keep you coming back. Definitely an album you can put on and listen to front to back without skipping tracks.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am so thankful for Veronica Roth for not making this book predictable. There are too many YA books out there that you can see the plot twists and turns coming before they even happen. I absolutely loved this whole series and cannot wait for all of the movies!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Parts were better than the whole. Elements of the story were intriguing, but the plot was weak and there was no one I cared about...they were all jerks who got what they deserved. Zeitoun was so good; this was not so good.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first book, it was amazing.  The second book was excellent too but the third book left little in the view of hope.  I had planned on reading the whole series again but after the third book I was so disappointed I couldn't bring myself to re-live that.  I am an avid reader and don't always need a happy ending at the end of my books but I at least need to feel that there was a purpose behind some of the choices in the story.  Overall I gave it 3 stars because of the first and second book being great reads.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I have had to buy it twice, we love it so much. David Tennant as Charles Darwin?...Yes! and thank you!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I am actually enjoying the alarm setting. Although you can only set three alarms. That's enough for me. Plus blue is my favorite color. The display is great and the different setting for music to wake up to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this game can out so I don't have to be at my PC and can play on the kindle
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas Movie. It is a timeless classic. The remakes of this film just can't hold up to the original.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Fun action movie.  Typical Bruce Willis action and fun.  Same crew at RED with a few added and of course the one that was killed did not return.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for adults and children. It really makes you think about the details and it has a ton of different levels.
B00CIAY9SY|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies and the first one viewed on my Kindle HD which I purchased a month ago.
B00FGM0IEU|1.0|Half a great movie, BUT WHERE THE HELL IS EDDIE HINTON? You would'nt make a movie about the Rolling Stones and leave out Keith Richards, so why make a movie about Muscle Shoals and leave out Eddie Hinton?<br />For anyone who does'nt know who he is seek out the &#34;Mighty Field of Vision&#34; anthology and you all will be writing letters too!
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Once you let go of your expectations and just allow yourself to enjoy a sci-fi action flic, you'll be fine.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I saw how addictive it was to friends and family and swore up and down that I would not buy into it...<br /><br />Until I got bored and decided to see what all the hype is about...needless to say that I've only been playing for a few levels and I'm already impatient about the fact the live  take so long to load.. I just want them to load so I can beat this level...and I've been sucked into it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|As always Sylvia delivered on this book!!! I Can not wait for the next installment which will be out next year
B00A285OOW|5.0|Excellent novel, couldn't put it down. As always with phillipa Gregory. Never stop writing about this intriguing era. Please keep writing.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What a waste for the series to end this way! So disappointed for this series to end on this note.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Yet another intense season of character development with unexpected challenges for individuals and the community they are building. And zombies!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I have liked this book well enough, but at times it seemed to drag. And yet I know there will be another book to follow this one, so the author has been laying the groundwork. Overall a good story.
B000VMIILU|1.0|In this movie, Christopher Columbus is this super nice guy who is centuries ahead of his time in rejecting racism and brutality.  But an evil guy named Adri&aacute;n de Moxica is a vicious, greedy, racist villain who treats the natives like dirt.  How sad, Columbus gets punished as though it were all his fault!  Great story.<br /><br />Too bad it didn't happen that way.  In real life, virtually everything done by the villain Adri&aacute;n de Moxica (who is dressed in a black goth suit and rides around town on a black horse, just in case you have trouble figuring out who the bad guy is) was in fact said and done by Columbus himself.  One of Columbus's henchmen even wrote in his diary about the time Columbus gave him a native girl to rape, hinted at in the movie with a scene in which Moxica suggests that one of his underlings can do as he pleases with a girl they are ogling.  Columbus wrote about how easy it was going to be to enslave them.<br /><br />So it's totally misleading fiction, shifting blame so that a rotten old guy can still be called a hero.<br /><br />If Ridley Scott didn't want to make an accurate movie, he should have invented different character names as well.  Heck, he could have set this all in space as an Alien spinoff.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great to read about Jake and Lucien, again.  Good follow-up novel to A Time To Kill.  Easy read with a nice plot.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great Movie! Can't wait to see the next one. A great set of books, movie puts your imagination to reality.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Ever since I saw this movie,I can't  believe what a amazing voice Christina has, and Cher is always and forever great!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If looking for a scary read, this is as good as it gets. Old school Stephen King, it is NOT schlock thrown out to fulfill a contract as some of his work has seemed. Two great book this year from SK - this one, and Joyland (4 1/2 stars).
B004UJAOLM|5.0|It´s a clasic. You have to read it. I used it to practice english, but I was surprised by its psicological and sociological annalisys.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|Wonderful price as an Amazon best deal. Complete series in one box, packaged well and arrived very quickly. Each season in an individual DVD box and all seasons packaged in a medium sized box. Nice to have the bonus material on each seasons DVDs. It's so nice to have every episode of Friends to enjoy whenever I want, exactly what I was looking for.
086571701X|2.0|More of an overview instead of specific instructions.Good to have on your book shelf if you are a successful aquaponics gardener already.  However,  If you are like me and have spent all your free time researching hydro/aquaponics, then you will not find much new information here. Not by a long shot worth 22$.  This will NOT be the only book you need to buy for aquaponics.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|For its day this was really great, still a great plot and very good movie, it is a &#34;little&#34; dated but would watch again
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Love the parody of Star Trek!  Sigourney Weaver is a riot and the guy who plays Guy is great as the expendable crew member (think &#34;red shirt&#34;).
1878424319|5.0|I have read several self-help books and no book really resonated with me like this one. It was a simple read and I easily grasped all of the concepts unlike other books which can be more esoteric. I think anybody can benefit from the principles in this book. However, putting them into practice is a whole different story. If I could truly not take anything personally... my life would change immeasurably.<br /><br />However with a lot of these types of books, I am always wishing for some actual concrete steps of how to put these principles into practice and this book is no different. Still this book has been wonderful for me. I am on my second read.<br /><br />Buy it if in doubt. Have your teen read it as well. I can only imagine what this book could have done for me if I had read it as a teen when I really needed some perspective.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I found this book years ago, but wanted to share this with my adult clients who were dealing with their parents getting older.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I just started watching this show and I must say that I was really excited to do so. I had heard so much about about it so maybe I was expecting too much. I am into the second season and just don't think the show is all that great. I am still watching it but find it kind of boring and tedious sometimes. They seem to always win no matter what... where's the fun in that? I also don't find Alicia all that likable. They seemed to have made her into the &#34;special snowflake&#34; on the show. I love Cary, however. He has charm, heart and smarts. I hated the way that he was booted out of the firm simply because of Alicia and her connections.<br /><br />Don't really care for Kalinda either. Can anybody really be that good (lucky)? Why would people risk their jobs to leak to her when she never offers anything in return... it just seem unrealistic. She has no charm or charisma to account to speak of. Always stern-faced yet people are always so willing to talk to her. Hmmm.<br /><br />It is a decent show but not good or great in my opinion. Hence three stars.
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|I really have enjoyed learning from this little Kindle book. Simple recipes. I love using a scale for cooking I think weight is more accurate than spoonfuls so I look for recipes that use weight. The Kindle edition is in spoonfuls and cups.. I made the chicken dumplings (Quenelles) with soup, the husband loved them, I think I will like them more with the white sauce  (bechamel) and cheese. The chouquettes were yummy (I bought the pearl sugar here on Amazon). The madeleines are amazing (I bought the tin here on Amazon) These is a cheese recipe that everyone can make quickly, it's scrumptious. There are a lot of basic sauces and dishes. I'm very rural and landlocked so fresh seafood isn't always an option It's a nice little book with lovely photo's. I have all 6 of her tv shows on my dvr and use them in addition. If I had the chance to live in a tiny, tiny little apartment in the nice part of downtown Paris for a season, I'd be on the next plane out! These are more approachable than some of Laura Calder's although I love her work as well. For instance, baguettes brushed with extra virgin olive oil sprinkled with grated chocolate and toasted in the oven. Tasty and easy. This isn't low fat so be ready to ramp up the exercise. Good starter on French Food.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Awesome show. Love it. Writers and actors should win an award. I hope to see many more seasons. Every episode keeps you wanting more.
B003A2JBKA|4.0|A great toy. Awesome minifigures but the ship has really loose parts. And you have to take off two of general grevious's arms to fit him in the star fighter. I'd give it four and a half stars.
1250038820|5.0|Love this book, couldn't be happier with my purchase. I keep reading it over and over again and each time I find a new interesting thing that I hadn't noticed before. Exactly what you want from a book especially a book of photographs :-)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very fun game, but if you want to get anything accomplished, you are going to have to sit and watch tv with the app open so you can &quot;tap&quot; your village for hours to build up money. Land expansions go from cheap to costly to insane in the blink of an eye.
B00G91WB3S|2.0|What does it say about us when we need to rewrite our own mythos to be murderous? Is it a reflection of our current mindset? I know this, I was led to believe that Superman was the model of forbearance. He was the tale that taught us that just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do that thing. This film removes that restraint and opens a very uncivilized door. Whether this is a reflection of our current status in society or a hidden fantasy, it is disturbing. This telling of the myth clearly  lacks the morality of former tellings of this mythic tale.<br /><br />Whatever you think about my musings, this is not a film for children.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Great cd, some of the song I actually like better on this cd such as My Hero. It also came on time too so I have no complaints towards delivery
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This is the best album they have made since they were the complete korn in 2005. The deluxe edition is worth the extra few bucks. Almost all of the songs are great and heavy with that one of a kind korn sound. Never never is the worst song they have ever made but it dosent detract from the album at all. Definitely worth it but just skip never never.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was okay...storyline was weak compared to the first two books. Characters didn't seem as smart and there wasn't a wow factor with this story except for disappointment
1400052173|5.0|Clearly explains the science, the outrageous injustice to Henrietta Lacks's family, and the importance of her legacy in a multimillion dollar marketplace.  Riveting.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|Horrible book! Very disappointing, loves the first two books in the series hate but hate this one! Wish I never read it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is an addicting game but while playing on my kindle fire it freezes up randomly, most of the time it starts again but other times I have to restart the device.
B0047T86G0|5.0|In conjunction with the Kindle highlight feature a tap on an unknown word, if it really is a word, brings up a basic definition.  There is also a button control that permits you to get a very detailed definition and derivation of the word.<br /><br />It only takes a tap to go back to the text of the book you are reading.<br /><br />Easy and useful.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|Never should have been made, not that funny. I should have waited for it to be on cable tv !
B004U52VPS|2.0|not so entertaining pretty cheap especially after everyone has played the video version. I am not sure if my grandson kept this or not
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|Great information!!! Easy to read and understand. Defiantly looking at the amount of carbs eating during a day and working on further decreasing.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|A must see holiday movie.  Every generation will enjoy this movie.  Gotta love the Griswalds and the holiday spirit Clark G has!
B00DZPVS9O|4.0|10th release from these New Jersey icons of stoner rock is filled with classic, mid-tempo tunes<br /> that tend to build in energy and intensity.  Guitars continuously rumble & roar with rock ‘n’ roll<br /> power chords and bluesy psych riffs, while Dave Wyndorf’s voice embodies the very essence of<br /> what a rock vocalist should sound like—often reminiscent of the Doors’ Jim Morrison or Pet the<br /> Preacher’s Christian Madson, with a bit of Dr. John’s New Orleans growl thrown in.  As always,<br /> there’s a decadent thread of sleazy, potent sexuality in the lyrical punch of the songs.  The song<br /> “Three Kingfishers” is a Donovan cover from the 1966 album “Sunshine Superman”.  Current<br /> members of the band have played in Shrapnel, The Atomic Bitchwax, Gallery of Mites, The<br /> Ribeye Brothers, Lord Sterling, Riotgod.  Overall this time, I think the songwriting is a bit more<br /> predictable and downtempo than some past efforts, but still well worth a listen.  Although this<br /> may not be Monster Magnet’s best album, it’s still SO much better than most other new rock<br /> releases today.
0812981448|5.0|One of the best and inspirational books I've ever read! I recommend this to anyone looking to go into business or start a non-profit.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but so far it is very good. I always enjoy his books and can't wait for the next one!
1844448797|3.0|Five stars for translating it into Panjabi at all . . . one star for the typographical error in Panjabi on the COVER.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|If you’ve been following my reviews, you’re probably thinking why, for the love of all that is good and holy, did I pick a romance from Harlequin Romance when I’m always carrying on about how much I dislike romance in books. Please allow me to be clearer on the type of romance I hate in books: the insta love and love triangles. Those are the two elements in romance I can’t stand. And even though I’m not a true blue romantic at heart, I do – believe it or not – have a romantic bone or two in my body. There was actually a time in my life, many, many moons ago, when I devoured one paperback romance after the other...and loved it! I’m not talking steamy romance, just swoony, googly-eyed cotton candy fluff.<br /><br />With that in mind, here are my thoughts on this lovely gem from Harlequin. Firstly, it does have a few raunchy scenes, but it was done tastefully and nothing too explicit. It doesn’t come anywhere near erotica (which I DON’T read). The actual hook for me, and the reason for picking up this book, was the gorgeous cover (of course!), but mostly it was the title that got me curious. I just had to know how the heck it was possible for two people to wake up married, with one of them not even recalling they got married in the wee hours of the morning. In all honesty, it sounded like it was going to be a fun, lighthearted read, which it was, but with a more serious undertone than I expected. This is really a novel about character growth and two damaged individuals being thrown together having to learn to let go of the past and learn to trust and love (yes, Tina Turner, love’s got everything to do with it).<br /><br />I loved both the main characters. Maybe I liked Connor a little bit more than Megan, but that can most likely be attributed to the fact that most of the story is told from Connor’s point of view. Nonetheless, Megan also makes the reader privy to her thoughts and feelings, and we get a deeper understanding as to why she’s willing to tackle parenting as a single mother. I’d probably have felt the same if my mother got married seven times and I got a new stepdad every couple of years. Megan’s character is a little Mary Sue-ish, but not overtly so. She’s described as a brainiac beauty, confident, modest, independent to an extreme, kind, smart, and funny.<br /><br />Connor was the real surprise, though. Probably because I imagined Colin Firth in this role (I don’t know why, it just felt like a role Mr Firth would portray perfectly). Connor is motivated, dependable, level-headed, goal-driven and unafraid of confrontation or hard work. Who wouldn’t want to fall in love with a man who has his priorities straight? But oh, wait, Connor doesn’t want love and he doesn’t want to be in love. Due to his traumatized childhood, he has endured several failed relationships and thus has become a jilted man. Sad, but true. Both Megan and Connor not wanting the commitments and strings that goes with loving someone, how will they ever make this quickie Vegas marriage work? That was the question that kept me reading right through to the end.<br /><br />What I appreciated most from this author is that she didn’t expect me as the reader to fall in love with her characters based on how good looking they are. Yes, Connor has a solid build, and Megan is sexy as heck with her deep blue eyes, but all of this were just a mere mention in the background to give the reader an idea of what the author envisions as her characters’ physical attributes. The bigger focus was heavily placed on what these two were made of, and that on its own brought a certain depth to the story.<br /><br />Waking Up Married, as you can imagine, has its fair share of sidesplitting moments. Traditionally, people get to know each other more than half a day in advance before taking the proverbial plunge. Of course, Megan and Connor isn’t your traditional couple and so they had to learn to live with each others’ quirks AFTER they got married. Yep, lots of laughter ensued. I loved peeling back the layers on both these multifaceted characters to get a glimpse of what makes them tick.<br /><br />All in all, this was a terrific read. The only thing I can complain about is that every other sentence started with “Only,...”. I started counting it after awhile, but lost count near the end. It was something I picked up on, but it didn’t dampen my enjoyment of Connor’s pursuit in convincing Megan why this is a marriage worth staying in. I also enjoyed Ms Kelly’s way with words and how she turned it into a story sheer in emotion. I’d recommend Waking Up Married to anyone whose heart beats faster at the mention of the words “sweet romance”. I’m looking forward to reading more books by this author.ey got married.

B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|As a devoted fan of Grisham I was surprised I did not give his latest book a higher rating, I loved the precursor, A TIME TO KILL and think Jake , Lucien and Harry Rex are all intriguing characters.I was really excited to catch up with them all again.  While Grisham does not write &#34;who donits&#34; (we often know the answer to that question at the very beginning) I expected a little more of the unexpected. I had figured out why the deceased decided to change his will long before the end and I am not a particularly accomplished sleuth. Grisham is a gifted writer but at times I found his prose in this book a bit , I don't know, amateurish perhaps. I still think he is a  great writer . Just found this particular novel to be a disappointment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is Absolutely addicting!!!! I love this game and its really great if you want to get hooked on a game.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|All the actors have grown into their characters and are completely believable. The story changes enough from one episode to the ext to make me curious and always leaves me wanting more.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great characters, compelling story and it generates contemplation about the possibility of our futures becoming as such. I went through withdrawals after I finished this trilogy in one weekend.  It definitely held my attention.  LOVED IT!
B008M721MS|1.0|I never received the download.  Presumably because it is incompatible with my Kindle Fire (Non HD). So I've no idea why Amazon thinks that the process was successful.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|enough action, little light on story, but for most part entertaining as part of the terminator story.  Of course the next angle of trying to kill John Connor, first his mom then him and now his father.  down playing his role in humanity by making him seem like the underling who keeps trying to take charge but gets pushed down by the non-believers.  In the end he saves humanity with the respect others have for him and his leadership
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Plot well done. Although I didn't at first, I appreciate the storyline for Thomas. The dynamics between family and staff is fascinating. Anxious for Season Four to begin.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Really surprised me cause the trailer and title wasn't very interesting.  Infectious decease spreading across world .... that is believable. It has enough thought provoking content, good story telling, good acting, good music, basically well filmed. Really surprised how much I enjoyed, it is a good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a unique apocalyptic story with well developed characters.  There were plenty of unexpected turns and twists. I really enjoyed reading it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|The story was told well, no need for deep explanations.  The young actors did a really good job of acting like teenagers and growing into responsible individuals.  The action and effects done well.  Entertained, had a love story, resolving family issues, teenage rivals becoming friends, secrets, special effects and not bad acting.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Had heard about it so I watched to see what the hype was about.  It was alright.  Had I known more about it before I watched it, I would not have watched it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|ive played a lot of games like this and they don't impress me and I don't understand all the hype about this one its average at best
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|Big fan of Lady Gaga; I have all her other albums. This album seems a bit all-over-the-place. The lyrics are also more nonsensical and clunky than on her other albums. There are a few solid pop tracks (a big fan of MANiCURE and some other other slower tempo songs like Dope and Gypsy) but in general I'm not the biggest fan of this album.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Despite the length of the book, the author through her writing and research transports the reader back to a time that shaped American history and politics.  Knowing how brilliant and kind Lincoln was to all of his rivals and constituents made it even sadder that his life was caught short through assassination.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton is awesome from the actors, the costumes, to the plot.  This is one of the best shows ever on television.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great smash em up movie. If you are expecting Oscar worthy material, you're in the wrong place. As advertised. The adolescent inside will enjoy this immensely.
B009178OQA|4.0|Beautifully shot - clean lines, the filmmaker regards his subject with the same care and attention as his subject treats his profession - Hungry for more!
B000XUBFE2|3.0|It kept my interest, but the ending was short and quick with many ends the reader would like to have tied up for them..<br />Hope the movie does better,but I don't go to movies anymore so I will never know.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|The movie starts off nothing short of cheesy, which I expected, but the acting was so atrocious that even Arnold himself probably walked out of the theater. Ron Pearlman should stop.<br />If your into a bad action movie (which I am) it has some decent fight scenes, but it never goes above decent. I guess its worth a watch, but I would never watch it again.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Very disappointing novel. Very rushed with little character development. I was not a fan of the POV writing as Roth didn't use this style of writing with the first two books, and found that it made reading very confusing. Killing off all the characters for a sloppy ending. Don't waste your money!
B00CSYR432|5.0|Classic movie from Studio Ghibli. I love most of there movies, and can put this one in with the other classics.
143911000X|5.0|This is a wonderfully entertaining book.  All my friends find it amusing too.  It is rated NSFW (Not Safe For Work), so use some discretion.  Some people can't handle raw awesomeness and must have it watered down!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I would like to see the Secret society top hat camera dude show up or lurking in around a column in the pics.
031623480X|5.0|With looking where our Healthcare is going...I'm looking to do everything I can to stay healthy.  I think there is allot of truth to what Dr. Perlmutter is saying here.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast only works with certain apps such as Netflix and Hulu.  I bought it specifically for use with the Xfinity and HBO Go apps so that is kind of disappointing.  But it works well with the apps that it is compatible with.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am a bit over half way done, have been reading this without losing interest for over 8 weeks now. There is just so much going on in so many places at once. I am not a cable TV freak, but I really find this fantasy world enjoyable.
B00D2JDNQ4|4.0|I enjoyed most of the way that the book was constructed and the story held my interest for the most part.  However, the ending seemed to be more about construction and insufficiently, to my taste, about resolution.  Perhaps 850 pages was just too long.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Was thoroughly entertained. I have no interest in all the extras, no idea if they are good or not, I buy for the movie.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun, intriguing, creative game with lots of searching. Nothing too difficult, but not so easy you won't need the help button, either.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|I can not list the times I've seen this movie over the years as it has been quite a few.. and..... for me to purchase it to watch once again tells you how much I enjoy it. Kathy Bates is top class in my books!
B0013O123Q|1.0|The story is very week. It looks like it was written by an amateur. The concept is interesting but it's been done before. Handle of time is really poor. At the beginning of the movie there are shots that will make you dizzy. I don't really know the purpose of it. Very amateur.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Great read.  Really made you feel like you were along on the trip.  I understand why women need to escape and why women fear men while men fear bears.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Decent chick flick. About several women that get pregnant around the same time and what moments transpire for each of them during their pregnancies. Even has some funny parts in there for the guys.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The author thought all we were looking for were the sex scenes again.  I was more interested in the psycology and there wasn't enough of that.  It was like reading a bad Danielle Steele.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great activity for boredom or when nothing on the tv. Good brain exercise. No worries about missing pieces or puzzle pieces to store.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|I love these type of games ready for chapter two hope it's longer than part one the games to short
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|Oh, it is more of a challenge to me than I could have expected.  Fun.  Exasperating.  Obvious, when you solve something.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Love love love this Sudoko version.  Keeps my brain young. I can listen to an audio book and work the Kakuro puzzles at the same time and my brain is able to follow both.I love any and all versions of Sudoku.if you are as hooked on Sudoku puzzles as I am you will.enjoy this one.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|I like the gameplay and and the unique level selection option it provides.  I'm sure my son will enjoy it too, when he gets to play it later this evening.<br /><br />This version of the app (v1.1.1) does not offer an exit option or allow for exiting when tapping a Back soft key.  Tapping the home screen button does what it should, but the app continues to run in the background.  Force closing the app is the only way to close it, short of shutting of your device.<br /><br />Version 1.1.9, available through that other app market, does offer an exit option in the game.<br /><br />Not sure why the developer and Amazon would not have ensured they were offering the latest version when highlighting it as the FAOTD, but hopefully we'll see the latest version in the near future.  Not the apps fault.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Fantastic story, well written!  The way the writer wove the history of the characters from the past to present was amazing.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It is a fun game but I don't need the aggravation of being timed out of the game unless I pony up money to keep playing.<br />This is not a good move on the part of the distributors - once ;you turn people off with your avarice they stay turned off.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Bought this series for my husband, he loves it. He hadn't been reading for many many yrs. He's so excited to read again, he's up to book 13 or something. I started reading them after him, not as far along but we both enjoy this, man's man, 'get her done', military background character. Each book has twists and turns, yet his character is straight up his own man. Read the first one and see if you don't agree. Thumbs up! ;D
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Point out as many plot holes you want to in this movie, I still loved it. It was a lot of fun, kept a good pace, and the cinematography/CGI was amazing. The only thing that could have been improved was to spend a little more time with character development on the crews. That way when things start going south, I would care more. I guess the best thing I can say about this movie is that I will definitely see it again.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Bought this series for my husband, he loves it. He hadn't been reading for many many yrs. He's so excited to read again, he's up to book 13 or something.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the show Downton Abbey; so glad Amazon has it available for free instant streaming for prime members. Definitely a great perk of my prime membership! Also love the closed captioning options, it's nice to be able to adjust the font to what I want.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Bought this series for my husband, he loves it. He hadn't been reading for many many yrs. He's so excited to read again, he's up to book 13 or something.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all of John Grisham's legal thrillers. Sycamore Row does not disappoint. There is always a good, seemingly outnumbered lawyer who inevitably wins out over the bigger bad boys.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Bought this series for my husband, he loves it. He hadn't been reading for many many yrs. He's so excited to read again, he's up to book 13 or something.

0920236251|1.0|I didn't realize it was a tiny book. I would havepaid mmore for thebigger one. My daughter was so disappointed.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Not as unique and interesting as I would have expected. The fight sequences were actually too destructive and unlike superman.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I have purchased many Kindle books and magazines. Most of them I even got to read once. Then my kindle died. I had to get my son-in-law and my husband to download and install kindle for the PC in order to recover my books. My magazines which I had continued to be docked for out of my social security money are just gone. I never even got to read them once even though I had paid for them.<br /><br />Kindle for the PC would not install on some of our computers, for reasons unknown, so even that was a bust. In is NOT the next best thing!
0786956291|3.0|In regards to this being a starter kit, it performed its duty magnificently. The kit does a great job of walking player(s) through character set up and their first adventure while explaining all the D&D jargon. The map, tokens, and dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) are perfect for a beginner's collection and all of which are useful in any D&D game whether you are using the campaign from this set or another one.<br /><br />I stared D&D with 4e and have since tried 3.5 and Pathfinder, in comparison, 4e is incredibly basic and lacking in character customization. 4e simplifies everything down in so that it all fits on one page which means less spells, less feats, and less skills.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you're looking for a simple start into the world of table top RPGs and don't mind the lack of customization, then this starter kit is PERFECT for you, however; if you want to customize all the details of your character with a ton of options, I would recommend looking somewhere else to start.

B0001I561E|5.0|Timeless story and modern adaptation with good animation and characters from the root (Persian and India-n) of the 1001 Arabian Nights, nicely done once again.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural continues to fascinate me with its many twists and turns as the two brothers deal with the underworld, our earthly world and the heavenly world.  My favorite character would be &#34;Bennie&#34; the vampire...They should bring him back more often.  The actor was great in the part
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I wish I had more stars available because as a true Metallica fan this is arguably one of the best live recordings of music I have ever heard. I previously thought this of &#34;S&M&#34; but after hearing this album, has the absolute best mix of music throughout all the instruments. Not only can you feel Lars' bass drum but you feel it in your bones the shredding of Kirk and James' guitars and Robert's bass is something emblematic of Cliff dare I say. OMG please go get this album, I cannot stop listening to it and if you're a true fan and not one of those typical &#34;oh they were only good in the 80s&#34; just go get bent because they bring back songs from every album, some of which I have never heard live versions of like 'Ride the Lightning&#34; and &#34;...Justice.&#34; Just seriously mind-blowingly-epic and an album you will friggin love for the rest of time, GO GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I tore through the series during a 5-day hospital stay in 2012. It was a horrible experience and the entertainment and excitement of the trilogy kept my mind occupied and active.<br />Just finished Catching Fire for the second time, in anticipation of the movie. Just as riveted as I was the first time. Thank you Suazanne Collins for your intelligent yarn of twists and turns!
B008BM9L72|5.0|This trilogy is not porn, it is about psychology of people that have had extremely unusual life styles which have distorted their personal way of dealing with humans on a personal level. I found the books well written and captivating. I have read all three twice and found I enjoyed them more the second time.  Well worth the time spent reading them.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Its just moving way too slow, I understand the season has to build up, but it moving to kind of slow
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good but seemed to be confusing to my husband who had not read the books. I know it is hard to incorporate everything from the book into the movie, but I think they left out some key points. Overall a great movie as long as you have read the book.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|He go he go he dh dh wc dh he dh :-) kh th B-) uhh dh no it eff hmm if dh yr egg egg Jr Seth bc dh it dh by it tv vs 107th ds set her will it B-)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Sometimes the game can make me mad but then I start playing and I am moving up in the levels and then I get stuck on a level but in all its a fun game I like it a lot .
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Interesting read.  As with all books of this type, the author fawns a bit over Bezos, but in the end, paints a believable portrait.  I loved, then hated, then loved, and hated again both Amazon and Bezos as I read throughout the book.  I'm not much of a reader, but this one kept my attention all the way.  Oh yeh, I placed my zillionith order with Amazon this morning, after swearing to myself several times while reading, that I never would use Amazon again.  Oh, well.
B00FOWX6NM|4.0|4 stars for slim profile, good styling, great corner bumper cushioning.  HOWEVER--the 'cafe brown' color I selected for my gold iphone just doesn't look nice.  In the pictures, it looks complementary, but in reality it looks like putty and IMO does not complement the gold color at all.
B001CZVVW8|5.0|Superb singing, acting and staging. Fleming is convincing in her subtle portrayal of the naive teenager as well as the mature Tatiana. The chemistry between her and Hvorostovsky was palpable. They both were in great voice.<br /><br />The current Met production doesn't compare in all these categories.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I read this for my book club and that was the only reason I managed to finish it. I felt the character development was poor, probably because there were so many characters in the book. It was poorly written, poorly edited and the plot really did not interest me at all. The only person in the town that I even remotely cared about did not fare well at the end. I almost felt as if this was a book the Rowling wrote years ago, before the Potter series, and decided to publish it based on her success.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Very nice and high quality item. I didn't buy as a game, but as cake topper so it was AWESOME because it has all the little pieces that make up the real game.
B00G3DA63Y|4.0|IF you are reading the listing for the BluRay version that is called The Final Cut and IF it turns out to be the 99 minute version (they really should have the original cut and the as complete as we are likely to get cut but don't appear to - thus only 4 stars) then you should buy it.  Otherwise not.
B0030MM68O|5.0|It gave a very realistic portrait of the life in a desert country.  I was in Saudi Arabia for two years just before Sadam invaded Kuwait.<br />I felt the same way the three soldiers were portrayed:  they were fearful of the unknown and unfamiliar terrain and society, but at the same time they felt more alive than at any other time in their lives.
B000W965QW|4.0|The story kept my attention.<br />It has a bit too much of a Hollywood ending for me though. It seems like it was written with the intention of making it into a film.<br /><br />Still I enjoyed the book and recommend it.
B00D48BSBA|3.0|Appears to be too descriptive and full of military jargons.... does not keep the reader engrossed completely. can be better coming from master storyteller
1400069289|4.0|First and foremost, I don't feel like this is a self-help book as somebody may have thought.  I enjoyed Part I of the book very much and I found Part II somewhat interesting and Part III was ok.  Nevethless, good read.  Recommeneded!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Works as described.  Now I won't be loosing my BT headset anymore.  Interesting product, haven't seen any other product like this for any other BT brand.  Owned this for 6 months now, no problems.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I actually ended up getting the full version, but if you don't want to pay for that this one is very good.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Small amazing good quality interface. This is not the PreSonus board but the controls are easy set up is quick and it is so portable. I especially like the dual inputs on front. Back light on knobs shows clipping on volume (green and red) and connected (green).USB powered and plug and play. My Ableton Suite detected and connected in seconds.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|What can I say? It's nice to have the Twitter app on my Kindle. I've had no issues with it, so I'm happy.
0240815807|1.0|Technically this guy is great, he should take a writing course. The information quality in this book is great, the presentation is well, to be kind, terrible. Long winded and with a young home studio audience not a good presentation of the material.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game! I had never played it before but my mom had it on her tablet and I was hooked. It is chalenging, but not crazy hard. A lot of fun.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Excellent movie nice effects especially, good history. I like to see the movie again . keep in continuing movies like this
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game all around. It is definately addicting. I love all the Temple Run versions and the original is just as much fun as the 2nd one.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|A great story as only John Grisham can write , no idea how story will end which keeps one interested .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this game. It has much better graphics then the first one. It is easy to getted hooked.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app I wish we could more than pres a bottom to score but other than that it was a great game
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like having this app on my Kindle. It works very well for posts, messaging and just browsing the homepage. I have  noticed that you can't do everything you can with the full site, like moving a photo from one album to another or editing certain things.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies! Its up there with Its A Woderful Life. A must have in your collection.
B00E5MXU4C|5.0|It was fast but interesting. I love this series and can't wait for another.  You will enjoy meeting her family. The characters continue throughout the books.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|It was an excellent. Fantasy one that few me in from the very first chapter. It is an easy read and one that will keep you wanting more.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game its very fun, but I hate the offers that end up all over my facebook page. The free offers are not real so why do they keep putting them up.
B00FFJPIJE|5.0|This is a great resource for brewers of any size. Written in a conversational style, Hieronymus gets the reader inside the heads of many of the world's most outstanding brewers.<br /><br />Fantastic resource and fun to read.<br /><br />DJ Weber
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Delightful series.  I wish there were far more episodes in each season, and more seasons in the series.  I will be sad when I have finished watching them all.  I have come to love the characters and watching their lives unfold.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I was captured by the writing, and became involved in the life of the characters. I believe that is a sign of a very good book. A welcome departure from some of the awful best sellers in the market place.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books...loved the early ones and liked the later installments.  However, I am truly saddened that Ms. Cornwell felt it was appropriate to insert her fictional character into a real tragedy that is not even a year in the past.  To mention that Kay had helped out might have been one thing but to continue with the graphic descriptions of her fictional involvement was simply disrespectful.  I can only hope that Ms. Cornwell is donating a considerable amount of money from the sale of this book to one of the many organizations devoted to helping the victims and their families.  If she is not then I am very sorry I purchased this book and apologize for any additional pain it may add to an already tragic situation.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham always writes fun novels.  A Time to Kill was my favorite of his books and this is a follow up.  Fast reading and fun.  All the twists and turns we expect from Grisham.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The game is a nice simple chess game. U can adjust the difficulty as u wish, which is nice. Other than that its chess.
B009LDD590|4.0|The adventure continues.  Lots of history - accurate or not - about prohibition and the era.  It's hard to stop watching.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Big fish has the most amazing hidden object games!! Can't get enough! Ready for the sequel!! It's nice to get your money's worth. Keep it up big fish...your by far my go to hidden object game creator =)
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel is outstanding. Storyline has many twists and turns. I would not recommend to watch this movie in flight. Make sure you have both feet firmly on the ground.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Plenty of curves and unknowns in story plot!  Baldacci is a good story teller who always keeps you guessing.  A great read!
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Excellent album.  Great lyrics and music.  One of the best bands of this decade.  Very stoke about this band from Ohio.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The picture was very clear.  The sound was fantastic.  The storyline was awesome.  The movie was action packed and I was captured from beginning to end by the way the movie was developed and depicted on the screen.  The screen shots keeps you interested the entire length of the movie.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|As an animal rehabilitator myself, I want to say that PETA disgusts me and should have their tax exempt status yanked. They aren't helping my industry (euthanizing most of the animals taken into their care.)<br /><br />I went to Sea World in Florida when I was a child. I remember the awe that stayed with me since a naive child, so when I was in San Diego a few years back as a mid-life adult I checked out that location. I noticed during the Shamu show that the male trainer was hustling to get the fish and dump it in the whale's mouth. I turned to my husband and said, &#34;I guess that fish gives the whale something to chew on instead of the human!&#34; From what I saw, nothing in this movie shocks me. Just check out the ticket price for dinner with Shamu. Wow.<br /><br />There is not one reasonable person that can deny what these whales are going through. Do a google maps search for &#34;Sea World Drive, San Diego, CA&#34; (or the FL location) and look at the aerial shot where you can see the whales in their tanks. We get cabin fever if we are stuck in our house for a period of time. Imagine what it would be like to be that size of a creature in that tiny of a living space. When I visited San Diego, with all the wacko Hollywood animal rights activists I was hoping the whales were kept out in the ocean and lured in for the shows, but sadly they were not. Not everyone has the ability to feel for another person or animal, which explains the poor reviews on this film (did they even watch it?) There is no way you could visit Sea World, look at the body language of the whales and think &#34;they're happy!&#34; They absolutely are not. A falling fin is not normal. You'd have to be brain dead to not think they go crazy in these tanks. There is a way of doing it right and time has shown that Sea World is not interested in caring about the state of mind of the Orcas. They took her baby away from her, cold turkey. They didn't put the baby in the pool next to her and wean her from the mother over time, they just &#34;did it.&#34; WTF is wrong with you if you think that's okay? Only the self-absorbed will shrug it off. We wouldn't do that to a dog and its puppies (if we cared about their mental state). I'm embarrassed for the human race - we should know better.<br /><br />The movie itself was very good. The flow of it, the footage they collected was incredible (even though you could tell they matched up footage that didn't represent the true storyline but it helped you follow the story better.) I was expecting a so-so documentary that left me regretting most of the time/life I wasted watching it, like most other documentaries. This one was very well made and informational.
0425252868|4.0|A Higher Call is a wonderful read for anyone who appreciates the non-fiction genre.  Although the events are built around technical names of bombers and fighter jets, it is the emotional drama captured by Adam Makos, the author that eventually captures the reader.  Centered around a German pilot named Franz and an American pilot named Charlie Brown, this story unravels the tragedy of war and the many pilots who turn this into a war game by marking their daily victories. The protagonists, however, show that humanity still exists, especially in the central event of Franz holding back the trigger that could have killed Charlie Brown and his entire crew.  This book is an excellent story of endurance in the midst of death and destruction. It provides a cleansing of two souls that eventually meet after the war has long ended - Dr. Pamela Allegretto-Diiulio
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Austen romance, a great collection of characters, and Johnny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley - how much better does it get?!
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This is a fun movie. I have the sequel; just didn't have this one. Ordered a used DVD at an extremely reasonable price, and it arrived in good condition, no scratches, and plays perfectly. Am very happy with it. Thank you.
B00371XIJE|3.0|A sweet story, and a sad one too.  Watched this with my 8-year-old dog loving daughter and found it quite endearing.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|As usual Big Fish Games has come up with another great game and I can't wait until the next edition of this game comes out.. This is a great hidden object adventure game that has great graphics and a great story line that keeps you interested and wanting more..
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|completely different from the previous albums , every song in the album sounds different then the others it just amazing love it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again, John Grisham has given us an interesting read.  It was hard to put the book down.  Looking forward to the next book.
B008578PMU|5.0|Great true story, Great affects, They need to remake all the old war movies like they did this one. One could only imagine seeing formations of all these great planes flying overhead, until this movie. This movie make me Proud to be an American.I loved it so much that I purchased the blue ray & DVD set. I don't usually watch but a handful of movies over and over again but this is one of them. Most every time I see a new detail.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was a waste of my time. I wish  would have stopped at book two and never read this one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read these over and over and over.  I can not get enough.  Does that make me a bad girl?
1419707671|5.0|I like the book. Bought it for my 5 year old who is slowly reading chapter books. Hopefully, next year she can enjoy it more. She loves reading some of the words or vocabulary on these books are still a bit difficult for her to understand.
B00846REIS|5.0|Ms. Day, I bow to your creative mind!  You have created an enthralling world where one is allowed to explore pleasurable possibilities!  My husband says thank you, too.
B002VISN9E|5.0|Fantastic Childrens story.<br />Cheeky and fun with a huge heart.<br />Hopefully inspires the young and young at heart to read more books!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Makes 50 Shades seem like a Disney production.  Can not wait for more of Gideon and Eva's exploits. More pleeeease!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent movie. The triology books were one of the best I've read. I had a hard time putting them down. The Hunger Games movie followed the books with a few exceptions but I think you can expect that any time a book is made into a movie.<br /><br />I rarely watch a movie more than once but I will watch this one again at least once more!  The second half of the trilogy is just coming out in movie format. I hope it's as good as this first movie.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app has absolutely no problems. all I do is go to the app and hit play,  then fall asleep. you only arrange your sounds once and saves them. if you don't like your previous arrangement simply coco different sounds and turn the old ones off.
B00ESNE696|5.0|The writers have really spiced up the Good Wife series in season 5. I can't wait for the next episode!
B00EV2OY6Y|5.0|Great recording!  Full album plus some rares.  Well worth it.  If I could have heard Don't Shoot Shotgun live or Run Riot...
B0050DZN4K|4.0|There have been a lot of updates lately and as usual the amazon app lags behind the play store horrendously. It doesn't crash as much on my phone or on the kindle fire hd, but usually after following a link or two it will. And now I cannot back out or otherwise exit out of the app on either device except by the home button, which doesn't exit the app. Fix that and I will make it 5 stars.
B002APS61I|4.0|Beautiful scenery!  Classic story is always wonderful and Keira Knightley is perfect in the starring role. ( I just wish Colin Firth was Mr. Darcy in this film too)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It had a lot of action, loved the story, but HATED the ending :( very sad. But other than that I love the story line!!
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|I purchased this calculator just to see if something a reviewer said was true. The square root of 2 X the square root of 2 does = 2 on this calculator and not 1.99999. Not too bad if all you're wanting is a simple calculator. However, I won't be using this calculator as the one I got from the play store is still the best I've found. Real calculator is still the best I've found and it's a scientific calculator so it has more functions I need.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|&#34;Her face decorated with fury&#34; &#34; A gang of tears&#34;.... Odd  use of language that I found not exactly pretentious but a little bizarre. If something is decorated, surely it would be attractive, or at least try to be so. Tears don't come in gangs, they come solo, albeit fast moving, but one by one, not in a group.<br /><br />The writing is awkward, distant from the characters, so much so that I thought the author must be German and it was a bad transaktion, but no, he's Australian. I didn't find the language poetic but just odd. I wish I had downloaded a sample first instead of buying. Not my idea of great prose at all.. Needless to say, I didn't finish this book...<br /><br />Also, I
B0037YOMWS|4.0|This review is for those that are interested in knowing more about the aesthetics of this calculator (as I know there are many die-hard HP calculator collectors out there).<br /><br />I picked this up for a really good price elsewhere. I am really into aesthetics when it comes to anything and is why I chose this over Texas Instrument's plasticky/toyish looking calculators. It looks superb and really professional on your work desk and the plastic (contrary to what some have said) does not look/feel cheap like 99% of other calculators I've seen. I have to admit, if this was on your desk, you have a client over and they see this on your desk (vs. a standard regular calculator), they will probably take you more seriously. The black plastic has a very nice texture and the back has really sturdy rubber feets so that it doesn't slide/knock on your desk when you're typing it on a hard surface.  I especially love how the buttons feel when you type it - it has a really nice/crisp click - not mushy like Texas Instruments or other brands.  The LCD screen also has clear plastic over that is a part of the overall front fascia of the calculator so when you run your finger from the very top to the first row of buttons across the screen, it is just seamless. I like this because I hate it with other calculators where dust/dirt gets stuck on the edges of the LCD screen.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that I was actually fooled into thinking that the front was made of some sort of metal like some older Casio calculators.  I wanted durability with steel because I haven't purchased a calculator in over 6 years and wanted this one to be used for years as well. It is not metal - it is simply plastic with a metal look to it. The HP badging on the top-right is also not a real 3D badge like older HP calculators. It is simply an imprint - though it does look really nice I have to admit.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Was disappointed with the book in general. Would not have wasted my time reading the series if this is how it would have ended.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|Great game for my 4 year old son.  Teaches him good eye hand coordination.  Visiually stimulating since he has a disability.
B00FXMECS6|1.0|Horrible movie a real letdown from the first. No motivation whatsoever. Very cheesy, pretty much a &#34;D&#34; or &#34;F&#34; rated sequel.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The best one yet!!!  I hate it that I finished it so fast.  I can not wait until the next law case by Jake.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As with all Michael Connelly novels, this one is fantastic. Can't wat for December release of The Gods Of Guilt. I've read them all and so should you.
B0097WB83K|5.0|Easily one of the top 10 most disturbing movies I've ever seen. Nature vs Nurture. A true psycho-horror film. How are the most everyday things so creepy? And the poor guinea pig!!!
B008J05EL8|1.0|This app is useless. Don't bother spending your money. I tried to open it and it would not. A rip off in my opinion,.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This was purchased for my daughter and she loves that the tiles are not the typical pictures you see with Mahjong tiles.  It is nice there are every day pictures to match.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its a great app! I love it and its very addicting, can't stop pinning! I love all the things people pin including recipes, which I've tried making.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I purchased this to try a different type of gaming.  It is a challenging game to play. My husband is addicted.
B000IZA9NK|1.0|When I saw this movie I was disappointed. It was like watching a traffic cam for an hour and a half. Things moved in front of the camera but I had no reason to really care about the things. Then angelina Jolie came in front of the camera and suddenly there was a focus for my attention and a reason to care about what happens to someone on the screen. How great a movie this would have been if Jolie had been cast as Sky Captain and Jude Law had been the reporter. I still haven't figured out what the director and editors were going for in the film, but when I think of the film the Angelina Jolie character is the only thing that comes to mind. What a waste of money and talent simply because the producer couldn't see past the script page into what was really going on in the film.
B000HZGNHW|3.0|Michael Caine is always entertaining. The plot is original but not fully developed taking too many unexplained short cuts. The end is a surprise.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A great sequel to A Time to Kill which was excellent.  Grisham captures in the readers mind that same deep south feeling and uses many of the same characters when he left us from his last visit there and introduces several new ones to make this an interesting and intriguing adventure from start to finish.  The movie makers should already be salivating on bringing this one to the silver screen.
B000I55YV2|2.0|Predictable movie inspired by a 60s British movie spiced up with a much too nice chick with a also predictable Hollywood ending
1400069807|4.0|Lots of eye-opening information about foods I usually eat! I now think twice about the foods I purchase and consume.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Impressed by how quickly and easily this app works.  Just a few taps and the junk is cleaned out.  Very glad I got it.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|An excellent story about an amazing place where incredible music was created... What a soundtrack! Wonderful storytelling by some of the best to ever do it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The read was good the whole way through, lots of twists and turns, but the ending left me much to be desired.  It was weird.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Have been using YAHOO since my first computer in 1997. YAHOO has very good news items; they don't focus on any one thing but instead spread themselves all over the board to let the reader/user make their own decisions/opinions. Always get great TECH SUPPORT and have always relied on YAHOO.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This is a classic and a must own by any thriller movie fan. Highly recommended to movie buffs and fans
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I did not realize until I read the instructions that this does not work with Windows XP which is the system in my computer. The only way to make it work, is to buy a new computer.
0783225482|5.0|This is an Awesome movie.  One of my favorites.  No issues with quality or shipping.  Great as a gift or for yourself.
1400062756|5.0|I see alreaday a change in the athlètes that I train and I have not finished the book yet.<br />Thank you Louis Graveline
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I enjoy Facebook, but I have a hard time navigating.  It kicks me out when I'm just trying to get back to the news feed.  I also have a hard time finding features that used to be easy since they updated the last few times.
141694737X|5.0|A classic!  The flaps are surprisingly sturdy.  This book 'taught' my daughter animals sounds.  She still likes it at 2.5 year old.  Now she is starting to get the 'humor' in it rather than just being excited by the hidden animals.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I am hooked on all things Marvel comics can come up with...I love this show!  I watch the shows on my ROKU, at $1.99 per episode.  It is worth it not to have all those commercials!
B008JFUPPI|5.0|Was well worth the wait for the movie.<br />Love a good laugh this movie will give you that ...... .
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|this app was totally worth it I would recommend this to anyone who is in to world war two or just likes guns
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game because I played it on the xbox and it is aventris<br />lots of guns<br />monsters<br />blooks<br />pepol
B00BD99JMW|1.0|THERE WILL BE NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.<br /><br />It's been said that the ending is controversial. My daughter and I have been reading these books together. I finished first.  I suggested to her that she not finish and whatever way she thinks it ends to walk away with that thought. I know that's almost impossible to do and so did she. She finished it and she and her friends didn't like it much either, though clearly I had the more visceral reaction. It reminded me of The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King. Another really unexpected and disappointing ending. At least he had the courtesy of pausing and telling the reader &#34;my ending is not your ending &#34;(more or less what I told my daughter) and I didn't heed his warning any more than my daughter did mine.  In the end it's the authors story to tell but I just don't see why she made some if the choices she did. I finished these books not wanting to read anything more by Veronica Roth. All just a matter of taste and as an avid reader I probably have a &#34;type&#34;. This was it until Allegiant.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Ok game but hidden objects are too small and hard to find due to the fact that they are sometimes hidden behind things
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Shameful. This movie is completely contrary to every message in the book. I just wish it wasn't called World War Z and then maybe I would have been able to enjoy some of it. Unfortunately, I completely hated it.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Watched this movie with grandchildren ages 6, 5 & 3. They loved it! I'm sure it will be watched many more times.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book went off on a tangent and while very emotional, I don't think there was justice for the main characters.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is the best!  How iconic and fun and campy can you get.  I can't wait for the new movie!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|The GoPro HERO3 LCD Touch BacPac turns the GoPro camera into a nice camcorder. It is so convenient to see what you are aiming the camera at, and then be able to play it back on the spot.  I am not sure what impact it has on battery life because I like to always use it.  It seems like the GoPro camera is best with some spare batteries anyway.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Doctor Who is the best!  How iconic and fun and campy can you get.  I can't wait for the new movie!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show ever! I loooooove that I can get it on here when I dont get a chance to watch it at home and the fact that I can download it makes me happy, happy, happy!!!
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Doctor Who is the best!  How iconic and fun and campy can you get.  I can't wait for the new movie!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love horses and this is a cute game, very realistic, and very easy to play. I like everything - from the design, the coin system, the tasks... but I simply hate the advertisement that pops up on it after every time I groom the horse, or compete, etc. So I will probably delete it because I just can't deal with those every single minute of the game. If you can't stand the apps, just don't get this game.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I know a lot of songs but just don't know the titles much of the time.  This app has worked every time .  It is simple to use and responds immediately.  I suppose I could work on my memory, but this is so much easier.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Not bad for a short story but feels incomplete. This story came up short feels as if it ended in the middle.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down, just like the other 2!  This is one of the only books I've ever pre-ordered and it was well worth it.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Book is just okay nothing great.  Story line is good but Morgan Rice does not take it where it would have made the book a real good read.
1593272782|5.0|The photos shown in the book are nicely done.  My grandson was interested in building Legos that incorporate motors.  Using Ebay I purchased the necessary parts shown in the photos.  He and I spend many hours duplicating the ideas found in this book.  It has even led to development of his own ideas.  Too bad Lego decided to move away from &#34;Technic&#34;
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Bought this for my Mom for an early Christmas present. She has been watching it every day and other family members are concerned she isn't going to make Thanksgiving dinner on the account she is holed up watching Colombo every day.<br /><br />I may have to buy pizzas for twenty for Thanksgiving, as I am being blamed for feeding Mom's Columbo addiction. A family intervention may be in order.<br /><br />Seriously, for a Columbo fan, this makes a wonderful gift. 100 hours of Columbo.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Love The movie was great Action Scenes are tha best can't wait for another movie!!!!! Loved it more 007 Movies Please
B00DSO9RMC|1.0|This was a very big disappointment and a far cry from the glories of books like Interesting Times or Small Gods. There was no trace of humour anywhere in this book, which astonished me as Pratchett is one of the funniest writers ever. It was as if this was written by someone who had studied the Discworld series and knew all the characters but who had none of Pratchett's wit or imagination or facility with words. It was just a straight-forward and not very interesting story about not very interesting people, told without satire, humour or Pratchett&#34;s usual social commentary. The last few books in this series have been poor but this was a new low from one of my favourite writers. Sadly, this was a waste of time and money.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Looks fun and great it would be even better if I could download it on my kindle fire hd but no it won't let me every time I try so I just give up!!!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I can keep my whole family updated on our busy schedule :)  Everyone always knows what is on the agenda.
B005ML9YOU|5.0|Always been a avid reader of Sherlock Holmes, and the Kindle version makes it possible for me to take them with me everywhere.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun game. It would be more fun if I really knew what I was doing. I like it.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I love all the songs on this album.  He is so crafty and intelligent when he flows and he is always telling a story.  Makes you WANT to listen!
B00E9A656K|5.0|Fun and exciting if you like fixing up and drag racing you will like this game you gotta win to replace parts to make your car faster.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|I don't know if this book is for everyone, but I loved it. I was sorry when it ended. It was a perfect storm. I'm a sucker for Victorian novels, beautiful writing, intricate puzzles, and books that I can submerge myself into for an endless journey. Incidentally, I don't know a thing about astrology and essentially missed that part of it, but I can't say that bothered me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a GREAT book. Once again, King delivers. Without going into the story, I did think it got a little preachy about alcoholism at times (although, that was part of the story). Otherwise, exceptional.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I liked it but it seemed the author run out of ideas at the end.  I loved the ending as it is realistic.
B00G9U7NEQ|3.0|It was good but not laugh out loud, like the first two Shrek movies. I would recommend it for kids from 5 to 13.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Any book written by John Grisham is great.  I have read everyone of them. It was difficult to put down.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|While not humorous or lighthearted like &#34;Shawn of the Dead&#34; or &#34;Zombieland&#34;, the movie was entertaining with lots of bloody action, if that's your sort of thing.  The spread of a highly contagious, deadly virus causing people to turn into blood-thirsty spreaders of disease...a classic combination.  I liked it, but didn't love it...
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Lady Gaga's latest album, ARTPOP, is a balanced display of expression and musicality. Longtime fans of Mother Monster will appreciated the growth that Gaga displays in this album; some of the songs (&#34;MANiCURE,&#34; &#34;Applause,&#34; &#34;Fashion!,&#34; etc.) are reminiscent of the first two albums, The Fame and The Fame Monster, while other songs (&#34;Sexxx Dreams,&#34; &#34;Swine,&#34; &#34;Donatella&#34;) more closely mirror the anthem-like songs of the Born This Way album. The remainder of ARTPOP's songs have a completely new, evolved quality that we haven't seen from Lady Gaga. Some of these are very heavy with mature subject matter (&#34;Swine,&#34; &#34;Dope); some (&#34;Aura,&#34; &#34;Artpop&#34;) push the boundaries of musical genre, which I feel is one of the main themes of ARTPOP: breaking down musical barriers and blending the ideas of pop culture and aesthetic art into one living, thriving entity.<br />If you're a fan of Gaga, then I promise you won't be disappointed with this latest installment. If you're new to Gaga, then I suggest maybe starting with The Fame Monster album before diving straight into the more complex ARTPOP. The true beauty of this album is sitting down and listening to it start to finish. The producers of it coordinated the order of the songs to make it flow and blend truly like a work of art. Overall, Gaga's most artistic and eloquent album to date.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|The movie was a bit depressing for most of it.  I also felt it wasn't one of Denzel's best performances.  It was a solid or good movie but certainly isn't going to be on anyone's list of favorite movies.
B001G8XON0|5.0|I would call this film a tragicomic cinematic pop opera. Australian Baz Luhrmann (who also directed one of my all-time favorite films, Strictly Ballroom) goes over the top with Moulin Rouge.  The film is lavish and fast-moving, almost frenetic at first, demanding a looseness of the audience.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and yet, by the end, assisted by a great musical score, its sweet message goes home to the heart – love ultimately triumphs over money.
B0081336FO|4.0|It was a different, modern take on an old classic theme.  Kept me wondering what unique twist they were going to come up with next.  The actors do a fine job bringing out their characters individual traits.  Fun to watch.
B004FECNIO|5.0|It is said that good art is that which allows you to experience your own experience.  By that criteria, this film was an excellent work of art for me.  As I sat through the film I went from interest, to becoming engrossed, to thinking it was weird, to feeling deeply sad.  As I reflected on the story, David (the mechanical android) represented for me modern humanity's children, so in a sense all of humanity.  At some juncture, we humans began treating our children as androids, using them to fulfill our own needs, and lost a sense of truly loving them.  David is programmed to love, and his search for love and protection in a harsh world is poignant.  When the vulnerable, misunderstood, long-suffering David becomes violent, I thought of Columbine and the many such events since then.  Though I sometimes find director Spielberg sentimental, I don't agree with many critics about the &#34;soft&#34; ending of A.I.  To me it meant that one day of love, one experience of being truly loved, is remarkably healing, easing the restless place inside a person, and is desperately needed by every human being.
B008602KQI|4.0|Great plot, but I don't understand how a highly industrialized society still depends on coal.  It seems those big space ships are run on nuclear power or some other energy souce, not coal.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I thought it would be perfectly awful, but somehow it wasn't nearly so bad as I thought it might be.
B000GX8B9I|5.0|Less we forget their sacrifices...some conflicts receive less news than others so we tend to forget. We must never let this happen to any of our Nation's fallen heroes.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game to play. Have it on my phone, iPad, and Kindle Fire. Have fun with it every day. Get it.
B003QSOE0U|5.0|Used for instructional purposes...it painted a picture that words have a difficult time painted. Great historical reminder for our youth
B001NEK2GE|5.0|My primary use for this is not gaming, but rather running Adobe Illustrator and FlexiSign in a graphic production setting. The ergonomic profile makes it very nice. 90% of the functions I use can be accessed one-handedly via the hotkeys.<br /><br />The joystick functions as the arrow keys would. I have the shift/ctrl/alt modifiers programmed. Also common hotkeys like the pen tool, layers panel, color panel, appearance panel, type modifiers, space bar, cut/paste, zoom. That sort of stuff.<br /><br />The ability to program hotkeys on the fly is also useful, since in a production setting I'm often doing repetitive bulk order stuff.. I generally leave the LCD turned to the CPU/RAM monitor applet, just because it makes my non-technical coworkers and boss think I'm like some kind of technical savant. heh. I may never use the full capability of this keyboard. There are 3 macro sets PER PROFILE. So that means you have something like 28 buttons times 3. So you can have your Illustrator profile, with your 3 macro sets. It's like profile inception.<br /><br />But yeah. Form, function, price. Whenever I have to do graphics and I don't have my G13, I feel like a part of me is missing.
B002VECM6S|5.0|When you see this movie it tears at thr heart.  It makes you realize that for many the world is not roses, but to see one person overcome all this makes you want to hope for others.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  THIS SHOW!!!  if you haven't watched it you must.  Wonderfully written, preformed and the visuals take you to another time.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I  have always been a Star Trek fan so this was very enjoyable.  It has some ties to the original  Star Trek movies so when you see it  you will know what I am talking about if you are an old fan too..
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|Great music. Stays with you all day. Its a must have. Well worth it to buy. And its very up beat
B008JFUR10|5.0|What a great popcorn movie!  The good guys  against the bad guys, and you get to watch them beat the **** out of each other. The movie is just fun to watch, so pop the corn and get ready!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read in a long time. The way King writes about this tragic day from a 3rd party perspective is amazing. The journey the main character, Jake, takes through the book is mind blowing. This book has so much history and just a really great tale of how everything used to be in the 50’s-60’s era. I would recommend this to any history buff and/or King fan. It’s quite a few pages and might take a while to get through but it’s more than worth it. I really hope King gets this one turned into a movie as well, as long it doesn’t stray from the book, it was be an awesome movie. I give many thanks to King for another well written book.
0553801503|5.0|If you have watched the series on television then you will know that it runs along the story from the books.  Good book series to read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is very easy to use and I love the built in devotionals.  The note taking function is very easy to use.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Great movie. My son has read all the books and he loved it! Would recommend this movie to anyone. Mom's and dad's will like it too.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Very very very funny.. Best season ever ...to sad because it's the last one... Long time took to met the mother xxxx
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Great story of time travel, intrigue, hot and frequent sex scenes (rate it X), fine prose. The eroticism can be a turn off for some, but the  book is a page-turner.
B008XCJ03K|4.0|I own two Passenger CDs and I love them both.  Let Her Go is an amazing song and I am starting to hear it on the radio now, which feels a bit like my secret has been leaked to the world.  Silly I know.  Amazing lyrics sung by the most uniquely amazing voice! And equally amazing music. Wonderful Band!  Totally recommend!
B001HBWY8M|5.0|What this girl wants is to watch this movie over and over.  Love the cast, the music, the pace, the fun.  Yes I think that is it.  This movie is just so much delicious fun!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I LOVE this game. The only reason I give it four stars is because it is So addicting, and It can get very hard. Also, It's annoying how you have to pay for power-ups.
B00AEBEQW8|4.0|Borrowed this book from the library for my two kids. This book reads as a litany of complaints by each used-and-abused crayon in a child's box. Cute, colorful illustrations, and each crayon has its own 'personality'. Nice change of pace from the usual kids' books, and helps kids learn their colors. Good for either gender. Worth the read, my kids LOVE it!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Very funny book. LOL for sure I would definitely recommend this book. I read it two times it's that good!
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Lady Gaga does it again. :) This will definitely please Gaga fans, and I think there are things here that will interest new fans as well. This takes the sound of Born This Way in a different, more evolved direction and includes themes that hearken back to The Fame. The sound of Artpop is eclectic and awesome: industrial, EDM, funk, 80s, hardcore rap. And it all works.<br /><br />The album opens with &#34;Aura,&#34; which sort of takes you down the rabbit hole. I'm iffy on &#34;Venus&#34; and the title track, &#34;Artpop&#34; (it's more downbeat), but literally every other track is incredible. &#34;Gypsy&#34; and &#34;Applause&#34; close out the album in a satisfying way. Every song will make you dance, and most of them will also make you think if you listen to the lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, Artpop is a great entry into Gaga's career! Get it!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game my kids like it alot its Great hopefully get to see more games like that keep it up :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent storytelling with great acting...fun to watch the good, the bad and the ugly. Highly enjoyable and I look forward to Season 4.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is very similar to the Facebook version, which I have been playing for over a year.  It is fun and very easy to play.  You can play and use many of the games features without using real cash.  However, you do have the option of purchasing items with cash.  If you are looking for neighbors, my ID is:  FAUYHPA.  I'm looking for neighbors that play daily.
B00EVW04PE|5.0|Awesome movie! Was funny and had lots of action. Like Channing and Jaime in this movie. A must see now!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham is a great writer.  He kind of floundered when he became so popular and seemed to push out books too quickly.  This one was well written, and intense.  I think there's another movie in this one.  The surprise ending was a surprise, but also expected if that can be true.  I would like to have known why the character &#34;Doyle&#34; hated Jake so much.  I've read every one of Grisham's books, so trying to remember who Doyle was from a previous book is a little impossible.  I think any Grisham fan would like this book.  I read it in on day.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book that tells a very good story.  Nice to catch up on what Jake was doing!  Always enjoy Grisham's writing.
B00821OX98|4.0|I just started to watch this TV show and I like it.  I have liked other shows with Noah Wyle so I thought I would give this a try.  I watch a few episodes in season 3 so I am going back to start in the beginning.
B000P2A3WI|3.0|A warm novel that deals with themes like suicide, friendship, loneliness and hope from a funny perspective. It´s fine for a summer weekend.
B00BKZUVGM|3.0|the ending was shit the rest of the book was not like the first just average typical ending no excitement
B00FRMDH7Y|4.0|The movie was very easy to download, no problems. Loved the movie, great picture quality, but the ending was very predictable.
B00DWVOPHI|5.0|Ok Who/Pete Townshend fans, time to shell out for &#34;Tommy&#34; AGAIN...  Yes all, you have purchased the LP's back in the day, you bought the CD in the 80's, you bought it again in 1996 as part of the remaster program and you bought in 2003 for the &#34;Deluxe&#34; version which included some demos and outtakes.  But, buy it again as this version is beautiful and sounds good.  The Demos disc has been a real highlight for me and hearing Pete sing all the tracks has been really fascinating.  So far I've played it more than Tommy itself!  The live disc is also good to have but not essential since live Tommy from the 60's has been out before.  The book is absolutely gorgeous and informative with the really nice photos and artwork (along with all lyrics) but a nice essay from Pete would have been nice also.  The Blu-ray disc is pretty cool.  I did not make it through the entire disc due to time restraints but it is great - I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />One complaint I have is that this is allegedly the definitive &#34;Tommy&#34; but you will have to hold onto your 2003 &#34;Deluxe&#34; version as it includes a few outtakes not included here.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|If you don't keep killing the animal, you have to wait awhile before you can continue playing.  We prefer games you can play continuously.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Great melody and meaningful lyrics. One of the rare albums you can listen to cover to cover. I recommend it to everyone I know
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I don't have to buy a kindle, but I can have it on my phone and still read the same books.  My phone doesn't hold as many books as a kindle would I am sure.  But it does help me finish my books before I can start reading more.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Love this movie they really entertain you has a lot of action not noting at all I plan yo purchase the others yea
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It was easy to download, movie was good, good picture quality, but the ending was predictable.  We enjoy this movie overall.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Is is easy to bring up and it makes you think. The size of the tiles is just right and easy to see.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|The second season does not disappoint.  Sexy and brilliant, every episode will leave you begging for more!  Fantastic TV series!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wonderful book and a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy. Kept my attention the whole time, crazy wild ride. Highly recommended!!!!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Smart, funny, sexy, and very entertaining.  Great writing and excellent casting make this show one of my all time favorites!
B000001DTM|5.0|One of the greatest collections of songs ever made.  Now my heart is still with the Joshua Tree, but this is right behind that album.  I can safely say that I miss this kind of music (containing relevant messages within the lyrics).  U2 still remains one of the greatest bands to ever bless the ears of the masses.  And don't ever try to compare Coldplay to these geniuses.  I'm a Coldplay fan, but not because of the lyrics.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Amazing and so much fun it messes up though on my kindle fire HD it goes slow and the pictures start to mess up
B000INAXGU|5.0|I'll tell you that I am a deep fan of Jamiroquai and love this album, even though I have all their albums already, but it still bothers me when (for whatever reason, money, boredom, etc.) a band makes a &#34;best of&#34; or &#34;singles&#34; album well before they've either broken up or retired.  Now for those who are behind on this band who was considered a one hit wonder after releasing &#34;Virtual Insanity.&#34; This would be a great starter album, but after listening to this I recommend that you consider collecting the rest of the albums, as they are collectively and individually bloody brilliant!
B00140PK6O|4.0|My wife and I are big fans of English period pieces, especially the Ninteenth century.  We love most of the Jane Austen works, and quite a few others.  However, I only gave this four stars because it just wasn't quite right for me.<br /><br />In my favorite English dramas, there is either a great, passionate romance to be consumated, or a deep, dark secret to be revealed, or a complex mystery to be solved.  Cranford didn't have any of these.  What Cranford did offer was an interesting slice of life from the 1840s.  However, for my tastes, it included too many unconnected small stories, entertaining as they may have been (some were quite entertaining).  And I was hoping for one great story.<br /><br />However, my wife really liked this.  Also, we got a good price, and this is packaged nicely.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is amazing! IF you want to lose weight do this 5 days a week and you will lose it all. Great start to the day. Best part it is only 20 minutes a day and she really works you out!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so addicting I could not keep my hands off th game if you are into boxing this is for you but it is a . Little frustrating at sometimes overall I love it
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|This a delight throughout.  It makes Shakespeare's work now and understandable and funny.  Thank you Joss Whedon for a wonderful movie.
B007Z9R9C6|3.0|This movie has no meaning, but pretend that it does. Main supporting role is also difficult to believe. If the main actor was at best below-average looking, maybe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As I have found this game is very addictive.  I try to get 3 stars on all the scenes which is a challenge on some.  I like the fact that I only need to play getting 1 star but is a challenge to get 3 stars.  I really don't understand about the lives.  I paid for 1 time to get lives and I don't think I got any.  This is the only thing I don't like is having to wait between games to get more lives.
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|Sometimes we think that we know the meaning of life but the author pushes us to think deeper. Going through the stories with the three main characters provokes more thoughts along the line. I did not give it a five star as I found that during the middle stage, I sort of able to guess the ending (though not exactly the same as the real ending). Overall, I think it is a good book.
B009G41CG2|3.0|I've got a number of mahjong games on my kindle and really didn't like this one.  I still have a number to play but found this one wasn't very much fun.
B001NA6096|5.0|romantic but not mushy; part of a trilogy, the series is all worth watching.  I wish there could be more of them.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|This book PROVES that I am naive and I am too gullible.  My fault, it was a load of rubbish
B004IPPINW|4.0|intriguing and interesting; thought provoking and well written.  an unusual book and point of view. Is a book that makes the reader work at what is happening: who is the character speaking, who is the character listening, and what will really happen?  what are our instinctual  responses to this: based on prejudice and history, or based on real information.  Could make a great movie, I think.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Absolutely groundbreakingly awesome series.  Characters are multidimentional and complex. Action is edgy and over the top. One of my all time favs.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I love this show. The premise may not be new, but this is a wild exciting ride. Great acting by the lead character(s).
0142407542|5.0|My family absolutely love this story! My daughters asks for it often, I would highly recommend it, it's a cute story.
B007ME5BUG|3.0|Antony Beevor is a wonderful author.  His writing is easy to follow and he makes his points clearly and concisely.  As a historian he is excellent and covers many historic issues others either avoid or gloss over.  The author can see many issues more clearly than other historians.  For example, he is exceptional in his discussions of Churchill's strengths and weaknesses.  Antony Beevor also recognizes the importance of the several conferences held by the Allied powers during WWII and how the men attending these conferences set the main strategy for the Allies and what the consequences of those discussions were.  The best part of Mr. Beevor's work is he has no illusions about the politicians or the politics that directed the war.  His insight is cool and without bias.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars?<br /><br />The Second World War concentrates far too much on the tortures and rapes committed by the soldiers.  I am glad he does not gloss over these tragedies; however, after reading page after page of horror stories it just gets to be too much.  The suffering from the bombing attacks is also covered in detail, especially the fire bombings, which was necessary but once again a bit much.<br /><br />One of my biggest complaints is his handling of the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese.  MacArthur totally mishandled the preparations for this assault and the direction of the defense after the Japanese had landed.  Bataan was not stocked with food and medical supplies and ammunition before the Japanese struck even though MacArthur had YEARS to prepare.  He even had time to transfer the medical and food supplies he would need for a siege after the Japanese assaults on Pearl Harbor and his own units.  His incompetence in handling the defense of the Philippines should have resulted in his court martial.  It certainly resulted in the loss of thousands of American and Philippine lives.  Mr. Beevor fails to even talk about this.  It is a major flaw in his book.<br /><br />The maps are substandard and there are too few of them.  All the temperatures are in Centigrade and the distances are in Kilometers.  There is NO indication of what these are in standard American units of measure.  It should have been very easy to put the distances and temperatures in brackets, but this was not done.<br /><br />The other major flaw is a lack of explanations about why some things were done.  Mr. Beevor tells us about Japanese war crimes including the systemic killing of locals for food and medical experiments on civilians, and he informs us that the Japanese were not prosecuted for these crimes.  But he never talks about WHY they were not prosecuted.  This occurs in several places in the book and on several important issues.  If there is no information as to why he should say that in his book.<br /><br />My edition was electronic on the Kindle.<br /><br />AD2The maps are substandard and there are too few of them.

B004YXE438|5.0|I like jigsaw puzzles, so I thought I'd try this game and I am so happy I did. I only play huge (48 pieces) and hard (no edges highlighted) as I enjoy the challenge, but others may like that there are easier options. And expansion packs of more images are available too.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Ms.Grout wrote a book that is easy to read, understand and enjoy.  Even though the topic is &#34;heavy&#34; she has mixed serious content with laugh-out-loud humor.  I think this book is a real &#34;sleeper&#34; and would interest anyone with an inquisitive mind.  Highly recommend.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This was/is a favorite book of mine and was a requested gift for the grandchildren.  Everyone enjoyed it, of course.  What's not to like with the catchy tunes and likable characters.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|I read this 15 or 20 years ago, so am re-reading. I was reminded of it on a recent trip to New Orleans, where I encountered the Ignatius J. Reilly bronze (?) statue on Canal Street. It's a hoot.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Superb writing, suspenseful storyline. I like the characters that were first in A Time to Kill, which is my favorite Grisham book.
B00B5HQL50|1.0|I would LOVE to rate this movie!  I've been trying to get it through Amazon Streaming for weeks.  Every time I start to watch SKYFALL it  &#34;pixelates&#34; , the sound is not in unison with the motion, it fades to black, and any number of irritating things that force me to turn off the movie.  I  reported it to a techy at Amazon--a very NICE and HELPFUL fellow but we could not get anything positive accomplished--I DO believe HE  did all things right  and that it is AMAZON'S STREAMING system that needs fixing.  I'm starting to wonder if this is a way to get people to BUY the movie out of shear frustration.  I know other friends who have the same problem.
B00902AKK4|5.0|Fun and creative game. Not too hard, but challenging enough to help yor problem solving ability. My grandson really enjoys playing it, so I'm happy!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I chose it because you do not include zero stars.  If this is what passes for writing in a culture that produced Henry David Thoreau, John Steinbeck and Langston Hughes, then it is no wonder that more and more Americans are turning to electronic devices and the games they offer to kill their time. This killed my time like fur traders kill seals.
1781162646|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this one. Am a true Stephen King fan anyway. However I did not find this to be the usual far out there stuff that most of his books are. But it made for a really good story. Keep 'em coming Mr. King.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great free app comes in handy every month when the bills are due should have downloaded it sooner I use it a lot
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Lovely book, fun, lighthearted and romantic. An easy and enjoyable read. A great book club choice. Highly recommend it. :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is one for the times and a must read for children maybe 6th grade an up.  It's a lesson about NOT repeating history, kids!  This book is also appropriate for anyone 80+ years of age.  The writing style/voice is unique and catches you &#34;thinking&#34; every time the narrator comments on the state of humans and human nature.  Can't wait for the movie!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although this series has been out for awhile, the new movie of the first book premiered this month and I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  The book has some interesting back-stories missing from the movie and helps establish Orson Scott Card's premise for the next in the series, &#34;Speaker For The Dead, &#34; which he says was the book he wanted to write but needed a prequel.  Ender's Game is the prequel.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Outstanding drama!  We have had to ration ourselves to watch only one episode per night. It is so intriguing and contemporary involving the viewer in every twist and turn.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I was surprised to find this book to be as good as it was. I haven't seen this book at any book stores, but it was better than some that I got there. I just wished that this book included a map of the landscape, because I think it would be helpful to see all of the area in scale. Even without a map, this book is fantastic and I can't wait to read book two of the series!
030759565X|5.0|I received this book for Christmas this year, and I can honestly say it is my favorite cookbook. The recipes are amazing and pretty easy to make. The alfredo sauce beats most restaurants and the brisket is seems way more impressive for the amount of effort you put into it. I recommend this cookbook to anyone that wants to branch out their cooking skills.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Can't go wrong with Reacher.  I need to get the next one ASAP .  This is a very enjoyable character and the stories are always on the edge of your seat reading.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book and plot.  You can see the people from the original book and movie.....Hope they do this one into a movie soon....
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I honestly just purchased this game cuz it was free and I got free coins as well. After playing it tho I am hooked. I'm constantly trying to beat my top score on the 5 minute mode. Def not what I expected, much better!
0811879542|5.0|Very creative; I have never read a children's book like this before.  Great for encouraging participation- I wish that I could see how my friend's children respond.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|A great movie which portrays life aboard a man-o-war during the Napoleonic era. The hardships and daily difficulties are almost overlooked however as Crowe shows us what a Captain with savory seamanship and sparkling guile can do. This, to me, is Crowe's best performance.
1595827684|5.0|A must have for any Bioware fan If you love their art, you will get everything you want and more!
B005UKK4Y2|1.0|Not at all what I expected. A lot of unnecessary cursing. Not funny. Do not waste your money.<br />Preview was the funniest part.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As usual G5 games are the best. Others complain about the deceptive cost, but  by now everyone should know they are not free. But for $5 it a lot of fun.
0425238091|2.0|I was recommended this book as a medical student to read and give some perspective during our time on the wards as students and residents. I was intrigued because it was written by a health care professional based on his work at a top-tier hospital (Ivy leage affiliated).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: this book was just OK. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but other health care professionals looking to see what &#34;life was like&#34; before residency hour restrictions and focus on abuse.<br /><br />First, I don't find the prose to be all that great, but then it is written by a doctor so I shouldn't have been expected that much. My other big problem is it is hard to determine what is real and what is made up. I have no doubt that Shem is drawing from personal experienced but he seems to flow between what is real and what is unreal too casually. I also consider myself pretty open-minded but there is A LOT of sex in this book. If that stuff bothers you, buyer beware. I have never found myself WANTING a book to end as I did in this case, like a bad movie that you only watch to see how the plot ends.
B00ARN0ZF0|1.0|Worst one since the second. Boring for most of the movie with unnecessary, but predictable ending. Would not see again.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|it is always timeless, john hughes again had his finger on the pulse of youth.  love the seen where grace ( rooney's secretary) is sniffing the liquid eraser!! that always gets me
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Acting was great, punch lines were funny and the vocals were surprisingly good. No complaints at all here with this choice.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn's style. She never disappoints. All of her books keep you guessing. By the end you have changes your theory a dozen times.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I am a fan of the comic strip characters and watch all the Marvel comics movies that come out for us fans. It has a good story line with lots of action and special effects.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This is a cleverly well written movie, with awesome acting. Tim Allen played his part perfectly! Very fun movie to watch.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Seriously Funny Book with a great twist at the end! Can't wait to read the rest of the Rose Gardner series.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I didn't love it. It felt a bit monotonous; therefore, a bit too long. I could have done without the chapters of the groupies, but in real life, zealots and odd people would cling to someone like Harold and his pilgrimage to accomplish some unknown purpose. However, since it is fiction, I would have preferred Harold to not have encountered this group of misfits. To me this group felt like unnecessary filler in a book that didn't need fluff. I more enjoyed Harold's solitary encounters and learnings from the people he met, his self-reflection on his life, his physical and emotional struggles, his personal growth and his closure.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm think candy crush saga is a good game to play with friends have a great time. Yes I think that they can do a little better. The only thing that bugs me is the fact that you have to have a Facebook account to ask for tickets, life's and what not. I don't it's fair because many people do not have a Facebook account and it just not fair to me (my opinion).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome buy it totally worth it! recommend to anyone who likes a challenging game :) but you do need a facebook account though :( has to get one in order to play.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game has a hard time figuring it out but once I did had a blast playing it check it out you will love it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just read it. I wish I could write and see and notice the universe as she does. This is a beautiful story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|On my new kindle fire and can check things out quickly to see what is going on. Now on can check on DWTS right away.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game has wonderful physics and puzzle aspects. The relaxing and gentle soundtrack goes perfectly with the game.  This is worth every penny.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Well presented.  One can almost taste the bittersweet relationship between Elizabeth and Henry.  One almost wishes to reach out and<br />help both of them!
B0035HKWM6|5.0|Was amazing  I like this move one of the best I watch it in past and I watch it now
B0041D843M|4.0|The Campbells share the fruits of a fascinating career of research into the connections between health and diet, concluding with a strong argument for embracing a whole-food plant-based diet.<br /><br />It's unlikely that more than a tiny minority of Americans will find such an eating plan sufficiently to their liking to stick with it. I doubt I will, though I'm trying out a lot of plant-based foods that I previously wouldn't have given any consideration to.<br /><br />I'm a medical doctor with considerable experience in reading and interpreting scientific literature. As I was reading the book, I had the impression that the author was falling into the very trap he warned against in one section of cherry-picking results that agree with his thesis, results with statistical significance but probably not corrected for the bias of multiple testing. In fact, he seems to revel in the huge number of correlations that he tested for in his dataset. When I searched the internet to see if others had a similar impression, I found that a cottage industry seems to have sprung up delving into his analysis and calling some of it into question.<br /><br />I cannot find any serious fault with those who aim to follow a whole-food plant-based diet, whether on ethical or other grounds. Please be sure to take supplemental vitamin B-12, which cannot be derived from such a diet. However, there is still a crying need for better guidance for the 99% who will not follow this method, yet want to optimize their vitality and longevity through eating. Willett's &#34;Eat, Drink and Be Healthy&#34; is a good start in that direction.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Loved this. I couldn't see how she would ever get herself out of this terrifying journey (maybe she didn't) as everybody, literally everybody else in the story was on the dark side. Great scene-setting, crisp dialogue, and sinister characters throughout. Must read some more of his stuff! Recommended.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am really enjoying this so far. Just got it today but can't stop playing! Works really well on my Kindle. Trying to keep my mind active!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel was nominated for best actor and he should have won. Fabulous movie! Great character study and acting is superb.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I couldn't put it down, the characters and situations are compelling, you won't notice the length. It is a great read

B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed is a novel about the many forms of love and how that love impacts a life.  I highly recommend it.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Even though I have studied a ton of personal growth, energy healing and relationship books and classes. I must say this book brings new insight into the relationship between man and woman. The examples, the theories, and the exercises are incredibly valuable to resolve a ton of problems between couples. Wish I read this book 6-10 years ago.  That was the problem! Even though I had 2 masters degrees, traveled many places, and worked many businesses, I was still blind about many things. And I did not know how blind I was.  We don't know what we don't know!<br /><br />To make the the matters worse, we don't always learn the right lessons from our experiences without consciously seeking personal improvement!  It is like if we screw up doing something, instead of learning what to do to succeed, we often learn the lesson, based on our fear of failure, don't do it, it's not for me.<br /><br />That's why so many people fail their marriages over and over again, even though you'd think they must have learned from their experiences. Or some people learn &#34;marriage is not for me&#34;, so they don't try it anymore.  It's like if you got sick eating something once, you concluded never to eat that thing again, without finding out why.<br /><br /> Mistakes are never the problem, refusing to learn is.  If you think your relationship can be improved, this is a must book to read!  If you think changing parter will solve your problem, you are wrong!  Because whatever the problems we have in any relationship, are the same as the successes we have in a relationship . They are the result of team work! That means we are partially responsible for it. As far as which part, that is for us to face the issues to find out.  So that we don't bring our unresolved problems to our next relationship.<br /><br />Marriage and Divorce are just ways to accomplish something, hopefully in the long run better for everyone involved.

That means, we must take initiatives to better ourselves and our lives. Nobody will require us to do so.  We are our own masters, like it or not.<br /><br />If after going through this with your partner, you are still not getting the expected result, at least you will be more conscious about what is really going on.  What the problem really is.  Then you can make a better decision with your partner what to do.  Through the process, you will become an emotionally stronger and more conscious person.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|We read this book as a family and really enjoyed the fast pace and discussion that followed.  I would recommend this book for the age appropriate audience.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|This is an excellent movie with great acting. It has a surprise ending and keeps your interest all the way. I'm not even a Sean Penn fan, but he was excellent.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My 8 year old and 9 year old are addicted to this game. It would be nice if multiplayer connected easier, they sit on 2 devices 2 feet from each other and the app won't connect the devices. They also can't figured out how to connect them to my facebook page...
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Hadn't seen this ina few years, had forgotten what a great job Michael Keaton does. 25 years old and I felt like I was watching it for the first time, didn't remember some scenes.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This has quickly become one of my favorite apps. Very addicting and easy to use. Plus the background music is very relaxing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was such an amazing book!! It shows so much detail you feel like you are actually there with katniss. This is definitely my favorite book from the trilogy!!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Give me a break.  How could they put this midget in a movie and try to palm him off as Jack Reacher?<br />Beyond lame. Flick is VERY forgettable ... pass on it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I'm just getting into the Marvel superheroes movies, and I wish I had gotten into them sooner! Thor is a fantastic installment and you will be riveted from beginning to end. And Chris Hemsworth is absolutely perfect as Thor. Eye candy for days!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|One of the best TV series ever created.  We are on our second time thru and all my kids love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and pray they keep it going. Amazon Prime is an awesome product. It's easy to use and very nice.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Well, since art is such a personal thing, I'm not going to rate the movie per se.  If you're reading this review, chances are that you have already seen the movie and are thinking about buying this version.  The sound and visuals are excellent and I found the blu-ray edition  more involving that the older version.  On my TV and surround system, the colors were more vivid and the sound cleaner; it was easy to understand every word of dialogue and I didn't notice any ghosts or pixelation (sp?).  If you enjoyed this movie in other formats, I'm sure you'll enjoy it more in Blu-ray.  Life is a Cabaret, old chum, come to the Cabaret.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've been a star trek fan forever.  I loved the first movie and this one did not disappoint.  If you aren't into star trek this probably won't be your cup of tea, but if you are you will surely love it.  Great quality, great action, great movie.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The story was really good but I got a feel for very few of the characters because there were so many! Hard to keep them straight but I will definitely read as many volumes of this series Mr Martin cares to write!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Hadn't seen this movie before I purchased the dvd.  It was good (not great), kept your attention, and was a different take on the zombie movie, which I haven't decided if I like.  Good quality and good purchase.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Good if your a little squeaker ( little kid ) but I'm 17 so I lost interest in this quick. What's the point of this game?? All's you do is build stuff kinda lame
B00D2K40WY|3.0|its ok I mean it could be way better no offended its just not my favorite game to play sorry
B004H0M8EA|5.0|A very interesting book on an important subject.  A lot of history about previous settlement that had problems with their living environment.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I was a bit thrown off that there weren't any pictures in this book. Maybe it's because I read it on Kindle, but really? Sometimes you just need a picture for the story to really come to life.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|Delightful to look at, delightful to hold, but when I read the blurb, We had to mark it &#34;Sold&#34; !
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addictive.  Don't download if you are a busy person, since all you are going to want to do is play this game.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This wonderful movie continued the Star Trek tradition. The actors portrayed the original characters so closely that once immersed in the movie, you could believe they were the actual younger versions!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great answer to the question, \\"Whatever happened to Danny\\". I used to read Stephen King a lot in my teens. As a mom, it was deliciously disturbing!
B005VPRG10|5.0|I bought this for my six year old grandson and his Mother said he loves it.  He uses his imagination, and with other Lego sets he has, does a whole war game on the living room floor.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I flew through this book and loved the ending! Even thought I have no love of racing this book kept me reading and intrigued.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|for a free so, there are plenty of sounds, and frequencies to guide your brain into deep meditation and deep dream sleep
B006LSZECO|2.0|Hated the ending. I took me 3 tries to get through the book. I don't see what all the fanfare was regarding this book!
0756407915|2.0|Patrick Rothfuss' writing is too predictable. Every time the protagonist has a major triumph, expect a defeat or tempered spoils.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Forget the story, whatever it is. Big creatures fighting big robots is just mindless fun. Best performances are from the supporting cast.
0756404746|2.0|Patrick Rothfuss' writing is too predictable. Every time the protagonist has a major triumph, expect a defeat or tempered spoils.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love it can't get enough. Non stop rush with twists and turns..keeps you guessing whats going to happen, you think you know then a curveball
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very interesting story, typical Grisham, plot well developed, characters come alive. Really cannot put it down you just want to get to the end.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Love the show its the greatest. Best written history drama I've seen in a long time. Wish it was still on
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|Not a grand cinematic masterpiece, but fun enough for the whole family to watch together, which isn't always easy to find.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fabulous and can't wait til next season!!! Love the way the plot thickened and particularly Shirley McLaine and her performance.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|A good read but sometimes I feel like the author draws too much to his own pseudo-profound insights into minutiae. The vivid descriptions really seem to transport you back a few decades and across the world into Shantaram's Bombay. But the unclear boundaries between fact and fiction leave me so curious as to what actually happened.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This version is alright...if you are using the PC version, It is much easier to move around,.  The Minecraft Pocket edition is fine for killing a little time for a while.  You can't build as well or as fast.
B005TBN04S|1.0|No movie has ever made me confront my mortality more than the Hangover Part II. I am a 22 year old man who thoroughly enjoyed The Hangover. But all I could think about while watching this pathetic sequel is the brevity of the human life. Like me, you are probably only getting older and closer to your inevitable demise, so use what precious time you have in any manner of ways other than viewing this film. This movie was a total waste of time.
B00AGH5LF6|4.0|Although it's not as good as the first Home Alone, it's still the perfect movie for the holiday season! A must see.
B000HF0ISC|4.0|this is the second time I've watched this movie.  the great advantage of advanced age (65+) is that after a few months watching any movie is &#34;like the first time!&#34;  truly, this is a top film at practically every level:  script, casting, acting, editing, etc.  the manipulation of the legal system by the four victims of perverse acts to exact revenge on the perpetrators tempts one to feel that &#34;justice&#34; was rendered.  let us not be ensnared by the devil for &#34;vengence is mine, saith the Lord, I will repay!&#34;
B003VANOFY|2.0|I liked these headphones when they worked, but they proved to be defective after 3 months.  For every hour of use, it will now cut out twice for about 15-30 seconds at a time.  It doesn't matter if they are plugged in or over WiFi.  Since its been over a month, I have to contact Logitech directly.  I will update when Logitech responds.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is challenging and fun.  However, you only get 4 or 5 tries at each stage, and then you are &#34;locked out&#34; for a day if you can't successfully move to the next level..
0345803507|1.0|the hype doesn't match the writing. This is not written well.  There are so many other books out there with the same subject matter that are so much better.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked it. Id recommend without a doubt. Wish there were some more levels. I cant wait until there are!
1401907725|1.0|i never got what what i paid for.all i got was a tracking number .it showed that the package was at at my post office.but when i went there they told me they have no record of it .so who dropped the ball?the seller or the post office.anyway the end result was the same i wound up with nothing!
B00EVW04PE|3.0|Channing Tatum, who gets better in every film, teams with President Jamie Foxx to fight terrorist's who capture White House. Strong quality production design, solid direction and a enjoyable yarn once you get over a contrived plot.  James Woods walks through his role as the bad guy and the reason for the takeover never rings even remotely true.  Tatum and Foxx are enjoyable outshining some stunted dialogue while it is hands down the greatest White House set ever created for film.<br />It's a Tuesday evening bowl of popcorn shoot'em up kinda deal that a better plot and script could have elevated to far, far better film.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|I was really disappointed in this film.  I felt betrayed.  Seeing them treat the Mandarin character as they did, and the extremis storyline was ruined. It felt as if this movie was just thrown together to have a vehicle for the next avenger film.
B000SEH80I|5.0|While my situation was covered in only a small portion of this book I found that I read the entire book voraciously and learned a lot. Ultimately, it always comes down to becoming a true adult and breaking free from patterns of behavior that were formed in reaction to over-controlling parents. The information and exercises in the book are invaluable in breaking free.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Best.  Show. Ever!  I love the characters, and the actors who play them. Jessica Lange and Zachary Quinto made this show.  The story was great, the acting awesome.  Not slow like the Walking Dead, and I love that show as well.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|addictive. funny graphics, kept passing my kindle back and forth with my dad trying to blow up the tanks. Not very good but fun to do. very easy to use, just touch the screen to relase the ball.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Just when I thought that nothing could top American Horror Story, season 2 comes out.  Again, another stellar cast performance.  Great writing, great acting,  great atmosphere.  Love this show.
B00902AKK4|5.0|This is very addicting. I am not so good at figuring out how to get around and love the screen that will come up and take you to a showing on how the level works then it's just me trying to make it happen.  I say Ahg!! a lot with my fat fingers over pushing a button... a lot of fun
B003THJA1G|5.0|Castle is highly entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.  I can't get enough of it!!!  I'm hooked!  I'm already in to season three.
B00EXVZW6E|4.0|Had fun, does what says try to find the object given a variety of ways pic, name outline.  just wish has a skip button, to keep going if a word or item don't know or can't find..maybe a button could push to show the item...Using these type of games to keep my brain active.
B008D36INE|3.0|Undecided how much I liked this movie.  The acting was very good from anyone, but the movie itself was so slow paced.
B008EL25LE|4.0|I'm not much of a gamer but trying to keep my mind going.  this provides you with various games in your journey so found fun to do and a bit addicting.
B00E9A656K|3.0|This game is fun. And for a free game that's all we can ask for on a free game. But this game could be a lot better. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is good for a drag racing game. A lack of cars is kind of a down note but again it's free. The thing that really gets me is how hard it's pushing me towards in app purchasing of points or cash. I have finished the first tier as they call it and can't progress really until I get another car. I am forced to grind away at an easy race to get enough money to get a tier two car. Which is made ever more difficult by the fact I can only do so many races before I have to wait to &quot;refuel&quot;. It's not a game breaker but it does kind of get old. Also not being able to participate in multiplayer till tier three also is annoying.<br /><br />It's not a bad game but it's not great. Solid three, worth a download if you're waiting for more energy in one of the other million free games that follow this annoying game mechanic.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Lots of different challenges are provided. You can choose what you like to do...haven't been thru all of them. I am challenged in so many ways...:)  but have enjoyed the diamond match, no time limit...haven't decided if that is a good thing or not, can lose track of time when doing it.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I didn't know that this was a game for very young children.  I am a senior citizen and have never had children.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game and is so addictive and fast pace I even got my grandbaby hooked working on my husband now
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|Headline prettt much sums up how i feel about rockets.  Its a more simple, and yet in the end more complicated, Angry Birds.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The ending was very good and I thought it was one of Grisham's better books.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Captivating, complex mystery....Love, lies, mystery, intrigue and deceit - this book has everything. It's amazing the lengths people will go to for love....HIghly recommended!
B007WZ55XI|4.0|This book is clearly written for those of us who like to use quantitative results–numbers–to motivate and guide our training. That said, I feel it can be a valuable learning resource even if you aren’t planning on using a power meter.<br /><br />Athletes need a schema, a way of looking at the process of building physical capacity to judge what next steps would benefit our development. The lens you use to view your workouts might be based on heart rate, perceived effort or power generated. This book lays a foundation based on power, but still adds a deeper understanding to heart rate and perceived effort training.<br /><br />I was impressed that there was real value if you just scanned it, read the text without trying to interrupt the charts, or studied the texts, examples and charts carefully. Each time I have gone through it I have seen increased benefit from my training time. It always helps me feel more grounded and motivated to approach my bike training with an eye to creating results that fit my goals and strengths.<br /><br />Even though I don’t race, it has also motivated me to get a power meter to improve my times in distance events.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|fantastic read that draws you into the story from the first chapter and keeps you hooked.  Rand gets her readers involved with her characters
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I like the reboot of the Star Trek Original Series they have done.  I really really admire the moviecraft of these two revamped versions of Star Trek.  I admit there is a bit more Star Wars implanted than I would  prefer, but at least that is done well and not overdone (barely).  As a long time Trekker who has attended a Star Trek convention more than once but who has never donned a costume, I have enjoyed both Star Trek the Movie and Star Trek Into Darkness.  Hope they make more and can sustain the quality of the first two.
0439882826|5.0|It looked brand new, on the outside. I didn't get to see the inside but I hope my boyfriend liked it. Thank you!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|The Coen Brothers are consistently great with their films. But this one is over the top for me and mine. Along with the humor is the great music put together by the one and only T. Bone Burnett. It is both a joy and an education featuring the finest talent around, along with songs that have a deep history in our culture! Yes! And thank you all! Peace
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Excellent album!  My favorite tracks are Reflektor, Supersymmetry and Afterlife.  I don't purchase albums unless I like at least 3 songs, and as I listen to the album I am enjoying more and more of them.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book filled in some of the questions that remained from Book 4 .  It gave us a look at what was happening to several of the main characters.  The characters are mostly charismatic and the reader truly wants to know what happens to them.<br />I find it difficult to follow so many characters with only a chapter here and then again many chapters later.  It is difficult also to see many of appear to be main characters killed off.<br />I do applaud the intensity and degree of thoughtfulness that goes into the descriptions.  Also love to \\"see\\" what is being thought and then what is actually said.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series has touched me as I am sure it has touched others.  So many of the emotional aspects of this story can be tied back to something in all of our lives.  Joys, fears, loss, courage and love.  We have the ability for all factions but our strengths may lay with certain ones more strongly.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A friend recommended I try this app. I have to say that I am enjoying the game. I would recommend it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This series had a gripping and engaging plot with a most talented collection of actors. Such creative writing . Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Quit and leys do something betyer<br /><br />Hooks you up then naggs about money to progress i am getting tired of the nag will stop playinuag
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book did not inspire me to read any more by this author, and I didn't even have the impulse to finish it.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I am having a terrible time trying to get into this book on my Kindle. It is not an easy start but, I need to give it another try. I have heard such great things!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hard, yet entertaining enough to keep you trying without throwing it.<br />I would recommend it to my friends. They will love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a love /hats relationship with this game. I'm totally addicted to it, but still haven't spent a penny on it.
0240808452|5.0|I've bought all the FORCE books. My Gesture Drawing for Animators is a little bit worn out cause I constantly go back to re read everything. I've read a lot of art books and a lot of them aproaches with the basic drawing the boxes and adding stuff, and blah blah. Force on the other hand is not just about copying the figure, but understanding how it works. It makes creating dynamic figures almost child's play, heck its one of the only art instruction books that actually goes in length to explain rhythm rather than spend one paragraph that basically say 'its the way the figure moves'.  I would stand by and say that they are one of the best art instructional books I've ever read. I've looked at some pages of The Art and Feel and the thing is I saw that there were 4 pages (maybe less) that appear to talk about Straight to Curve and if you've looked at any of Mattesi's learning materials, books and website, you would know how super important they are. 4 pages doesn't do justice to the method but I doubt it could cover a 1/10th of the whole idea of it especially when you see Mattesi's explainations of it. Do yourself a favor and throw all of Mattesi's books in your cart and then go to his website: drawingforce.com and subscribe to see videos of demonstrations and explanations of how to draw with FORCE.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Such an addicting story line, as a young adult novel the depth behind kami's writing is not particularly amazing bu tht estoryline will keep you hooked!  Definitely a fun read!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to navigate, is very helpful, always sends me to the correct site, and can even help with my spelling.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this just after a loss in our family and found it very comforting. Because this was written by a neurosurgeon, it had more credibility than most books of this type.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|If you need to wipe Singerman Returns from your memory banks? This Blockbuster is just the film to do it.<br /><br />I rank this film on par with Superman II. Henry Cavill did and outstanding job as Clark & Supes.<br />Henry Cavill's Clark Kent is charmingly similar to Smallville's Tom Welling's Clark Kent and his portrayal of Superman is reminiscent of Tim Daly's Superman of the CW's animated series. I give it 5 stars because it's a classic and a excellent Reboot film. The franchise has much to improve upon but it's a great beginning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and I have no computer this Is the closest game to the pc version yes this is made by mojang and is updating but it's not exactly pc version I hear rumors of the next update coming on November 25 and I have some ideas for future updates fix realms make it easier to change skins like on x box edition add new textures like for the trees and grass rotten flesh nether portal not just reactor end portal endermen usable redstone wolf's squids villagers and villages every item in creative from each gamemode so yeah those are my ideas btw thx
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like this book because it was interesting and it describes what catniss was seeing.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people that like violence.<br /><br />This book deserves five stars<br /><br />Meganegodley
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved Loved Loved It...amazing story well written kept me glued to my kindle read it 2 1/2 days!!! Don't take my work read it and see!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is my favorite tower defense game on the kindle fire. Good gameplay, nice soundtrack, and pretty of variety. With the 2$ easily!
1400069289|5.0|We read this book, bought copies for other people, and thoroughly recommend it to everyone.  Learn about how habits influence your life, for good and bad, and how you can change them or create new ones.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like the movie due to the overexposure of the two main stars....  But I was immediately grabbed by Aguilera's vocals.  My wife still gets the chills when Christina gets a chance to really rip into it midway through the film.  Ok, the story isn't Oscar material, but it is a fun watch, especially Stanley Tucci (can he do no wrong?).  They could have used the genius of Alan Cummings more, but ok.  Overall, definitely worth having in the movie collection.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|The 3D is horrible in this game. I wore my glasses for hours while playing and not once did I get the illusion of &#34;anything&#34; flying at me. And now the bridge of my nose is bruised from prolonged wear.....
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|I watched the first 20 minutes of the film and had no idea what was going on.  In fact, absolutely nothing was going on, so I turned it off.  Maybe it got better.  Other reviewers seemed to like it, but I thought it was never going anywhere and making no sense.  Too many things to do to watch a questionable movie.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|Seriously, what's not to love?! This is my favorite movie to watch around Halloween - hands down! A must-see! YAY!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I could not put this book down..it made me laugh and cry...also taught me a few things..read it.  you won't be sorry
B005C8ENI0|4.0|An interesting story with unexpected twists and turns.  Main star is so good in this movie.  We continue to see it over and over for this reason.  A believable drama.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|One of the best movies out there.  Tells a great story in a very funny way.  Truly a gem of a movie.
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|Best all star production I've seen in a long time.  Wonderful Shakespeare I actually enjoy listening to.  The story comes alive in every moment of this film.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is an excellent story of what happened to the unsuspecting youth of Europe.  You will cry some of the time.
B0037XPP7U|5.0|This is one of those star filled productions.  Costumes, pomp, ceremony, setting and scenery all breathtaking.  We thought the acting in this superb.  One worth seeing over and over.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I missed some episodes of NCIS through the season so this purchase gave me the opportunity to catch up on all that had taken place.  The price was very reasonable and much less expensive than purchasing the season disk.
B007R11DKQ|2.0|Too predictable and even with all the visual effects it seemed annoying to me.  It didn't seem set up for kids either.  Just a movie
B00C7607BC|5.0|A great deal on an absolute classic, this is a must buy. We absolutely love the little mermaid and were so happy to have it finally out on bluray.
0545615402|5.0|I got this as a gift for a true harry potter fanatic im pleased and cant wait to see her reaction!
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this movie from the commercials, but after hearing my daughter ask to watch it so many times i just bought it for her. Now i am so glad that i did. This is a really cute story and i can enjoy the movie right along side my daughter. The picture is just beautiful and the story is very positive.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I ve loved most Bond films since Goldfinger. Great opening stunt and plenty of action. And for the parents i dont recall even one swear word
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Best X-Men movie so far . I would recommend it for your collection .if your a marvel fan , this movie is a must have .
B004XANKVO|4.0|I bought this to serve as an everyday college/weekend bookbag. It fits the bill perfectly and it looks great. I can easily fit a laptop, a tablet, a couple folders, a 1 inch binder, textbook, and a small lunchbox into it. I have had this for about a month and probably carry anywhere from 5lbs-15lbs in it depending on the day.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks rugged but yet modern and refined<br />- Has a ton of space to throw stuff in<br />- The &#34;pouch&#34; is actually great for a jacket, newspaper, or umbrella<br />- Solid material and quality.<br />- Decent amount of pockets.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The straps are stiff, but I believe they did this so that the weight is evenly distributed throughout the strap. This honestly doesn't bother me much<br />- Some of the zippers are a bit difficult to zip up where two hands are needed<br />- The bottom compartment on the underside is awkwardly placed, I have not found it useful to put anything there.<br />- I wish the large compartment had a couple of sleeves or a pouch for some folders or whatever, this is my biggest issue with the bag. If the big compartment had some sort of compartmentalization, I would have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this bag for guys. I think it would be too big for the frame of the average girl.<br /><br />It looks great, is made of solid quality, and packs everything that you could think of. Oh and for everyone who thinks this was made in Switzerland, it is actually made in China! Regardless, still a great bag.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book! Stayed on point, had some interesting characters and good story line. There was enough meat in the book so that even if you hadn't read The Shining you could still follow the storyline.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone whether they're a Stephen King fan or not.
0316056898|5.0|This book is so funny! I love Tina Fey! I researched books to take on our honeymoon, and this book was on all the lists of must reads that I found! I just started it and am hooked!
B003V5ED7W|4.0|Really enjoyed his movie with my whole family.  Some movie don't age well.  Cool Runnings is one that is still entertaining and funny.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It's an older version of Facebook and keeps asking me to update, but the directions it gives don't work and it doesn't update.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love love love this show!! highly addictive, bought these so i could catch up to the new season starting in January.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great story..writing style was different at first, but after you got into the book, it was an easy read that was spellbinding and tragic.
0307887898|4.0|Give it a few chapters to warm up. Once Mr. Ries gets beyond his own story and into the description of the Lean Startup model, the information becomes gold.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! It has so many websites and creative ideas! You can find all kinds of projects and crafts, ways of organizing, recipes of homemade cleaners and soaps, and so much more!!!
0385350864|1.0|i tried to read this book, but i just couldn't. i read both the first and second books, and i don't remember them being this chaotic (were they?). and perhaps it's not fair of me to review a book i couldn't finish...but isn't that telling in itself? i LOVE to read (almost) more than anything in the world, and if i can't get past the first couple of chapters without cringing or asking myself WTH was i reading, then i have to admit defeat and close the book for good. some things just aren't meant to be. if you still want to attempt to read this book, i suggest borrowing it from the library - which is what i did, fortunately.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I do enjoyed the good wife , season 4  great  loved all the seasons relates to real life & problems
B00FOQRNN2|4.0|At last, some insight into Amazon. Work cultures at e.g. Apple, Google were/are much more openly discussed. Amazon was always very secretive, maybe they got that virus from their Seattle neighbor Microsoft.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very simple installation and use. Loved the ability to stream YouTube to my big TV.<br />One star less for lack of app support.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Usually John Grisham's books have some suprise to them.  This one did not. It was a little boring. If you already know how the book is going to end, I like to be entertained by the characters.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|One of the best TV series ever... Keeps getting more intense as it goes! AMC is awesome at making great shows!
B00DGI1Y08|5.0|Already Reviewed June 2013. Just the best, but I'm sorry to see that it hasn't been picked up as mainstream...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I did not want to finish this book.  It cut to the core. It is a beautiful,absorbing story.  I will recommend it to everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game and I'm hooked. sadly all my progress will be list when I have to trade my phone tor my newly fixed phone. I am at level 360 and it sucks there is no way to swap it to my new one. I have tried contacting king with no response back.  not sure I will redownload
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This is a serious topic discussed with humor, compassion and cool intelligence. Mr. Dawkins is a fine writer and displays a discerning mind. He makes a cogent argument for atheism based on logical thought and a kind heart.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such a good book. I cried, but I couldn't put it down. I usually go to sleep around 10, but I stayed up until 1 reading it and couldn't stop thinking about it at work the next day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wish the free version was a little bigger, but this game kept me working for a few days straight. Difficult, frustratingly hint and instruction free, but still a lot of fun.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|First I'm going to give you words and phrases that describe this page turner for me.... Conspiracy, discovery, trust, betrayal, mystic powers, terror, innocence, sibling love, friendship, family.<br />Outview is the story of a young teenager Nate who has this power (or curse; however you choose to see it). His father had it, his brother Dustin has it and his Aunt Rose does as well. Their gift is misunderstood - most likely by ignorance on the part of the 'normal folks'<br />After Nate's father dies (or is killed  - you'll have to figure that out), Nate goes on a search to find the depth of these Outviews he experiences. I had never heard of an out view and I'll have to admit I was intrigued.<br />With the help of his good friends Kyle and Linh, Nate begins his search to find answers. He is steadfast in his search for answers.  The depth of the innocent adolescent friendship between these three is another thing that amazed me. We see how unconditional love and trust abounds with them. We also experience Nate meeting up with his spiritual advisors along the way, the mystics who don't give him answers per se but encourage and teach him how to deal with his power; to look into himself for answers. I learned just how powerful the mind is....mind over matter I guess you could say.<br />Brandt Legg is the ultimate story teller. He takes us on the journey with Nate and I completely felt like a spectator. I WAS in the woods with Nate. I felt everything from the wind blowing in my face, to running through the woods with Nate, the sound of the water, the branches of the trees moving, the mountain lions and the vivid descriptions of each scene.  I felt the sting of knife wounds, the piercing of a gunshot to the flesh and I was scared to death.<br />I also felt the anguish and heartache Nate's mom went through. As a parent I felt for her. I cried. She did what she thought was right at the time and I realized through her that as parents we don't always do what is right. Sometimes we make decisions based on what other people tell us is the right thing to do.  We come to regret that later and her regrets tore at my heart.<br />The love between Nate and Dustin was incredible. These 2 boys had 'the gift' but one was institutionalized and labeled crazy. The other was tethering on believing he was crazy as well.<br />I cannot wait to read the second and third books in this series. I'm a romance reader but I can honestly say I am so happy I read Outview. I have recommended it to all my friends and I will be purchasing the trilogy as Christmas gifts for my friends.<br />Great Job Brandt Legg - you've given us three gifts:)we make decisions based on what other people tell us is the right thing to do.

B00114RKT8|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen!  The soundtrack is beautiful.  You cannot watch this movie and be the same afterwards!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great if you need just a basic calculator - really great - dowload was easy! Free is always good!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|been a big fan forever --- catching up on shows and refreshing my memories of the first season.  will watch season 2 next
B005PK57IK|4.0|I really enjoy the characters and the variety of cases presented.  Gives me a better understanding of how the law really operates.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice graphics..easy to learn..easy to play. Recommend for time to burn. ... different animals to hunt..And once again.. GRAPHICS ROCK!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Their Best album yet.  Stryper style mixed with todays modern raw guitars and heavy bass.  I love this album because it finally showcases Tim great bass abilities.  By far one of the better albums this year in the rock/modern rock category!<br /><br />Great Album!
B004GYY714|4.0|It finally started working when I upgraded to 8.1  I've been using it on Android, but spent way to much time trying to get it to work on 8.0.  It has a good interface and selection of stations.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Great Bond movie. Back to tradition adventure that makes Bond great but updated for today.  Like how it ties back to the old films in a new way
B008EQIJQO|4.0|Very cute show.  I think it was a charming movie and very interesting to see how they did a modern silent movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I kept waiting for the story to capture me, but it never did. Just not as good as the first and second book of the trilogy. Would not re-read it.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Fun, sweet, predictable.  What can I say.  I like animated films and this is a good one.  Has a few items for the adults that watch.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I had this album on vinyl when growing up, and literally grew up singing along to it! SO glad I now have it on CD!!! The Beatles were truly the BEST! It's kind of a 'greatest hits' thing, but not quite. If you like the Beatles, you'll find yourself singing along!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|It was quite entertaining.  I'd watch it again.  The actors did a good job and the script was good.  Interesting setting
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|One of my favorite movies!!! I don't generally get into the &#34;comic book&#34; movies, but this one is SO clever and so much FUN!! John Malkovich literally steals the show! &#34;Can I kill her now?&#34; and &#34;Old man my a^*!&#34; You WILL laugh, and at times you WILL be on the edge of your seat.
B001AQQR2S|1.0|The running of the video was choppy; the picture was awful, and I couldn't get the volume to a decent level where I could hear it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first 2 books but was disappointed with this one. It seemed rushed to a point and not as developed. I also didn't like the ending but that's just my opinion.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I love love LOVE this album. I hadn't heard any Fall Out Boy before the &#34;light 'em up&#34; song, and I sincerely thought it was Adam Lambert when I heard it! I ordered this album and was really please with all of the songs on it. They are up tempo, banging, loud, catchy, and keep me moving. Some even have lyrics that are kind of...deep! Ha!
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|Another game that only lets you get up to a certain point before you need you either dedicate an insane number of hours on boring hunts to get money slowwwly or spend real cash. It's a shame because I'd pay $3-5 for this game. Oh well, uninstall it is.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|These books are fun, page turners.  Good old Jack never fails to amuse as he travels the Country helping damsels in distress.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Excellent storyline and engrossing characters keep you comin back for more. The bygone era and the fabulous lifestyle are like a fairy tale setting for an already great drama.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|Truly abysmal album. The problem with Gaga is that she's more interested in cheap gimmicks and being viewed as some kind of innovative artist than in honestly representing her talent. The woman has a terrific voice. She can sing the hell out of a song. But all the theatrics around her releases, the pomp and drive to 'top herself' in presentation is exhausting, repetitive and, at this point, embarrassing ... like Liza Minnelli playing dress-up in Madonna's old wardrobe closet.<br /><br />I think the kiss of death for an artist is taking him or herself too seriously, and any piece of work that titles itself as ART is almost guaranteed not to be. The cover artwork is more accurate, Gaga seeming to give birth to a shimmering fart.<br /><br />She asks at the beginning of this album if we want to see the woman behind the aura. The answer is yes. Strip away the nonsense and show us something real, Gaga.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Its true. One of the better bond movies I've seen in a long time. Although not the bond I'm used to which turned out to be more refreshing than anything.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham at his best. I pride myself of at least kinda fiiguring out how it's all going to go down. Grisham totally surprised me with this one, I would say it;s one of his best.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Twist after twist keeps me guessing.  I've heard that the end isn't so good.  Well I guess I'll find out for myself.<br />Amazon's video quality is normally outstanding.  My Internet provider's service isn't consistent but when my link is working well the quality is superb.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very well developed, one of the best hidden objects games I have played.  I look forward to playing each day.in
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Charger Great product, great place to keep ear jack and charges at the same time! no worries with this product! I would recommend this product to anyone.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|A good friend gave this to me, and I didn't get to it right away. Once I started it though I couldn't stop! LOL.<br /><br />I'm a huge Sci fi fan and have been for years. The title itself made me laugh and I expected that I would enjoy the book. I was not disappointed. I laughed out loud several times but not in a mean way, more in a &#34;oh how funny and charming&#34; way.<br /><br />I love all the old TV shows and so it was so much fun to relive them but from a very interesting perspective. What I didn't expect was how the book twisted and actually became more than just a fun romp through an interesting premise.<br /><br />I love where the book ended up. I also really appreciated the CODA's. Especially the last one. I never expected tears from this book; but there you have it.<br /><br />Thank you for writing such a enjoyable and surprisingly sweet book.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Bro·mance (bro-mans)- Describes the complicated love and affection shared by two straight males.<br /><br />There are around four bro couples in this movie, each having to deal with different life challenges.<br />In a world where a dimensional rip in the ocean acts as a one way gate that lets giant monsters into our world, our heroes have to control giant robots that were built specifically for fighting said monsters. Here's the catch: not just anyone can control these robots, you need two people for each robot, and as if that isnt enough, they have to connect with each other on a level only equal to love. When our hero loses his bro in a tragic battle early on in the movie, he's forced to find another bro, but theres a twist.. the bro he ends up finding is... (what!?) a WOMAN!<br /><br />I give this title an A++ for being jam-packed with gay undertones. The subtle moral of the story seems to be \\"even though you may be attracted to men, give women a try, you might like them.\\"
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has written another work of art!...The personal journey she allowed us passage . through.. Eat, Pray, Love...opened a portal for readers to meet  Alma Whittaker. Alma..  the strong female character we crave for our daughters and granddaughters ! A treasure trove of natural history ..cultural insights...and deep hidden gems that we sow into our collective memory ! If you have ever looked at the sky...the ocean...the mud between your toes...with awe...you are not alone..Alma is with you and you are with her...I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have so enjoyed this book.  Of course I'm a huge fan of John Grisham.  I hate it took him so many years to write the 2nd book.  Thank goodness I had recalled the first one.  Great, great book, would highly recommend it!
B005LAIIMG|1.0|Finally watched this after hearing so many people praise it was disappointed at the relatively pedestrian plot.  As an alternative, I suggest watching \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" which an older movie that has many of the same plot elements and is much better done.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book & story.  It's a great somewhat typical love story and c'mon what girl doesn't love a bad boy trying to be good!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I didn't buy this device because I had a real need for it.  My PC is already hooked up to my TV.<br /><br />I just bought it because I like gadgets, and it was $35.  It's really simple to install, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to turn their regular TV into a smart TV.  I've used it to watch a few movies on Netflix without any issues.  Pandora and youtube steaming works as well.<br /><br />To stream music on Google Play though, you must own the content in the Play Store.  This means any MP3s you have from other sources won't stream to the Chromecast.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Absolutely loved the end/last book to this trilogy.  It was unpredictable and kept me on the edge of my seat (esp the end).  Great story can't wait to see the movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Keeps you guessing right up to the end.  A bit long winded and disjointed in spots but an enjoyable read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever downloaded!  It is great for when you have time to kill at the doctor's office, etc.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham does it again in this wonderfully descriptive novels a real page turner I was up all hours of the night reading this thriller
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Movie was delivered WITH NO SOUND!!!  I WANT A REFUND!!!!  I wish I could have enjoyed this movie I paid for.  Do the right thing Amazon....
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Love this book. Characters are great. As usual, couldn't put it down. A lot of court room drama.  Learned much about the wheels of justice.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I'd call it Mose suspenseful than scary. All the actors did fantastic jobs and the story is compelling, the special effects are awesome. All around great film.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I really liked this book.  I haven't read Grisham's books for several years and I'd forgotten how much I love his writing.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I found myself trying to remember who some of the characters were.  (It's been a long time since I read A Time To Kill)
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I used to watch this with my family as a  kid. It brought back old memories of my family together.
1616550414|5.0|It came quicker than I thought and in perfect condition. The guide help me catch up to Hyrule's history and the art work is amazing. This book is a keeper and great to have on your shelf.
B008PUXMP2|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can not stop listening to the 3 cd's in this collection. Till this point I never listened to Amy Winehouse.  I was curious, and my daughter recommended her highly.  I was  blown away by her voice, and her unique style. I wish I had discovered her sooner and able to see her in person.  I intend to buy more of her cd's and make Amy a part of my listening pleasures.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Y cry like never before, seriously I couldn't stop, if you like to suffer like I did with this book you will love it
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I think this might be my favorite Stryper CD to date. Michael sounds spectacular, the CD is HEAVY, everything just gels! Glad to see sales on this disc in the US almost doubled the last 3 album debuts. These guys are great and thanks Frontiers for signing them!
B005Y9B5UG|4.0|Shakira is mesmerizing in this concert. If you like her, you will love her after seeing this preformance.  A must have
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Pretty fun match 3 game. Probably the best.  Unfortunately the levels starting at 100 require more luck than skill. You'll find yourself playing a level over and over a dozen times based entirely on the luck of the candy drops.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I wish they would have released all of these American Recording before he passed.  A lot of the songs were very prophetic.  Hurt and Personal Jesus where my 2 favorites off this CD.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Excellent father and son bonding movie, my son and I loved it. The graphics and sound are amazing, along with the landscaping.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I had to think real hard about the star rating because my 1st inclination was a 3. Before I posted the 3 I gave some thought of why I would choose that rating. At times while reading my emotions ran from &#34;this makes me uncomfortable hurry & get through this part&#34; to &#34; oh no, don't stop now I want to see where this goes&#34;. I think that is what the author wants, to make the reader feel a range of emotions while reading their work.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Good mouse, doesn't seem cheap, the companion software isn't bloated. The only drawback is the 3 side buttons are bound to Ctrl, Alt, and Shift. A rather awkward design and has taken me some time to not habitually try to use them as back and forward buttons in the browser or use them as an independent key or button for games. However, if you find this button layout desirable than you will love this mouse.
B00G8P2B4E|4.0|I thought Monsters University was an entertaining movie. The kids (ages 11, 8, and 5) liked it.  However... My husband commented several times that he thought the first Monsters was much better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great seeing how the &#34;other side&#34; used to live.  My ancestors would probably been the ones dusting and carrying things. I like the characters,  plots and sub plots.  Looking forward to the next season
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I thought it was too easy but kept playing until the game really got challenging.  It is lots of fun to have to think outside the &quot;box&quot; to win.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|It's simple, I like this show and missed so much of the last season.  Just happened to be Jr Hi Football night.
B00AZRBLHO|3.0|It's helpful to anyone in IT looking to make a strategic shift in their organization. We read it at work and it's been helpful to all.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Didn't realize it was short story.  Good read as are all of Lee Child's books. Will order more in the future.
B0001FYPZU|1.0|This DVD would not play on  an American DVD player - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! Buy from an American source.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|It kept my interest and had a good story to follow. Now I'm just hoping for a sequel within a year or two.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Grisham's first novel - a must read about racial discrimination in the south, murder and the trial that follows - the people in the novel &#34;fit thier roles&#34;
B00FPH6M82|3.0|I did like the move but it was slow and didn't really hold my interest to the point where I didn't walk away and want to rewind what I missed. The story line was just average and not enough action.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never felt more betrayed by a book series before. I wish I'd never found these books. Skip it.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Wonderful movie when it was made and my grandchildren love it now !!! IT will always remain at the top of my list!!
B00G32OMF8|4.0|I like the honest progression of the characters as they age. If for no other reason, I find it refreshing that neither actor has undergone plastic surgery or obvious cosmetic procedures to preserve that eternal &#34;I am twenty,&#34; look that seems necessary in Hollywood.<br /><br />The writing is good. The dialogue is honest.
B003BKZW7C|5.0|Both chilling and insightful.  When it comes to understanding human nature, the nature of the beast within, and expressing it in language that is both elegant and approachable, this author has it nailed.
031623480X|5.0|Good book....  Couldn't put it down once I started reading it...  It is an eye opener and explains much more than why grains are bad.  Read it for yourself.  You will be surprised.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|AMAZING book!!!!! Great to read if you don't want to put a book done. I've read this book many times and it still is great.
B002KC8BSO|1.0|just too campy, boring.  I thought it was going to be a real movie not a parody of a sideshow
B002N14GPE|5.0|This movie actually surprised me. It was a good horror film from 2009. It managed to make me jump a few times. Twisted ending didn't see coming
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is my favorite show and Johnny Galecki rocks in the show as Leonard.  Must get all the seasons.
B005WGIJJ6|5.0|i would so reqier it!come with bruce wayn batman robin bane and poisen ivy!!!!!!even suit changer!!!!!and bat computer!!!!!LOVEING IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--
B005HEPOKU|4.0|I really like this series. It is enjoyable and very entertaining. I like the entire Star Trek series. I watch them when I can.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Excellent delivery and quality. We (my 4 year old son and I)  love this movie so much and are happy with all aspects of the purchase !!!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Very cleaver.  Good acting from UK.  Good stories. Fun to watch. I love the show and recommend it to all sci fi lovers.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I found this very interesting with an ending I did not see coming.  I recomend  this movie and may watch again.
B000TGCR3I|1.0|Yes, this movie looks gorgeous: fantastic environments, weird looking character faces, incredible details. Total eye-candy, but the story is retarded. Two idiots can somehow jump up buildings, telephone poles, cars etc. (like The Incredible Hulk) (never explained - okay it's anime, fair enough- but still- huh?). These dumb street kids do one stupid thing after another and magically don't get killed - even when one kid gets stabbed through the belly with a giant sword and bleeds a huge puddle of blood. The plot seems to be making them do progressively more moronic things. And in a manipulative way, we're supposed to think they're cute and pure. Awwww, look at the little punk kid pick his nose and have a string of snot coming out his nose. Tee hee, isn't this great anime? Eff you movie! Hey, don't listen to me, I thought Akira was boooooorrring!
B00CWM3F4C|2.0|Had to drop the price to sell this horrible excuse for an album, I am a huge AiC fan and hate to call this garbage!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books in this series and got involved with the characters. The this third book really blows your mind. I read this one faster than the other two wanted to see how it ended and what a shock it was! I was really disappointed :( I reread all of them several times not wanting to let them go but the end result was always the same. I guess that's the way life is sometimes,we all move on.....
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|People who enjoyed &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; and &#34;A Painted House&#34;  may particularly appreciate this.  Representation of southern culture and character development within that framework particularly engaging and similar to those earlier books.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|An album full of surprises! Must have album for her die hard fans! Loved Me Back To Life, Somebody Loves Somebody, Breakaway, Always Be Your Girl, Incredible, Overjoyed & Thank You are superb and awesome. Not to forget Unfinished Songs and Didn't Know Love which show her powerful voice yet with new arrangement. For those who wants to relax and end their day, there is At Seventeen waiting for you. Purchase it now before too late and make sure you get the deluxe edition with 2 extra songs. Celine Dion career will always go on!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love to read about NDEs.  It was a book like this that finally turned me to God.  Highly recommended.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Clever and visually appealing.  Some plot and action holes but still a very entertaining escape.  I'm ready for the next one
B007WPM4P0|4.0|Nice movie. Kept my interest. Live watching these movies. Enjoy them more than newer ones. I would definetly suggest watching
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice game so far. Amazing quality in hd. Only downside is the inapp purchases. Nowdays seems that you can only get the cool stuff in apps by buying them with real money
B00499NHLC|5.0|Tried watching an episode of Sherlock a couple of years ago and couldn't get into it.  However, I recently tried watching from the beginning of the series and loved it.  I did revisit some of the original Sherlock Holmes stories and read the Laurie King Mary Russel novels in the interval which piqued my interest in Sherlock.  There are many references to the original stories in this version of the modern setting.  The modern setting works well.  Sherlock is a bit annoying -  but that's how he is supposed to be!
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|Good Halloween Movie. Not one of the absolute best but definitely one I crave once in awhile. Is it weird that I think Christopher Walken is supremely sexy in this movie? X)
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Pretty disappointing stuff, after six years. High expectations. Besides \\"New\\"- good song...<br /> but not great- the other songs aren't there.  Forgettable.
B001F6ZIXW|2.0|I guess I don't know what I expected but I was not impressed and not sure that I will continue watching the show.  I think the performances by the actors were emmy-worthy but I don't like the motorcycle/mafia premise.
B001P3SA94|5.0|Loved this movie because it tells the story of many of the black blues singers back in the day. The good times and the bad times. I was also able to relate to singer like Muddy Waters and many more.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I wish I were better at this, but I still love it. You actually need to think logically in order to complete each screen and get as many points and bonuses as possible. I love the little monster's noises too... so cute.
006202406X|4.0|If you like the previous books in the series, I believe that this one will not disappoint. While Veronica Roth's writing isn't the strongest (especially dialogue), an exciting and interesting plot more than made up for it for me.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|A very interesting show.  Not sure how accurate it is in terms of &#34;how it really was back in the day&#34; (as I'm no expert on the subject matter in this show), but it is very enjoyable to watch and see the character interaction/evolution.  If you have any interest in history or 'recent' British history, this is a great show.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|As a 14 year old freshmen waking up at about 5 a.m. isn't fun. This alarm clock gives mii options and variety on how I want to be woken up ! I love it, best alarm clock on the market !
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a shining jewel in the crown of TV.  The acting is superb, the writing is nothing short of clever and smart.  The cinematography is wonderfully creative and does a great job of portraying 21st century technology as a character unto itself.
B006TF6WAM|2.0|It is a 'beige' and bland book , with boring characters. The story had elements that could have been interesting but were lost behind the boring facade of middle class England and non descript people.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|this is a great game and its free, couldn't ask for a better game and anyone can play it..love it
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Denzel Washington was excellent, as usual. So were Don Cheadle and John Goodman. Gives a great view into the life of an addict.
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|It's definitely worth 99 cents really fun you can do all sorts of things and the tutorial is very clear on teaching you what to do amazing overall.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I read the whole, long book.  I don't know what the excitement was about... i didn't find the characters very believable; the plot was thin, the concept was interesting .....but i found the book flawed.  If this is the best book of 2013... something's wrong!!
159463176X|5.0|Enjoy it a lot. You get to know and love the whole family and also learn about another culture so different to ours. I recommend it very much.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|LA Confidential is one of my top ten movies.  I think it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1997.  It received nine nominations.  The actors were perfect for their parts.  The film captured the time period.  Wonderful!
0385537131|3.0|Though I haven't finished yet, so far so good.This is the kind of novels he should keep writing. Are you listening, Mr Grisham? As soon as I finish I will rate it again.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Gripping drama that provides a real message of courage, loyalty, and moral stamina. We watched as Prime subscribers. A real value.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I enjoyed this series over The Hunger Games.  All three books in this series kept the story going and wanting you to keep on reading.
B00AN0KGWE|3.0|First, I am watching the entire series so it has held my interest.  I read all of the books and both the first and second season seem to follow the books fairly closely.  The characters are well acted and the costumes and sets are lovely.  Because I read the books I have no trouble following the story but I wonder if someone just watching the videos would be able to follow the myriad of characters, plots and subplots involved.  My lower rating reflects what I perceive as unnecessary  carnage, nudity, and graphic sexual content which is visualized excessively throughout the episodes.  The story stands well on its own and the viewer can get the idea of the violent aspects of the plot without actually seeing the heads chopped off or the graphic sexual scenes - added I believe for shock value.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the book! Lots to think about! Clear, honest writing! No sympathy allowed here! Open yourself to new horizons and situations!
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is easier than going online on my computer to check email. Traveling email that is the way to go.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I always enjoy the twists and turns of his legal books.  I know I can count on Grisham for an imaginative plot.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|She is the best singer and I have attended her concert earlier this year. This album is the best to listen to.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Besides having nothing to do with the book (which is excellent)  besides the title, it was a boring movie with an idiotic plot that tries too hard to be epic. This mainly consists of Bad Pitt moping around the screen for 2 hours and only surviving because he's some super ex UN white man. I really rather have watched something else.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Hokey is the best description that comes to mind. Brad Pitt fighting zombies? C'mon. He must have really needed the paycheck to sink this low.
B007SVPZMW|5.0|It works so well it cannot be beaten, but if you slip up it will win. Great game for children and adults withy easy and hard levels
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have a love hate relationship with this game :) Some levels are easy others it takes weeks to get through... You must have patience or a fat wallet to play this game... It is possible to defeat levels with out having to use &#34;real&#34; money and that is where the patience comes into play.... It is a great time to pass time with!!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Not huge and heavy, just right.  I wear this every day and have only put my Movado on twice since I got it.  Very accurate for a mechanical, and ~$800 less than comparable mechaicals.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Recommending those who want to read the series to just read books 1 and 2 and then imagine their own ending :) really felt like the style of writing and character personalities strayed very far from divergent and insurgent. Loved the first two, was super pumped about this one and it just didn't do it for me. Felt rushed and confused the entire book. Hated the jumping back and forth between four and tris.
B0000028PL|5.0|STAIN is the LIVING COLOUR album created in the GRUNGE ERA, and you can hear that....Most of the songs are really heavy....Well, VIVID and TIME´s UP are AMAZING, and STAIN is too......WELL DONE, LIVING COLOUR!!!!! 3 MASTERPIECES!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|It did make me think and while I agree that we are giving up our privacy with reckless abandon the characters and story were one dimensional.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The most insightful book I read in years. The author explains in crisp clear language what the hell happened to the world and how to adjust to it and thrive. Its practical and to the point , I recommend it to anyone seeking to improve him/herself.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|i just love these! came brand new nothing wrong with it no scratches no nothing. plus its the first harry potter movie! come on nowwww
B00CHILW64|3.0|Although it tells a nearly miraculous true story of a family's survival through the Asian tsunami against all odds, this movie was extremely difficult to watch.  The pain, suffering and horror it portrays is nearly unrelieved throughout the movie, except for several instances of amazing human kindness and courage in the face of abject horror, loss, and misery. Don't watch it unless you have a strong tolerance for emotional suffering and gore.  It is not a light evening's entertainment.<br /><br />In spite of all that, it seemed slow to me, but perhaps that was because a lot of the story involved intolerable endless waiting. Overall, it lacked depth and nuance.  They told the story, but it needed some additional layers of plot or something.  Great special effects showing the horrible conditions, but then some things you'd expect were omitted.  For example, there was a shortage of food and water, but they were never shown acting hungry or thirsty, or eating or drinking anything.<br /><br />There were many good points, too, such as the portrayals of courage and kindness mentioned above, as well as unshakable the bonds of familial love.  I could not watch this movie again, though.
B000W799NU|5.0|came to me with nothing wrong with it. great movie long but good. i love harry potter movies!! if you don't like lengthy movies then dont buy
B00G8YG8S0|5.0|I can't ever get enough f David Tennant's version of The Doctor!  To hear what his c-stars thought of his performance - along with Tennant's own views - was nothing short of sheer delight. Can't hardly wait to see him again as the dearest Doctor in the 50th Anniversary episode. (I really MISS him!)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! Very addicting! I love it and so do my kids! Should give a little more explanation on what to do with the Jellies I have to go online and look up what that meant.
B0055N0FZM|3.0|Anne starts off writing her diary at 13. She writes fantastic for a 13 year old and some of the words she uses you wonder how she knows these words at such a young age, which makes me wonder if it hasn't been re-written/ edited. Overall an interesting story.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|The movie is base primarily on the game under the same title. Halo 4:FUD has relatively similar elements of UNSC in the game as they are in real life. Much of the movie deals with human preparing for battling the enemy.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|To be honest I wasn't all that thrilled with this album the first time I heard it. But that's the thing...I just heard it. I didn't LISTEN to it. The second time I actually listened and got into it and realized this is an amazing album. It has throwbacks to old slim shady songs and even continues on from where some songs left off. I won't spoil anything by saying anything else but if you are an Eminem fan, get this album and give it a chance. It's one of his best and you will not regret it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The story and plot of Skyfall is similar to those of its two predecessors. Craig maintains his aggressive persona towards a criminal in every direction and move. Skyfall isn't particularly a full-on combat movie compare with previous Bond films. But it certainly has one of the best storyline in any Bond films.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Awesome movie! Our family watches it every year around Christmas! My son also loves it!! The blu ray version is better!!
B002436WJE|5.0|An excellent movie base on possibly real life father who pursue after his kidnapped daughter by human traffickers. His courageous and intellectual moves and experience are his only techniques to save his daughter before she disappears.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|just a bad sequel to the first movie...plot not to good and the actors where not used well in this movie
